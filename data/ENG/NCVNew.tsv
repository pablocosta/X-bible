NCV	Matthew	1	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Matthew	2	2	They asked , “ Where is the baby who was born to be the king of the Jews ? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him. ”
NCV	Matthew	2	3	When King Herod heard this , he was troubled , as were all the people in Jerusalem .
NCV	Matthew	2	4	Herod called a meeting of all the leading priests and teachers of the law and asked them where the Christ would be born .
NCV	Matthew	2	5	They answered , “ In the town of Bethlehem in Judea . The prophet wrote about this in the Scriptures :
NCV	Matthew	2	6	‘ But you , Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , are not just an insignificant village in Judah . A ruler will come from you who will be like a shepherd for my people Israel. ’ ” Micah 5:2
NCV	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod had a secret meeting with the wise men and learned from them the exact time they first saw the star .
NCV	Matthew	2	8	He sent the wise men to Bethlehem , saying , “ Look carefully for the child . When you find him , come tell me so I can worship him too. ”
NCV	Matthew	2	9	After the wise men heard the king , they left . The star that they had seen in the east went before them until it stopped above the place where the child was .
NCV	Matthew	2	10	When the wise men saw the star , they were filled with joy .
NCV	Matthew	2	11	They came to the house where the child was and saw him with his mother , Mary , and they bowed down and worshiped him . They opened their gifts and gave him treasures of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
NCV	Matthew	2	12	But God warned the wise men in a dream not to go back to Herod , so they returned to their own country by a different way . Jesus ’ Parents Take Him to Egypt
NCV	Matthew	2	13	After they left , an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream and said , “ Get up ! Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt , because Herod is starting to look for the child so he can kill him . Stay in Egypt until I tell you to return. ”
NCV	Matthew	2	14	So Joseph got up and left for Egypt during the night with the child and his mother .
NCV	Matthew	2	15	And Joseph stayed in Egypt until Herod died . This happened to bring about what the Lord had said through the prophet : “ I called my son out of Egypt. ” [ a ] Herod Kills the Baby Boys
NCV	Matthew	2	16	When Herod saw that the wise men had tricked him , he was furious . So he gave an order to kill all the baby boys in Bethlehem and in the surrounding area who were two years old or younger . This was in keeping with the time he learned from the wise men .
NCV	Matthew	2	17	So what God had said through the prophet Jeremiah came true :
NCV	Matthew	2	18	“ A voice was heard in Ramah of painful crying and deep sadness : Rachel crying for her children . She refused to be comforted , because her children are dead. ” Jeremiah 31:15 Joseph and Mary Return
NCV	Matthew	2	19	After Herod died , an angel of the Lord spoke to Joseph in a dream while he was in Egypt .
NCV	Matthew	2	20	The angel said , “ Get up ! Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel , because the people who were trying to kill the child are now dead. ”
NCV	Matthew	2	21	So Joseph took the child and his mother and went to Israel .

NCV	Matthew	3	13	At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River and wanted John to baptize him .
NCV	Matthew	3	14	But John tried to stop him , saying , “ Why do you come to me to be baptized ? I need to be baptized by you ! ”
NCV	Matthew	3	15	Jesus answered , “ Let it be this way for now . We should do all things that are God ’ s will. ” So John agreed to baptize Jesus .
NCV	Matthew	3	16	As soon as Jesus was baptized , he came up out of the water . Then heaven opened , and he saw God ’ s Spirit coming down on him like a dove .

NCV	Matthew	4	9	The devil said , “ If you will bow down and worship me , I will give you all these things. ”
NCV	Matthew	4	10	Jesus said to the devil , “ Go away from me , Satan ! It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him. ’ ” [ c ]

NCV	Matthew	4	13	He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum , a town near Lake Galilee , in the area near Zebulun and Naphtali .

NCV	Matthew	4	21	As Jesus continued walking by Lake Galilee , he saw two other brothers , James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in a boat with their father Zebedee , mending their nets . Jesus told them to come with him .

NCV	Matthew	6	24	“ No one can serve two masters . The person will hate one master and love the other , or will follow one master and refuse to follow the other . You can not serve both God and worldly riches . Don ’ t Worry
NCV	Matthew	6	25	“ So I tell you , don ’ t worry about the food or drink you need to live , or about the clothes you need for your body . Life is more than food , and the body is more than clothes .

NCV	Matthew	12	32	Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven , but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven , now or in the future . People Know You by Your Words
NCV	Matthew	12	33	“ If you want good fruit , you must make the tree good . If your tree is not good , it will have bad fruit . A tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces .
NCV	Matthew	12	34	You snakes ! You are evil people , so how can you say anything good ? The mouth speaks the things that are in the heart .
NCV	Matthew	12	35	Good people have good things in their hearts , and so they say good things . But evil people have evil in their hearts , so they say evil things .
NCV	Matthew	12	36	And I tell you that on the Judgment Day people will be responsible for every careless thing they have said .
NCV	Matthew	12	37	The words you have said will be used to judge you . Some of your words will prove you right , but some of your words will prove you guilty. ” The People Ask for a Miracle
NCV	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law answered Jesus , saying , “ Teacher , we want to see you work a miracle as a sign. ”
NCV	Matthew	12	39	Jesus answered , “ Evil and sinful people are the ones who want to see a miracle for a sign . But no sign will be given to them , except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
NCV	Matthew	12	40	Jonah was in the stomach of the big fish for three days and three nights . In the same way , the Son of Man will be in the grave three days and three nights .
NCV	Matthew	12	41	On the Judgment Day the people from Nineveh [ c ] will stand up with you people who live now , and they will show that you are guilty . When Jonah preached to them , they were sorry and changed their lives . And I tell you that someone greater than Jonah is here .
NCV	Matthew	12	42	On the Judgment Day , the Queen of the South [ d ] will stand up with you people who live today . She will show that you are guilty , because she came from far away to listen to Solomon ’ s wise teaching . And I tell you that someone greater than Solomon is here . People Today Are Full of Evil
NCV	Matthew	12	43	“ When an evil spirit comes out of a person , it travels through dry places , looking for a place to rest , but it doesn ’ t find it .
NCV	Matthew	12	44	So the spirit says , ‘ I will go back to the house I left. ’ When the spirit comes back , it finds the house still empty , swept clean , and made neat .
NCV	Matthew	12	45	Then the evil spirit goes out and brings seven other spirits even more evil than it is , and they go in and live there . So the person has even more trouble than before . It is the same way with the evil people who live today. ” Jesus ’ True Family

NCV	Matthew	13	13	This is why I use stories to teach the people : They see , but they don ’ t really see . They hear , but they don ’ t really hear or understand .
NCV	Matthew	13	2	Large crowds gathered around him , so he got into a boat and sat down , while the people stood on the shore .
NCV	Matthew	13	3	Then Jesus used stories to teach them many things . He said : “ A farmer went out to plant his seed .
NCV	Matthew	13	4	While he was planting , some seed fell by the road , and the birds came and ate it all up .
NCV	Matthew	13	5	Some seed fell on rocky ground , where there wasn ’ t much dirt . That seed grew very fast , because the ground was not deep .
NCV	Matthew	13	6	But when the sun rose , the plants dried up , because they did not have deep roots .
NCV	Matthew	13	7	Some other seed fell among thorny weeds , which grew and choked the good plants .
NCV	Matthew	13	8	Some other seed fell on good ground where it grew and produced a crop . Some plants made a hundred times more , some made sixty times more , and some made thirty times more .
NCV	Matthew	13	9	Let those with ears use them and listen. ” Why Jesus Used Stories to Teach
NCV	Matthew	13	10	The followers came to Jesus and asked , “ Why do you use stories to teach the people ? ”
NCV	Matthew	13	11	Jesus answered , “ You have been chosen to know the secrets about the kingdom of heaven , but others can not know these secrets .
NCV	Matthew	13	12	Those who have understanding will be given more , and they will have all they need . But those who do not have understanding , even what they have will be taken away from them .
NCV	Matthew	13	14	So they show that the things Isaiah said about them are true : ‘ You will listen and listen , but you will not understand . You will look and look , but you will not learn .
NCV	Matthew	13	15	For the minds of these people have become stubborn . They do not hear with their ears , and they have closed their eyes . Otherwise they might really understand what they see with their eyes and hear with their ears . They might really understand in their minds and come back to me and be healed. ’ Isaiah 6:9–10
NCV	Matthew	13	16	But you are blessed , because you see with your eyes and hear with your ears .
NCV	Matthew	13	17	I tell you the truth , many prophets and good people wanted to see the things that you now see , but they did not see them . And they wanted to hear the things that you now hear , but they did not hear them . Jesus Explains the Seed Story
NCV	Matthew	13	18	“ So listen to the meaning of that story about the farmer .
NCV	Matthew	13	19	What is the seed that fell by the road ? That seed is like the person who hears the message about the kingdom but does not understand it . The Evil One comes and takes away what was planted in that person ’ s heart .
NCV	Matthew	13	20	And what is the seed that fell on rocky ground ? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching and quickly accepts it with joy .
NCV	Matthew	13	21	But he does not let the teaching go deep into his life , so he keeps it only a short time . When trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching he accepted , he quickly gives up .
NCV	Matthew	13	22	And what is the seed that fell among the thorny weeds ? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching but lets worries about this life and the temptation of wealth stop that teaching from growing . So the teaching does not produce fruit [ a ] in that person ’ s life .
NCV	Matthew	13	23	But what is the seed that fell on the good ground ? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching and understands it . That person grows and produces fruit , sometimes a hundred times more , sometimes sixty times more , and sometimes thirty times more. ” A Story About Wheat and Weeds
NCV	Matthew	13	24	Then Jesus told them another story : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who planted good seed in his field .
NCV	Matthew	13	25	That night , when everyone was asleep , his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and then left .
NCV	Matthew	13	26	Later , the wheat sprouted and the heads of grain grew , but the weeds also grew .
NCV	Matthew	13	27	Then the man ’ s servants came to him and said , ‘ You planted good seed in your field . Where did the weeds come from ? ’
NCV	Matthew	13	28	The man answered , ‘ An enemy planted weeds. ’ The servants asked , ‘ Do you want us to pull up the weeds ? ’
NCV	Matthew	13	29	The man answered , ‘ No , because when you pull up the weeds , you might also pull up the wheat .
NCV	Matthew	13	30	Let the weeds and the wheat grow together until the harvest time . At harvest time I will tell the workers , “ First gather the weeds and tie them together to be burned . Then gather the wheat and bring it to my barn. ” ’ ” Stories of Mustard Seed and Yeast
NCV	Matthew	13	31	Then Jesus told another story : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his field .
NCV	Matthew	13	32	That seed is the smallest of all seeds , but when it grows , it is one of the largest garden plants . It becomes big enough for the wild birds to come and build nests in its branches. ”
NCV	Matthew	13	33	Then Jesus told another story : “ The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in a large tub of flour until it made all the dough rise. ”
NCV	Matthew	13	34	Jesus used stories to tell all these things to the people ; he always used stories to teach them .
NCV	Matthew	13	35	This is as the prophet said : “ I will speak using stories ; I will tell things that have been secret since the world was made. ” Psalm 78:2 Jesus Explains About the Weeds
NCV	Matthew	13	36	Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house . His followers came to him and said , “ Explain to us the meaning of the story about the weeds in the field. ”
NCV	Matthew	13	37	Jesus answered , “ The man who planted the good seed in the field is the Son of Man .
NCV	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world , and the good seed are all of God ’ s children who belong to the kingdom . The weeds are those people who belong to the Evil One .
NCV	Matthew	13	39	And the enemy who planted the bad seed is the devil . The harvest time is the end of the age , and the workers who gather are God ’ s angels .
NCV	Matthew	13	40	“ Just as the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire , so it will be at the end of the age .
NCV	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send out his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all who cause sin and all who do evil .
NCV	Matthew	13	42	The angels will throw them into the blazing furnace , where the people will cry and grind their teeth with pain .
NCV	Matthew	13	43	Then the good people will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Let those with ears use them and listen . Stories of a Treasure and a Pearl
NCV	Matthew	13	44	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field . One day a man found the treasure , and then he hid it in the field again . He was so happy that he went and sold everything he owned to buy that field .
NCV	Matthew	13	45	“ Also , the kingdom of heaven is like a man looking for fine pearls .
NCV	Matthew	13	46	When he found a very valuable pearl , he went and sold everything he had and bought it . A Story of a Fishing Net
NCV	Matthew	13	47	“ Also , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was put into the lake and caught many different kinds of fish .
NCV	Matthew	13	48	When it was full , the fishermen pulled the net to the shore . They sat down and put all the good fish in baskets and threw away the bad fish .
NCV	Matthew	13	49	It will be this way at the end of the age . The angels will come and separate the evil people from the good people .
NCV	Matthew	13	50	The angels will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain. ”
NCV	Matthew	13	51	Jesus asked his followers , “ Do you understand all these things ? ” They answered , “ Yes , we understand. ”
NCV	Matthew	13	52	Then Jesus said to them , “ So every teacher of the law who has been taught about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house . He brings out both new things and old things he has saved. ” Jesus Goes to His Hometown
NCV	Matthew	13	53	When Jesus finished teaching with these stories , he left there .
NCV	Matthew	13	54	He went to his hometown and taught the people in the synagogue , and they were amazed . They said , “ Where did this man get this wisdom and this power to do miracles ?
NCV	Matthew	13	55	He is just the son of a carpenter . His mother is Mary , and his brothers are James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas .
NCV	Matthew	13	56	And all his sisters are here with us . Where then does this man get all these things ? ”
NCV	Matthew	13	57	So the people were upset with Jesus . But Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown and in his own home. ”
NCV	Matthew	13	58	So he did not do many miracles there because they had no faith . Footnotes - 13:22 produce fruit To produce fruit means to have in your life the good things God wants . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Matthew	14	14	When he arrived , he saw a great crowd waiting . He felt sorry for them and healed those who were sick .
NCV	Matthew	14	2	So he said to his servants , “ Jesus is John the Baptist , who has risen from the dead . That is why he can work these miracles. ”
NCV	Matthew	14	3	Sometime before this , Herod had arrested John , tied him up , and put him into prison . Herod did this because of Herodias , who had been the wife of Philip , Herod ’ s brother .
NCV	Matthew	14	4	John had been telling Herod , “ It is not lawful for you to be married to Herodias. ”
NCV	Matthew	14	5	Herod wanted to kill John , but he was afraid of the people , because they believed John was a prophet .
NCV	Matthew	14	6	On Herod ’ s birthday , the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests , and she pleased him .
NCV	Matthew	14	7	So he promised with an oath to give her anything she wanted .
NCV	Matthew	14	8	Herodias told her daughter what to ask for , so she said to Herod , “ Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter. ”
NCV	Matthew	14	9	Although King Herod was very sad , he had made a promise , and his dinner guests had heard him . So Herod ordered that what she asked for be done .
NCV	Matthew	14	10	He sent soldiers to the prison to cut off John ’ s head .
NCV	Matthew	14	11	And they brought it on a platter and gave it to the girl , and she took it to her mother .
NCV	Matthew	14	12	John ’ s followers came and got his body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus . More than Five Thousand Fed
NCV	Matthew	14	13	When Jesus heard what had happened to John , he left in a boat and went to a lonely place by himself . But the crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns .
NCV	Matthew	14	15	When it was evening , his followers came to him and said , “ No one lives in this place , and it is already late . Send the people away so they can go to the towns and buy food for themselves. ”
NCV	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus answered , “ They don ’ t need to go away . You give them something to eat. ”
NCV	Matthew	14	17	They said to him , “ But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish. ”
NCV	Matthew	14	18	Jesus said , “ Bring the bread and the fish to me. ”
NCV	Matthew	14	19	Then he told the people to sit down on the grass . He took the five loaves and the two fish and , looking to heaven , he thanked God for the food . Jesus divided the bread and gave it to his followers , who gave it to the people .
NCV	Matthew	14	20	All the people ate and were satisfied . Then the followers filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of food .
NCV	Matthew	14	21	There were about five thousand men there who ate , not counting women and children . Jesus Walks on the Water
NCV	Matthew	14	22	Immediately Jesus told his followers to get into the boat and go ahead of him across the lake . He stayed there to send the people home .
NCV	Matthew	14	23	After he had sent them away , he went by himself up into the hills to pray . It was late , and Jesus was there alone .
NCV	Matthew	14	24	By this time , the boat was already far away from land . It was being hit by waves , because the wind was blowing against it .
NCV	Matthew	14	25	Between three and six o ’ clock in the morning , Jesus came to them , walking on the water .
NCV	Matthew	14	26	When his followers saw him walking on the water , they were afraid . They said , “ It ’ s a ghost ! ” and cried out in fear .
NCV	Matthew	14	27	But Jesus quickly spoke to them , “ Have courage ! It is I . Do not be afraid. ”
NCV	Matthew	14	28	Peter said , “ Lord , if it is really you , then command me to come to you on the water. ”
NCV	Matthew	14	29	Jesus said , “ Come. ” And Peter left the boat and walked on the water to Jesus .
NCV	Matthew	14	30	But when Peter saw the wind and the waves , he became afraid and began to sink . He shouted , “ Lord , save me ! ”
NCV	Matthew	14	31	Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught Peter . Jesus said , “ Your faith is small . Why did you doubt ? ”
NCV	Matthew	14	32	After they got into the boat , the wind became calm .
NCV	Matthew	14	33	Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus and said , “ Truly you are the Son of God ! ”
NCV	Matthew	14	34	When they had crossed the lake , they came to shore at Gennesaret .
NCV	Matthew	14	35	When the people there recognized Jesus , they told people all around there that Jesus had come , and they brought all their sick to him .

NCV	Matthew	15	15	Peter said , “ Explain the example to us. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	2	“ Why don ’ t your followers obey the unwritten laws which have been handed down to us ? They don ’ t wash their hands before they eat. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	3	Jesus answered , “ And why do you refuse to obey God ’ s command so that you can follow your own teachings ?
NCV	Matthew	15	4	God said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ [ a ] and ‘ Anyone who says cruel things to his father or mother must be put to death. ’ [ b ]
NCV	Matthew	15	5	But you say a person can tell his father or mother , ‘ I have something I could use to help you , but I have given it to God already. ’
NCV	Matthew	15	6	You teach that person not to honor his father or his mother . You rejected what God said for the sake of your own rules .
NCV	Matthew	15	7	You are hypocrites ! Isaiah was right when he said about you :
NCV	Matthew	15	8	‘ These people show honor to me with words , but their hearts are far from me .
NCV	Matthew	15	9	Their worship of me is worthless . The things they teach are nothing but human rules. ’ ” Isaiah 29:13
NCV	Matthew	15	10	After Jesus called the crowd to him , he said , “ Listen and understand what I am saying .
NCV	Matthew	15	11	It is not what people put into their mouths that makes them unclean . It is what comes out of their mouths that makes them unclean. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	12	Then his followers came to him and asked , “ Do you know that the Pharisees are angry because of what you said ? ”
NCV	Matthew	15	13	Jesus answered , “ Every plant that my Father in heaven has not planted himself will be pulled up by the roots .
NCV	Matthew	15	14	Stay away from the Pharisees ; they are blind leaders . [ c ] And if a blind person leads a blind person , both will fall into a ditch. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	16	Jesus said , “ Do you still not understand ?
NCV	Matthew	15	17	Surely you know that all the food that enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then goes out of the body .
NCV	Matthew	15	18	But what people say with their mouths comes from the way they think ; these are the things that make people unclean .
NCV	Matthew	15	19	Out of the mind come evil thoughts , murder , adultery , sexual sins , stealing , lying , and speaking evil of others .
NCV	Matthew	15	20	These things make people unclean ; eating with unwashed hands does not make them unclean. ” Jesus Helps a Non-Jewish Woman
NCV	Matthew	15	21	Jesus left that place and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon .
NCV	Matthew	15	22	A Canaanite woman from that area came to Jesus and cried out , “ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on me ! My daughter has a demon , and she is suffering very much. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	23	But Jesus did not answer the woman . So his followers came to Jesus and begged him , “ Tell the woman to go away . She is following us and shouting. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	24	Jesus answered , “ God sent me only to the lost sheep , the people of Israel. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	25	Then the woman came to Jesus again and bowed before him and said , “ Lord , help me ! ”
NCV	Matthew	15	26	Jesus answered , “ It is not right to take the children ’ s bread and give it to the dogs. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	27	The woman said , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters ’ table. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered , “ Woman , you have great faith ! I will do what you asked. ” And at that moment the woman ’ s daughter was healed . Jesus Heals Many People
NCV	Matthew	15	29	After leaving there , Jesus went along the shore of Lake Galilee . He went up on a hill and sat there .
NCV	Matthew	15	30	Great crowds came to Jesus , bringing with them the lame , the blind , the crippled , those who could not speak , and many others . They put them at Jesus ’ feet , and he healed them .
NCV	Matthew	15	31	The crowd was amazed when they saw that people who could not speak before were now able to speak . The crippled were made strong . The lame could walk , and the blind could see . And they praised the God of Israel for this . More than Four Thousand Fed
NCV	Matthew	15	32	Jesus called his followers to him and said , “ I feel sorry for these people , because they have already been with me three days , and they have nothing to eat . I don ’ t want to send them away hungry . They might faint while going home. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	33	His followers asked him , “ How can we get enough bread to feed all these people ? We are far away from any town. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	34	Jesus asked , “ How many loaves of bread do you have ? ” They answered , “ Seven , and a few small fish. ”
NCV	Matthew	15	35	Jesus told the people to sit on the ground .
NCV	Matthew	15	36	He took the seven loaves of bread and the fish and gave thanks to God . Then he divided the food and gave it to his followers , and they gave it to the people .

NCV	Matthew	16	5	Jesus ’ followers went across the lake , but they had forgotten to bring bread .
NCV	Matthew	16	6	Jesus said to them , “ Be careful ! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. ”
NCV	Matthew	16	7	His followers discussed the meaning of this , saying , “ He said this because we forgot to bring bread. ”
NCV	Matthew	16	8	Knowing what they were talking about , Jesus asked them , “ Why are you talking about not having bread ? Your faith is small .
NCV	Matthew	16	9	Do you still not understand ? Remember the five loaves of bread that fed the five thousand ? And remember that you filled many baskets with the leftovers ?
NCV	Matthew	16	10	Or the seven loaves of bread that fed the four thousand and the many baskets you filled then also ?

NCV	Matthew	16	13	When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his followers , “ Who do people say the Son of Man is ? ”
NCV	Matthew	16	14	They answered , “ Some say you are John the Baptist . Others say you are Elijah , and still others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets. ”
NCV	Matthew	16	15	Then Jesus asked them , “ And who do you say I am ? ”
NCV	Matthew	16	17	Jesus answered , “ You are blessed , Simon son of Jonah , because no person taught you that . My Father in heaven showed you who I am .
NCV	Matthew	16	18	So I tell you , you are Peter . [ c ] On this rock I will build my church , and the power of death will not be able to defeat it .
NCV	Matthew	16	19	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; the things you don ’ t allow on earth will be the things that God does not allow , and the things you allow on earth will be the things that God allows. ”
NCV	Matthew	16	20	Then Jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone he was the Christ . Jesus Says that He Must Die
NCV	Matthew	16	21	From that time on Jesus began telling his followers that he must go to Jerusalem , where the Jewish elders , the leading priests , and the teachers of the law would make him suffer many things . He told them he must be killed and then be raised from the dead on the third day .
NCV	Matthew	16	22	Peter took Jesus aside and told him not to talk like that . He said , “ God save you from those things , Lord ! Those things will never happen to you ! ”
NCV	Matthew	16	23	Then Jesus said to Peter , “ Go away from me , Satan ! [ d ] You are not helping me ! You don ’ t care about the things of God , but only about the things people think are important. ”
NCV	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ If people want to follow me , they must give up the things they want . They must be willing even to give up their lives to follow me .
NCV	Matthew	16	25	Those who want to save their lives will give up true life , and those who give up their lives for me will have true life .

NCV	Matthew	17	10	Then his followers asked him , “ Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ”
NCV	Matthew	17	11	Jesus answered , “ They are right to say that Elijah is coming and that he will make everything the way it should be .
NCV	Matthew	17	12	But I tell you that Elijah has already come , and they did not recognize him . They did to him whatever they wanted to do . It will be the same with the Son of Man ; those same people will make the Son of Man suffer. ”

NCV	Matthew	17	15	The man said , “ Lord , have mercy on my son . He has epilepsy [ b ] and is suffering very much , because he often falls into the fire or into the water .
NCV	Matthew	17	16	I brought him to your followers , but they could not cure him. ”
NCV	Matthew	17	18	Jesus commanded the demon inside the boy . Then the demon came out , and the boy was healed from that time on .
NCV	Matthew	17	19	The followers came to Jesus when he was alone and asked , “ Why couldn ’ t we force the demon out ? ”
NCV	Matthew	17	20	Jesus answered , “ Because your faith is too small . I tell you the truth , if your faith is as big as a mustard seed , you can say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move . All things will be possible for you . [

NCV	Matthew	17	26	Peter answered , “ Other people pay the taxes. ” Jesus said to Peter , “ Then the children of the king don ’ t have to pay taxes .

NCV	Matthew	18	18	“ I tell you the truth , the things you don ’ t allow on earth will be the things God does not allow . And the things you allow on earth will be the things that God allows .
NCV	Matthew	18	2	Jesus called a little child to him and stood the child before his followers .
NCV	Matthew	18	3	Then he said , “ I tell you the truth , you must change and become like little children . Otherwise , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
NCV	Matthew	18	4	The greatest person in the kingdom of heaven is the one who makes himself humble like this child .
NCV	Matthew	18	5	“ Whoever accepts a child in my name accepts me .
NCV	Matthew	18	6	If one of these little children believes in me , and someone causes that child to sin , it would be better for that person to have a large stone tied around the neck and be drowned in the sea .
NCV	Matthew	18	7	How terrible for the people of the world because of the things that cause them to sin . Such things will happen , but how terrible for the one who causes them to happen !
NCV	Matthew	18	8	If your hand or your foot causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to lose part of your body and live forever than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns forever .
NCV	Matthew	18	9	If your eye causes you to sin , take it out and throw it away . It is better for you to have only one eye and live forever than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell . A Lost Sheep
NCV	Matthew	18	10	“ Be careful . Don ’ t think these little children are worth nothing . I tell you that they have angels in heaven who are always with my Father in heaven . [
NCV	Matthew	18	11	The Son of Man came to save lost people . ] [ a ]
NCV	Matthew	18	12	“ If a man has a hundred sheep but one of the sheep gets lost , he will leave the other ninety-nine on the hill and go to look for the lost sheep .
NCV	Matthew	18	13	I tell you the truth , if he finds it he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that were never lost .
NCV	Matthew	18	14	In the same way , your Father in heaven does not want any of these little children to be lost . When a Person Sins Against You
NCV	Matthew	18	15	“ If your fellow believer sins against you , [ b ] go and tell him in private what he did wrong . If he listens to you , you have helped that person to be your brother or sister again .
NCV	Matthew	18	16	But if he refuses to listen , go to him again and take one or two other people with you . ‘ Every case may be proved by two or three witnesses. ’ [ c ]
NCV	Matthew	18	17	If he refuses to listen to them , tell the church . If he refuses to listen to the church , then treat him like a person who does not believe in God or like a tax collector .
NCV	Matthew	18	19	“ Also , I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about something and pray for it , it will be done for you by my Father in heaven .
NCV	Matthew	18	20	This is true because if two or three people come together in my name , I am there with them. ” An Unforgiving Servant
NCV	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter came to Jesus and asked , “ Lord , when my fellow believer sins against me , how many times must I forgive him ? Should I forgive him as many as seven times ? ”
NCV	Matthew	18	22	Jesus answered , “ I tell you , you must forgive him more than seven times . You must forgive him even if he wrongs you seventy times seven .
NCV	Matthew	18	23	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a king who decided to collect the money his servants owed him .
NCV	Matthew	18	24	When the king began to collect his money , a servant who owed him several million dollars was brought to him .
NCV	Matthew	18	25	But the servant did not have enough money to pay his master , the king . So the master ordered that everything the servant owned should be sold , even the servant ’ s wife and children . Then the money would be used to pay the king what the servant owed .
NCV	Matthew	18	26	“ But the servant fell on his knees and begged , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay you everything I owe. ’
NCV	Matthew	18	27	The master felt sorry for his servant and told him he did not have to pay it back . Then he let the servant go free .
NCV	Matthew	18	28	“ Later , that same servant found another servant who owed him a few dollars . The servant grabbed him around the neck and said , ‘ Pay me the money you owe me ! ’
NCV	Matthew	18	29	“ The other servant fell on his knees and begged him , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay you everything I owe. ’
NCV	Matthew	18	30	“ But the first servant refused to be patient . He threw the other servant into prison until he could pay everything he owed .
NCV	Matthew	18	31	When the other servants saw what had happened , they were very sorry . So they went and told their master all that had happened .
NCV	Matthew	18	32	“ Then the master called his servant in and said , ‘ You evil servant ! Because you begged me to forget what you owed , I told you that you did not have to pay anything .
NCV	Matthew	18	33	You should have showed mercy to that other servant , just as I showed mercy to you. ’
NCV	Matthew	18	34	The master was very angry and put the servant in prison to be punished until he could pay everything he owed .

NCV	Matthew	19	2	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
NCV	Matthew	19	3	Some Pharisees came to Jesus and tried to trick him . They asked , “ Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for any reason he chooses ? ”
NCV	Matthew	19	4	Jesus answered , “ Surely you have read in the Scriptures : When God made the world , ‘ he made them male and female. ’ [ a ]
NCV	Matthew	19	5	And God said , ‘ So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife , and the two will become one body. ’ [ b ]
NCV	Matthew	19	6	So there are not two , but one . God has joined the two together , so no one should separate them. ”
NCV	Matthew	19	7	The Pharisees asked , “ Why then did Moses give a command for a man to divorce his wife by giving her divorce papers ? ”
NCV	Matthew	19	8	Jesus answered , “ Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept God ’ s teaching , but divorce was not allowed in the beginning .
NCV	Matthew	19	9	I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . [ c ] The only reason for a man to divorce his wife is if his wife has sexual relations with another man. ”
NCV	Matthew	19	10	The followers said to him , “ If that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife , it is better not to marry. ”
NCV	Matthew	19	11	Jesus answered , “ Not everyone can accept this teaching , but God has made some able to accept it .
NCV	Matthew	19	12	There are different reasons why some men can not marry . Some men were born without the ability to become fathers . Others were made that way later in life by other people . And some men have given up marriage because of the kingdom of heaven . But the person who can marry should accept this teaching about marriage. ” [ d ] Jesus Welcomes Children
NCV	Matthew	19	13	Then the people brought their little children to Jesus so he could put his hands on them [ e ] and pray for them . His followers told them to stop ,
NCV	Matthew	19	14	but Jesus said , “ Let the little children come to me . Don ’ t stop them , because the kingdom of heaven belongs to people who are like these children. ”
NCV	Matthew	19	15	After Jesus put his hands on the children , he left there . A Rich Young Man ’ s Question
NCV	Matthew	19	16	A man came to Jesus and asked , “ Teacher , what good thing must I do to have life forever ? ”
NCV	Matthew	19	17	Jesus answered , “ Why do you ask me about what is good ? Only God is good . But if you want to have life forever , obey the commands. ”
NCV	Matthew	19	18	The man asked , “ Which commands ? ” Jesus answered , “ ‘ You must not murder anyone ; you must not be guilty of adultery ; you must not steal ; you must not tell lies about your neighbor ;
NCV	Matthew	19	20	The young man said , “ I have obeyed all these things . What else do I need to do ? ”
NCV	Matthew	19	21	Jesus answered , “ If you want to be perfect , then go and sell your possessions and give the money to the poor . If you do this , you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me. ”
NCV	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard this , he left sorrowfully , because he was rich .
NCV	Matthew	19	23	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ I tell you the truth , it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven .
NCV	Matthew	19	24	Yes , I tell you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NCV	Matthew	19	25	When Jesus ’ followers heard this , they were very surprised and asked , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NCV	Matthew	19	26	Jesus looked at them and said , “ For people this is impossible , but for God all things are possible. ”
NCV	Matthew	19	27	Peter said to Jesus , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you . So what will we have ? ”
NCV	Matthew	19	28	Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the truth , when the age to come has arrived , the Son of Man will sit on his great throne . All of you who followed me will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
NCV	Matthew	19	29	And all those who have left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , [ h ] children , or farms to follow me will get much more than they left , and they will have life forever .

NCV	Matthew	20	20	Then the wife of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons . She bowed before him and asked him to do something for her .
NCV	Matthew	20	2	The man agreed to pay the workers one coin [ a ] for working that day . Then he sent them into the vineyard to work .
NCV	Matthew	20	3	About nine o ’ clock the man went to the marketplace and saw some other people standing there , doing nothing .
NCV	Matthew	20	4	So he said to them , ‘ If you go and work in my vineyard , I will pay you what your work is worth. ’
NCV	Matthew	20	5	So they went to work in the vineyard . The man went out again about twelve o ’ clock and three o ’ clock and did the same thing .
NCV	Matthew	20	6	About five o ’ clock the man went to the marketplace again and saw others standing there . He asked them , ‘ Why did you stand here all day doing nothing ? ’
NCV	Matthew	20	7	They answered , ‘ No one gave us a job. ’ The man said to them , ‘ Then you can go and work in my vineyard. ’
NCV	Matthew	20	8	“ At the end of the day , the owner of the vineyard said to the boss of all the workers , ‘ Call the workers and pay them . Start with the last people I hired and end with those I hired first. ’
NCV	Matthew	20	9	“ When the workers who were hired at five o ’ clock came to get their pay , each received one coin .
NCV	Matthew	20	10	When the workers who were hired first came to get their pay , they thought they would be paid more than the others . But each one of them also received one coin .
NCV	Matthew	20	11	When they got their coin , they complained to the man who owned the land .
NCV	Matthew	20	12	They said , ‘ Those people were hired last and worked only one hour . But you paid them the same as you paid us who worked hard all day in the hot sun. ’
NCV	Matthew	20	13	But the man who owned the vineyard said to one of those workers , ‘ Friend , I am being fair to you . You agreed to work for one coin .
NCV	Matthew	20	14	So take your pay and go . I want to give the man who was hired last the same pay that I gave you .
NCV	Matthew	20	15	I can do what I want with my own money . Are you jealous because I am good to those people ? ’
NCV	Matthew	20	16	“ So those who are last now will someday be first , and those who are first now will someday be last. ” Jesus Talks About His Own Death
NCV	Matthew	20	17	While Jesus was going to Jerusalem , he took his twelve followers aside privately and said to them ,
NCV	Matthew	20	18	“ Look , we are going to Jerusalem . The Son of Man will be turned over to the leading priests and the teachers of the law , and they will say that he must die .
NCV	Matthew	20	19	They will give the Son of Man to the non-Jewish people to laugh at him and beat him with whips and crucify him . But on the third day , he will be raised to life again. ” A Mother Asks Jesus a Favor
NCV	Matthew	20	21	Jesus asked , “ What do you want ? ” She said , “ Promise that one of my sons will sit at your right side and the other will sit at your left side in your kingdom. ”
NCV	Matthew	20	22	But Jesus said , “ You don ’ t understand what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink ? ” [ b ] The sons answered , “ Yes , we can. ”
NCV	Matthew	20	23	Jesus said to them , “ You will drink from my cup . But I can not choose who will sit at my right or my left ; those places belong to those for whom my Father has prepared them. ”
NCV	Matthew	20	24	When the other ten followers heard this , they were angry with the two brothers .
NCV	Matthew	20	25	Jesus called all the followers together and said , “ You know that the rulers of the non-Jewish people love to show their power over the people . And their important leaders love to use all their authority .
NCV	Matthew	20	26	But it should not be that way among you . Whoever wants to become great among you must serve the rest of you like a servant .
NCV	Matthew	20	27	Whoever wants to become first among you must serve the rest of you like a slave .
NCV	Matthew	20	28	In the same way , the Son of Man did not come to be served . He came to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many people. ” Jesus Heals Two Blind Men
NCV	Matthew	20	29	When Jesus and his followers were leaving Jericho , a great many people followed him .
NCV	Matthew	20	30	Two blind men sitting by the road heard that Jesus was going by , so they shouted , “ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us ! ”
NCV	Matthew	20	31	The people warned the blind men to be quiet , but they shouted even more , “ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us ! ”
NCV	Matthew	20	32	Jesus stopped and said to the blind men , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
NCV	Matthew	20	33	They answered , “ Lord , we want to see. ”

NCV	Matthew	21	21	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , if you have faith and do not doubt , you will be able to do what I did to this tree and even more . You will be able to say to this mountain , ‘ Go , fall into the sea. ’ And if you have faith , it will happen .
NCV	Matthew	21	2	and said to them , “ Go to the town you can see there . When you enter it , you will quickly find a donkey tied there with its colt . Untie them and bring them to me .
NCV	Matthew	21	3	If anyone asks you why you are taking the donkeys , say that the Master needs them , and he will send them at once. ”
NCV	Matthew	21	4	This was to bring about what the prophet had said :
NCV	Matthew	21	5	“ Tell the people of Jerusalem , ‘ Your king is coming to you . He is gentle and riding on a donkey , on the colt of a donkey. ’ ” Isaiah 62:11 ; Zechariah 9:9
NCV	Matthew	21	6	The followers went and did what Jesus told them to do .
NCV	Matthew	21	7	They brought the donkey and the colt to Jesus and laid their coats on them , and Jesus sat on them .
NCV	Matthew	21	8	Many people spread their coats on the road . Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
NCV	Matthew	21	9	The people were walking ahead of Jesus and behind him , shouting , “ Praise [ a ] to the Son of David ! God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord ! Psalm 118:26 Praise to God in heaven ! ”
NCV	Matthew	21	10	When Jesus entered Jerusalem , all the city was filled with excitement . The people asked , “ Who is this man ? ”
NCV	Matthew	21	11	The crowd said , “ This man is Jesus , the prophet from the town of Nazareth in Galilee. ” Jesus Goes to the Temple
NCV	Matthew	21	12	Jesus went into the Temple and threw out all the people who were buying and selling there . He turned over the tables of those who were exchanging different kinds of money , and he upset the benches of those who were selling doves .
NCV	Matthew	21	13	Jesus said to all the people there , “ It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ My Temple will be called a house for prayer. ’ [ b ] But you are changing it into a ‘ hideout for robbers. ’ ” [ c ]
NCV	Matthew	21	14	The blind and crippled people came to Jesus in the Temple , and he healed them .
NCV	Matthew	21	15	The leading priests and the teachers of the law saw that Jesus was doing wonderful things and that the children were praising him in the Temple , saying , “ Praise [ d ] to the Son of David. ” All these things made the priests and the teachers of the law very angry .
NCV	Matthew	21	16	They asked Jesus , “ Do you hear the things these children are saying ? ” Jesus answered , “ Yes . Haven ’ t you read in the Scriptures , ‘ You have taught children and babies to sing praises ’ ? ” [ e ]
NCV	Matthew	21	17	Then Jesus left and went out of the city to Bethany , where he spent the night . The Power of Faith
NCV	Matthew	21	18	Early the next morning , as Jesus was going back to the city , he became hungry .
NCV	Matthew	21	19	Seeing a fig tree beside the road , Jesus went to it , but there were no figs on the tree , only leaves . So Jesus said to the tree , “ You will never again have fruit. ” The tree immediately dried up .
NCV	Matthew	21	20	When his followers saw this , they were amazed . They asked , “ How did the fig tree dry up so quickly ? ”
NCV	Matthew	21	22	If you believe , you will get anything you ask for in prayer. ” Leaders Doubt Jesus ’ Authority
NCV	Matthew	21	23	Jesus went to the Temple , and while he was teaching there , the leading priests and the elders of the people came to him . They said , “ What authority do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
NCV	Matthew	21	24	Jesus answered , “ I also will ask you a question . If you answer me , then I will tell you what authority I have to do these things .
NCV	Matthew	21	25	Tell me : When John baptized people , did that come from God or just from other people ? ” They argued about Jesus ’ question , saying , “ If we answer , ‘ John ’ s baptism was from God , ’ Jesus will say , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
NCV	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , ‘ It was from people , ’ we are afraid of what the crowd will do because they all believe that John was a prophet. ”
NCV	Matthew	21	27	So they answered Jesus , “ We don ’ t know. ” Jesus said to them , “ Then I won ’ t tell you what authority I have to do these things . A Story About Two Sons
NCV	Matthew	21	28	“ Tell me what you think about this : A man had two sons . He went to the first son and said , ‘ Son , go and work today in my vineyard. ’
NCV	Matthew	21	29	The son answered , ‘ I will not go. ’ But later the son changed his mind and went .
NCV	Matthew	21	30	Then the father went to the other son and said , ‘ Son , go and work today in my vineyard. ’ The son answered , ‘ Yes , sir , I will go and work , ’ but he did not go .
NCV	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two sons obeyed his father ? ” The priests and leaders answered , “ The first son. ” Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the truth , the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you do .
NCV	Matthew	21	32	John came to show you the right way to live . You did not believe him , but the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him . Even after seeing this , you still refused to change your ways and believe him . A Story About God ’ s Son
NCV	Matthew	21	33	“ Listen to this story : There was a man who owned a vineyard . He put a wall around it and dug a hole for a winepress and built a tower . Then he leased the land to some farmers and left for a trip .
NCV	Matthew	21	34	When it was time for the grapes to be picked , he sent his servants to the farmers to get his share of the grapes .
NCV	Matthew	21	35	But the farmers grabbed the servants , beat one , killed another , and then killed a third servant with stones .
NCV	Matthew	21	36	So the man sent some other servants to the farmers , even more than he sent the first time . But the farmers did the same thing to the servants that they had done before .
NCV	Matthew	21	37	So the man decided to send his son to the farmers . He said , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
NCV	Matthew	21	38	But when the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This son will inherit the vineyard . If we kill him , it will be ours ! ’
NCV	Matthew	21	39	Then the farmers grabbed the son , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
NCV	Matthew	21	40	So what will the owner of the vineyard do to these farmers when he comes ? ”
NCV	Matthew	21	41	The priests and leaders said , “ He will surely kill those evil men . Then he will lease the vineyard to some other farmers who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time. ”
NCV	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said to them , “ Surely you have read this in the Scriptures : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone . The Lord did this , and it is wonderful to us. ’ Psalm 118:22–23

NCV	Matthew	22	10	So the servants went into the streets and gathered all the people they could find , both good and bad . And the wedding hall was filled with guests .
NCV	Matthew	22	11	“ When the king came in to see the guests , he saw a man who was not dressed for a wedding .
NCV	Matthew	22	12	The king said , ‘ Friend , how were you allowed to come in here ? You are not dressed for a wedding. ’ But the man said nothing .
NCV	Matthew	22	13	So the king told some servants , ‘ Tie this man ’ s hands and feet . Throw him out into the darkness , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain. ’
NCV	Matthew	22	14	“ Yes , many are invited , but only a few are chosen. ” Is It Right to Pay Taxes or Not ?
NCV	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees left that place and made plans to trap Jesus in saying something wrong .
NCV	Matthew	22	16	They sent some of their own followers and some people from the group called Herodians . [ a ] They said , “ Teacher , we know that you are an honest man and that you teach the truth about God ’ s way . You are not afraid of what other people think about you , because you pay no attention to who they are .
NCV	Matthew	22	17	So tell us what you think . Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
NCV	Matthew	22	18	But knowing that these leaders were trying to trick him , Jesus said , “ You hypocrites ! Why are you trying to trap me ?
NCV	Matthew	22	19	Show me a coin used for paying the tax. ” So the men showed him a coin . [ b ]
NCV	Matthew	22	20	Then Jesus asked , “ Whose image and name are on the coin ? ”
NCV	Matthew	22	21	The men answered , “ Caesar ’ s. ” Then Jesus said to them , “ Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and give to God the things that are God ’ s. ”
NCV	Matthew	22	23	That same day some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question . ( Sadducees believed that people would not rise from the dead . )
NCV	Matthew	22	24	They said , “ Teacher , Moses said if a married man dies without having children , his brother must marry the widow and have children for him .
NCV	Matthew	22	25	Once there were seven brothers among us . The first one married and died . Since he had no children , his brother married the widow .
NCV	Matthew	22	26	Then the second brother also died . The same thing happened to the third brother and all the other brothers .
NCV	Matthew	22	27	Finally , the woman died .
NCV	Matthew	22	28	Since all seven men had married her , when people rise from the dead , whose wife will she be ? ”
NCV	Matthew	22	29	Jesus answered , “ You don ’ t understand , because you don ’ t know what the Scriptures say , and you don ’ t know about the power of God .
NCV	Matthew	22	30	When people rise from the dead , they will not marry , nor will they be given to someone to marry . They will be like the angels in heaven .
NCV	Matthew	22	31	Surely you have read what God said to you about rising from the dead .
NCV	Matthew	22	32	God said , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ’ [ c ] God is the God of the living , not the dead. ”
NCV	Matthew	22	33	When the people heard this , they were amazed at Jesus ’ teaching . The Most Important Command
NCV	Matthew	22	34	When the Pharisees learned that the Sadducees could not argue with Jesus ’ answers to them , the Pharisees met together .
NCV	Matthew	22	35	One Pharisee , who was an expert on the law of Moses , asked Jesus this question to test him :
NCV	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , which command in the law is the most important ? ”
NCV	Matthew	22	37	Jesus answered , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , and all your mind. ’ [ d ]
NCV	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and most important command .
NCV	Matthew	22	39	And the second command is like the first : ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ’ [ e ]
NCV	Matthew	22	40	All the law and the writings of the prophets depend on these two commands. ” Jesus Questions the Pharisees
NCV	Matthew	22	41	While the Pharisees were together , Jesus asked them ,
NCV	Matthew	22	42	“ What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? ” They answered , “ The Christ is the Son of David. ”
NCV	Matthew	22	43	Then Jesus said to them , “ Then why did David call him ‘ Lord ’ ? David , speaking by the power of the Holy Spirit , said ,
NCV	Matthew	22	44	‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit by me at my right side , until I put your enemies under your control. ” ’ Psalm 110:1
NCV	Matthew	22	45	David calls the Christ ‘ Lord , ’ so how can the Christ be his son ? ”
NCV	Matthew	22	46	None of the Pharisees could answer Jesus ’ question , and after that day no one was brave enough to ask him any more questions .

NCV	Matthew	23	23	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You give to God one-tenth of everything you earn—even your mint , dill , and cumin . [ c ] But you don ’ t obey the really important teachings of the law—justice , mercy , and being loyal . These are the things you should do , as well as those other things .
NCV	Matthew	23	2	“ The teachers of the law and the Pharisees have the authority to tell you what the law of Moses says .
NCV	Matthew	23	3	So you should obey and follow whatever they tell you , but their lives are not good examples for you to follow . They tell you to do things , but they themselves don ’ t do them .
NCV	Matthew	23	4	They make strict rules and try to force people to obey them , but they are unwilling to help those who struggle under the weight of their rules .
NCV	Matthew	23	5	“ They do good things so that other people will see them . They enlarge the little boxes [ a ] holding Scriptures that they wear , and they make their special prayer clothes very long .
NCV	Matthew	23	6	Those Pharisees and teachers of the law love to have the most important seats at feasts and in the synagogues .
NCV	Matthew	23	7	They love people to greet them with respect in the marketplaces , and they love to have people call them ‘ Teacher. ’
NCV	Matthew	23	8	“ But you must not be called ‘ Teacher , ’ because you have only one Teacher , and you are all brothers and sisters together .
NCV	Matthew	23	9	And don ’ t call any person on earth ‘ Father , ’ because you have one Father , who is in heaven .
NCV	Matthew	23	10	And you should not be called ‘ Master , ’ because you have only one Master , the Christ .
NCV	Matthew	23	11	Whoever is your servant is the greatest among you .
NCV	Matthew	23	12	Whoever makes himself great will be made humble . Whoever makes himself humble will be made great .
NCV	Matthew	23	13	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You close the door for people to enter the kingdom of heaven . You yourselves don ’ t enter , and you stop others who are trying to enter . [
NCV	Matthew	23	14	How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees . You are hypocrites . You take away widows ’ houses , and you say long prayers so that people will notice you . So you will have a worse punishment . ] [ b ]
NCV	Matthew	23	15	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You travel across land and sea to find one person who will change to your ways . When you find that person , you make him more fit for hell than you are .
NCV	Matthew	23	16	“ How terrible for you ! You guide the people , but you are blind . You say , ‘ If people swear by the Temple when they make a promise , that means nothing . But if they swear by the gold that is in the Temple , they must keep that promise. ’
NCV	Matthew	23	17	You are blind fools ! Which is greater : the gold or the Temple that makes that gold holy ?
NCV	Matthew	23	18	And you say , ‘ If people swear by the altar when they make a promise , that means nothing . But if they swear by the gift on the altar , they must keep that promise. ’
NCV	Matthew	23	19	You are blind ! Which is greater : the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy ?
NCV	Matthew	23	20	The person who swears by the altar is really using the altar and also everything on the altar .
NCV	Matthew	23	21	And the person who swears by the Temple is really using the Temple and also everything in the Temple .
NCV	Matthew	23	22	The person who swears by heaven is also using God ’ s throne and the One who sits on that throne .
NCV	Matthew	23	24	You guide the people , but you are blind ! You are like a person who picks a fly out of a drink and then swallows a camel ! [ d ]
NCV	Matthew	23	25	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You wash the outside of your cups and dishes , but inside they are full of things you got by cheating others and by pleasing only yourselves .
NCV	Matthew	23	26	Pharisees , you are blind ! First make the inside of the cup clean , and then the outside of the cup can be truly clean .
NCV	Matthew	23	27	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You are like tombs that are painted white . Outside , those tombs look fine , but inside , they are full of the bones of dead people and all kinds of unclean things .
NCV	Matthew	23	28	It is the same with you . People look at you and think you are good , but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil .
NCV	Matthew	23	29	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You are hypocrites ! You build tombs for the prophets , and you show honor to the graves of those who lived good lives .
NCV	Matthew	23	30	You say , ‘ If we had lived during the time of our ancestors , we would not have helped them kill the prophets. ’
NCV	Matthew	23	31	But you give proof that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets .

NCV	Matthew	23	35	So you will be guilty for the death of all the good people who have been killed on earth—from the murder of that good man Abel to the murder of Zechariah [ e ] son of Berakiah , whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar .
NCV	Matthew	23	36	I tell you the truth , all of these things will happen to you people who are living now . Jesus Feels Sorry for Jerusalem

NCV	Matthew	24	24	False Christs and false prophets will come and perform great wonders and miracles . They will try to fool even the people God has chosen , if that is possible .
NCV	Matthew	24	2	Jesus asked , “ Do you see all these buildings ? I tell you the truth , not one stone will be left on another . Every stone will be thrown down to the ground. ”
NCV	Matthew	24	3	Later , as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , his followers came to be alone with him . They said , “ Tell us , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that it is time for you to come again and for this age to end ? ”
NCV	Matthew	24	4	Jesus answered , “ Be careful that no one fools you .
NCV	Matthew	24	5	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the Christ , ’ and they will fool many people .
NCV	Matthew	24	6	You will hear about wars and stories of wars that are coming , but don ’ t be afraid . These things must happen before the end comes .
NCV	Matthew	24	7	Nations will fight against other nations ; kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms . There will be times when there is no food for people to eat , and there will be earthquakes in different places .
NCV	Matthew	24	8	These things are like the first pains when something new is about to be born .
NCV	Matthew	24	9	“ Then people will arrest you , hand you over to be hurt , and kill you . They will hate you because you believe in me .
NCV	Matthew	24	10	At that time , many will lose their faith , and they will turn against each other and hate each other .
NCV	Matthew	24	11	Many false prophets will come and cause many people to believe lies .
NCV	Matthew	24	12	There will be more and more evil in the world , so most people will stop showing their love for each other .
NCV	Matthew	24	13	But those people who keep their faith until the end will be saved .
NCV	Matthew	24	14	The Good News about God ’ s kingdom will be preached in all the world , to every nation . Then the end will come .
NCV	Matthew	24	15	“ Daniel the prophet spoke about ‘ a blasphemous object that brings destruction. ’ [ a ] You will see this standing in the holy place. ” ( You who read this should understand what it means . )
NCV	Matthew	24	16	“ At that time , the people in Judea should run away to the mountains .
NCV	Matthew	24	17	If people are on the roofs [ b ] of their houses , they must not go down to get anything out of their houses .
NCV	Matthew	24	18	If people are in the fields , they must not go back to get their coats .
NCV	Matthew	24	19	At that time , how terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or have nursing babies !
NCV	Matthew	24	20	Pray that it will not be winter or a Sabbath day when these things happen and you have to run away ,
NCV	Matthew	24	21	because at that time there will be much trouble . There will be more trouble than there has ever been since the beginning of the world until now , and nothing as bad will ever happen again .
NCV	Matthew	24	22	God has decided to make that terrible time short . Otherwise , no one would go on living . But God will make that time short to help the people he has chosen .
NCV	Matthew	24	23	At that time , someone might say to you , ‘ Look , there is the Christ ! ’ Or another person might say , ‘ There he is ! ’ But don ’ t believe them .
NCV	Matthew	24	25	Now I have warned you about this before it happens .
NCV	Matthew	24	26	“ If people tell you , ‘ The Christ is in the desert , ’ don ’ t go there . If they say , ‘ The Christ is in the inner room , ’ don ’ t believe it .
NCV	Matthew	24	27	When the Son of Man comes , he will be seen by everyone , like lightning flashing from the east to the west .
NCV	Matthew	24	28	Wherever the dead body is , there the vultures will gather .
NCV	Matthew	24	29	“ Soon after the trouble of those days , ‘ the sun will grow dark , and the moon will not give its light . The stars will fall from the sky . And the powers of the heavens will be shaken. ’ Isaiah 13:10 ; 34:4
NCV	Matthew	24	30	“ At that time , the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky . Then all the peoples of the world will cry . They will see the Son of Man coming on clouds in the sky with great power and glory .
NCV	Matthew	24	31	He will use a loud trumpet to send his angels all around the earth , and they will gather his chosen people from every part of the world .
NCV	Matthew	24	32	“ Learn a lesson from the fig tree : When its branches become green and soft and new leaves appear , you know summer is near .
NCV	Matthew	24	33	In the same way , when you see all these things happening , you will know that the time is near , ready to come .
NCV	Matthew	24	34	I tell you the truth , all these things will happen while the people of this time are still living .
NCV	Matthew	24	35	Earth and sky will be destroyed , but the words I have said will never be destroyed . When Will Jesus Come Again ?
NCV	Matthew	24	36	“ No one knows when that day or time will be , not the angels in heaven , not even the Son . [ c ] Only the Father knows .
NCV	Matthew	24	37	When the Son of Man comes , it will be like what happened during Noah ’ s time .
NCV	Matthew	24	38	In those days before the flood , people were eating and drinking , marrying and giving their children to be married , until the day Noah entered the boat .
NCV	Matthew	24	39	They knew nothing about what was happening until the flood came and destroyed them . It will be the same when the Son of Man comes .
NCV	Matthew	24	40	Two men will be in the field . One will be taken , and the other will be left .
NCV	Matthew	24	41	Two women will be grinding grain with a mill . [ d ] One will be taken , and the other will be left .
NCV	Matthew	24	42	“ So always be ready , because you don ’ t know the day your Lord will come .
NCV	Matthew	24	43	Remember this : If the owner of the house knew what time of night a thief was coming , the owner would watch and not let the thief break in .
NCV	Matthew	24	44	So you also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at a time you don ’ t expect him .
NCV	Matthew	24	45	“ Who is the wise and loyal servant that the master trusts to give the other servants their food at the right time ?
NCV	Matthew	24	46	When the master comes and finds the servant doing his work , the servant will be blessed .
NCV	Matthew	24	47	I tell you the truth , the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns .
NCV	Matthew	24	48	But suppose that evil servant thinks to himself , ‘ My master will not come back soon , ’
NCV	Matthew	24	49	and he begins to beat the other servants and eat and get drunk with others like him ?
NCV	Matthew	24	50	The master will come when that servant is not ready and is not expecting him .
NCV	Matthew	24	51	Then the master will cut him in pieces and send him away to be with the hypocrites , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain .

NCV	Matthew	25	2	Five of them were foolish and five were wise .
NCV	Matthew	25	3	The five foolish bridesmaids took their lamps , but they did not take more oil for the lamps to burn .
NCV	Matthew	25	4	The wise bridesmaids took their lamps and more oil in jars .
NCV	Matthew	25	5	Because the bridegroom was late , they became sleepy and went to sleep .
NCV	Matthew	25	6	“ At midnight someone cried out , ‘ The bridegroom is coming ! Come and meet him ! ’
NCV	Matthew	25	7	Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready .
NCV	Matthew	25	8	But the foolish ones said to the wise , ‘ Give us some of your oil , because our lamps are going out. ’
NCV	Matthew	25	9	The wise bridesmaids answered , ‘ No , the oil we have might not be enough for all of us . Go to the people who sell oil and buy some for yourselves. ’
NCV	Matthew	25	10	“ So while the five foolish bridesmaids went to buy oil , the bridegroom came . The bridesmaids who were ready went in with the bridegroom to the wedding feast . Then the door was closed and locked .

NCV	Matthew	25	14	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going to another place for a visit . Before he left , he called for his servants and told them to take care of his things while he was gone .
NCV	Matthew	25	15	He gave one servant five bags of gold , another servant two bags of gold , and a third servant one bag of gold , to each one as much as he could handle . Then he left .
NCV	Matthew	25	16	The servant who got five bags went quickly to invest the money and earned five more bags .
NCV	Matthew	25	17	In the same way , the servant who had two bags invested them and earned two more .
NCV	Matthew	25	18	But the servant who got one bag went out and dug a hole in the ground and hid the master ’ s money .
NCV	Matthew	25	19	“ After a long time the master came home and asked the servants what they did with his money .
NCV	Matthew	25	20	The servant who was given five bags of gold brought five more bags to the master and said , ‘ Master , you trusted me to care for five bags of gold , so I used your five bags to earn five more. ’
NCV	Matthew	25	21	The master answered , ‘ You did well . You are a good and loyal servant . Because you were loyal with small things , I will let you care for much greater things . Come and share my joy with me. ’
NCV	Matthew	25	22	“ Then the servant who had been given two bags of gold came to the master and said , ‘ Master , you gave me two bags of gold to care for , so I used your two bags to earn two more. ’
NCV	Matthew	25	23	The master answered , ‘ You did well . You are a good and loyal servant . Because you were loyal with small things , I will let you care for much greater things . Come and share my joy with me. ’
NCV	Matthew	25	24	“ Then the servant who had been given one bag of gold came to the master and said , ‘ Master , I knew that you were a hard man . You harvest things you did not plant . You gather crops where you did not sow any seed .
NCV	Matthew	25	26	The master answered , ‘ You are a wicked and lazy servant ! You say you knew that I harvest things I did not plant and that I gather crops where I did not sow any seed .
NCV	Matthew	25	27	So you should have put my gold in the bank . Then , when I came home , I would have received my gold back with interest. ’
NCV	Matthew	25	28	“ So the master told his other servants , ‘ Take the bag of gold from that servant and give it to the servant who has ten bags of gold .
NCV	Matthew	25	29	Those who have much will get more , and they will have much more than they need . But those who do not have much will have everything taken away from them. ’

NCV	Matthew	26	15	He said , “ What will you pay me for giving Jesus to you ? ” And they gave him thirty silver coins .
NCV	Matthew	26	16	After that , Judas watched for the best time to turn Jesus in . Jesus Eats the Passover Meal
NCV	Matthew	26	17	On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the followers came to Jesus . They said , “ Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? ”
NCV	Matthew	26	18	Jesus answered , “ Go into the city to a certain man and tell him , ‘ The Teacher says : “ The chosen time is near . I will have the Passover with my followers at your house. ” ’ ”
NCV	Matthew	26	19	The followers did what Jesus told them to do , and they prepared the Passover meal .
NCV	Matthew	26	20	In the evening Jesus was sitting at the table with his twelve followers .
NCV	Matthew	26	21	As they were eating , Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , one of you will turn against me. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	22	This made the followers very sad . Each one began to say to Jesus , “ Surely , Lord , I am not the one who will turn against you , am I ? ”
NCV	Matthew	26	23	Jesus answered , “ The man who has dipped his hand with me into the bowl is the one who will turn against me .
NCV	Matthew	26	24	The Son of Man will die , just as the Scriptures say . But how terrible it will be for the person who hands the Son of Man over to be killed . It would be better for him if he had never been born. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	25	Then Judas , who would give Jesus to his enemies , said to Jesus , “ Teacher , surely I am not the one , am I ? ” Jesus answered , “ Yes , it is you. ” The Lord ’ s Supper
NCV	Matthew	26	27	Then Jesus took a cup and thanked God for it and gave it to the followers . He said , “ Every one of you drink this .
NCV	Matthew	26	28	This is my blood which is the new [ a ] agreement that God makes with his people . This blood is poured out for many to forgive their sins .
NCV	Matthew	26	29	I tell you this : I will not drink of this fruit of the vine [ b ] again until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father ’ s kingdom. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	30	After singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives . Jesus ’ Followers Will Leave Him
NCV	Matthew	26	31	Jesus told his followers , “ Tonight you will all stumble in your faith on account of me , because it is written in the Scriptures : ‘ I will kill the shepherd , and the sheep will scatter. ’ Zechariah 13:7
NCV	Matthew	26	32	But after I rise from the dead , I will go ahead of you into Galilee. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	33	Peter said , “ Everyone else may stumble in their faith because of you , but I will not. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , tonight before the rooster crows you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	35	But Peter said , “ I will never say that I don ’ t know you ! I will even die with you ! ” And all the other followers said the same thing . Jesus Prays Alone
NCV	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus went with his followers to a place called Gethsemane . He said to them , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	37	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him , and he began to be very sad and troubled .
NCV	Matthew	26	38	He said to them , “ My heart is full of sorrow , to the point of death . Stay here and watch with me. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	39	After walking a little farther away from them , Jesus fell to the ground and prayed , “ My Father , if it is possible , do not give me this cup [ c ] of suffering . But do what you want , not what I want. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	40	Then Jesus went back to his followers and found them asleep . He said to Peter , “ You men could not stay awake with me for one hour ?
NCV	Matthew	26	41	Stay awake and pray for strength against temptation . The spirit wants to do what is right , but the body is weak. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	42	Then Jesus went away a second time and prayed , “ My Father , if it is not possible for this painful thing to be taken from me , and if I must do it , I pray that what you want will be done. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	43	Then he went back to his followers , and again he found them asleep , because their eyes were heavy .
NCV	Matthew	26	44	So Jesus left them and went away and prayed a third time , saying the same thing .
NCV	Matthew	26	45	Then Jesus went back to his followers and said , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinful people .
NCV	Matthew	26	46	Get up , we must go . Look , here comes the man who has turned against me. ” Jesus Is Arrested
NCV	Matthew	26	47	While Jesus was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve apostles , came up . With him were many people carrying swords and clubs who had been sent from the leading priests and the Jewish elders of the people .
NCV	Matthew	26	48	Judas had planned to give them a signal , saying , “ The man I kiss is Jesus . Arrest him. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	49	At once Judas went to Jesus and said , “ Greetings , Teacher ! ” and kissed him .
NCV	Matthew	26	50	Jesus answered , “ Friend , do what you came to do. ” Then the people came and grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
NCV	Matthew	26	51	When that happened , one of Jesus ’ followers reached for his sword and pulled it out . He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
NCV	Matthew	26	52	Jesus said to the man , “ Put your sword back in its place . All who use swords will be killed with swords .
NCV	Matthew	26	53	Surely you know I could ask my Father , and he would give me more than twelve armies of angels .
NCV	Matthew	26	54	But it must happen this way to bring about what the Scriptures say. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	55	Then Jesus said to the crowd , “ You came to get me with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal . Every day I sat in the Temple teaching , and you did not arrest me there .
NCV	Matthew	26	56	But all these things have happened so that it will come about as the prophets wrote. ” Then all of Jesus ’ followers left him and ran away . Jesus Before the Leaders
NCV	Matthew	26	57	Those people who arrested Jesus led him to the house of Caiaphas , the high priest , where the teachers of the law and the elders were gathered .
NCV	Matthew	26	58	Peter followed far behind to the courtyard of the high priest ’ s house , and he sat down with the guards to see what would happen to Jesus .
NCV	Matthew	26	59	The leading priests and the whole Jewish council tried to find something false against Jesus so they could kill him .
NCV	Matthew	26	60	Many people came and told lies about him , but the council could find no real reason to kill him . Then two people came and said ,
NCV	Matthew	26	61	“ This man said , ‘ I can destroy the Temple of God and build it again in three days. ’ ”
NCV	Matthew	26	62	Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus , “ Aren ’ t you going to answer ? Don ’ t you have something to say about their charges against you ? ”
NCV	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus said nothing . Again the high priest said to Jesus , “ I command you by the power of the living God : Tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	64	Jesus answered , “ Those are your words . But I tell you , in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God , the Powerful One , and coming on clouds in the sky. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	65	When the high priest heard this , he tore his clothes and said , “ This man has said things that are against God ! We don ’ t need any more witnesses ; you all heard him say these things against God .
NCV	Matthew	26	66	What do you think ? ” The people answered , “ He should die. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	67	Then the people there spat in Jesus ’ face and beat him with their fists . Others slapped him .
NCV	Matthew	26	68	They said , “ Prove to us that you are a prophet , you Christ ! Tell us who hit you ! ” Peter Says He Doesn ’ t Know Jesus
NCV	Matthew	26	69	At that time , as Peter was sitting in the courtyard , a servant girl came to him and said , “ You also were with Jesus of Galilee. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	70	But Peter said to all the people there that he was never with Jesus . He said , “ I don ’ t know what you are talking about. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	71	When he left the courtyard and was at the gate , another girl saw him . She said to the people there , “ This man was with Jesus of Nazareth. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	72	Again , Peter said he was never with him , saying , “ I swear I don ’ t know this man Jesus ! ”
NCV	Matthew	26	73	A short time later , some people standing there went to Peter and said , “ Surely you are one of those who followed Jesus . The way you talk shows it. ”
NCV	Matthew	26	74	Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear , “ I don ’ t know the man. ” At once , a rooster crowed .
NCV	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered what Jesus had told him : “ Before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ” Then Peter went outside and cried painfully .

NCV	Matthew	27	27	The governor ’ s soldiers took Jesus into the governor ’ s palace , and they all gathered around him .
NCV	Matthew	27	2	They tied him , led him away , and turned him over to Pilate , the governor . Judas Kills Himself
NCV	Matthew	27	3	Judas , the one who had given Jesus to his enemies , saw that they had decided to kill Jesus . Then he was very sorry for what he had done . So he took the thirty silver coins back to the priests and the leaders ,
NCV	Matthew	27	4	saying , “ I sinned ; I handed over to you an innocent man. ” The leaders answered , “ What is that to us ? That ’ s your problem , not ours. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	5	So Judas threw the money into the Temple . Then he went off and hanged himself .
NCV	Matthew	27	6	The leading priests picked up the silver coins in the Temple and said , “ Our law does not allow us to keep this money with the Temple money , because it has paid for a man ’ s death. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	7	So they decided to use the coins to buy Potter ’ s Field as a place to bury strangers who died in Jerusalem .
NCV	Matthew	27	8	That is why that field is still called the Field of Blood .
NCV	Matthew	27	9	So what Jeremiah the prophet had said came true : “ They took thirty silver coins . That is how little the Israelites thought he was worth .
NCV	Matthew	27	10	They used those thirty silver coins to buy the potter ’ s field , as the Lord commanded me. ” [ a ] Pilate Questions Jesus
NCV	Matthew	27	11	Jesus stood before Pilate the governor , and Pilate asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus answered , “ Those are your words. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	12	When the leading priests and the elders accused Jesus , he said nothing .
NCV	Matthew	27	13	So Pilate said to Jesus , “ Don ’ t you hear them accusing you of all these things ? ”
NCV	Matthew	27	14	But Jesus said nothing in answer to Pilate , and Pilate was very surprised at this . Pilate Tries to Free Jesus
NCV	Matthew	27	15	Every year at the time of Passover the governor would free one prisoner whom the people chose .
NCV	Matthew	27	16	At that time there was a man in prison , named Barabbas , [ b ] who was known to be very bad .
NCV	Matthew	27	17	When the people gathered at Pilate ’ s house , Pilate said , “ Whom do you want me to set free : Barabbas [ c ] or Jesus who is called the Christ ? ”
NCV	Matthew	27	18	Pilate knew that they turned Jesus in to him because they were jealous .
NCV	Matthew	27	19	While Pilate was sitting there on the judge ’ s seat , his wife sent this message to him : “ Don ’ t do anything to that man , because he is innocent . Today I had a dream about him , and it troubled me very much. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	20	But the leading priests and elders convinced the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be freed and for Jesus to be killed .
NCV	Matthew	27	21	Pilate said , “ I have Barabbas and Jesus . Which do you want me to set free for you ? ” The people answered , “ Barabbas. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	22	Pilate asked , “ So what should I do with Jesus , the one called the Christ ? ” They all answered , “ Crucify him ! ”
NCV	Matthew	27	23	Pilate asked , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? ” But they shouted louder , “ Crucify him ! ”
NCV	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he could do nothing about this and that a riot was starting , he took some water and washed his hands [ d ] in front of the crowd . Then he said , “ I am not guilty of this man ’ s death . You are the ones who are causing it ! ”
NCV	Matthew	27	25	All the people answered , “ We and our children will be responsible for his death. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	26	Then he set Barabbas free . But Jesus was beaten with whips and handed over to the soldiers to be crucified .
NCV	Matthew	27	28	They took off his clothes and put a red robe on him .
NCV	Matthew	27	29	Using thorny branches , they made a crown , put it on his head , and put a stick in his right hand . Then the soldiers bowed before Jesus and made fun of him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
NCV	Matthew	27	30	They spat on Jesus . Then they took his stick and began to beat him on the head .
NCV	Matthew	27	31	After they finished , the soldiers took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again . Then they led him away to be crucified . Jesus Is Crucified
NCV	Matthew	27	32	As the soldiers were going out of the city with Jesus , they forced a man from Cyrene , named Simon , to carry the cross for Jesus .
NCV	Matthew	27	33	They all came to the place called Golgotha , which means the Place of the Skull .
NCV	Matthew	27	34	The soldiers gave Jesus wine mixed with gall [ e ] to drink . He tasted the wine but refused to drink it .
NCV	Matthew	27	35	When the soldiers had crucified him , they threw lots to decide who would get his clothes . [ f ]
NCV	Matthew	27	36	The soldiers sat there and continued watching him .
NCV	Matthew	27	37	They put a sign above Jesus ’ head with a charge against him . It said : this is jesus , the king of the jews .
NCV	Matthew	27	38	Two robbers were crucified beside Jesus , one on the right and the other on the left .
NCV	Matthew	27	39	People walked by and insulted Jesus and shook their heads ,
NCV	Matthew	27	40	saying , “ You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days . So save yourself ! Come down from that cross if you are really the Son of God ! ”
NCV	Matthew	27	41	The leading priests , the teachers of the law , and the Jewish elders were also making fun of Jesus .
NCV	Matthew	27	42	They said , “ He saved others , but he can ’ t save himself ! He says he is the king of Israel ! If he is the king , let him come down now from the cross . Then we will believe in him .
NCV	Matthew	27	43	He trusts in God , so let God save him now , if God really wants him . He himself said , ‘ I am the Son of God. ’ ”
NCV	Matthew	27	44	And in the same way , the robbers who were being crucified beside Jesus also insulted him . Jesus Dies
NCV	Matthew	27	45	At noon the whole country became dark , and the darkness lasted for three hours .
NCV	Matthew	27	46	About three o ’ clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice , “ Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? ” This means , “ My God , my God , why have you abandoned me ? ”
NCV	Matthew	27	47	Some of the people standing there who heard this said , “ He is calling Elijah. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	48	Quickly one of them ran and got a sponge and filled it with vinegar and tied it to a stick and gave it to Jesus to drink .
NCV	Matthew	27	49	But the others said , “ Don ’ t bother him . We want to see if Elijah will come to save him. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	50	But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and died .
NCV	Matthew	27	51	Then the curtain in the Temple [ g ] was torn into two pieces , from the top to the bottom . Also , the earth shook and rocks broke apart .
NCV	Matthew	27	52	The graves opened , and many of God ’ s people who had died were raised from the dead .
NCV	Matthew	27	53	They came out of the graves after Jesus was raised from the dead and went into the holy city , where they appeared to many people .
NCV	Matthew	27	54	When the army officer and the soldiers guarding Jesus saw this earthquake and everything else that happened , they were very frightened and said , “ He really was the Son of God ! ”
NCV	Matthew	27	55	Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to help him were standing at a distance from the cross , watching .
NCV	Matthew	27	56	Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of James and John were there . Jesus Is Buried
NCV	Matthew	27	57	That evening a rich man named Joseph , a follower of Jesus from the town of Arimathea , came to Jerusalem .
NCV	Matthew	27	58	Joseph went to Pilate and asked to have Jesus ’ body . So Pilate gave orders for the soldiers to give it to Joseph .
NCV	Matthew	27	59	Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth .
NCV	Matthew	27	60	He put Jesus ’ body in a new tomb that he had cut out of a wall of rock , and he rolled a very large stone to block the entrance of the tomb . Then Joseph went away .
NCV	Matthew	27	61	Mary Magdalene and the other woman named Mary were sitting near the tomb . The Tomb of Jesus Is Guarded
NCV	Matthew	27	62	The next day , the day after Preparation Day , the leading priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate .
NCV	Matthew	27	63	They said , “ Sir , we remember that while that liar was still alive he said , ‘ After three days I will rise from the dead. ’
NCV	Matthew	27	64	So give the order for the tomb to be guarded closely till the third day . Otherwise , his followers might come and steal the body and tell people that he has risen from the dead . That lie would be even worse than the first one. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said , “ Take some soldiers and go guard the tomb the best way you know. ”
NCV	Matthew	27	66	So they all went to the tomb and made it safe from thieves by sealing the stone in the entrance and putting soldiers there to guard it .

NCV	Matthew	28	28	The day after the Sabbath day was the first day of the week . At dawn on the first day , Mary Magdalene and another woman named Mary went to look at the tomb .
NCV	Matthew	28	2	At that time there was a strong earthquake . An angel of the Lord came down from heaven , went to the tomb , and rolled the stone away from the entrance . Then he sat on the stone .
NCV	Matthew	28	3	He was shining as bright as lightning , and his clothes were white as snow .
NCV	Matthew	28	4	The soldiers guarding the tomb shook with fear because of the angel , and they became like dead men .
NCV	Matthew	28	5	The angel said to the women , “ Don ’ t be afraid . I know that you are looking for Jesus , who has been crucified .
NCV	Matthew	28	6	He is not here . He has risen from the dead as he said he would . Come and see the place where his body was .
NCV	Matthew	28	7	And go quickly and tell his followers , ‘ Jesus has risen from the dead . He is going into Galilee ahead of you , and you will see him there. ’ ” Then the angel said , “ Now I have told you. ”
NCV	Matthew	28	8	The women left the tomb quickly . They were afraid , but they were also very happy . They ran to tell Jesus ’ followers what had happened .
NCV	Matthew	28	9	Suddenly , Jesus met them and said , “ Greetings. ” The women came up to him , took hold of his feet , and worshiped him .
NCV	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Go and tell my followers to go on to Galilee , and they will see me there. ” The Soldiers Report to the Leaders
NCV	Matthew	28	11	While the women went to tell Jesus ’ followers , some of the soldiers who had been guarding the tomb went into the city to tell the leading priests everything that had happened .
NCV	Matthew	28	12	Then the priests met with the elders and made a plan . They paid the soldiers a large amount of money
NCV	Matthew	28	13	and said to them , “ Tell the people that Jesus ’ followers came during the night and stole the body while you were asleep .
NCV	Matthew	28	14	If the governor hears about this , we will satisfy him and save you from trouble. ”
NCV	Matthew	28	15	So the soldiers kept the money and did as they were told . And that story is still spread among the people even today . Jesus Talks to His Followers
NCV	Matthew	28	16	The eleven followers went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go .
NCV	Matthew	28	17	On the mountain they saw Jesus and worshiped him , but some of them did not believe it was really Jesus .
NCV	Matthew	28	18	Then Jesus came to them and said , “ All power in heaven and on earth is given to me .
NCV	Matthew	28	19	So go and make followers of all people in the world . Baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit .

NCV	Mark	1	1	This is the beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ , the Son of God , [ a ]
NCV	Mark	1	2	as the prophet Isaiah wrote : “ I will send my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way. ” Malachi 3:1
NCV	Mark	1	3	“ This is a voice of one who calls out in the desert : ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord . Make the road straight for him. ’ ” Isaiah 40:3
NCV	Mark	1	4	John was baptizing people in the desert and preaching a baptism of changed hearts and lives for the forgiveness of sins .
NCV	Mark	1	5	All the people from Judea and Jerusalem were going out to him . They confessed their sins and were baptized by him in the Jordan River .
NCV	Mark	1	6	John wore clothes made from camel ’ s hair , had a leather belt around his waist , and ate locusts and wild honey .
NCV	Mark	1	7	This is what John preached to the people : “ There is one coming after me who is greater than I ; I am not good enough even to kneel down and untie his sandals .
NCV	Mark	1	8	I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. ” Jesus Is Baptized
NCV	Mark	1	9	At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River .
NCV	Mark	1	10	Immediately , as Jesus was coming up out of the water , he saw heaven open . The Holy Spirit came down on him like a dove ,
NCV	Mark	1	11	and a voice came from heaven : “ You are my Son , whom I love , and I am very pleased with you. ”
NCV	Mark	1	12	Then the Spirit sent Jesus into the desert .
NCV	Mark	1	13	He was in the desert forty days and was tempted by Satan . He was with the wild animals , and the angels came and took care of him . Jesus Chooses Some Followers
NCV	Mark	1	14	After John was put in prison , Jesus went into Galilee , preaching the Good News from God .
NCV	Mark	1	15	He said , “ The right time has come . The kingdom of God is near . Change your hearts and lives and believe the Good News ! ”
NCV	Mark	1	16	When Jesus was walking by Lake Galilee , he saw Simon [ b ] and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen .
NCV	Mark	1	17	Jesus said to them , “ Come follow me , and I will make you fish for people. ”
NCV	Mark	1	18	So Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed him .
NCV	Mark	1	19	Going a little farther , Jesus saw two more brothers , James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in a boat , mending their nets .
NCV	Mark	1	20	Jesus immediately called them , and they left their father in the boat with the hired workers and followed Jesus . Jesus Forces Out an Evil Spirit
NCV	Mark	1	21	Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum . On the Sabbath day He went to the synagogue and began to teach .
NCV	Mark	1	22	The people were amazed at his teaching , because he taught like a person who had authority , not like their teachers of the law .
NCV	Mark	1	23	Just then , a man was there in the synagogue who had an evil spirit in him . He shouted ,
NCV	Mark	1	24	“ Jesus of Nazareth ! What do you want with us ? Did you come to destroy us ? I know who you are—God ’ s Holy One ! ”
NCV	Mark	1	25	Jesus commanded the evil spirit , “ Be quiet ! Come out of the man ! ”
NCV	Mark	1	26	The evil spirit shook the man violently , gave a loud cry , and then came out of him .
NCV	Mark	1	27	The people were so amazed they asked each other , “ What is happening here ? This man is teaching something new , and with authority . He even gives commands to evil spirits , and they obey him. ”
NCV	Mark	1	28	And the news about Jesus spread quickly everywhere in the area of Galilee . Jesus Heals Many People
NCV	Mark	1	29	As soon as Jesus and his followers left the synagogue , they went with James and John to the home of Simon [ c ] and Andrew .
NCV	Mark	1	30	Simon ’ s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever , and the people told Jesus about her .
NCV	Mark	1	31	So Jesus went to her bed , took her hand , and helped her up . The fever left her , and she began serving them .
NCV	Mark	1	32	That evening , after the sun went down , the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and had demons in them .
NCV	Mark	1	33	The whole town gathered at the door .
NCV	Mark	1	34	Jesus healed many who had different kinds of sicknesses , and he forced many demons to leave people . But he would not allow the demons to speak , because they knew who he was .
NCV	Mark	1	35	Early the next morning , while it was still dark , Jesus woke and left the house . He went to a lonely place , where he prayed .
NCV	Mark	1	36	Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus .
NCV	Mark	1	37	When they found him , they said , “ Everyone is looking for you ! ”
NCV	Mark	1	38	Jesus answered , “ We should go to other towns around here so I can preach there too . That is the reason I came. ”
NCV	Mark	1	39	So he went everywhere in Galilee , preaching in the synagogues and forcing out demons . Jesus Heals a Sick Man
NCV	Mark	1	40	A man with a skin disease came to Jesus . He fell to his knees and begged Jesus , “ You can heal me if you will. ”
NCV	Mark	1	41	Jesus felt sorry for the man , so he reached out his hand and touched him and said , “ I will . Be healed ! ”
NCV	Mark	1	42	Immediately the disease left the man , and he was healed .
NCV	Mark	1	43	Jesus told the man to go away at once , but he warned him strongly ,
NCV	Mark	1	44	“ Don ’ t tell anyone about this . But go and show yourself to the priest . And offer the gift Moses commanded for people who are made well . [ d ] This will show the people what I have done. ”

NCV	Mark	1	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Mark	2	2	Many people gathered together so that there was no room in the house , not even outside the door . And Jesus was teaching them God ’ s message .
NCV	Mark	2	3	Four people came , carrying a paralyzed man .
NCV	Mark	2	4	Since they could not get to Jesus because of the crowd , they dug a hole in the roof right above where he was speaking . When they got through , they lowered the mat with the paralyzed man on it .
NCV	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw the faith of these people , he said to the paralyzed man , “ Young man , your sins are forgiven. ”
NCV	Mark	2	6	Some of the teachers of the law were sitting there , thinking to themselves ,
NCV	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this man say things like that ? He is speaking as if he were God . Only God can forgive sins. ”
NCV	Mark	2	8	Jesus knew immediately what these teachers of the law were thinking . So he said to them , “ Why are you thinking these things ?
NCV	Mark	2	9	Which is easier : to tell this paralyzed man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to tell him , ‘ Stand up . Take your mat and walk ’ ?
NCV	Mark	2	10	But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man ,
NCV	Mark	2	11	“ I tell you , stand up , take your mat , and go home. ”
NCV	Mark	2	12	Immediately the paralyzed man stood up , took his mat , and walked out while everyone was watching him . The people were amazed and praised God . They said , “ We have never seen anything like this ! ”
NCV	Mark	2	13	Jesus went to the lake again . The whole crowd followed him there , and he taught them .
NCV	Mark	2	14	While he was walking along , he saw a man named Levi son of Alphaeus , sitting in the tax collector ’ s booth . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , ” and he stood up and followed Jesus .
NCV	Mark	2	15	Later , as Jesus was having dinner at Levi ’ s house , many tax collectors and “ sinners ” were eating there with Jesus and his followers . Many people like this followed Jesus .
NCV	Mark	2	16	When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with the tax collectors and “ sinners , ” they asked his followers , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NCV	Mark	2	17	Jesus heard this and said to them , “ It is not the healthy people who need a doctor , but the sick . I did not come to invite good people but to invite sinners. ” Jesus ’ Followers Are Criticized
NCV	Mark	2	18	Now the followers of John [ a ] and the Pharisees often fasted [ b ] for a certain time . Some people came to Jesus and said , “ Why do John ’ s followers and the followers of the Pharisees often fast , but your followers don ’ t ? ”
NCV	Mark	2	19	Jesus answered , “ The friends of the bridegroom do not fast while the bridegroom is still with them . As long as the bridegroom is with them , they can not fast .
NCV	Mark	2	20	But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and then they will fast .
NCV	Mark	2	21	“ No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth over a hole in an old coat . Otherwise , the patch will shrink and pull away—the new patch will pull away from the old coat . Then the hole will be worse .
NCV	Mark	2	22	Also , no one ever pours new wine into old leather bags . Otherwise , the new wine will break the bags , and the wine will be ruined along with the bags . But new wine should be put into new leather bags. ” Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath
NCV	Mark	2	23	One Sabbath day , as Jesus was walking through some fields of grain , his followers began to pick some grain to eat .
NCV	Mark	2	24	The Pharisees said to Jesus , “ Why are your followers doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? ”
NCV	Mark	2	25	Jesus answered , “ Have you never read what David did when he and those with him were hungry and needed food ?
NCV	Mark	2	26	During the time of Abiathar the high priest , David went into God ’ s house and ate the holy bread , which is lawful only for priests to eat . And David also gave some of the bread to those who were with him. ”
NCV	Mark	2	27	Then Jesus said to the Pharisees , “ The Sabbath day was made to help people ; they were not made to be ruled by the Sabbath day .
NCV	Mark	2	28	So then , the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day. ” Footnotes - 2:18 John John the Baptist , who preached to the Jewish people about Christ ’ s coming ( Mark 1:4–8 ) . - 2:18 fasted The people would give up eating for a special time of prayer and worship to God .

NCV	Mark	3	3	Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand , “ Stand up here in the middle of everyone. ”
NCV	Mark	3	2	Some people watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day so they could accuse him .
NCV	Mark	3	4	Then Jesus asked the people , “ Which is lawful on the Sabbath day : to do good or to do evil , to save a life or to kill ? ” But they said nothing to answer him .
NCV	Mark	3	5	Jesus was angry as he looked at the people , and he felt very sad because they were stubborn . Then he said to the man , “ Hold out your hand. ” The man held out his hand and it was healed .
NCV	Mark	3	6	Then the Pharisees left and began making plans with the Herodians [ a ] about a way to kill Jesus . Many People Follow Jesus
NCV	Mark	3	7	Jesus left with his followers for the lake , and a large crowd from Galilee followed him .
NCV	Mark	3	8	Also many people came from Judea , from Jerusalem , from Idumea , from the lands across the Jordan River , and from the area of Tyre and Sidon . When they heard what Jesus was doing , many people came to him .
NCV	Mark	3	9	When Jesus saw the crowds , he told his followers to get a boat ready for him to keep people from crowding against him .
NCV	Mark	3	10	He had healed many people , so all the sick were pushing toward him to touch him .
NCV	Mark	3	11	When evil spirits saw Jesus , they fell down before him and shouted , “ You are the Son of God ! ”
NCV	Mark	3	12	But Jesus strongly warned them not to tell who he was . Jesus Chooses His Twelve Apostles
NCV	Mark	3	13	Then Jesus went up on a mountain and called to him those he wanted , and they came to him .
NCV	Mark	3	14	Jesus chose twelve and called them apostles . [ b ] He wanted them to be with him , and he wanted to send them out to preach
NCV	Mark	3	15	and to have the authority to force demons out of people .
NCV	Mark	3	16	These are the twelve men he chose : Simon ( Jesus named him Peter ) ,
NCV	Mark	3	17	James and John , the sons of Zebedee ( Jesus named them Boanerges , which means “ Sons of Thunder ” ) ,
NCV	Mark	3	18	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Zealot ,
NCV	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot , who later turned against Jesus . Some People Say Jesus Has a Devil
NCV	Mark	3	20	Then Jesus went home , but again a crowd gathered . There were so many people that Jesus and his followers could not eat .
NCV	Mark	3	21	When his family heard this , they went to get him because they thought he was out of his mind .
NCV	Mark	3	22	But the teachers of the law from Jerusalem were saying , “ Beelzebul is living inside him ! He uses power from the ruler of demons to force demons out of people. ”
NCV	Mark	3	23	So Jesus called the people together and taught them with stories . He said , “ Satan will not force himself out of people .
NCV	Mark	3	24	A kingdom that is divided can not continue ,
NCV	Mark	3	25	and a family that is divided can not continue .
NCV	Mark	3	26	And if Satan is against himself and fights against his own people , he can not continue ; that is the end of Satan .
NCV	Mark	3	27	No one can enter a strong person ’ s house and steal his things unless he first ties up the strong person . Then he can steal things from the house .
NCV	Mark	3	28	I tell you the truth , all sins that people do and all the things people say against God can be forgiven .
NCV	Mark	3	29	But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven ; he is guilty of a sin that continues forever. ”
NCV	Mark	3	30	Jesus said this because the teachers of the law said that he had an evil spirit inside him . Jesus ’ True Family
NCV	Mark	3	31	Then Jesus ’ mother and brothers arrived . Standing outside , they sent someone in to tell him to come out .
NCV	Mark	3	32	Many people were sitting around Jesus , and they said to him , “ Your mother and brothers [ c ] are waiting for you outside. ”
NCV	Mark	3	33	Jesus asked , “ Who are my mother and my brothers ? ”
NCV	Mark	3	34	Then he looked at those sitting around him and said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers !

NCV	Mark	4	4	While he was planting , some seed fell by the road , and the birds came and ate it up .
NCV	Mark	4	2	Jesus taught them many things , using stories . He said ,
NCV	Mark	4	3	“ Listen ! A farmer went out to plant his seed .
NCV	Mark	4	5	Some seed fell on rocky ground where there wasn ’ t much dirt . That seed grew very fast , because the ground was not deep .
NCV	Mark	4	6	But when the sun rose , the plants dried up because they did not have deep roots .
NCV	Mark	4	7	Some other seed fell among thorny weeds , which grew and choked the good plants . So those plants did not produce a crop .
NCV	Mark	4	8	Some other seed fell on good ground and began to grow . It got taller and produced a crop . Some plants made thirty times more , some made sixty times more , and some made a hundred times more. ”
NCV	Mark	4	9	Then Jesus said , “ Let those with ears use them and listen ! ” Jesus Tells Why He Used Stories
NCV	Mark	4	10	Later , when Jesus was alone , the twelve apostles and others around him asked him about the stories .
NCV	Mark	4	11	Jesus said , “ You can know the secret about the kingdom of God . But to other people I tell everything by using stories
NCV	Mark	4	12	so that : ‘ They will look and look , but they will not learn . They will listen and listen , but they will not understand . If they did learn and understand , they would come back to me and be forgiven. ’ ” Isaiah 6:9–10 Jesus Explains the Seed Story
NCV	Mark	4	13	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ Don ’ t you understand this story ? If you don ’ t , how will you understand any story ?
NCV	Mark	4	14	The farmer is like a person who plants God ’ s message in people .
NCV	Mark	4	15	Sometimes the teaching falls on the road . This is like the people who hear the teaching of God , but Satan quickly comes and takes away the teaching that was planted in them .
NCV	Mark	4	16	Others are like the seed planted on rocky ground . They hear the teaching and quickly accept it with joy .
NCV	Mark	4	17	But since they don ’ t allow the teaching to go deep into their lives , they keep it only a short time . When trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching they accepted , they quickly give up .
NCV	Mark	4	18	Others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds . They hear the teaching ,
NCV	Mark	4	19	but the worries of this life , the temptation of wealth , and many other evil desires keep the teaching from growing and producing fruit [ a ] in their lives .
NCV	Mark	4	20	Others are like the seed planted in the good ground . They hear the teaching and accept it . Then they grow and produce fruit—sometimes thirty times more , sometimes sixty times more , and sometimes a hundred times more. ” Use What You Have
NCV	Mark	4	21	Then Jesus said to them , “ Do you hide a lamp under a bowl or under a bed ? No ! You put the lamp on a lampstand .
NCV	Mark	4	22	Everything that is hidden will be made clear and every secret thing will be made known .
NCV	Mark	4	23	Let those with ears use them and listen !
NCV	Mark	4	24	“ Think carefully about what you hear . The way you give to others is the way God will give to you , but God will give you even more .
NCV	Mark	4	25	Those who have understanding will be given more . But those who do not have understanding , even what they have will be taken away from them. ” Jesus Uses a Story About Seed
NCV	Mark	4	26	Then Jesus said , “ The kingdom of God is like someone who plants seed in the ground .
NCV	Mark	4	27	Night and day , whether the person is asleep or awake , the seed still grows , but the person does not know how it grows .
NCV	Mark	4	28	By itself the earth produces grain . First the plant grows , then the head , and then all the grain in the head .
NCV	Mark	4	29	When the grain is ready , the farmer cuts it , because this is the harvest time. ” A Story About Mustard Seed
NCV	Mark	4	30	Then Jesus said , “ How can I show you what the kingdom of God is like ? What story can I use to explain it ?
NCV	Mark	4	31	The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed , the smallest seed you plant in the ground .
NCV	Mark	4	32	But when planted , this seed grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants . It produces large branches , and the wild birds can make nests in its shade. ”
NCV	Mark	4	33	Jesus used many stories like these to teach the crowd God ’ s message—as much as they could understand .
NCV	Mark	4	34	He always used stories to teach them . But when he and his followers were alone , Jesus explained everything to them . Jesus Calms a Storm
NCV	Mark	4	35	That evening , Jesus said to his followers , “ Let ’ s go across the lake. ”
NCV	Mark	4	36	Leaving the crowd behind , they took him in the boat just as he was . There were also other boats with them .
NCV	Mark	4	37	A very strong wind came up on the lake . The waves came over the sides and into the boat so that it was already full of water .
NCV	Mark	4	38	Jesus was at the back of the boat , sleeping with his head on a cushion . His followers woke him and said , “ Teacher , don ’ t you care that we are drowning ! ”
NCV	Mark	4	39	Jesus stood up and commanded the wind and said to the waves , “ Quiet ! Be still ! ” Then the wind stopped , and it became completely calm .
NCV	Mark	4	40	Jesus said to his followers , “ Why are you afraid ? Do you still have no faith ? ”
NCV	Mark	4	41	The followers were very afraid and asked each other , “ Who is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! ” Footnotes - 4:19 producing fruit To produce fruit means to have in your life the good things God wants . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Mark	5	5	Day and night he would wander around the burial caves and on the hills , screaming and cutting himself with stones .
NCV	Mark	5	2	When Jesus got out of the boat , instantly a man with an evil spirit came to him from the burial caves .
NCV	Mark	5	3	This man lived in the caves , and no one could tie him up , not even with a chain .
NCV	Mark	5	4	Many times people had used chains to tie the man ’ s hands and feet , but he always broke them off . No one was strong enough to control him .
NCV	Mark	5	6	While Jesus was still far away , the man saw him , ran to him , and fell down before him .
NCV	Mark	5	7	The man shouted in a loud voice , “ What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I command you in God ’ s name not to torture me ! ”
NCV	Mark	5	8	He said this because Jesus was saying to him , “ You evil spirit , come out of the man. ”
NCV	Mark	5	9	Then Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He answered , “ My name is Legion , [ b ] because we are many spirits. ”
NCV	Mark	5	10	He begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of that area .
NCV	Mark	5	11	A large herd of pigs was feeding on a hill near there .
NCV	Mark	5	12	The demons begged Jesus , “ Send us into the pigs ; let us go into them. ”
NCV	Mark	5	13	So Jesus allowed them to do this . The evil spirits left the man and went into the pigs . Then the herd of pigs—about two thousand of them—rushed down the hill into the lake and were drowned .
NCV	Mark	5	14	The herdsmen ran away and went to the town and to the countryside , telling everyone about this . So people went out to see what had happened .
NCV	Mark	5	15	They came to Jesus and saw the man who used to have the many evil spirits , sitting , clothed , and in his right mind . And they were frightened .
NCV	Mark	5	16	The people who saw this told the others what had happened to the man who had the demons living in him , and they told about the pigs .
NCV	Mark	5	17	Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their area .
NCV	Mark	5	18	As Jesus was getting back into the boat , the man who was freed from the demons begged to go with him .
NCV	Mark	5	19	But Jesus would not let him . He said , “ Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you. ”
NCV	Mark	5	20	So the man left and began to tell the people in the Ten Towns [ c ] about what Jesus had done for him . And everyone was amazed . Jesus Gives Life to a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman
NCV	Mark	5	21	When Jesus went in the boat back to the other side of the lake , a large crowd gathered around him there .
NCV	Mark	5	22	A leader of the synagogue , named Jairus , came there , saw Jesus , and fell at his feet .
NCV	Mark	5	23	He begged Jesus , saying again and again , “ My daughter is dying . Please come and put your hands on her so she will be healed and will live. ”
NCV	Mark	5	24	So Jesus went with him . A large crowd followed Jesus and pushed very close around him .
NCV	Mark	5	25	Among them was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years .
NCV	Mark	5	26	She had suffered very much from many doctors and had spent all the money she had , but instead of improving , she was getting worse .
NCV	Mark	5	27	When the woman heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his coat .
NCV	Mark	5	28	She thought , “ If I can just touch his clothes , I will be healed. ”
NCV	Mark	5	29	Instantly her bleeding stopped , and she felt in her body that she was healed from her disease .
NCV	Mark	5	30	At once Jesus felt power go out from him . So he turned around in the crowd and asked , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
NCV	Mark	5	31	His followers said , “ Look at how many people are pushing against you ! And you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
NCV	Mark	5	32	But Jesus continued looking around to see who had touched him .
NCV	Mark	5	33	The woman , knowing that she was healed , came and fell at Jesus ’ feet . Shaking with fear , she told him the whole truth .
NCV	Mark	5	34	Jesus said to her , “ Dear woman , you are made well because you believed . Go in peace ; be healed of your disease. ”
NCV	Mark	5	35	While Jesus was still speaking , some people came from the house of the synagogue leader . They said , “ Your daughter is dead . There is no need to bother the teacher anymore. ”
NCV	Mark	5	36	But Jesus paid no attention to what they said . He told the synagogue leader , “ Don ’ t be afraid ; just believe. ”
NCV	Mark	5	37	Jesus let only Peter , James , and John the brother of James go with him .
NCV	Mark	5	38	When they came to the house of the synagogue leader , Jesus found many people there making lots of noise and crying loudly .
NCV	Mark	5	39	Jesus entered the house and said to them , “ Why are you crying and making so much noise ? The child is not dead , only asleep. ”
NCV	Mark	5	40	But they laughed at him . So , after throwing them out of the house , Jesus took the child ’ s father and mother and his three followers into the room where the child was .
NCV	Mark	5	41	Taking hold of the girl ’ s hand , he said to her , “ Talitha , koum ! ” ( This means , “ Young girl , I tell you to stand up ! ” )
NCV	Mark	5	42	At once the girl stood right up and began walking . ( She was twelve years old . ) Everyone was completely amazed .
NCV	Mark	5	43	Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell people about this . Then he told them to give the girl something to eat .

NCV	Mark	6	6	He was amazed at how many people had no faith . Then Jesus went to other villages in that area and taught .
NCV	Mark	6	2	On the Sabbath day he taught in the synagogue . Many people heard him and were amazed , saying , “ Where did this man get these teachings ? What is this wisdom that has been given to him ? And where did he get the power to do miracles ?
NCV	Mark	6	3	He is just the carpenter , the son of Mary and the brother of James , Joseph , Judas , and Simon . And his sisters are here with us. ” So the people were upset with Jesus .
NCV	Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown and with his own people and in his own home. ”
NCV	Mark	6	5	So Jesus was not able to work any miracles there except to heal a few sick people by putting his hands on them .
NCV	Mark	6	7	He called his twelve followers together and got ready to send them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits .
NCV	Mark	6	8	This is what Jesus commanded them : “ Take nothing for your trip except a walking stick . Take no bread , no bag , and no money in your pockets .
NCV	Mark	6	9	Wear sandals , but take only the clothes you are wearing .
NCV	Mark	6	10	When you enter a house , stay there until you leave that town .
NCV	Mark	6	11	If the people in a certain place refuse to welcome you or listen to you , leave that place . Shake its dust off your feet [ a ] as a warning to them. ” [ b ]
NCV	Mark	6	12	So the followers went out and preached that people should change their hearts and lives .
NCV	Mark	6	13	They forced many demons out and put olive oil on many sick people and healed them . How John the Baptist Was Killed
NCV	Mark	6	14	King Herod heard about Jesus , because he was now well known . Some people said , [ c ] “ He is John the Baptist , who has risen from the dead . That is why he can work these miracles. ”
NCV	Mark	6	15	Others said , “ He is Elijah. ” [ d ] Other people said , “ Jesus is a prophet , like the prophets who lived long ago. ”
NCV	Mark	6	16	When Herod heard this , he said , “ I killed John by cutting off his head . Now he has risen from the dead ! ”

NCV	Mark	6	18	John had been telling Herod , “ It is not lawful for you to be married to your brother ’ s wife. ”
NCV	Mark	6	19	So Herodias hated John and wanted to kill him . But she couldn ’ t ,
NCV	Mark	6	20	because Herod was afraid of John and protected him . He knew John was a good and holy man . Also , though John ’ s preaching always bothered him , he enjoyed listening to John .
NCV	Mark	6	21	Then the perfect time came for Herodias to cause John ’ s death . On Herod ’ s birthday , he gave a dinner party for the most important government leaders , the commanders of his army , and the most important people in Galilee .
NCV	Mark	6	22	When the daughter of Herodias [ e ] came in and danced , she pleased Herod and the people eating with him . So King Herod said to the girl , “ Ask me for anything you want , and I will give it to you. ”
NCV	Mark	6	23	He promised her , “ Anything you ask for I will give to you—up to half of my kingdom. ”
NCV	Mark	6	24	The girl went to her mother and asked , “ What should I ask for ? ” Her mother answered , “ Ask for the head of John the Baptist. ”
NCV	Mark	6	25	At once the girl went back to the king and said to him , “ I want the head of John the Baptist right now on a platter. ”
NCV	Mark	6	26	Although the king was very sad , he had made a promise , and his dinner guests had heard it . So he did not want to refuse what she asked .
NCV	Mark	6	27	Immediately the king sent a soldier to bring John ’ s head . The soldier went and cut off John ’ s head in the prison
NCV	Mark	6	28	and brought it back on a platter . He gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
NCV	Mark	6	29	When John ’ s followers heard this , they came and got John ’ s body and put it in a tomb . More than Five Thousand Fed
NCV	Mark	6	30	The apostles gathered around Jesus and told him about all the things they had done and taught .
NCV	Mark	6	31	Crowds of people were coming and going so that Jesus and his followers did not even have time to eat . He said to them , “ Come away by yourselves , and we will go to a lonely place to get some rest. ”
NCV	Mark	6	32	So they went in a boat by themselves to a lonely place .
NCV	Mark	6	33	But many people saw them leave and recognized them . So from all the towns they ran to the place where Jesus was going , and they got there before him .
NCV	Mark	6	34	When he arrived , he saw a great crowd waiting . He felt sorry for them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . So he began to teach them many things .
NCV	Mark	6	35	When it was late in the day , his followers came to him and said , “ No one lives in this place , and it is already very late .
NCV	Mark	6	36	Send the people away so they can go to the countryside and towns around here to buy themselves something to eat. ”
NCV	Mark	6	37	But Jesus answered , “ You give them something to eat. ” They said to him , “ We would all have to work a month to earn enough money to buy that much bread ! ”
NCV	Mark	6	38	Jesus asked them , “ How many loaves of bread do you have ? Go and see. ” When they found out , they said , “ Five loaves and two fish. ”
NCV	Mark	6	39	Then Jesus told his followers to have the people sit in groups on the green grass .
NCV	Mark	6	40	So they sat in groups of fifty or a hundred .
NCV	Mark	6	41	Jesus took the five loaves and two fish and , looking up to heaven , he thanked God for the food . He divided the bread and gave it to his followers for them to give to the people . Then he divided the two fish among them all .
NCV	Mark	6	42	All the people ate and were satisfied .
NCV	Mark	6	43	The followers filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of bread and fish .
NCV	Mark	6	44	There were five thousand men who ate . Jesus Walks on the Water
NCV	Mark	6	45	Immediately Jesus told his followers to get into the boat and go ahead of him to Bethsaida across the lake . He stayed there to send the people home .
NCV	Mark	6	46	After sending them away , he went into the hills to pray .
NCV	Mark	6	47	That night , the boat was in the middle of the lake , and Jesus was alone on the land .
NCV	Mark	6	48	He saw his followers struggling hard to row the boat , because the wind was blowing against them . Between three and six o ’ clock in the morning , Jesus came to them , walking on the water , and he wanted to walk past the boat .
NCV	Mark	6	49	But when they saw him walking on the water , they thought he was a ghost and cried out .
NCV	Mark	6	50	They all saw him and were afraid . But quickly Jesus spoke to them and said , “ Have courage ! It is I . Do not be afraid. ”
NCV	Mark	6	51	Then he got into the boat with them , and the wind became calm . The followers were greatly amazed .
NCV	Mark	6	52	They did not understand about the miracle of the five loaves , because their minds were closed .
NCV	Mark	6	53	When they had crossed the lake , they came to shore at Gennesaret and tied the boat there .
NCV	Mark	6	54	When they got out of the boat , people immediately recognized Jesus .
NCV	Mark	6	55	They ran everywhere in that area and began to bring sick people on mats wherever they heard he was .

NCV	Mark	6	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Mark	7	7	Their worship of me is worthless . The things they teach are nothing but human rules. ’ Isaiah 29:13
NCV	Mark	7	2	They saw that some of Jesus ’ followers ate food with hands that were not clean , that is , they hadn ’ t washed them .
NCV	Mark	7	3	( The Pharisees and all the Jews never eat before washing their hands in the way required by their unwritten laws .
NCV	Mark	7	4	And when they buy something in the market , they never eat it until they wash themselves in a special way . They also follow many other unwritten laws , such as the washing of cups , pitchers , and pots . [ a ] )
NCV	Mark	7	5	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law said to Jesus , “ Why don ’ t your followers obey the unwritten laws which have been handed down to us ? Why do your followers eat their food with hands that are not clean ? ”
NCV	Mark	7	6	Jesus answered , “ Isaiah was right when he spoke about you hypocrites . He wrote , ‘ These people show honor to me with words , but their hearts are far from me .
NCV	Mark	7	8	You have stopped following the commands of God , and you follow only human teachings. ” [ b ]
NCV	Mark	7	9	Then Jesus said to them , “ You cleverly ignore the commands of God so you can follow your own teachings .
NCV	Mark	7	10	Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ [ c ] and ‘ Anyone who says cruel things to his father or mother must be put to death. ’ [ d ]
NCV	Mark	7	11	But you say a person can tell his father or mother , ‘ I have something I could use to help you , but it is Corban—a gift to God. ’
NCV	Mark	7	12	You no longer let that person use that money for his father or his mother .
NCV	Mark	7	13	By your own rules , which you teach people , you are rejecting what God said . And you do many things like that. ”
NCV	Mark	7	14	After Jesus called the crowd to him again , he said , “ Every person should listen to me and understand what I am saying .
NCV	Mark	7	15	There is nothing people put into their bodies that makes them unclean . People are made unclean by the things that come out of them . [
NCV	Mark	7	16	Let those with ears use them and listen . ] ” [ e ]
NCV	Mark	7	17	When Jesus left the people and went into the house , his followers asked him about this story .
NCV	Mark	7	18	Jesus said , “ Do you still not understand ? Surely you know that nothing that enters someone from the outside can make that person unclean .
NCV	Mark	7	19	It does not go into the mind , but into the stomach . Then it goes out of the body. ” ( When Jesus said this , he meant that no longer was any food unclean for people to eat . )
NCV	Mark	7	20	And Jesus said , “ The things that come out of people are the things that make them unclean .
NCV	Mark	7	21	All these evil things begin inside people , in the mind : evil thoughts , sexual sins , stealing , murder , adultery ,
NCV	Mark	7	22	greed , evil actions , lying , doing sinful things , jealousy , speaking evil of others , pride , and foolish living .
NCV	Mark	7	23	All these evil things come from inside and make people unclean. ” Jesus Helps a Non-Jewish Woman
NCV	Mark	7	24	Jesus left that place and went to the area around Tyre . [ f ] When he went into a house , he did not want anyone to know he was there , but he could not stay hidden .
NCV	Mark	7	25	A woman whose daughter had an evil spirit in her heard that he was there . So she quickly came to Jesus and fell at his feet .
NCV	Mark	7	26	She was Greek , born in Phoenicia , in Syria . She begged Jesus to force the demon out of her daughter .
NCV	Mark	7	27	Jesus told the woman , “ It is not right to take the children ’ s bread and give it to the dogs . First let the children eat all they want. ”
NCV	Mark	7	28	But she answered , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs under the table can eat the children ’ s crumbs. ”
NCV	Mark	7	29	Then Jesus said , “ Because of your answer , you may go . The demon has left your daughter. ”
NCV	Mark	7	30	The woman went home and found her daughter lying in bed ; the demon was gone . Jesus Heals a Deaf Man
NCV	Mark	7	31	Then Jesus left the area around Tyre and went through Sidon to Lake Galilee , to the area of the Ten Towns . [ g ]
NCV	Mark	7	32	While he was there , some people brought a man to him who was deaf and could not talk plainly . The people begged Jesus to put his hand on the man to heal him .
NCV	Mark	7	33	Jesus led the man away from the crowd , by himself . He put his fingers in the man ’ s ears and then spit and touched the man ’ s tongue .
NCV	Mark	7	34	Looking up to heaven , he sighed and said to the man , “ Ephphatha ! ” ( This means , “ Be opened. ” )
NCV	Mark	7	35	Instantly the man was able to hear and to use his tongue so that he spoke clearly .
NCV	Mark	7	36	Jesus commanded the people not to tell anyone about what happened . But the more he commanded them , the more they told about it .
NCV	Mark	7	37	They were completely amazed and said , “ Jesus does everything well . He makes the deaf hear ! And those who can ’ t talk he makes able to speak. ” Footnotes - 7:4 pots Some Greek copies continue , “ and dining couches. ” - 7:8 teachings Some Greek copies continue , “ You wash pitchers and jugs and do many other such things. ” - 7:10 ‘ Honor . . . mother. ’ Quotation from Exodus 20:12 ; Deuteronomy 5:16 . - 7:10 ‘ Anyone . . . death. ’ Quotation from Exodus 21:17 . - 7:16 Let . . . listen .

NCV	Mark	8	8	All the people ate and were satisfied . Then his followers filled seven baskets with the leftover pieces of food .
NCV	Mark	8	2	“ I feel sorry for these people , because they have already been with me for three days , and they have nothing to eat .
NCV	Mark	8	3	If I send them home hungry , they will faint on the way . Some of them live a long way from here. ”
NCV	Mark	8	4	Jesus ’ followers answered , “ How can we get enough bread to feed all these people ? We are far away from any town. ”
NCV	Mark	8	5	Jesus asked , “ How many loaves of bread do you have ? ” They answered , “ Seven. ”
NCV	Mark	8	6	Jesus told the people to sit on the ground . Then he took the seven loaves , gave thanks to God , and divided the bread . He gave the pieces to his followers to give to the people , and they did so .
NCV	Mark	8	7	The followers also had a few small fish . After Jesus gave thanks for the fish , he told his followers to give them to the people also .
NCV	Mark	8	9	There were about four thousand people who ate . After they had eaten , Jesus sent them home .
NCV	Mark	8	10	Then right away he got into a boat with his followers and went to the area of Dalmanutha . The Leaders Ask for a Miracle
NCV	Mark	8	11	The Pharisees came to Jesus and began to ask him questions . Hoping to trap him , they asked Jesus for a miracle from God .
NCV	Mark	8	12	Jesus sighed deeply and said , “ Why do you people ask for a miracle as a sign ? I tell you the truth , no sign will be given to you. ”
NCV	Mark	8	13	Then Jesus left the Pharisees and went in the boat to the other side of the lake . Guard Against Wrong Teachings
NCV	Mark	8	14	His followers had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat ; they had forgotten to bring more .
NCV	Mark	8	15	Jesus warned them , “ Be careful ! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod. ”
NCV	Mark	8	16	His followers discussed the meaning of this , saying , “ He said this because we have no bread. ”

NCV	Mark	8	18	You have eyes , but you don ’ t really see . You have ears , but you don ’ t really listen . Remember when
NCV	Mark	8	19	I divided five loaves of bread for the five thousand ? How many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces of food ? ” They answered , “ Twelve. ”
NCV	Mark	8	20	“ And when I divided seven loaves of bread for the four thousand , how many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces of food ? ” They answered , “ Seven. ”
NCV	Mark	8	21	Then Jesus said to them , “ Don ’ t you understand yet ? ” Jesus Heals a Blind Man
NCV	Mark	8	22	Jesus and his followers came to Bethsaida . There some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch the man .
NCV	Mark	8	23	So Jesus took the blind man ’ s hand and led him out of the village . Then he spit on the man ’ s eyes and put his hands on the man and asked , “ Can you see now ? ”
NCV	Mark	8	24	The man looked up and said , “ Yes , I see people , but they look like trees walking around. ”
NCV	Mark	8	25	Again Jesus put his hands on the man ’ s eyes . Then the man opened his eyes wide and they were healed , and he was able to see everything clearly .
NCV	Mark	8	26	Jesus told him to go home , saying , “ Don ’ t go into the town. ” [ a ] Peter Says Jesus Is the Christ
NCV	Mark	8	27	Jesus and his followers went to the towns around Caesarea Philippi . While they were traveling , Jesus asked them , “ Who do people say I am ? ”
NCV	Mark	8	28	They answered , “ Some say you are John the Baptist . Others say you are Elijah , [ b ] and others say you are one of the prophets. ”
NCV	Mark	8	29	Then Jesus asked , “ But who do you say I am ? ” Peter answered , “ You are the Christ. ”
NCV	Mark	8	30	Jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone who he was .
NCV	Mark	8	31	Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and that he would be rejected by the Jewish elders , the leading priests , and the teachers of the law . He told them that the Son of Man must be killed and then rise from the dead after three days .
NCV	Mark	8	32	Jesus told them plainly what would happen . Then Peter took Jesus aside and began to tell him not to talk like that .
NCV	Mark	8	33	But Jesus turned and looked at his followers . Then he told Peter not to talk that way . He said , “ Go away from me , Satan ! [ c ] You don ’ t care about the things of God , but only about things people think are important. ”
NCV	Mark	8	34	Then Jesus called the crowd to him , along with his followers . He said , “ If people want to follow me , they must give up the things they want . They must be willing even to give up their lives to follow me .
NCV	Mark	8	35	Those who want to save their lives will give up true life . But those who give up their lives for me and for the Good News will have true life .
NCV	Mark	8	36	It is worthless to have the whole world if they lose their souls .
NCV	Mark	8	37	They could never pay enough to buy back their souls .
NCV	Mark	8	38	The people who live now are living in a sinful and evil time . If people are ashamed of me and my teaching , the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes with his Father ’ s glory and with the holy angels. ” Footnotes - 8:26 town Some Greek copies continue , “ Don ’ t even go and tell anyone in the town. ” - 8:28 Elijah A man who spoke for God and who lived hundreds of years before Christ .

NCV	Mark	8	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Mark	9	9	As they were coming down the mountain , Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone about what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
NCV	Mark	9	2	Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John up on a high mountain by themselves . While they watched , Jesus ’ appearance was changed .
NCV	Mark	9	3	His clothes became shining white , whiter than any person could make them .
NCV	Mark	9	4	Then Elijah and Moses [ a ] appeared to them , talking with Jesus .
NCV	Mark	9	5	Peter said to Jesus , “ Teacher , it is good that we are here . Let us make three tents—one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
NCV	Mark	9	6	Peter did not know what to say , because he and the others were so frightened .
NCV	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud came and covered them , and a voice came from the cloud , saying , “ This is my Son , whom I love . Listen to him ! ”
NCV	Mark	9	8	Suddenly Peter , James , and John looked around , but they saw only Jesus there alone with them .
NCV	Mark	9	10	So the followers obeyed Jesus , but they discussed what he meant about rising from the dead .
NCV	Mark	9	11	Then they asked Jesus , “ Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ”
NCV	Mark	9	12	Jesus answered , “ They are right to say that Elijah must come first and make everything the way it should be . But why does the Scripture say that the Son of Man will suffer much and that people will treat him as if he were nothing ?
NCV	Mark	9	13	I tell you that Elijah has already come . And people did to him whatever they wanted to do , just as the Scriptures said it would happen. ” Jesus Heals a Sick Boy
NCV	Mark	9	14	When Jesus , Peter , James , and John came back to the other followers , they saw a great crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them .
NCV	Mark	9	15	But as soon as the crowd saw Jesus , the people were surprised and ran to welcome him .
NCV	Mark	9	16	Jesus asked , “ What are you arguing about ? ”
NCV	Mark	9	17	A man answered , “ Teacher , I brought my son to you . He has an evil spirit in him that stops him from talking .
NCV	Mark	9	18	When the spirit attacks him , it throws him on the ground . Then my son foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes very stiff . I asked your followers to force the evil spirit out , but they couldn ’ t. ”
NCV	Mark	9	19	Jesus answered , “ You people have no faith . How long must I stay with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring the boy to me. ”
NCV	Mark	9	20	So the followers brought him to Jesus . As soon as the evil spirit saw Jesus , it made the boy lose control of himself , and he fell down and rolled on the ground , foaming at the mouth .
NCV	Mark	9	21	Jesus asked the boy ’ s father , “ How long has this been happening ? ” The father answered , “ Since he was very young .
NCV	Mark	9	22	The spirit often throws him into a fire or into water to kill him . If you can do anything for him , please have pity on us and help us. ”
NCV	Mark	9	23	Jesus said to the father , “ You said , ‘ If you can ! ’ All things are possible for the one who believes. ”
NCV	Mark	9	24	Immediately the father cried out , “ I do believe ! Help me to believe more ! ”
NCV	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering , he ordered the evil spirit , saying , “ You spirit that makes people unable to hear or speak , I command you to come out of this boy and never enter him again ! ”
NCV	Mark	9	26	The evil spirit screamed and caused the boy to fall on the ground again . Then the spirit came out . The boy looked as if he were dead , and many people said , “ He is dead ! ”
NCV	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took hold of the boy ’ s hand and helped him to stand up .
NCV	Mark	9	28	When Jesus went into the house , his followers began asking him privately , “ Why couldn ’ t we force that evil spirit out ? ”
NCV	Mark	9	29	Jesus answered , “ That kind of spirit can only be forced out by prayer. ” [ b ] Jesus Talks About His Death
NCV	Mark	9	30	Then Jesus and his followers left that place and went through Galilee . He didn ’ t want anyone to know where he was ,
NCV	Mark	9	31	because he was teaching his followers . He said to them , “ The Son of Man will be handed over to people , and they will kill him . After three days , he will rise from the dead. ”
NCV	Mark	9	32	But the followers did not understand what Jesus meant , and they were afraid to ask him . Who Is the Greatest ?
NCV	Mark	9	33	Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum . When they went into a house there , he asked them , “ What were you arguing about on the road ? ”
NCV	Mark	9	34	But the followers did not answer , because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest .
NCV	Mark	9	35	Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him . He said , “ Whoever wants to be the most important must be last of all and servant of all. ”
NCV	Mark	9	36	Then Jesus took a small child and had him stand among them . Taking the child in his arms , he said ,
NCV	Mark	9	37	“ Whoever accepts a child like this in my name accepts me . And whoever accepts me accepts the One who sent me. ” Anyone Not Against Us Is for Us
NCV	Mark	9	38	Then John said , “ Teacher , we saw someone using your name to force demons out of a person . We told him to stop , because he does not belong to our group. ”
NCV	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , “ Don ’ t stop him , because anyone who uses my name to do powerful things will not easily say evil things about me .
NCV	Mark	9	40	Whoever is not against us is with us .
NCV	Mark	9	41	I tell you the truth , whoever gives you a drink of water because you belong to the Christ will truly get his reward .
NCV	Mark	9	42	“ If one of these little children believes in me , and someone causes that child to sin , it would be better for that person to have a large stone tied around his neck and be drowned in the sea .
NCV	Mark	9	43	If your hand causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to lose part of your body and live forever than to have two hands and go to hell , where the fire never goes out . [
NCV	Mark	9	44	In hell the worm does not die ; the fire is never put out . ] [ c ]
NCV	Mark	9	45	If your foot causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to lose part of your body and to live forever than to have two feet and be thrown into hell . [
NCV	Mark	9	46	In hell the worm does not die ; the fire is never put out . ] [ d ]
NCV	Mark	9	47	If your eye causes you to sin , take it out . It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell .
NCV	Mark	9	48	In hell the worm does not die ; the fire is never put out .
NCV	Mark	9	49	Every person will be salted with fire .
NCV	Mark	9	50	“ Salt is good , but if the salt loses its salty taste , you can not make it salty again . So , be full of salt , and have peace with each other. ” Footnotes - 9:4 Elijah and Moses Two of the most important Jewish leaders in the past .

NCV	Mark	10	10	Later , in the house , his followers asked Jesus again about the question of divorce .
NCV	Mark	10	2	Some Pharisees came to Jesus and tried to trick him . They asked , “ Is it right for a man to divorce his wife ? ”
NCV	Mark	10	3	Jesus answered , “ What did Moses command you to do ? ”
NCV	Mark	10	4	They said , “ Moses allowed a man to write out divorce papers and send her away. ” [ a ]
NCV	Mark	10	5	Jesus said , “ Moses wrote that command for you because you were stubborn .
NCV	Mark	10	6	But when God made the world , ‘ he made them male and female. ’ [ b ]
NCV	Mark	10	7	‘ So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife , [ c ]
NCV	Mark	10	8	and the two will become one body. ’ [ d ] So there are not two , but one .
NCV	Mark	10	9	God has joined the two together , so no one should separate them. ”
NCV	Mark	10	11	He answered , “ Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery against her .
NCV	Mark	10	12	And the woman who divorces her husband and marries another man is also guilty of adultery. ” Jesus Accepts Children
NCV	Mark	10	13	Some people brought their little children to Jesus so he could touch them , but his followers told them to stop .
NCV	Mark	10	14	When Jesus saw this , he was upset and said to them , “ Let the little children come to me . Don ’ t stop them , because the kingdom of God belongs to people who are like these children .
NCV	Mark	10	15	I tell you the truth , you must accept the kingdom of God as if you were a little child , or you will never enter it. ”
NCV	Mark	10	16	Then Jesus took the children in his arms , put his hands on them , and blessed them . A Rich Young Man ’ s Question
NCV	Mark	10	17	As Jesus started to leave , a man ran to him and fell on his knees before Jesus . The man asked , “ Good teacher , what must I do to have life forever ? ”
NCV	Mark	10	18	Jesus answered , “ Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
NCV	Mark	10	19	You know the commands : ‘ You must not murder anyone . You must not be guilty of adultery . You must not steal . You must not tell lies about your neighbor . You must not cheat . Honor your father and mother. ’ ” [ e ]
NCV	Mark	10	20	The man said , “ Teacher , I have obeyed all these things since I was a boy. ”
NCV	Mark	10	21	Jesus , looking at the man , loved him and said , “ There is one more thing you need to do . Go and sell everything you have , and give the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me. ”
NCV	Mark	10	22	He was very sad to hear Jesus say this , and he left sorrowfully , because he was rich .
NCV	Mark	10	23	Then Jesus looked at his followers and said , “ How hard it will be for the rich to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
NCV	Mark	10	24	The followers were amazed at what Jesus said . But he said again , “ My children , it is very hard [ f ] to enter the kingdom of God !
NCV	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NCV	Mark	10	26	The followers were even more surprised and said to each other , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NCV	Mark	10	27	Jesus looked at them and said , “ For people this is impossible , but for God all things are possible. ”
NCV	Mark	10	28	Peter said to Jesus , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you. ”
NCV	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , all those who have left houses , brothers , sisters , mother , father , children , or farms for me and for the Good News
NCV	Mark	10	30	will get more than they left . Here in this world they will have a hundred times more homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and fields . And with those things , they will also suffer for their belief . But in this age they will have life forever .
NCV	Mark	10	31	Many who are first now will be last in the future . And many who are last now will be first in the future. ” Jesus Talks About His Death
NCV	Mark	10	32	As Jesus and the people with him were on the road to Jerusalem , he was leading the way . His followers were amazed , but others in the crowd who followed were afraid . Again Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and began to tell them what was about to happen in Jerusalem .
NCV	Mark	10	33	He said , “ Look , we are going to Jerusalem . The Son of Man will be turned over to the leading priests and the teachers of the law . They will say that he must die , and they will turn him over to the non-Jewish people ,
NCV	Mark	10	34	who will laugh at him and spit on him . They will beat him with whips and crucify him . But on the third day , he will rise to life again. ” Two Followers Ask Jesus a Favor
NCV	Mark	10	35	Then James and John , sons of Zebedee , came to Jesus and said , “ Teacher , we want to ask you to do something for us. ”
NCV	Mark	10	36	Jesus asked , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
NCV	Mark	10	37	They answered , “ Let one of us sit at your right side and one of us sit at your left side in your glory in your kingdom. ”
NCV	Mark	10	38	Jesus said , “ You don ’ t understand what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I must drink ? And can you be baptized with the same kind of baptism that I must go through ? ” [ g ]
NCV	Mark	10	39	They answered , “ Yes , we can. ” Jesus said to them , “ You will drink the same cup that I will drink , and you will be baptized with the same baptism that I must go through .
NCV	Mark	10	40	But I can not choose who will sit at my right or my left ; those places belong to those for whom they have been prepared. ”
NCV	Mark	10	41	When the other ten followers heard this , they began to be angry with James and John .
NCV	Mark	10	42	Jesus called them together and said , “ The other nations have rulers . You know that those rulers love to show their power over the people , and their important leaders love to use all their authority .
NCV	Mark	10	43	But it should not be that way among you . Whoever wants to become great among you must serve the rest of you like a servant .
NCV	Mark	10	44	Whoever wants to become the first among you must serve all of you like a slave .
NCV	Mark	10	45	In the same way , the Son of Man did not come to be served . He came to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many people. ” Jesus Heals a Blind Man
NCV	Mark	10	46	Then they came to the town of Jericho . As Jesus was leaving there with his followers and a great many people , a blind beggar named Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting by the road .
NCV	Mark	10	47	When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth was walking by , he began to shout , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NCV	Mark	10	48	Many people warned the blind man to be quiet , but he shouted even more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NCV	Mark	10	49	Jesus stopped and said , “ Tell the man to come here. ” So they called the blind man , saying , “ Cheer up ! Get to your feet . Jesus is calling you. ”
NCV	Mark	10	50	The blind man jumped up , left his coat there , and went to Jesus .
NCV	Mark	10	51	Jesus asked him , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man answered , “ Teacher , I want to see. ”
NCV	Mark	10	52	Jesus said , “ Go , you are healed because you believed. ” At once the man could see , and he followed Jesus on the road .

NCV	Mark	11	11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple . After he had looked at everything , since it was already late , he went out to Bethany with the twelve apostles .
NCV	Mark	11	2	and said to them , “ Go to the town you can see there . When you enter it , you will quickly find a colt tied , which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here to me .
NCV	Mark	11	3	If anyone asks you why you are doing this , tell him its Master needs the colt , and he will send it at once. ”
NCV	Mark	11	4	The followers went into the town , found a colt tied in the street near the door of a house , and untied it .
NCV	Mark	11	5	Some people were standing there and asked , “ What are you doing ? Why are you untying that colt ? ”
NCV	Mark	11	6	The followers answered the way Jesus told them to answer , and the people let them take the colt .
NCV	Mark	11	7	They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it , and Jesus sat on it .
NCV	Mark	11	8	Many people spread their coats on the road . Others cut branches in the fields and spread them on the road .
NCV	Mark	11	9	The people were walking ahead of Jesus and behind him , shouting , “ Praise God ! God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord ! Psalm 118:26
NCV	Mark	11	10	God bless the kingdom of our father David ! That kingdom is coming ! Praise [ a ] to God in heaven ! ”
NCV	Mark	11	12	The next day as Jesus was leaving Bethany , he became hungry .
NCV	Mark	11	13	Seeing a fig tree in leaf from far away , he went to see if it had any figs on it . But he found no figs , only leaves , because it was not the right season for figs .
NCV	Mark	11	14	So Jesus said to the tree , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again. ” And Jesus ’ followers heard him say this . Jesus Goes to the Temple
NCV	Mark	11	15	When Jesus returned to Jerusalem , he went into the Temple and began to throw out those who were buying and selling there . He turned over the tables of those who were exchanging different kinds of money , and he upset the benches of those who were selling doves .
NCV	Mark	11	16	Jesus refused to allow anyone to carry goods through the Temple courts .
NCV	Mark	11	17	Then he taught the people , saying , “ It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ My Temple will be called a house for prayer for people from all nations. ’ [ b ] But you are changing God ’ s house into a ‘ hideout for robbers. ’ ” [ c ]
NCV	Mark	11	18	The leading priests and the teachers of the law heard all this and began trying to find a way to kill Jesus . They were afraid of him , because all the people were amazed at his teaching .
NCV	Mark	11	19	That evening , Jesus and his followers [ d ] left the city . The Power of Faith
NCV	Mark	11	20	The next morning as Jesus was passing by with his followers , they saw the fig tree dry and dead , even to the roots .
NCV	Mark	11	21	Peter remembered the tree and said to Jesus , “ Teacher , look ! The fig tree you cursed is dry and dead ! ”
NCV	Mark	11	22	Jesus answered , “ Have faith in God .
NCV	Mark	11	23	I tell you the truth , you can say to this mountain , ‘ Go , fall into the sea. ’ And if you have no doubts in your mind and believe that what you say will happen , God will do it for you .
NCV	Mark	11	24	So I tell you to believe that you have received the things you ask for in prayer , and God will give them to you .
NCV	Mark	11	25	When you are praying , if you are angry with someone , forgive him so that your Father in heaven will also forgive your sins . [
NCV	Mark	11	26	But if you don ’ t forgive other people , then your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins . ] ” [ e ] Leaders Doubt Jesus ’ Authority
NCV	Mark	11	27	Jesus and his followers went again to Jerusalem . As Jesus was walking in the Temple , the leading priests , the teachers of the law , and the elders came to him .
NCV	Mark	11	28	They said to him , “ What authority do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
NCV	Mark	11	29	Jesus answered , “ I will ask you one question . If you answer me , I will tell you what authority I have to do these things .
NCV	Mark	11	30	Tell me : When John baptized people , was that authority from God or just from other people ? ”
NCV	Mark	11	31	They argued about Jesus ’ question , saying , “ If we answer , ‘ John ’ s baptism was from God , ’ Jesus will say , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
NCV	Mark	11	32	But if we say , ‘ It was from other people , ’ the crowd will be against us. ” ( These leaders were afraid of the people , because all the people believed that John was a prophet . )
NCV	Mark	11	33	So they answered Jesus , “ We don ’ t know. ” Jesus said to them , “ Then I won ’ t tell you what authority I have to do these things. ” Footnotes - 11:10 Praise Literally , “ Hosanna , ” a Hebrew word used at first in praying to God for help , but at this time it was probably a shout of joy used in praising God or his Messiah . - 11:17 ‘ My Temple . . . nations. ’ Quotation from Isaiah 56:7 . - 11:17 ‘ hideout for robbers ’ Quotation from Jeremiah 7:11 . - 11:19 his followers Some Greek copies mention only Jesus here . - 11:26 But . . . sins .

NCV	Mark	12	12	The Jewish leaders knew that the story was about them . So they wanted to find a way to arrest Jesus , but they were afraid of the people . So the leaders left him and went away . Is It Right to Pay Taxes or Not ?
NCV	Mark	12	2	When it was time for the grapes to be picked , he sent a servant to the farmers to get his share of the grapes .
NCV	Mark	12	3	But the farmers grabbed the servant and beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
NCV	Mark	12	4	Then the man sent another servant . They hit him on the head and showed no respect for him .
NCV	Mark	12	5	So the man sent another servant , whom they killed . The man sent many other servants ; the farmers beat some of them and killed others .
NCV	Mark	12	6	“ The man had one person left to send , his son whom he loved . He sent him last of all , saying , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
NCV	Mark	12	7	“ But the farmers said to each other , ‘ This son will inherit the vineyard . If we kill him , it will be ours. ’
NCV	Mark	12	8	So they took the son , killed him , and threw him out of the vineyard .
NCV	Mark	12	9	“ So what will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and kill those farmers and will give the vineyard to other farmers .
NCV	Mark	12	10	Surely you have read this Scripture : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone .
NCV	Mark	12	11	The Lord did this , and it is wonderful to us. ’ ” Psalm 118:22–23
NCV	Mark	12	13	Later , the Jewish leaders sent some Pharisees and Herodians [ a ] to Jesus to trap him in saying something wrong .
NCV	Mark	12	14	They came to him and said , “ Teacher , we know that you are an honest man . You are not afraid of what other people think about you , because you pay no attention to who they are . And you teach the truth about God ’ s way . Tell us : Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ?
NCV	Mark	12	15	Should we pay them , or not ? ” But knowing what these men were really trying to do , Jesus said to them , “ Why are you trying to trap me ? Bring me a coin to look at. ”
NCV	Mark	12	16	They gave Jesus a coin , and he asked , “ Whose image and name are on the coin ? ” They answered , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NCV	Mark	12	17	Then Jesus said to them , “ Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and give to God the things that are God ’ s. ” The men were amazed at what Jesus said . Some Sadducees Try to Trick Jesus
NCV	Mark	12	18	Then some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question . ( Sadducees believed that people would not rise from the dead . )
NCV	Mark	12	19	They said , “ Teacher , Moses wrote that if a man ’ s brother dies , leaving a wife but no children , then that man must marry the widow and have children for his brother .
NCV	Mark	12	20	Once there were seven brothers . The first brother married and died , leaving no children .
NCV	Mark	12	21	So the second brother married the widow , but he also died and had no children . The same thing happened with the third brother .
NCV	Mark	12	22	All seven brothers married her and died , and none of the brothers had any children . Finally the woman died too .
NCV	Mark	12	23	Since all seven brothers had married her , when people rise from the dead , whose wife will she be ? ”
NCV	Mark	12	24	Jesus answered , “ Why don ’ t you understand ? Don ’ t you know what the Scriptures say , and don ’ t you know about the power of God ?
NCV	Mark	12	25	When people rise from the dead , they will not marry , nor will they be given to someone to marry . They will be like the angels in heaven .
NCV	Mark	12	26	Surely you have read what God said about people rising from the dead . In the book in which Moses wrote about the burning bush , [ b ] it says that God told Moses , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ’ [ c ]
NCV	Mark	12	27	God is the God of the living , not the dead . You Sadducees are wrong ! ” The Most Important Command
NCV	Mark	12	28	One of the teachers of the law came and heard Jesus arguing with the Sadducees . Seeing that Jesus gave good answers to their questions , he asked Jesus , “ Which of the commands is most important ? ”
NCV	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , “ The most important command is this : ‘ Listen , people of Israel ! The Lord our God is the only Lord .
NCV	Mark	12	30	Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , all your mind , and all your strength. ’ [ d ]
NCV	Mark	12	31	The second command is this : ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ’ [ e ] There are no commands more important than these. ”
NCV	Mark	12	32	The man answered , “ That was a good answer , Teacher . You were right when you said God is the only Lord and there is no other God besides him .
NCV	Mark	12	33	One must love God with all his heart , all his mind , and all his strength . And one must love his neighbor as he loves himself . These commands are more important than all the animals and sacrifices we offer to God. ”
NCV	Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that the man answered him wisely , Jesus said to him , “ You are close to the kingdom of God. ” And after that , no one was brave enough to ask Jesus any more questions .
NCV	Mark	12	35	As Jesus was teaching in the Temple , he asked , “ Why do the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David ?
NCV	Mark	12	36	David himself , speaking by the Holy Spirit , said : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit by me at my right side , until I put your enemies under your control. ” ’ Psalm 110:1
NCV	Mark	12	37	David himself calls the Christ ‘ Lord , ’ so how can the Christ be his son ? ” The large crowd listened to Jesus with pleasure .
NCV	Mark	12	38	Jesus continued teaching and said , “ Beware of the teachers of the law . They like to walk around wearing fancy clothes , and they love for people to greet them with respect in the marketplaces .
NCV	Mark	12	39	They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and at feasts .
NCV	Mark	12	40	But they cheat widows and steal their houses and then try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers . They will receive a greater punishment. ” True Giving
NCV	Mark	12	41	Jesus sat near the Temple money box and watched the people put in their money . Many rich people gave large sums of money .
NCV	Mark	12	42	Then a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins , which were only worth a few cents .
NCV	Mark	12	43	Calling his followers to him , Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow gave more than all those rich people .
NCV	Mark	12	44	They gave only what they did not need . This woman is very poor , but she gave all she had ; she gave all she had to live on. ” Footnotes - 12:13 Herodians A political group that followed Herod and his family . - 12:26 burning bush Read Exodus 3:1–12 in the Old Testament . - 12:26 ‘ I am . . .

NCV	Mark	13	13	All people will hate you because you follow me , but those people who keep their faith until the end will be saved .
NCV	Mark	13	2	Jesus said , “ Do you see all these great buildings ? Not one stone will be left on another . Every stone will be thrown down to the ground. ”
NCV	Mark	13	3	Later , as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , opposite the Temple , he was alone with Peter , James , John , and Andrew . They asked Jesus ,
NCV	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that they are going to happen ? ”
NCV	Mark	13	5	Jesus began to answer them , “ Be careful that no one fools you .
NCV	Mark	13	6	Many people will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the One , ’ and they will fool many people .
NCV	Mark	13	7	When you hear about wars and stories of wars that are coming , don ’ t be afraid . These things must happen before the end comes .
NCV	Mark	13	8	Nations will fight against other nations , and kingdoms against other kingdoms . There will be earthquakes in different places , and there will be times when there is no food for people to eat . These things are like the first pains when something new is about to be born .
NCV	Mark	13	9	“ You must be careful . People will arrest you and take you to court and beat you in their synagogues . You will be forced to stand before kings and governors , to tell them about me . This will happen to you because you follow me .
NCV	Mark	13	10	But before these things happen , the Good News must be told to all people .
NCV	Mark	13	11	When you are arrested and judged , don ’ t worry ahead of time about what you should say . Say whatever is given you to say at that time , because it will not really be you speaking ; it will be the Holy Spirit .
NCV	Mark	13	12	“ Brothers will give their own brothers to be killed , and fathers will give their own children to be killed . Children will fight against their own parents and cause them to be put to death .
NCV	Mark	13	14	“ You will see ‘ a blasphemous object that brings destruction ’ [ a ] standing where it should not be. ” ( You who read this should understand what it means . ) “ At that time , the people in Judea should run away to the mountains .
NCV	Mark	13	15	If people are on the roofs [ b ] of their houses , they must not go down or go inside to get anything out of their houses .
NCV	Mark	13	16	If people are in the fields , they must not go back to get their coats .
NCV	Mark	13	17	At that time , how terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or have nursing babies !
NCV	Mark	13	18	Pray that these things will not happen in winter ,
NCV	Mark	13	19	because those days will be full of trouble . There will be more trouble than there has ever been since the beginning , when God made the world , until now , and nothing as bad will ever happen again .
NCV	Mark	13	20	God has decided to make that terrible time short . Otherwise , no one would go on living . But God will make that time short to help the people he has chosen .
NCV	Mark	13	21	At that time , someone might say to you , ‘ Look , there is the Christ ! ’ Or another person might say , ‘ There he is ! ’ But don ’ t believe them .
NCV	Mark	13	22	False Christs and false prophets will come and perform great wonders and miracles . They will try to fool even the people God has chosen , if that is possible .
NCV	Mark	13	23	So be careful . I have warned you about all this before it happens .
NCV	Mark	13	24	“ During the days after this trouble comes , ‘ the sun will grow dark , and the moon will not give its light .
NCV	Mark	13	25	The stars will fall from the sky . And the powers of the heavens will be shaken. ’ Isaiah 13:10 ; 34:4
NCV	Mark	13	26	“ Then people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
NCV	Mark	13	27	Then he will send his angels all around the earth to gather his chosen people from every part of the earth and from every part of heaven .
NCV	Mark	13	28	“ Learn a lesson from the fig tree : When its branches become green and soft and new leaves appear , you know summer is near .
NCV	Mark	13	29	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you will know that the time is near , ready to come .
NCV	Mark	13	30	I tell you the truth , all these things will happen while the people of this time are still living .
NCV	Mark	13	31	Earth and sky will be destroyed , but the words I have said will never be destroyed .
NCV	Mark	13	32	“ No one knows when that day or time will be , not the angels in heaven , not even the Son . Only the Father knows .
NCV	Mark	13	33	Be careful ! Always be ready , [ c ] because you don ’ t know when that time will be .
NCV	Mark	13	34	It is like a man who goes on a trip . He leaves his house and lets his servants take care of it , giving each one a special job to do . The man tells the servant guarding the door always to be watchful .
NCV	Mark	13	35	So always be ready , because you don ’ t know when the owner of the house will come back . It might be in the evening , or at midnight , or in the morning while it is still dark , or when the sun rises .
NCV	Mark	13	36	Always be ready . Otherwise he might come back suddenly and find you sleeping .
NCV	Mark	13	37	I tell you this , and I say this to everyone : ‘ Be ready ! ’ ” Footnotes - 13:14 ‘ a blasphemous object that brings destruction ’ Mentioned in Daniel 9:27 ; 12:11 ( cf .

NCV	Mark	14	14	When he goes into a house , tell the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says : “ Where is my guest room in which I can eat the Passover meal with my followers ? ” ’
NCV	Mark	14	2	But they said , “ We must not do it during the feast , because the people might cause a riot. ” A Woman with Perfume for Jesus
NCV	Mark	14	3	Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon , who had a skin disease . While Jesus was eating there , a woman approached him with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume , made of pure nard . She opened the jar and poured the perfume on Jesus ’ head .
NCV	Mark	14	4	Some who were there became upset and said to each other , “ Why waste that perfume ?
NCV	Mark	14	5	It was worth a full year ’ s work . It could have been sold and the money given to the poor. ” And they got very angry with the woman .
NCV	Mark	14	6	Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . Why are you troubling her ? She did an excellent thing for me .
NCV	Mark	14	7	You will always have the poor with you , and you can help them anytime you want . But you will not always have me .
NCV	Mark	14	8	This woman did the only thing she could do for me ; she poured perfume on my body to prepare me for burial .
NCV	Mark	14	9	I tell you the truth , wherever the Good News is preached in all the world , what this woman has done will be told , and people will remember her. ” Judas Becomes an Enemy of Jesus
NCV	Mark	14	10	One of the twelve apostles , Judas Iscariot , went to talk to the leading priests to offer to hand Jesus over to them .
NCV	Mark	14	11	These priests were pleased about this and promised to pay Judas money . So he watched for the best time to turn Jesus in . Jesus Eats the Passover Meal
NCV	Mark	14	12	It was now the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb was sacrificed . Jesus ’ followers said to him , “ Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? ”
NCV	Mark	14	13	Jesus sent two of his followers and said to them , “ Go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him .
NCV	Mark	14	15	The owner will show you a large room upstairs that is furnished and ready . Prepare the food for us there. ”
NCV	Mark	14	16	So the followers left and went into the city . Everything happened as Jesus had said , so they prepared the Passover meal .
NCV	Mark	14	17	In the evening , Jesus went to that house with the twelve .
NCV	Mark	14	18	While they were all eating , Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , one of you will turn against me—one of you eating with me now. ”
NCV	Mark	14	19	The followers were very sad to hear this . Each one began to say to Jesus , “ I am not the one , am I ? ”
NCV	Mark	14	20	Jesus answered , “ It is one of the twelve—the one who dips his bread into the bowl with me .
NCV	Mark	14	21	The Son of Man will die , just as the Scriptures say . But how terrible it will be for the person who hands the Son of Man over to be killed . It would be better for him if he had never been born. ” The Lord ’ s Supper
NCV	Mark	14	22	While they were eating , Jesus took some bread and thanked God for it and broke it . Then he gave it to his followers and said , “ Take it ; this is my body. ”
NCV	Mark	14	23	Then Jesus took a cup and thanked God for it and gave it to the followers , and they all drank from the cup .
NCV	Mark	14	24	Then Jesus said , “ This is my blood which is the new [ a ] agreement that God makes with his people . This blood is poured out for many .
NCV	Mark	14	25	I tell you the truth , I will not drink of this fruit of the vine [ b ] again until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. ”
NCV	Mark	14	26	After singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives . Jesus ’ Followers Will Leave Him
NCV	Mark	14	27	Then Jesus told the followers , “ You will all stumble in your faith , because it is written in the Scriptures : ‘ I will kill the shepherd , and the sheep will scatter. ’ Zechariah 13:7
NCV	Mark	14	28	But after I rise from the dead , I will go ahead of you into Galilee. ”
NCV	Mark	14	29	Peter said , “ Everyone else may stumble in their faith , but I will not. ”
NCV	Mark	14	30	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , tonight before the rooster crows twice you will say three times you don ’ t know me. ”
NCV	Mark	14	31	But Peter insisted , “ I will never say that I don ’ t know you ! I will even die with you ! ” And all the other followers said the same thing . Jesus Prays Alone
NCV	Mark	14	32	Jesus and his followers went to a place called Gethsemane . He said to them , “ Sit here while I pray. ”
NCV	Mark	14	33	Jesus took Peter , James , and John with him , and he began to be very sad and troubled .
NCV	Mark	14	34	He said to them , “ My heart is full of sorrow , to the point of death . Stay here and watch. ”
NCV	Mark	14	35	After walking a little farther away from them , Jesus fell to the ground and prayed that , if possible , he would not have this time of suffering .
NCV	Mark	14	36	He prayed , “ Abba , [ c ] Father ! You can do all things . Take away this cup [ d ] of suffering . But do what you want , not what I want. ”
NCV	Mark	14	37	Then Jesus went back to his followers and found them asleep . He said to Peter , “ Simon , are you sleeping ? Couldn ’ t you stay awake with me for one hour ?
NCV	Mark	14	38	Stay awake and pray for strength against temptation . The spirit wants to do what is right , but the body is weak. ”
NCV	Mark	14	39	Again Jesus went away and prayed the same thing .
NCV	Mark	14	40	Then he went back to his followers , and again he found them asleep , because their eyes were very heavy . And they did not know what to say to him .
NCV	Mark	14	41	After Jesus prayed a third time , he went back to his followers and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? That ’ s enough . The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinful people .
NCV	Mark	14	42	Get up , we must go . Look , here comes the man who has turned against me. ” Jesus Is Arrested
NCV	Mark	14	43	At once , while Jesus was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve apostles , came up . With him were many people carrying swords and clubs who had been sent from the leading priests , the teachers of the law , and the Jewish elders .
NCV	Mark	14	44	Judas had planned a signal for them , saying , “ The man I kiss is Jesus . Arrest him and guard him while you lead him away. ”
NCV	Mark	14	45	So Judas went straight to Jesus and said , “ Teacher ! ” and kissed him .
NCV	Mark	14	46	Then the people grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
NCV	Mark	14	47	One of his followers standing nearby pulled out his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
NCV	Mark	14	48	Then Jesus said , “ You came to get me with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal .
NCV	Mark	14	49	Every day I was with you teaching in the Temple , and you did not arrest me there . But all these things have happened to make the Scriptures come true. ”
NCV	Mark	14	50	Then all of Jesus ’ followers left him and ran away .
NCV	Mark	14	51	A young man , wearing only a linen cloth , was following Jesus , and the people also grabbed him .
NCV	Mark	14	52	But the cloth he was wearing came off , and he ran away naked . Jesus Before the Leaders
NCV	Mark	14	53	The people who arrested Jesus led him to the house of the high priest , where all the leading priests , the elders , and the teachers of the law were gathered .
NCV	Mark	14	54	Peter followed far behind and entered the courtyard of the high priest ’ s house . There he sat with the guards , warming himself by the fire .
NCV	Mark	14	55	The leading priests and the whole Jewish council tried to find something that Jesus had done wrong so they could kill him . But the council could find no proof of anything .
NCV	Mark	14	56	Many people came and told false things about him , but all said different things—none of them agreed .
NCV	Mark	14	57	Then some people stood up and lied about Jesus , saying ,
NCV	Mark	14	58	“ We heard this man say , ‘ I will destroy this Temple that people made . And three days later , I will build another Temple not made by people. ’ ”
NCV	Mark	14	59	But even the things these people said did not agree .
NCV	Mark	14	60	Then the high priest stood before them and asked Jesus , “ Aren ’ t you going to answer ? Don ’ t you have something to say about their charges against you ? ”
NCV	Mark	14	61	But Jesus said nothing ; he did not answer . The high priest asked Jesus another question : “ Are you the Christ , the Son of the blessed God ? ”
NCV	Mark	14	62	Jesus answered , “ I am . And in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God , the Powerful One , and coming on clouds in the sky. ”
NCV	Mark	14	63	When the high priest heard this , he tore his clothes and said , “ We don ’ t need any more witnesses !
NCV	Mark	14	64	You all heard him say these things against God . What do you think ? ” They all said that Jesus was guilty and should die .
NCV	Mark	14	65	Some of the people there began to spit at Jesus . They blindfolded him and beat him with their fists and said , “ Prove you are a prophet ! ” Then the guards led Jesus away and beat him . Peter Says He Doesn ’ t Know Jesus
NCV	Mark	14	66	While Peter was in the courtyard , a servant girl of the high priest came there .
NCV	Mark	14	67	She saw Peter warming himself at the fire and looked closely at him . Then she said , “ You also were with Jesus , that man from Nazareth. ”
NCV	Mark	14	68	But Peter said that he was never with Jesus . He said , “ I don ’ t know or understand what you are talking about. ” Then Peter left and went toward the entrance of the courtyard . And the rooster crowed . [ e ]
NCV	Mark	14	69	The servant girl saw Peter there , and again she said to the people who were standing nearby , “ This man is one of those who followed Jesus. ”
NCV	Mark	14	70	Again Peter said that it was not true . A short time later , some people were standing near Peter saying , “ Surely you are one of those who followed Jesus , because you are from Galilee , too. ”
NCV	Mark	14	71	Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear , “ I don ’ t know this man you ’ re talking about ! ”
NCV	Mark	14	72	At once , the rooster crowed the second time . Then Peter remembered what Jesus had told him : “ Before the rooster crows twice , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ” Then Peter lost control of himself and began to cry .

NCV	Mark	15	8	The crowd came to Pilate and began to ask him to free a prisoner as he always did .
NCV	Mark	15	9	So Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to free the king of the Jews ? ”
NCV	Mark	15	10	Pilate knew that the leading priests had turned Jesus in to him because they were jealous .
NCV	Mark	15	11	But the leading priests had persuaded the people to ask Pilate to free Barabbas , not Jesus .
NCV	Mark	15	12	Then Pilate asked the crowd again , “ So what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews ? ”
NCV	Mark	15	13	They shouted , “ Crucify him ! ”

NCV	Mark	15	36	Someone there ran and got a sponge , filled it with vinegar , tied it to a stick , and gave it to Jesus to drink . He said , “ We want to see if Elijah will come to take him down from the cross. ”

NCV	Mark	15	44	Pilate was amazed that Jesus would have already died , so he called the army officer who had guarded Jesus and asked him if Jesus had already died .
NCV	Mark	15	45	The officer told Pilate that he was dead , so Pilate told Joseph he could have the body .
NCV	Mark	15	46	Joseph bought some linen cloth , took the body down from the cross , and wrapped it in the linen . He put the body in a tomb that was cut out of a wall of rock . Then he rolled a very large stone to block the entrance of the tomb .

NCV	Luke	1	1	Chronicles
NCV	Luke	1	2	They have written the same things that we learned from others—the people who saw those things from the beginning and served God by telling people his message .
NCV	Luke	1	3	Since I myself have studied everything carefully from the beginning , most excellent [ a ] Theophilus , it seemed good for me to write it out for you . I arranged it in order ,
NCV	Luke	1	4	to help you know that what you have been taught is true . Zechariah and Elizabeth
NCV	Luke	1	5	During the time Herod ruled Judea , there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to Abijah ’ s group . [ b ] Zechariah ’ s wife , Elizabeth , came from the family of Aaron .
NCV	Luke	1	6	Zechariah and Elizabeth truly did what God said was good . They did everything the Lord commanded and were without fault in keeping his law .
NCV	Luke	1	7	But they had no children , because Elizabeth could not have a baby , and both of them were very old .
NCV	Luke	1	8	One day Zechariah was serving as a priest before God , because his group was on duty .
NCV	Luke	1	9	According to the custom of the priests , he was chosen by lot to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense .
NCV	Luke	1	10	There were a great many people outside praying at the time the incense was offered .
NCV	Luke	1	11	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah , standing on the right side of the incense table .
NCV	Luke	1	12	When he saw the angel , Zechariah was startled and frightened .
NCV	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , “ Zechariah , don ’ t be afraid . God has heard your prayer . Your wife , Elizabeth , will give birth to a son , and you will name him John .
NCV	Luke	1	14	He will bring you joy and gladness , and many people will be happy because of his birth .
NCV	Luke	1	15	John will be a great man for the Lord . He will never drink wine or beer , and even from birth , he will be filled with the Holy Spirit .
NCV	Luke	1	16	He will help many people of Israel return to the Lord their God .
NCV	Luke	1	17	He will go before the Lord in spirit and power like Elijah . He will make peace between parents and their children and will bring those who are not obeying God back to the right way of thinking , to make a people ready for the coming of the Lord. ”
NCV	Luke	1	18	Zechariah said to the angel , “ How can I know that what you say is true ? I am an old man , and my wife is old , too. ”
NCV	Luke	1	19	The angel answered him , “ I am Gabriel . I stand before God , who sent me to talk to you and to tell you this good news .
NCV	Luke	1	20	Now , listen ! You will not be able to speak until the day these things happen , because you did not believe what I told you . But they will really happen. ”
NCV	Luke	1	21	Outside , the people were still waiting for Zechariah and were surprised that he was staying so long in the Temple .
NCV	Luke	1	22	When Zechariah came outside , he could not speak to them , and they knew he had seen a vision in the Temple . He could only make signs to them and remained unable to speak .
NCV	Luke	1	23	When his time of service at the Temple was finished , he went home .

NCV	Luke	1	27	to a virgin . She was engaged to marry a man named Joseph from the family of David . Her name was Mary .
NCV	Luke	1	28	The angel came to her and said , “ Greetings ! The Lord has blessed you and is with you. ”
NCV	Luke	1	29	But Mary was very startled by what the angel said and wondered what this greeting might mean .
NCV	Luke	1	30	The angel said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid , Mary ; God has shown you his grace .
NCV	Luke	1	31	Listen ! You will become pregnant and give birth to a son , and you will name him Jesus .
NCV	Luke	1	32	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High . The Lord God will give him the throne of King David , his ancestor .
NCV	Luke	1	33	He will rule over the people of Jacob forever , and his kingdom will never end. ”
NCV	Luke	1	34	Mary said to the angel , “ How will this happen since I am a virgin ? ”
NCV	Luke	1	35	The angel said to Mary , “ The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will cover you . For this reason the baby will be holy and will be called the Son of God .
NCV	Luke	1	36	Now Elizabeth , your relative , is also pregnant with a son though she is very old . Everyone thought she could not have a baby , but she has been pregnant for six months .
NCV	Luke	1	37	God can do anything ! ”
NCV	Luke	1	38	Mary said , “ I am the servant of the Lord . Let this happen to me as you say ! ” Then the angel went away . Mary Visits Elizabeth
NCV	Luke	1	39	Mary got up and went quickly to a town in the hills of Judea .
NCV	Luke	1	40	She came to Zechariah ’ s house and greeted Elizabeth .
NCV	Luke	1	41	When Elizabeth heard Mary ’ s greeting , the unborn baby inside her jumped , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
NCV	Luke	1	42	She cried out in a loud voice , “ God has blessed you more than any other woman , and he has blessed the baby to which you will give birth .
NCV	Luke	1	43	Why has this good thing happened to me , that the mother of my Lord comes to me ?
NCV	Luke	1	44	When I heard your voice , the baby inside me jumped with joy .
NCV	Luke	1	45	You are blessed because you believed that what the Lord said to you would really happen. ” Mary Praises God
NCV	Luke	1	46	Then Mary said , “ My soul praises the Lord ;
NCV	Luke	1	47	my heart rejoices in God my Savior ,
NCV	Luke	1	48	because he has shown his concern for his humble servant girl . From now on , all people will say that I am blessed ,
NCV	Luke	1	49	because the Powerful One has done great things for me . His name is holy .
NCV	Luke	1	50	God will show his mercy forever and ever to those who worship and serve him .
NCV	Luke	1	51	He has done mighty deeds by his power . He has scattered the people who are proud and think great things about themselves .
NCV	Luke	1	52	He has brought down rulers from their thrones and raised up the humble .
NCV	Luke	1	53	He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away with nothing .
NCV	Luke	1	54	He has helped his servant , the people of Israel , remembering to show them mercy
NCV	Luke	1	55	as he promised to our ancestors , to Abraham and to his children forever. ”
NCV	Luke	1	56	Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home . The Birth of John
NCV	Luke	1	57	When it was time for Elizabeth to give birth , she had a boy .
NCV	Luke	1	58	Her neighbors and relatives heard how good the Lord was to her , and they rejoiced with her .
NCV	Luke	1	59	When the baby was eight days old , they came to circumcise him . They wanted to name him Zechariah because this was his father ’ s name ,
NCV	Luke	1	60	but his mother said , “ No ! He will be named John. ”
NCV	Luke	1	61	The people said to Elizabeth , “ But no one in your family has this name. ”
NCV	Luke	1	62	Then they made signs to his father to find out what he would like to name him .
NCV	Luke	1	63	Zechariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote , “ His name is John , ” and everyone was surprised .
NCV	Luke	1	64	Immediately Zechariah could talk again , and he began praising God .
NCV	Luke	1	65	All their neighbors became alarmed , and in all the mountains of Judea people continued talking about all these things .
NCV	Luke	1	66	The people who heard about them wondered , saying , “ What will this child be ? ” because the Lord was with him . Zechariah Praises God
NCV	Luke	1	67	Then Zechariah , John ’ s father , was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied :
NCV	Luke	1	68	“ Let us praise the Lord , the God of Israel , because he has come to help his people and has given them freedom .
NCV	Luke	1	69	He has given us a powerful Savior from the family of God ’ s servant David .
NCV	Luke	1	70	He said that he would do this through his holy prophets who lived long ago :
NCV	Luke	1	71	He promised he would save us from our enemies and from the power of all those who hate us .
NCV	Luke	1	72	He said he would give mercy to our ancestors and that he would remember his holy promise .
NCV	Luke	1	73	God promised Abraham , our father ,
NCV	Luke	1	74	that he would save us from the power of our enemies so we could serve him without fear ,
NCV	Luke	1	75	being holy and good before God as long as we live .
NCV	Luke	1	76	“ Now you , child , will be called a prophet of the Most High God . You will go before the Lord to prepare his way .
NCV	Luke	1	77	You will make his people know that they will be saved by having their sins forgiven .
NCV	Luke	1	78	With the loving mercy of our God , a new day from heaven will dawn upon us .
NCV	Luke	1	79	It will shine on those who live in darkness , in the shadow of death . It will guide us into the path of peace. ”
NCV	Luke	1	80	And so the child grew up and became strong in spirit . John lived in the desert until the time when he came out to preach to Israel .

NCV	Luke	2	14	“ Give glory to God in heaven , and on earth let there be peace among the people who please God. ” [ c ]

NCV	Luke	2	31	which you prepared before all people .

NCV	Luke	2	33	Jesus ’ father and mother were amazed at what Simeon had said about him .
NCV	Luke	2	34	Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary , “ God has chosen this child to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel . He will be a sign from God that many people will not accept

NCV	Luke	4	16	Jesus traveled to Nazareth , where he had grown up . On the Sabbath day he went to the synagogue , as he always did , and stood up to read .
NCV	Luke	4	17	The book of Isaiah the prophet was given to him . He opened the book and found the place where this is written :
NCV	Luke	4	18	“ The Lord has put his Spirit in me , because he appointed me to tell the Good News to the poor . He has sent me to tell the captives they are free and to tell the blind that they can see again . Isaiah 61:1 God sent me to free those who have been treated unfairly Isaiah 58:6
NCV	Luke	4	19	and to announce the time when the Lord will show his kindness. ” Isaiah 61:2
NCV	Luke	4	20	Jesus closed the book , gave it back to the assistant , and sat down . Everyone in the synagogue was watching Jesus closely .

NCV	Luke	5	5	Simon answered , “ Master , we worked hard all night trying to catch fish , and we caught nothing . But you say to put the nets in the water , so I will. ”
NCV	Luke	5	2	Jesus saw two boats at the shore of the lake . The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets .
NCV	Luke	5	3	Jesus got into one of the boats , the one that belonged to Simon , [ a ] and asked him to push off a little from the land . Then Jesus sat down and continued to teach the people from the boat .
NCV	Luke	5	4	When Jesus had finished speaking , he said to Simon , “ Take the boat into deep water , and put your nets in the water to catch some fish. ”
NCV	Luke	5	6	When the fishermen did as Jesus told them , they caught so many fish that the nets began to break .
NCV	Luke	5	7	They called to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . They came and filled both boats so full that they were almost sinking .
NCV	Luke	5	8	When Simon Peter saw what had happened , he bowed down before Jesus and said , “ Go away from me , Lord . I am a sinful man ! ”

NCV	Luke	5	12	When Jesus was in one of the towns , there was a man covered with a skin disease . When he saw Jesus , he bowed before him and begged him , “ Lord , you can heal me if you will. ”
NCV	Luke	5	13	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man and said , “ I will . Be healed ! ” Immediately the disease disappeared .
NCV	Luke	5	14	Then Jesus said , “ Don ’ t tell anyone about this , but go and show yourself to the priest [ b ] and offer a gift for your healing , as Moses commanded . [ c ] This will show the people what I have done. ”
NCV	Luke	5	15	But the news about Jesus spread even more . Many people came to hear Jesus and to be healed of their sicknesses ,
NCV	Luke	5	16	but Jesus often slipped away to be alone so he could pray . Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man

NCV	Luke	5	18	Just then , some men were carrying on a mat a man who was paralyzed . They tried to bring him in and put him down before Jesus .
NCV	Luke	5	19	But because there were so many people there , they could not find a way in . So they went up on the roof and lowered the man on his mat through the ceiling into the middle of the crowd right before Jesus .
NCV	Luke	5	20	Seeing their faith , Jesus said , “ Friend , your sins are forgiven. ”
NCV	Luke	5	21	The Jewish teachers of the law and the Pharisees thought to themselves , “ Who is this man who is speaking as if he were God ? Only God can forgive sins. ”
NCV	Luke	5	22	But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said , “ Why are you thinking these things ?
NCV	Luke	5	23	Which is easier : to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Stand up and walk ’ ?
NCV	Luke	5	24	But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man , “ I tell you , stand up , take your mat , and go home. ”
NCV	Luke	5	25	At once the man stood up before them , picked up his mat , and went home , praising God .
NCV	Luke	5	26	All the people were fully amazed and began to praise God . They were filled with much respect and said , “ Today we have seen amazing things ! ” Levi Follows Jesus
NCV	Luke	5	27	After this , Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax collector ’ s booth . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me ! ”

NCV	Luke	5	29	Then Levi gave a big dinner for Jesus at his house . Many tax collectors and other people were eating there , too .
NCV	Luke	5	30	But the Pharisees and the men who taught the law for the Pharisees began to complain to Jesus ’ followers , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NCV	Luke	5	31	Jesus answered them , “ It is not the healthy people who need a doctor , but the sick .
NCV	Luke	5	32	I have not come to invite good people but sinners to change their hearts and lives. ” Jesus Answers a Question
NCV	Luke	5	33	They said to Jesus , “ John ’ s followers often fast [ d ] for a certain time and pray , just as the Pharisees do . But your followers eat and drink all the time. ”
NCV	Luke	5	34	Jesus said to them , “ You can not make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is still with them .
NCV	Luke	5	35	But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast. ”
NCV	Luke	5	36	Jesus told them this story : “ No one takes cloth off a new coat to cover a hole in an old coat . Otherwise , he ruins the new coat , and the cloth from the new coat will not be the same as the old cloth .
NCV	Luke	5	37	Also , no one ever pours new wine into old leather bags . Otherwise , the new wine will break the bags , the wine will spill out , and the leather bags will be ruined .
NCV	Luke	5	38	New wine must be put into new leather bags .

NCV	Luke	6	2	Some Pharisees said , “ Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? ”
NCV	Luke	6	3	Jesus answered , “ Have you not read what David did when he and those with him were hungry ?
NCV	Luke	6	4	He went into God ’ s house and took and ate the holy bread , which is lawful only for priests to eat . And he gave some to the people who were with him. ”

NCV	Luke	6	19	All the people were trying to touch Jesus , because power was coming from him and healing them all .

NCV	Luke	6	30	Give to everyone who asks you , and when someone takes something that is yours , don ’ t ask for it back .

NCV	Luke	6	33	If you do good only to those who do good to you , what praise should you get ? Even sinners do that !
NCV	Luke	6	34	If you lend things to people , always hoping to get something back , what praise should you get ? Even sinners lend to other sinners so that they can get back the same amount !

NCV	Luke	7	20	When the men came to Jesus , they said , “ John the Baptist sent us to you with this question : ‘ Are you the One who is to come , or should we wait for someone else ? ’ ”
NCV	Luke	7	21	At that time , Jesus healed many people of their sicknesses , diseases , and evil spirits , and he gave sight to many blind people .

NCV	Luke	7	24	When John ’ s followers left , Jesus began talking to the people about John : “ What did you go out into the desert to see ? A reed [ a ] blown by the wind ?
NCV	Luke	7	25	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No , people who have fine clothes and much wealth live in kings ’ palaces .
NCV	Luke	7	26	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , and I tell you , John is more than a prophet .
NCV	Luke	7	27	This was written about him : ‘ I will send my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare the way for you. ’ Malachi 3:1
NCV	Luke	7	28	I tell you , John is greater than any other person ever born , but even the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than John. ”

NCV	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and experts on the law refused to accept God ’ s plan for themselves ; they did not let John baptize them . )
NCV	Luke	7	31	Then Jesus said , “ What shall I say about the people of this time ? What are they like ?
NCV	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the marketplace , calling to one another and saying , ‘ We played music for you , but you did not dance ; we sang a sad song , but you did not cry. ’
NCV	Luke	7	33	John the Baptist came and did not eat bread or drink wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon in him. ’
NCV	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Look at him ! He eats too much and drinks too much wine , and he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
NCV	Luke	7	35	But wisdom is proved to be right by what it does. ” A Woman Washes Jesus ’ Feet
NCV	Luke	7	36	One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him , so Jesus went into the Pharisee ’ s house and sat at the table .

NCV	Luke	7	38	and stood behind Jesus at his feet , crying . She began to wash his feet with her tears , and she dried them with her hair , kissing them many times and rubbing them with the perfume .
NCV	Luke	7	39	When the Pharisee who asked Jesus to come to his house saw this , he thought to himself , “ If Jesus were a prophet , he would know that the woman touching him is a sinner ! ”
NCV	Luke	7	40	Jesus said to the Pharisee , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” Simon said , “ Teacher , tell me. ”
NCV	Luke	7	41	Jesus said , “ Two people owed money to the same banker . One owed five hundred coins [ b ] and the other owed fifty .
NCV	Luke	7	42	They had no money to pay what they owed , but the banker told both of them they did not have to pay him . Which person will love the banker more ? ”
NCV	Luke	7	43	Simon , the Pharisee , answered , “ I think it would be the one who owed him the most money. ” Jesus said to Simon , “ You are right. ”
NCV	Luke	7	44	Then Jesus turned toward the woman and said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? When I came into your house , you gave me no water for my feet , but she washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair .
NCV	Luke	7	45	You gave me no kiss of greeting , but she has been kissing my feet since I came in .
NCV	Luke	7	46	You did not put oil on my head , but she poured perfume on my feet .
NCV	Luke	7	47	I tell you that her many sins are forgiven , so she showed great love . But the person who is forgiven only a little will love only a little. ”
NCV	Luke	7	48	Then Jesus said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven. ”
NCV	Luke	7	49	The people sitting at the table began to say among themselves , “ Who is this who even forgives sins ? ”

NCV	Luke	8	8	And some seed fell on good ground and grew and made a hundred times more. ” As Jesus finished the story , he called out , “ Let those with ears use them and listen ! ”

NCV	Luke	8	4	When a great crowd was gathered , and people were coming to Jesus from every town , he told them this story :
NCV	Luke	8	5	“ A farmer went out to plant his seed . While he was planting , some seed fell by the road . People walked on the seed , and the birds ate it up .
NCV	Luke	8	6	Some seed fell on rock , and when it began to grow , it died because it had no water .
NCV	Luke	8	7	Some seed fell among thorny weeds , but the weeds grew up with it and choked the good plants .
NCV	Luke	8	9	Jesus ’ followers asked him what this story meant .
NCV	Luke	8	10	Jesus said , “ You have been chosen to know the secrets about the kingdom of God . But I use stories to speak to other people so that : ‘ They will look , but they may not see . They will listen , but they may not understand. ’ Isaiah 6:9
NCV	Luke	8	11	“ This is what the story means : The seed is God ’ s message .
NCV	Luke	8	12	The seed that fell beside the road is like the people who hear God ’ s teaching , but the devil comes and takes it away from them so they can not believe it and be saved .
NCV	Luke	8	13	The seed that fell on rock is like those who hear God ’ s teaching and accept it gladly , but they don ’ t allow the teaching to go deep into their lives . They believe for a while , but when trouble comes , they give up .
NCV	Luke	8	14	The seed that fell among the thorny weeds is like those who hear God ’ s teaching , but they let the worries , riches , and pleasures of this life keep them from growing and producing good fruit .
NCV	Luke	8	15	And the seed that fell on the good ground is like those who hear God ’ s teaching with good , honest hearts and obey it and patiently produce good fruit . Use What You Have
NCV	Luke	8	16	“ No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed . Instead , the person puts it on a lampstand so those who come in will see the light .
NCV	Luke	8	17	Everything that is hidden will become clear , and every secret thing will be made known .
NCV	Luke	8	18	So be careful how you listen . Those who have understanding will be given more . But those who do not have understanding , even what they think they have will be taken away from them. ” Jesus ’ True Family
NCV	Luke	8	19	Jesus ’ mother and brothers came to see him , but there was such a crowd they could not get to him .
NCV	Luke	8	20	Someone said to Jesus , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside , wanting to see you. ”
NCV	Luke	8	21	Jesus answered them , “ My mother and my brothers are those who listen to God ’ s teaching and obey it ! ” Jesus Calms a Storm
NCV	Luke	8	22	One day Jesus and his followers got into a boat , and he said to them , “ Let ’ s go across the lake. ” And so they started across .
NCV	Luke	8	23	While they were sailing , Jesus fell asleep . A very strong wind blew up on the lake , causing the boat to fill with water , and they were in danger .
NCV	Luke	8	24	The followers went to Jesus and woke him , saying , “ Master ! Master ! We will drown ! ” Jesus got up and gave a command to the wind and the waves . They stopped , and it became calm .
NCV	Luke	8	25	Jesus said to his followers , “ Where is your faith ? ” The followers were afraid and amazed and said to each other , “ Who is this that commands even the wind and the water , and they obey him ? ” A Man with Demons Inside Him
NCV	Luke	8	26	Jesus and his followers sailed across the lake from Galilee to the area of the Gerasene [ a ] people .

NCV	Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus , he cried out and fell down before him . He said with a loud voice , “ What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , don ’ t torture me ! ”
NCV	Luke	8	29	He said this because Jesus was commanding the evil spirit to come out of the man . Many times it had taken hold of him . Though he had been kept under guard and chained hand and foot , he had broken his chains and had been forced by the demon out into a lonely place .
NCV	Luke	8	30	Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He answered , “ Legion , ” [ b ] because many demons were in him .
NCV	Luke	8	31	The demons begged Jesus not to send them into eternal darkness . [ c ]
NCV	Luke	8	32	A large herd of pigs was feeding on a hill , and the demons begged Jesus to allow them to go into the pigs . So Jesus allowed them to do this .
NCV	Luke	8	33	When the demons came out of the man , they went into the pigs , and the herd ran down the hill into the lake and was drowned .
NCV	Luke	8	34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they ran away and told about this in the town and the countryside .
NCV	Luke	8	35	And people went to see what had happened . When they came to Jesus , they found the man sitting at Jesus ’ feet , clothed and in his right mind , because the demons were gone . But the people were frightened .
NCV	Luke	8	36	The people who saw this happen told the others how Jesus had made the man well .
NCV	Luke	8	37	All the people of the Gerasene country asked Jesus to leave , because they were all very afraid . So Jesus got into the boat and went back to Galilee .
NCV	Luke	8	38	The man whom Jesus had healed begged to go with him , but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
NCV	Luke	8	39	“ Go back home and tell people how much God has done for you. ” So the man went all over town telling how much Jesus had done for him . Jesus Gives Life to a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman

NCV	Luke	8	43	A woman was in the crowd who had been bleeding for twelve years , [ d ] but no one was able to heal her .
NCV	Luke	8	44	She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his coat , and instantly her bleeding stopped .
NCV	Luke	8	45	Then Jesus said , “ Who touched me ? ” When all the people said they had not touched him , Peter said , “ Master , the people are all around you and are pushing against you. ”
NCV	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone did touch me , because I felt power go out from me. ”
NCV	Luke	8	47	When the woman saw she could not hide , she came forward , shaking , and fell down before Jesus . While all the people listened , she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed .
NCV	Luke	8	48	Jesus said to her , “ Dear woman , you are made well because you believed . Go in peace. ”
NCV	Luke	8	49	While Jesus was still speaking , someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said to him , “ Your daughter is dead . Don ’ t bother the teacher anymore. ”
NCV	Luke	8	50	When Jesus heard this , he said to Jairus , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Just believe , and your daughter will be well. ”
NCV	Luke	8	51	When Jesus went to the house , he let only Peter , John , James , and the girl ’ s father and mother go inside with him .
NCV	Luke	8	52	All the people were crying and feeling sad because the girl was dead , but Jesus said , “ Stop crying . She is not dead , only asleep. ”

NCV	Luke	8	54	But Jesus took hold of her hand and called to her , “ My child , stand up ! ”
NCV	Luke	8	55	Her spirit came back into her , and she stood up at once . Then Jesus ordered that she be given something to eat .

NCV	Luke	10	40	But Martha was busy with all the work to be done . She went in and said , “ Lord , don ’ t you care that my sister has left me alone to do all the work ? Tell her to help me. ”
NCV	Luke	10	41	But the Lord answered her , “ Martha , Martha , you are worried and upset about many things .
NCV	Luke	10	42	Only one thing is important .

NCV	Luke	11	11	If your children ask for [ b ] a fish , which of you would give them a snake instead ?
NCV	Luke	11	2	Jesus said to them , “ When you pray , say : ‘ Father , may your name always be kept holy . May your kingdom come .
NCV	Luke	11	3	Give us the food we need for each day .
NCV	Luke	11	4	Forgive us for our sins , because we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us . And do not cause us to be tempted. ’ ” [ a ] Continue to Ask
NCV	Luke	11	5	Then Jesus said to them , “ Suppose one of you went to your friend ’ s house at midnight and said to him , ‘ Friend , loan me three loaves of bread .
NCV	Luke	11	6	A friend of mine has come into town to visit me , but I have nothing for him to eat. ’
NCV	Luke	11	7	Your friend inside the house answers , ‘ Don ’ t bother me ! The door is already locked , and my children and I are in bed . I can not get up and give you anything. ’
NCV	Luke	11	8	I tell you , if friendship is not enough to make him get up to give you the bread , your boldness will make him get up and give you whatever you need .
NCV	Luke	11	9	So I tell you , ask , and God will give to you . Search , and you will find . Knock , and the door will open for you .
NCV	Luke	11	10	Yes , everyone who asks will receive . The one who searches will find . And everyone who knocks will have the door opened .
NCV	Luke	11	12	Or , if your children ask for an egg , would you give them a scorpion ?
NCV	Luke	11	13	Even though you are bad , you know how to give good things to your children . How much more your heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! ” Jesus ’ Power Is from God
NCV	Luke	11	14	One time Jesus was sending out a demon who could not talk . When the demon came out , the man who had been unable to speak , then spoke . The people were amazed .
NCV	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ Jesus uses the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of demons , to force demons out of people. ”
NCV	Luke	11	16	Other people , wanting to test Jesus , asked him to give them a sign from heaven .
NCV	Luke	11	17	But knowing their thoughts , he said to them , “ Every kingdom that is divided against itself will be destroyed . And a family that is divided against itself will not continue .
NCV	Luke	11	18	So if Satan is divided against himself , his kingdom will not continue . You say that I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons .
NCV	Luke	11	19	But if I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons , what power do your people use to force demons out ? So they will be your judges .
NCV	Luke	11	20	But if I use the power of God to force out demons , then the kingdom of God has come to you .
NCV	Luke	11	21	“ When a strong person with many weapons guards his own house , his possessions are safe .
NCV	Luke	11	22	But when someone stronger comes and defeats him , the stronger one will take away the weapons the first man trusted and will give away the possessions .
NCV	Luke	11	23	“ Anyone who is not with me is against me , and anyone who does not work with me is working against me . The Empty Person
NCV	Luke	11	24	“ When an evil spirit comes out of a person , it travels through dry places , looking for a place to rest . But when it finds no place , it says , ‘ I will go back to the house I left. ’
NCV	Luke	11	25	And when it comes back , it finds that house swept clean and made neat .
NCV	Luke	11	26	Then the evil spirit goes out and brings seven other spirits more evil than it is , and they go in and live there . So the person has even more trouble than before. ” People Who Are Truly Blessed
NCV	Luke	11	27	As Jesus was saying these things , a woman in the crowd called out to Jesus , “ Blessed is the mother who gave birth to you and nursed you. ”
NCV	Luke	11	28	But Jesus said , “ No , blessed are those who hear the teaching of God and obey it. ” The People Want a Miracle
NCV	Luke	11	29	As the crowd grew larger , Jesus said , “ The people who live today are evil . They want to see a miracle for a sign , but no sign will be given them , except the sign of Jonah . [ c ]
NCV	Luke	11	30	As Jonah was a sign for those people who lived in Nineveh , the Son of Man will be a sign for the people of this time .
NCV	Luke	11	31	On the Judgment Day the Queen of the South [ d ] will stand up with the people who live now . She will show they are guilty , because she came from far away to listen to Solomon ’ s wise teaching . And I tell you that someone greater than Solomon is here .
NCV	Luke	11	32	On the Judgment Day the people of Nineveh will stand up with the people who live now , and they will show that you are guilty . When Jonah preached to them , they were sorry and changed their lives . And I tell you that someone greater than Jonah is here . Be a Light for the World
NCV	Luke	11	33	“ No one lights a lamp and puts it in a secret place or under a bowl , but on a lampstand so the people who come in can see .
NCV	Luke	11	34	Your eye is a light for the body . When your eyes are good , your whole body will be full of light . But when your eyes are evil , your whole body will be full of darkness .
NCV	Luke	11	35	So be careful not to let the light in you become darkness .
NCV	Luke	11	36	If your whole body is full of light , and none of it is dark , then you will shine bright , as when a lamp shines on you. ” Jesus Accuses the Pharisees
NCV	Luke	11	37	After Jesus had finished speaking , a Pharisee asked Jesus to eat with him . So Jesus went in and sat at the table .
NCV	Luke	11	38	But the Pharisee was surprised when he saw that Jesus did not wash his hands [ e ] before the meal .
NCV	Luke	11	39	The Lord said to him , “ You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the dish , but inside you are full of greed and evil .
NCV	Luke	11	40	You foolish people ! The same one who made what is outside also made what is inside .
NCV	Luke	11	41	So give what is in your dishes to the poor , and then you will be fully clean .
NCV	Luke	11	42	How terrible for you Pharisees ! You give God one-tenth of even your mint , your rue , and every other plant in your garden . But you fail to be fair to others and to love God . These are the things you should do while continuing to do those other things .
NCV	Luke	11	43	How terrible for you Pharisees , because you love to have the most important seats in the synagogues , and you love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces .
NCV	Luke	11	44	How terrible for you , because you are like hidden graves , which people walk on without knowing. ” Jesus Talks to Experts on the Law
NCV	Luke	11	45	One of the experts on the law said to Jesus , “ Teacher , when you say these things , you are insulting us , too. ”
NCV	Luke	11	46	Jesus answered , “ How terrible for you , you experts on the law ! You make strict rules that are very hard for people to obey , but you yourselves don ’ t even try to follow those rules .
NCV	Luke	11	47	How terrible for you , because you build tombs for the prophets whom your ancestors killed !
NCV	Luke	11	48	And now you show that you approve of what your ancestors did . They killed the prophets , and you build tombs for them !
NCV	Luke	11	49	This is why in his wisdom God said , ‘ I will send prophets and apostles to them . They will kill some , and they will treat others cruelly. ’
NCV	Luke	11	50	So you who live now will be punished for the deaths of all the prophets who were killed since the beginning of the world—
NCV	Luke	11	51	from the killing of Abel to the killing of Zechariah , [ f ] who died between the altar and the Temple . Yes , I tell you that you who are alive now will be punished for them all .
NCV	Luke	11	52	“ How terrible for you , you experts on the law . You have taken away the key to learning about God . You yourselves would not learn , and you stopped others from learning , too. ”
NCV	Luke	11	53	When Jesus left , the teachers of the law and the Pharisees began to give him trouble , asking him questions about many things ,

NCV	Luke	12	12	At that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you must say. ” Jesus Warns Against Selfishness
NCV	Luke	12	2	Everything that is hidden will be shown , and everything that is secret will be made known .
NCV	Luke	12	3	What you have said in the dark will be heard in the light , and what you have whispered in an inner room will be shouted from the housetops .
NCV	Luke	12	4	“ I tell you , my friends , don ’ t be afraid of people who can kill the body but after that can do nothing more to hurt you .
NCV	Luke	12	5	I will show you the one to fear . Fear the one who has the power to kill you and also to throw you into hell . Yes , this is the one you should fear .
NCV	Luke	12	6	“ Five sparrows are sold for only two pennies , and God does not forget any of them .
NCV	Luke	12	7	But God even knows how many hairs you have on your head . Don ’ t be afraid . You are worth much more than many sparrows . Don ’ t Be Ashamed of Jesus
NCV	Luke	12	8	“ I tell you , all those who stand before others and say they believe in me , I , the Son of Man , will say before the angels of God that they belong to me .
NCV	Luke	12	9	But all who stand before others and say they do not believe in me , I will say before the angels of God that they do not belong to me .
NCV	Luke	12	10	“ Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven , but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
NCV	Luke	12	11	“ When you are brought into the synagogues before the leaders and other powerful people , don ’ t worry about how to defend yourself or what to say .
NCV	Luke	12	13	Someone in the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide with me the property our father left us. ”
NCV	Luke	12	14	But Jesus said to him , “ Who said I should judge or decide between you ? ”
NCV	Luke	12	15	Then Jesus said to them , “ Be careful and guard against all kinds of greed . Life is not measured by how much one owns. ”
NCV	Luke	12	16	Then Jesus told this story : “ There was a rich man who had some land , which grew a good crop .
NCV	Luke	12	17	He thought to himself , ‘ What will I do ? I have no place to keep all my crops. ’
NCV	Luke	12	18	Then he said , ‘ This is what I will do : I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and other goods .
NCV	Luke	12	19	Then I can say to myself , “ I have enough good things stored to last for many years . Rest , eat , drink , and enjoy life ! ” ’
NCV	Luke	12	20	“ But God said to him , ‘ Foolish man ! Tonight your life will be taken from you . So who will get those things you have prepared for yourself ? ’
NCV	Luke	12	21	“ This is how it will be for those who store up things for themselves and are not rich toward God. ” Don ’ t Worry
NCV	Luke	12	22	Jesus said to his followers , “ So I tell you , don ’ t worry about the food you need to live , or about the clothes you need for your body .
NCV	Luke	12	23	Life is more than food , and the body is more than clothes .
NCV	Luke	12	24	Look at the birds . They don ’ t plant or harvest , they don ’ t have storerooms or barns , but God feeds them . And you are worth much more than birds .
NCV	Luke	12	25	You can not add any time to your life by worrying about it .
NCV	Luke	12	26	If you can not do even the little things , then why worry about the big things ?
NCV	Luke	12	27	Consider how the lilies grow ; they don ’ t work or make clothes for themselves . But I tell you that even Solomon with his riches was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers .
NCV	Luke	12	28	God clothes the grass in the field , which is alive today but tomorrow is thrown into the fire . So how much more will God clothe you ? Don ’ t have so little faith !
NCV	Luke	12	29	Don ’ t always think about what you will eat or what you will drink , and don ’ t keep worrying .
NCV	Luke	12	30	All the people in the world are trying to get these things , and your Father knows you need them .
NCV	Luke	12	31	But seek God ’ s kingdom , and all your other needs will be met as well . Don ’ t Trust in Money
NCV	Luke	12	32	“ Don ’ t fear , little flock , because your Father wants to give you the kingdom .
NCV	Luke	12	33	Sell your possessions and give to the poor . Get for yourselves purses that will not wear out , the treasure in heaven that never runs out , where thieves can ’ t steal and moths can ’ t destroy .
NCV	Luke	12	34	Your heart will be where your treasure is . Always Be Ready
NCV	Luke	12	35	“ Be dressed , ready for service , and have your lamps shining .
NCV	Luke	12	36	Be like servants who are waiting for their master to come home from a wedding party . When he comes and knocks , the servants immediately open the door for him .
NCV	Luke	12	37	They will be blessed when their master comes home , because he sees that they were watching for him . I tell you the truth , the master will dress himself to serve and tell the servants to sit at the table , and he will serve them .
NCV	Luke	12	38	Those servants will be blessed when he comes in and finds them still waiting , even if it is midnight or later .
NCV	Luke	12	39	“ Remember this : If the owner of the house knew what time a thief was coming , he would not allow the thief to enter his house .
NCV	Luke	12	40	So you also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at a time when you don ’ t expect him ! ” Who Is the Trusted Servant ?
NCV	Luke	12	41	Peter said , “ Lord , did you tell this story to us or to all people ? ”
NCV	Luke	12	42	The Lord said , “ Who is the wise and trusted servant that the master trusts to give the other servants their food at the right time ?
NCV	Luke	12	43	When the master comes and finds the servant doing his work , the servant will be blessed .
NCV	Luke	12	44	I tell you the truth , the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns .
NCV	Luke	12	45	But suppose the servant thinks to himself , ‘ My master will not come back soon , ’ and he begins to beat the other servants , men and women , and to eat and drink and get drunk .
NCV	Luke	12	46	The master will come when that servant is not ready and is not expecting him . Then the master will cut him in pieces and send him away to be with the others who don ’ t obey .
NCV	Luke	12	47	“ The servant who knows what his master wants but is not ready , or who does not do what the master wants , will be beaten with many blows !
NCV	Luke	12	48	But the servant who does not know what his master wants and does things that should be punished will be beaten with few blows . From everyone who has been given much , much will be demanded . And from the one trusted with much , much more will be expected . Jesus Causes Division
NCV	Luke	12	49	“ I came to set fire to the world , and I wish it were already burning !

NCV	Luke	12	51	Do you think I came to give peace to the earth ? No , I tell you , I came to divide it .
NCV	Luke	12	52	From now on , a family with five people will be divided , three against two , and two against three .
NCV	Luke	12	53	They will be divided : father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ” Understanding the Times
NCV	Luke	12	54	Then Jesus said to the people , “ When you see clouds coming up in the west , you say , ‘ It ’ s going to rain , ’ and it happens .
NCV	Luke	12	55	When you feel the wind begin to blow from the south , you say , ‘ It will be a hot day , ’ and it happens .

NCV	Luke	12	57	“ Why can ’ t you decide for yourselves what is right ?
NCV	Luke	12	58	If your enemy is taking you to court , try hard to settle it on the way . If you don ’ t , your enemy might take you to the judge , and the judge might turn you over to the officer , and the officer might throw you into jail .

NCV	Luke	13	3	No , I tell you . But unless you change your hearts and lives , you will be destroyed as they were !

NCV	Luke	13	6	Jesus told this story : “ A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard . He came looking for some fruit on the tree , but he found none .
NCV	Luke	13	7	So the man said to his gardener , ‘ I have been looking for fruit on this tree for three years , but I never find any . Cut it down . Why should it waste the ground ? ’
NCV	Luke	13	8	But the servant answered , ‘ Master , let the tree have one more year to produce fruit . Let me dig up the dirt around it and put on some fertilizer .
NCV	Luke	13	9	If the tree produces fruit next year , good . But if not , you can cut it down. ’ ” Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
NCV	Luke	13	10	Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day .
NCV	Luke	13	11	A woman was there who , for eighteen years , had an evil spirit in her that made her crippled . Her back was always bent ; she could not stand up straight .
NCV	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her , he called her over and said , “ Woman , you are free from your sickness. ”
NCV	Luke	13	14	The synagogue leader was angry because Jesus healed on the Sabbath day . He said to the people , “ There are six days when one has to work . So come to be healed on one of those days , and not on the Sabbath day. ”
NCV	Luke	13	15	The Lord answered , “ You hypocrites ! Doesn ’ t each of you untie your work animals and lead them to drink water every day—even on the Sabbath day ?
NCV	Luke	13	16	This woman that I healed , a daughter of Abraham , has been held by Satan for eighteen years . Surely it is not wrong for her to be freed from her sickness on a Sabbath day ! ”
NCV	Luke	13	17	When Jesus said this , all of those who were criticizing him were ashamed , but the entire crowd rejoiced at all the wonderful things Jesus was doing . Stories of Mustard Seed and Yeast
NCV	Luke	13	18	Then Jesus said , “ What is God ’ s kingdom like ? What can I compare it with ?
NCV	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed that a man plants in his garden . The seed grows and becomes a tree , and the wild birds build nests in its branches. ”
NCV	Luke	13	20	Jesus said again , “ What can I compare God ’ s kingdom with ?
NCV	Luke	13	21	It is like yeast that a woman took and hid in a large tub of flour until it made all the dough rise. ” The Narrow Door
NCV	Luke	13	22	Jesus was teaching in every town and village as he traveled toward Jerusalem .
NCV	Luke	13	23	Someone said to Jesus , “ Lord , will only a few people be saved ? ” Jesus said ,
NCV	Luke	13	24	“ Try hard to enter through the narrow door , because many people will try to enter there , but they will not be able .
NCV	Luke	13	25	When the owner of the house gets up and closes the door , you can stand outside and knock on the door and say , ‘ Sir , open the door for us. ’ But he will answer , ‘ I don ’ t know you or where you come from. ’
NCV	Luke	13	26	to a.d.
NCV	Luke	13	27	But he will say to you , ‘ I don ’ t know you or where you come from . Go away from me , all you who do evil ! ’
NCV	Luke	13	28	You will cry and grind your teeth with pain when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in God ’ s kingdom , but you yourselves thrown outside .
NCV	Luke	13	29	People will come from the east , west , north , and south and will sit down at the table in the kingdom of God .

NCV	Luke	13	31	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said , “ Go away from here ! Herod wants to kill you ! ”
NCV	Luke	13	32	Jesus said to them , “ Go tell that fox Herod , ‘ Today and tomorrow I am forcing demons out and healing people . Then , on the third day , I will reach my goal. ’
NCV	Luke	13	33	Yet I must be on my way today and tomorrow and the next day . Surely it can not be right for a prophet to be killed anywhere except in Jerusalem .

NCV	Luke	14	2	And in front of him was a man with dropsy . [ a ]
NCV	Luke	14	3	Jesus said to the Pharisees and experts on the law , “ Is it right or wrong to heal on the Sabbath day ? ”
NCV	Luke	14	4	But they would not answer his question . So Jesus took the man , healed him , and sent him away .
NCV	Luke	14	5	Jesus said to the Pharisees and teachers of the law , “ If your child [ b ] or ox falls into a well on the Sabbath day , will you not pull him out quickly ? ”
NCV	Luke	14	6	And they could not answer him . Don ’ t Make Yourself Important
NCV	Luke	14	7	When Jesus noticed that some of the guests were choosing the best places to sit , he told this story :
NCV	Luke	14	8	“ When someone invites you to a wedding feast , don ’ t take the most important seat , because someone more important than you may have been invited .
NCV	Luke	14	9	The host , who invited both of you , will come to you and say , ‘ Give this person your seat. ’ Then you will be embarrassed and will have to move to the last place .
NCV	Luke	14	10	So when you are invited , go sit in a seat that is not important . When the host comes to you , he may say , ‘ Friend , move up here to a more important place. ’ Then all the other guests will respect you .
NCV	Luke	14	11	All who make themselves great will be made humble , but those who make themselves humble will be made great. ” You Will Be Rewarded
NCV	Luke	14	12	Then Jesus said to the man who had invited him , “ When you give a lunch or a dinner , don ’ t invite only your friends , your family , your other relatives , and your rich neighbors . At another time they will invite you to eat with them , and you will be repaid .
NCV	Luke	14	13	Instead , when you give a feast , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , and the blind .
NCV	Luke	14	15	One of those at the table with Jesus heard these things and said to him , “ Blessed are the people who will share in the meal in God ’ s kingdom. ”
NCV	Luke	14	16	Jesus said to him , “ A man gave a big banquet and invited many people .
NCV	Luke	14	17	When it was time to eat , the man sent his servant to tell the guests , ‘ Come . Everything is ready. ’
NCV	Luke	14	18	“ But all the guests made excuses . The first one said , ‘ I have just bought a field , and I must go look at it . Please excuse me. ’
NCV	Luke	14	19	Another said , ‘ I have just bought five pairs of oxen ; I must go and try them . Please excuse me. ’
NCV	Luke	14	20	A third person said , ‘ I just got married ; I can ’ t come. ’
NCV	Luke	14	21	So the servant returned and told his master what had happened . Then the master became angry and said , ‘ Go at once into the streets and alleys of the town , and bring in the poor , the crippled , the blind , and the lame. ’
NCV	Luke	14	22	Later the servant said to him , ‘ Master , I did what you commanded , but we still have room. ’
NCV	Luke	14	23	The master said to the servant , ‘ Go out to the roads and country lanes , and urge the people there to come so my house will be full .
NCV	Luke	14	24	I tell you , none of those whom I invited first will eat with me. ’ ” The Cost of Being Jesus ’ Follower
NCV	Luke	14	25	Large crowds were traveling with Jesus , and he turned and said to them ,
NCV	Luke	14	26	“ If anyone comes to me but loves his father , mother , wife , children , brothers , or sisters—or even life—more than me , he can not be my follower .
NCV	Luke	14	27	Whoever is not willing to carry his cross and follow me can not be my follower .
NCV	Luke	14	28	If you want to build a tower , you first sit down and decide how much it will cost , to see if you have enough money to finish the job .

NCV	Luke	15	15	So he got a job with one of the citizens there who sent the son into the fields to feed pigs .
NCV	Luke	15	2	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to complain : “ Look , this man welcomes sinners and even eats with them. ”
NCV	Luke	15	3	Then Jesus told them this story :
NCV	Luke	15	4	“ Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep but loses one of them . Then he will leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the open field and go out and look for the lost sheep until he finds it .
NCV	Luke	15	5	And when he finds it , he happily puts it on his shoulders
NCV	Luke	15	6	and goes home . He calls to his friends and neighbors and says , ‘ Be happy with me because I found my lost sheep. ’
NCV	Luke	15	7	In the same way , I tell you there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who changes his heart and life , than over ninety-nine good people who don ’ t need to change .
NCV	Luke	15	8	“ Suppose a woman has ten silver coins , [ a ] but loses one . She will light a lamp , sweep the house , and look carefully for the coin until she finds it .
NCV	Luke	15	9	And when she finds it , she will call her friends and neighbors and say , ‘ Be happy with me because I have found the coin that I lost. ’
NCV	Luke	15	10	In the same way , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God when one sinner changes his heart and life. ” The Son Who Left Home
NCV	Luke	15	11	Then Jesus said , “ A man had two sons .
NCV	Luke	15	12	The younger son said to his father , ‘ Give me my share of the property. ’ So the father divided the property between his two sons .
NCV	Luke	15	13	Then the younger son gathered up all that was his and traveled far away to another country . There he wasted his money in foolish living .
NCV	Luke	15	14	After he had spent everything , a time came when there was no food anywhere in the country , and the son was poor and hungry .
NCV	Luke	15	16	The son was so hungry that he wanted to eat the pods the pigs were eating , but no one gave him anything .
NCV	Luke	15	17	When he realized what he was doing , he thought , ‘ All of my father ’ s servants have plenty of food . But I am here , almost dying with hunger .
NCV	Luke	15	18	I will leave and return to my father and say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against God and against you .
NCV	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son , but let me be like one of your servants. ” ’
NCV	Luke	15	20	So the son left and went to his father . “ While the son was still a long way off , his father saw him and felt sorry for his son . So the father ran to him and hugged and kissed him .
NCV	Luke	15	21	The son said , ‘ Father , I have sinned against God and against you . I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’ [ b ]
NCV	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his servants , ‘ Hurry ! Bring the best clothes and put them on him . Also , put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet .
NCV	Luke	15	23	And get our fat calf and kill it so we can have a feast and celebrate .
NCV	Luke	15	24	My son was dead , but now he is alive again ! He was lost , but now he is found ! ’ So they began to celebrate .
NCV	Luke	15	25	“ The older son was in the field , and as he came closer to the house , he heard the sound of music and dancing .
NCV	Luke	15	26	So he called to one of the servants and asked what all this meant .
NCV	Luke	15	27	The servant said , ‘ Your brother has come back , and your father killed the fat calf , because your brother came home safely. ’
NCV	Luke	15	28	The older son was angry and would not go in to the feast . So his father went out and begged him to come in .
NCV	Luke	15	29	But the older son said to his father , ‘ I have served you like a slave for many years and have always obeyed your commands . But you never gave me even a young goat to have at a feast with my friends .
NCV	Luke	15	30	But your other son , who wasted all your money on prostitutes , comes home , and you kill the fat calf for him ! ’
NCV	Luke	15	31	The father said to him , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and all that I have is yours .
NCV	Luke	15	32	We had to celebrate and be happy because your brother was dead , but now he is alive . He was lost , but now he is found. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Luke	16	16	“ The law of Moses and the writings of the prophets were preached until John [ a ] came . Since then the Good News about the kingdom of God is being told , and everyone tries to enter it by force .
NCV	Luke	16	2	So he called the manager in and said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give me a report of what you have done with my money , because you can ’ t be my manager any longer. ’
NCV	Luke	16	3	The manager thought to himself , ‘ What will I do since my master is taking my job away from me ? I am not strong enough to dig ditches , and I am ashamed to beg .
NCV	Luke	16	4	I know what I ’ ll do so that when I lose my job people will welcome me into their homes. ’
NCV	Luke	16	5	“ So the manager called in everyone who owed the master any money . He asked the first one , ‘ How much do you owe ? ’
NCV	Luke	16	6	He answered , ‘ Eight hundred gallons of olive oil. ’ The manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill , sit down quickly , and write four hundred gallons. ’
NCV	Luke	16	7	Then the manager asked another one , ‘ How much do you owe ? ’ He answered , ‘ One thousand bushels of wheat. ’ Then the manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill and write eight hundred bushels. ’
NCV	Luke	16	8	So , the master praised the dishonest manager for being clever . Yes , worldly people are more clever with their own kind than spiritual people are .
NCV	Luke	16	9	“ I tell you , make friends for yourselves using worldly riches so that when those riches are gone , you will be welcomed in those homes that continue forever .
NCV	Luke	16	10	Whoever can be trusted with a little can also be trusted with a lot , and whoever is dishonest with a little is dishonest with a lot .
NCV	Luke	16	11	If you can not be trusted with worldly riches , then who will trust you with true riches ?
NCV	Luke	16	12	And if you can not be trusted with things that belong to someone else , who will give you things of your own ?
NCV	Luke	16	13	“ No servant can serve two masters . The servant will hate one master and love the other , or will follow one master and refuse to follow the other . You can not serve both God and worldly riches. ” God ’ s Law Can not Be Changed
NCV	Luke	16	14	The Pharisees , who loved money , were listening to all these things and made fun of Jesus .
NCV	Luke	16	15	He said to them , “ You make yourselves look good in front of people , but God knows what is really in your hearts . What is important to people is hateful in God ’ s sight .
NCV	Luke	16	17	It would be easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest part of a letter in the law to be changed . Divorce and Remarriage
NCV	Luke	16	18	“ If a man divorces his wife and marries another woman , he is guilty of adultery , and the man who marries a divorced woman is also guilty of adultery. ” The Rich Man and Lazarus
NCV	Luke	16	19	Jesus said , “ There was a rich man who always dressed in the finest clothes and lived in luxury every day .
NCV	Luke	16	20	And a very poor man named Lazarus , whose body was covered with sores , was laid at the rich man ’ s gate .
NCV	Luke	16	21	He wanted to eat only the small pieces of food that fell from the rich man ’ s table . And the dogs would come and lick his sores .
NCV	Luke	16	22	Later , Lazarus died , and the angels carried him to the arms of Abraham . The rich man died , too , and was buried .
NCV	Luke	16	23	In the place of the dead , he was in much pain . The rich man saw Abraham far away with Lazarus at his side .
NCV	Luke	16	24	He called , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me ! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue , because I am suffering in this fire ! ’
NCV	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , ‘ Child , remember when you were alive you had the good things in life , but bad things happened to Lazarus . Now he is comforted here , and you are suffering .
NCV	Luke	16	26	Besides , there is a big pit between you and us , so no one can cross over to you , and no one can leave there and come here. ’
NCV	Luke	16	27	The rich man said , ‘ Father , then please send Lazarus to my father ’ s house .
NCV	Luke	16	28	I have five brothers , and Lazarus could warn them so that they will not come to this place of pain. ’
NCV	Luke	16	29	But Abraham said , ‘ They have the law of Moses and the writings of the prophets ; let them learn from them. ’
NCV	Luke	16	30	The rich man said , ‘ No , father Abraham ! If someone goes to them from the dead , they would believe and change their hearts and lives. ’
NCV	Luke	16	31	But Abraham said to him , ‘ If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets , they will not listen to someone who comes back from the dead. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Luke	17	17	Jesus said , “ Weren ’ t ten men healed ? Where are the other nine ?
NCV	Luke	17	2	It would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large stone around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to sin .
NCV	Luke	17	3	So be careful ! “ If another follower sins , warn him , and if he is sorry and stops sinning , forgive him .
NCV	Luke	17	4	If he sins against you seven times in one day and says that he is sorry each time , forgive him. ” How Big Is Your Faith ?
NCV	Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Give us more faith ! ”
NCV	Luke	17	6	The Lord said , “ If your faith were the size of a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Dig yourself up and plant yourself in the sea , ’ and it would obey you . Be Good Servants
NCV	Luke	17	7	“ Suppose one of you has a servant who has been plowing the ground or caring for the sheep . When the servant comes in from working in the field , would you say , ‘ Come in and sit down to eat ’ ?
NCV	Luke	17	8	No , you would say to him , ‘ Prepare something for me to eat . Then get yourself ready and serve me . After I finish eating and drinking , you can eat. ’
NCV	Luke	17	9	The servant does not get any special thanks for doing what his master commanded .
NCV	Luke	17	10	It is the same with you . When you have done everything you are told to do , you should say , ‘ We are unworthy servants ; we have only done the work we should do. ’ ” Be Thankful
NCV	Luke	17	11	While Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem , he was going through the area between Samaria and Galilee .
NCV	Luke	17	12	As he came into a small town , ten men who had a skin disease met him there . They did not come close to Jesus
NCV	Luke	17	13	but called to him , “ Jesus ! Master ! Have mercy on us ! ”
NCV	Luke	17	14	When Jesus saw the men , he said , “ Go and show yourselves to the priests. ” [ a ] As the ten men were going , they were healed .
NCV	Luke	17	15	When one of them saw that he was healed , he went back to Jesus , praising God in a loud voice .
NCV	Luke	17	16	Then he bowed down at Jesus ’ feet and thanked him . ( And this man was a Samaritan . )
NCV	Luke	17	18	Is this Samaritan the only one who came back to thank God ? ”
NCV	Luke	17	19	Then Jesus said to him , “ Stand up and go on your way . You were healed because you believed. ” God ’ s Kingdom Is Within You
NCV	Luke	17	20	Some of the Pharisees asked Jesus , “ When will the kingdom of God come ? ” Jesus answered , “ God ’ s kingdom is coming , but not in a way that you will be able to see with your eyes .
NCV	Luke	17	21	People will not say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or , ‘ There it is ! ’ because God ’ s kingdom is within [ b ] you. ”
NCV	Luke	17	22	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ The time will come when you will want very much to see one of the days of the Son of Man . But you will not see it .
NCV	Luke	17	23	People will say to you , ‘ Look , there he is ! ’ or , ‘ Look , here he is ! ’ Stay where you are ; don ’ t go away and search . When Jesus Comes Again
NCV	Luke	17	24	“ When the Son of Man comes again , he will shine like lightning , which flashes across the sky and lights it up from one side to the other .
NCV	Luke	17	25	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by the people of this time .

NCV	Luke	18	18	A certain leader asked Jesus , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to have life forever ? ”
NCV	Luke	18	2	“ In a certain town there was a judge who did not respect God or care about people .
NCV	Luke	18	3	In that same town there was a widow who kept coming to this judge , saying , ‘ Give me my rights against my enemy. ’
NCV	Luke	18	4	For a while the judge refused to help her . But afterwards , he thought to himself , ‘ Even though I don ’ t respect God or care about people ,
NCV	Luke	18	5	I will see that she gets her rights . Otherwise she will continue to bother me until I am worn out. ’ ”
NCV	Luke	18	6	The Lord said , “ Listen to what the unfair judge said .

NCV	Luke	18	8	I tell you , God will help his people quickly . But when the Son of Man comes again , will he find those on earth who believe in him ? ” Being Right with God
NCV	Luke	18	9	Jesus told this story to some people who thought they were very good and looked down on everyone else :
NCV	Luke	18	10	“ A Pharisee and a tax collector both went to the Temple to pray .
NCV	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood alone and prayed , ‘ God , I thank you that I am not like other people who steal , cheat , or take part in adultery , or even like this tax collector .
NCV	Luke	18	12	I fast [ a ] twice a week , and I give one-tenth of everything I get ! ’
NCV	Luke	18	13	“ The tax collector , standing at a distance , would not even look up to heaven . But he beat on his chest because he was so sad . He said , ‘ God , have mercy on me , a sinner. ’
NCV	Luke	18	14	I tell you , when this man went home , he was right with God , but the Pharisee was not . All who make themselves great will be made humble , but all who make themselves humble will be made great. ” Who Will Enter God ’ s Kingdom ?
NCV	Luke	18	15	Some people brought even their babies to Jesus so he could touch them . When the followers saw this , they told them to stop .
NCV	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called for the children , saying , “ Let the little children come to me . Don ’ t stop them , because the kingdom of God belongs to people who are like these children .
NCV	Luke	18	17	I tell you the truth , you must accept the kingdom of God as if you were a child , or you will never enter it. ” A Rich Man ’ s Question
NCV	Luke	18	19	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
NCV	Luke	18	20	You know the commands : ‘ You must not be guilty of adultery . You must not murder anyone . You must not steal . You must not tell lies about your neighbor . Honor your father and mother. ’ ” [ b ]
NCV	Luke	18	21	But the leader said , “ I have obeyed all these commands since I was a boy. ”
NCV	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , “ There is still one more thing you need to do . Sell everything you have and give it to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me. ”
NCV	Luke	18	23	But when the man heard this , he became very sad , because he was very rich .
NCV	Luke	18	24	Jesus looked at him and said , “ It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God .
NCV	Luke	18	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. ” Who Can Be Saved ?
NCV	Luke	18	26	When the people heard this , they asked , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NCV	Luke	18	27	Jesus answered , “ The things impossible for people are possible for God. ”
NCV	Luke	18	28	Peter said , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you. ”
NCV	Luke	18	29	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , all those who have left houses , wives , brothers , parents , or children for the kingdom of God

NCV	Luke	18	33	beat him with whips , and kill him . But on the third day , he will rise to life again. ”

NCV	Luke	18	35	As Jesus came near the city of Jericho , a blind man was sitting beside the road , begging .
NCV	Luke	18	36	When he heard the people coming down the road , he asked , “ What is happening ? ”

NCV	Luke	19	19	The king said to this servant , ‘ You can rule over five cities. ’
NCV	Luke	19	2	A man was there named Zacchaeus , who was a very important tax collector , and he was wealthy .
NCV	Luke	19	3	He wanted to see who Jesus was , but he was not able because he was too short to see above the crowd .
NCV	Luke	19	4	He ran ahead to a place where Jesus would come , and he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .
NCV	Luke	19	5	When Jesus came to that place , he looked up and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , hurry and come down ! I must stay at your house today. ”
NCV	Luke	19	6	Zacchaeus came down quickly and welcomed him gladly .

NCV	Luke	19	11	As the people were listening to this , Jesus told them a story because he was near Jerusalem and they thought God ’ s kingdom would appear immediately .
NCV	Luke	19	12	He said : “ A very important man went to a country far away to be made a king and then to return home .
NCV	Luke	19	13	So he called ten of his servants and gave a coin [ a ] to each servant . He said , ‘ Do business with this money until I get back. ’
NCV	Luke	19	14	But the people in the kingdom hated the man . So they sent a group to follow him and say , ‘ We don ’ t want this man to be our king. ’
NCV	Luke	19	15	“ But the man became king . When he returned home , he said , ‘ Call those servants who have my money so I can know how much they earned with it. ’
NCV	Luke	19	16	“ The first servant came and said , ‘ Sir , I earned ten coins with the one you gave me. ’
NCV	Luke	19	17	The king said to the servant , ‘ Excellent ! You are a good servant . Since I can trust you with small things , I will let you rule over ten of my cities. ’
NCV	Luke	19	18	“ The second servant said , ‘ Sir , I earned five coins with your one. ’
NCV	Luke	19	20	“ Then another servant came in and said to the king , ‘ Sir , here is your coin which I wrapped in a piece of cloth and hid .
NCV	Luke	19	21	I was afraid of you , because you are a hard man . You even take money that you didn ’ t earn and gather food that you didn ’ t plant. ’
NCV	Luke	19	22	Then the king said to the servant , ‘ I will condemn you by your own words , you evil servant . You knew that I am a hard man , taking money that I didn ’ t earn and gathering food that I didn ’ t plant .
NCV	Luke	19	23	Why then didn ’ t you put my money in the bank ? Then when I came back , my money would have earned some interest. ’
NCV	Luke	19	24	“ The king said to the men who were standing by , ‘ Take the coin away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten coins. ’
NCV	Luke	19	25	They said , ‘ But sir , that servant already has ten coins. ’
NCV	Luke	19	26	The king said , ‘ Those who have will be given more , but those who do not have anything will have everything taken away from them .
NCV	Luke	19	27	Now where are my enemies who didn ’ t want me to be king ? Bring them here and kill them before me. ’ ” Jesus Enters Jerusalem as a King
NCV	Luke	19	28	After Jesus said this , he went on toward Jerusalem .
NCV	Luke	19	29	As Jesus came near Bethphage and Bethany , towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives , he sent out two of his followers .
NCV	Luke	19	30	He said , “ Go to the town you can see there . When you enter it , you will find a colt tied there , which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here to me .
NCV	Luke	19	31	If anyone asks you why you are untying it , say that the Master needs it. ”
NCV	Luke	19	32	The two followers went into town and found the colt just as Jesus had told them .
NCV	Luke	19	33	As they were untying it , its owners came out and asked the followers , “ Why are you untying our colt ? ”
NCV	Luke	19	34	The followers answered , “ The Master needs it. ”
NCV	Luke	19	35	So they brought it to Jesus , threw their coats on the colt ’ s back , and put Jesus on it .
NCV	Luke	19	36	As Jesus rode toward Jerusalem , others spread their coats on the road before him .
NCV	Luke	19	37	As he was coming close to Jerusalem , on the way down the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of followers began joyfully shouting praise to God for all the miracles they had seen .
NCV	Luke	19	38	They said , “ God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord ! Psalm 118:26 There is peace in heaven and glory to God ! ”
NCV	Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , tell your followers not to say these things. ”
NCV	Luke	19	40	But Jesus answered , “ I tell you , if my followers didn ’ t say these things , then the stones would cry out. ” Jesus Cries for Jerusalem
NCV	Luke	19	41	As Jesus came near Jerusalem , he saw the city and cried for it ,
NCV	Luke	19	42	saying , “ I wish you knew today what would bring you peace . But now it is hidden from you .
NCV	Luke	19	43	The time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and will hold you in on all sides .
NCV	Luke	19	44	They will destroy you and all your people , and not one stone will be left on another . All this will happen because you did not recognize the time when God came to save you. ” Jesus Goes to the Temple
NCV	Luke	19	45	Jesus went into the Temple and began to throw out the people who were selling things there .
NCV	Luke	19	46	He said , “ It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ My Temple will be a house for prayer. ’ [ b ] But you have changed it into a ‘ hideout for robbers ’ ! ” [ c ]

NCV	Luke	20	20	So they watched Jesus and sent some spies who acted as if they were sincere . They wanted to trap Jesus in saying something wrong so they could hand him over to the authority and power of the governor .
NCV	Luke	20	2	saying , “ Tell us what authority you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
NCV	Luke	20	3	Jesus answered , “ I will also ask you a question . Tell me :
NCV	Luke	20	4	When John baptized people , was that authority from God or just from other people ? ”
NCV	Luke	20	5	They argued about this , saying , “ If we answer , ‘ John ’ s baptism was from God , ’ Jesus will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
NCV	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ It was from other people , ’ all the people will stone us to death , because they believe John was a prophet. ”
NCV	Luke	20	7	So they answered that they didn ’ t know where it came from .
NCV	Luke	20	8	Jesus said to them , “ Then I won ’ t tell you what authority I have to do these things. ” A Story About God ’ s Son
NCV	Luke	20	9	Then Jesus told the people this story : “ A man planted a vineyard and leased it to some farmers . Then he went away for a long time .
NCV	Luke	20	10	When it was time for the grapes to be picked , he sent a servant to the farmers to get some of the grapes . But they beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed .
NCV	Luke	20	11	Then he sent another servant . They beat this servant also , and showed no respect for him , and sent him away empty-handed .
NCV	Luke	20	12	So the man sent a third servant . The farmers wounded him and threw him out .
NCV	Luke	20	13	The owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What will I do now ? I will send my son whom I love . Maybe they will respect him. ’
NCV	Luke	20	14	But when the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This son will inherit the vineyard . If we kill him , it will be ours. ’
NCV	Luke	20	15	So the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him . “ What will the owner of this vineyard do to them ?
NCV	Luke	20	16	He will come and kill those farmers and will give the vineyard to other farmers. ” When the people heard this story , they said , “ Let this never happen ! ”
NCV	Luke	20	17	But Jesus looked at them and said , “ Then what does this verse mean : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone ’ ? Psalm 118:22
NCV	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken , and the person on whom it falls , that person will be crushed ! ”
NCV	Luke	20	19	The teachers of the law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus at once , because they knew the story was about them . But they were afraid of what the people would do . Is It Right to Pay Taxes or Not ?
NCV	Luke	20	21	So the spies asked Jesus , “ Teacher , we know that what you say and teach is true . You pay no attention to who people are , and you always teach the truth about God ’ s way .
NCV	Luke	20	22	Tell us , is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
NCV	Luke	20	23	But Jesus , knowing they were trying to trick him , said ,
NCV	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a coin . Whose image and name are on it ? ” They said , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NCV	Luke	20	25	Jesus said to them , “ Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and give to God the things that are God ’ s. ”
NCV	Luke	20	26	So they were not able to trap Jesus in anything he said in the presence of the people . And being amazed at his answer , they became silent . Some Sadducees Try to Trick Jesus
NCV	Luke	20	27	Some Sadducees , who believed people would not rise from the dead , came to Jesus .
NCV	Luke	20	28	They asked , “ Teacher , Moses wrote that if a man ’ s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children , then that man must marry the widow and have children for his brother .
NCV	Luke	20	29	Once there were seven brothers . The first brother married and died , but had no children .
NCV	Luke	20	30	Then the second brother married the widow , and he died .
NCV	Luke	20	31	And the third brother married the widow , and he died . The same thing happened with all seven brothers ; they died and had no children .
NCV	Luke	20	32	Finally , the woman died also .
NCV	Luke	20	33	Since all seven brothers had married her , whose wife will she be when people rise from the dead ? ”
NCV	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them , “ On earth , people marry and are given to someone to marry .
NCV	Luke	20	35	But those who will be worthy to be raised from the dead and live again will not marry , nor will they be given to someone to marry .
NCV	Luke	20	36	In that life they are like angels and can not die . They are children of God , because they have been raised from the dead .
NCV	Luke	20	37	Even Moses clearly showed that the dead are raised to life . When he wrote about the burning bush , [ a ] he said that the Lord is ‘ the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ’ [ b ]
NCV	Luke	20	38	God is the God of the living , not the dead , because all people are alive to him. ”
NCV	Luke	20	39	Some of the teachers of the law said , “ Teacher , your answer was good. ”
NCV	Luke	20	40	No one was brave enough to ask him another question . Is the Christ the Son of David ?
NCV	Luke	20	41	Then Jesus said , “ Why do people say that the Christ is the Son of David ?
NCV	Luke	20	42	In the book of Psalms , David himself says : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit by me at my right side ,
NCV	Luke	20	43	until I put your enemies under your control. ” ’ [ c ] Psalm 110:1
NCV	Luke	20	44	David calls the Christ ‘ Lord , ’ so how can the Christ be his son ? ” Jesus Accuses Some Leaders
NCV	Luke	20	45	While all the people were listening , Jesus said to his followers ,
NCV	Luke	20	46	“ Beware of the teachers of the law . They like to walk around wearing fancy clothes , and they love for people to greet them with respect in the marketplaces . They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and at feasts .
NCV	Luke	20	47	But they cheat widows and steal their houses and then try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers . They will receive a greater punishment. ” Footnotes - 20:37 burning bush Read Exodus 3:1–12 in the Old Testament . - 20:37 ‘ the God of . . .

NCV	Luke	21	21	At that time , the people in Judea should run away to the mountains . The people in Jerusalem must get out , and those who are near the city should not go in .
NCV	Luke	21	2	Then he saw a poor widow putting two small copper coins into the box .
NCV	Luke	21	3	He said , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow gave more than all those rich people .
NCV	Luke	21	4	They gave only what they did not need . This woman is very poor , but she gave all she had to live on. ” The Temple Will Be Destroyed
NCV	Luke	21	5	Some people were talking about the Temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts offered to God . But Jesus said ,
NCV	Luke	21	6	“ As for these things you are looking at , the time will come when not one stone will be left on another . Every stone will be thrown down. ”
NCV	Luke	21	7	They asked Jesus , “ Teacher , when will these things happen ? What will be the sign that they are about to take place ? ”
NCV	Luke	21	8	Jesus said , “ Be careful so you are not fooled . Many people will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the One ’ and , ‘ The time has come ! ’ But don ’ t follow them .
NCV	Luke	21	9	When you hear about wars and riots , don ’ t be afraid , because these things must happen first , but the end will come later. ”
NCV	Luke	21	10	Then he said to them , “ Nations will fight against other nations , and kingdoms against other kingdoms .
NCV	Luke	21	11	In various places there will be great earthquakes , sicknesses , and a lack of food . Fearful events and great signs will come from heaven .
NCV	Luke	21	12	“ But before all these things happen , people will arrest you and treat you cruelly . They will judge you in their synagogues and put you in jail and force you to stand before kings and governors , because you follow me .
NCV	Luke	21	13	But this will give you an opportunity to tell about me .
NCV	Luke	21	14	Make up your minds not to worry ahead of time about what you will say .
NCV	Luke	21	15	I will give you the wisdom to say things that none of your enemies will be able to stand against or prove wrong .
NCV	Luke	21	16	Even your parents , brothers , relatives , and friends will turn against you , and they will kill some of you .
NCV	Luke	21	17	All people will hate you because you follow me .
NCV	Luke	21	18	But none of these things can really harm you .
NCV	Luke	21	19	By continuing to have faith you will save your lives . Jerusalem Will Be Destroyed
NCV	Luke	21	20	“ When you see armies all around Jerusalem , you will know it will soon be destroyed .
NCV	Luke	21	22	These are the days of punishment to bring about all that is written in the Scriptures .
NCV	Luke	21	23	How terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or have nursing babies ! Great trouble will come upon this land , and God will be angry with these people .
NCV	Luke	21	24	They will be killed by the sword and taken as prisoners to all nations . Jerusalem will be crushed by non-Jewish people until their time is over . Don ’ t Fear
NCV	Luke	21	25	“ There will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars . On earth , nations will be afraid and confused because of the roar and fury of the sea .
NCV	Luke	21	26	People will be so afraid they will faint , wondering what is happening to the world , because the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
NCV	Luke	21	27	Then people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
NCV	Luke	21	28	When these things begin to happen , look up and hold your heads high , because the time when God will free you is near ! ” Jesus ’ Words Will Live Forever
NCV	Luke	21	29	Then Jesus told this story : “ Look at the fig tree and all the other trees .
NCV	Luke	21	30	When their leaves appear , you know that summer is near .
NCV	Luke	21	31	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you will know that God ’ s kingdom is near .
NCV	Luke	21	32	“ I tell you the truth , all these things will happen while the people of this time are still living .
NCV	Luke	21	33	Earth and sky will be destroyed , but the words I have spoken will never be destroyed . Be Ready All the Time
NCV	Luke	21	34	“ Be careful not to spend your time feasting , drinking , or worrying about worldly things . If you do , that day might come on you suddenly ,
NCV	Luke	21	35	like a trap on all people on earth .
NCV	Luke	21	36	So be ready all the time . Pray that you will be strong enough to escape all these things that will happen and that you will be able to stand before the Son of Man. ”
NCV	Luke	21	37	During the day , Jesus taught the people in the Temple , and at night he went out of the city and stayed on the Mount of Olives .

NCV	Luke	22	22	What God has planned for the Son of Man will happen , but how terrible it will be for that one who turns against the Son of Man. ”
NCV	Luke	22	2	The leading priests and teachers of the law were trying to find a way to kill Jesus , because they were afraid of the people .
NCV	Luke	22	3	Satan entered Judas Iscariot , one of Jesus ’ twelve apostles .
NCV	Luke	22	4	Judas went to the leading priests and some of the soldiers who guarded the Temple and talked to them about a way to hand Jesus over to them .
NCV	Luke	22	5	They were pleased and agreed to give Judas money .
NCV	Luke	22	6	He agreed and watched for the best time to hand Jesus over to them when he was away from the crowd . Jesus Eats the Passover Meal
NCV	Luke	22	7	The Day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover lambs had to be sacrificed .
NCV	Luke	22	8	Jesus said to Peter and John , “ Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat. ”
NCV	Luke	22	9	They asked , “ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ”
NCV	Luke	22	10	Jesus said to them , “ After you go into the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him into the house that he enters ,
NCV	Luke	22	11	and tell the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says : “ Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover meal with my followers ? ” ’
NCV	Luke	22	12	Then he will show you a large , furnished room upstairs . Prepare the Passover meal there. ”
NCV	Luke	22	13	So Peter and John left and found everything as Jesus had said . And they prepared the Passover meal . The Lord ’ s Supper
NCV	Luke	22	14	When the time came , Jesus and the apostles were sitting at the table .
NCV	Luke	22	15	He said to them , “ I wanted very much to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer .
NCV	Luke	22	16	I will not eat another Passover meal until it is given its true meaning in the kingdom of God. ”
NCV	Luke	22	17	Then Jesus took a cup , gave thanks , and said , “ Take this cup and share it among yourselves .

NCV	Luke	22	21	“ But one of you will turn against me , and his hand is with mine on the table .
NCV	Luke	22	23	Then the apostles asked each other which one of them would do that . Be Like a Servant
NCV	Luke	22	24	The apostles also began to argue about which one of them was the most important .
NCV	Luke	22	25	But Jesus said to them , “ The kings of the non-Jewish people rule over them , and those who have authority over others like to be called ‘ friends of the people. ’
NCV	Luke	22	26	But you must not be like that . Instead , the greatest among you should be like the youngest , and the leader should be like the servant .
NCV	Luke	22	27	Who is more important : the one sitting at the table or the one serving ? You think the one at the table is more important , but I am like a servant among you .
NCV	Luke	22	28	“ You have stayed with me through my struggles .

NCV	Luke	22	32	I have prayed that you will not lose your faith ! Help your brothers be stronger when you come back to me. ”
NCV	Luke	22	33	But Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , I am ready to go with you to prison and even to die with you ! ”
NCV	Luke	22	34	But Jesus said , “ Peter , before the rooster crows this day , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ” Be Ready for Trouble
NCV	Luke	22	35	Then Jesus said to the apostles , “ When I sent you out without a purse , a bag , or sandals , did you need anything ? ” They said , “ No. ”
NCV	Luke	22	36	He said to them , “ But now if you have a purse or a bag , carry that with you . If you don ’ t have a sword , sell your coat and buy one .
NCV	Luke	22	37	The Scripture says , ‘ He was treated like a criminal , ’ [ c ] and I tell you this scripture must have its full meaning . It was written about me , and it is happening now. ”
NCV	Luke	22	38	His followers said , “ Look , Lord , here are two swords. ” He said to them , “ That is enough. ” Jesus Prays Alone
NCV	Luke	22	39	Jesus left the city and went to the Mount of Olives , as he often did , and his followers went with him .
NCV	Luke	22	40	When he reached the place , he said to them , “ Pray for strength against temptation. ”
NCV	Luke	22	41	Then Jesus went about a stone ’ s throw away from them . He kneeled down and prayed ,
NCV	Luke	22	42	“ Father , if you are willing , take away this cup [ d ] of suffering . But do what you want , not what I want. ”
NCV	Luke	22	43	Then an angel from heaven appeared to him to strengthen him .
NCV	Luke	22	44	Being full of pain , Jesus prayed even harder . His sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground .
NCV	Luke	22	45	When he finished praying , he went to his followers and found them asleep because of their sadness .
NCV	Luke	22	46	Jesus said to them , “ Why are you sleeping ? Get up and pray for strength against temptation. ” Jesus Is Arrested
NCV	Luke	22	47	While Jesus was speaking , a crowd came up , and Judas , one of the twelve apostles , was leading them . He came close to Jesus so he could kiss him .
NCV	Luke	22	48	But Jesus said to him , “ Judas , are you using the kiss to give the Son of Man to his enemies ? ”
NCV	Luke	22	49	When those who were standing around him saw what was happening , they said , “ Lord , should we strike them with our swords ? ”
NCV	Luke	22	50	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
NCV	Luke	22	51	Jesus said , “ Stop ! No more of this. ” Then he touched the servant ’ s ear and healed him .
NCV	Luke	22	52	Those who came to arrest Jesus were the leading priests , the soldiers who guarded the Temple , and the elders . Jesus said to them , “ You came out here with swords and clubs as though I were a criminal .
NCV	Luke	22	53	I was with you every day in the Temple , and you didn ’ t arrest me there . But this is your time—the time when darkness rules. ” Peter Says He Doesn ’ t Know Jesus
NCV	Luke	22	54	They arrested Jesus , and led him away , and brought him into the house of the high priest . Peter followed far behind them .
NCV	Luke	22	55	After the soldiers started a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat together , Peter sat with them .
NCV	Luke	22	56	A servant girl saw Peter sitting there in the firelight , and looking closely at him , she said , “ This man was also with him. ”
NCV	Luke	22	57	But Peter said this was not true ; he said , “ Woman , I don ’ t know him. ”
NCV	Luke	22	58	A short time later , another person saw Peter and said , “ You are also one of them. ” But Peter said , “ Man , I am not ! ”
NCV	Luke	22	59	About an hour later , another man insisted , “ Certainly this man was with him , because he is from Galilee , too. ”
NCV	Luke	22	60	But Peter said , “ Man , I don ’ t know what you are talking about ! ” At once , while Peter was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
NCV	Luke	22	61	Then the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter . And Peter remembered what the Lord had said : “ Before the rooster crows this day , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ”
NCV	Luke	22	62	Then Peter went outside and cried painfully . The People Make Fun of Jesus
NCV	Luke	22	63	The men who were guarding Jesus began making fun of him and beating him .
NCV	Luke	22	64	They blindfolded him and said , “ Prove that you are a prophet , and tell us who hit you. ”
NCV	Luke	22	65	They said many cruel things to Jesus . Jesus Before the Leaders
NCV	Luke	22	66	When day came , the council of the elders of the people , both the leading priests and the teachers of the law , came together and led Jesus to their highest court .
NCV	Luke	22	67	They said , “ If you are the Christ , tell us. ” Jesus said to them , “ If I tell you , you will not believe me .
NCV	Luke	22	68	And if I ask you , you will not answer .
NCV	Luke	22	69	But from now on , the Son of Man will sit at the right hand of the powerful God. ”
NCV	Luke	22	70	They all said , “ Then are you the Son of God ? ” Jesus said to them , “ You say that I am. ”

NCV	Luke	23	2	They began to accuse Jesus , saying , “ We caught this man telling things that mislead our people . He says that we should not pay taxes to Caesar , and he calls himself the Christ , a king. ”
NCV	Luke	23	3	Pilate asked Jesus , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus answered , “ Those are your words. ”
NCV	Luke	23	4	Pilate said to the leading priests and the people , “ I find nothing against this man. ”
NCV	Luke	23	5	They were insisting , saying , “ But Jesus makes trouble with the people , teaching all around Judea . He began in Galilee , and now he is here. ” Pilate Sends Jesus to Herod
NCV	Luke	23	6	Pilate heard this and asked if Jesus was from Galilee .
NCV	Luke	23	7	Since Jesus was under Herod ’ s authority , Pilate sent Jesus to Herod , who was in Jerusalem at that time .
NCV	Luke	23	8	When Herod saw Jesus , he was very glad , because he had heard about Jesus and had wanted to meet him for a long time . He was hoping to see Jesus work a miracle .
NCV	Luke	23	9	Herod asked Jesus many questions , but Jesus said nothing .
NCV	Luke	23	10	The leading priests and teachers of the law were standing there , strongly accusing Jesus .
NCV	Luke	23	11	After Herod and his soldiers had made fun of Jesus , they dressed him in a kingly robe and sent him back to Pilate .
NCV	Luke	23	12	In the past , Pilate and Herod had always been enemies , but on that day they became friends . Jesus Must Die
NCV	Luke	23	13	Pilate called the people together with the leading priests and the rulers .
NCV	Luke	23	14	He said to them , “ You brought this man to me , saying he makes trouble among the people . But I have questioned him before you all , and I have not found him guilty of what you say .
NCV	Luke	23	15	Also , Herod found nothing wrong with him ; he sent him back to us . Look , he has done nothing for which he should die .
NCV	Luke	23	16	So , after I punish him , I will let him go free. ” [
NCV	Luke	23	17	Every year at the Passover Feast , Pilate had to release one prisoner to the people . ] [ b ]
NCV	Luke	23	18	But the people shouted together , “ Take this man away ! Let Barabbas go free ! ”
NCV	Luke	23	19	( Barabbas was a man who was in prison for his part in a riot in the city and for murder . )
NCV	Luke	23	20	Pilate wanted to let Jesus go free and told this to the crowd .
NCV	Luke	23	21	But they shouted again , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ”
NCV	Luke	23	22	A third time Pilate said to them , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? I can find no reason to kill him . So I will have him punished and set him free. ”
NCV	Luke	23	24	Pilate decided to give them what they wanted .
NCV	Luke	23	25	He set free the man who was in jail for rioting and murder , and he handed Jesus over to them to do with him as they wished . Jesus Is Crucified

NCV	Luke	23	29	The time is coming when people will say , ‘ Blessed are the women who can not have children and who have no babies to nurse. ’
NCV	Luke	23	30	Then people will say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us ! ’ And they will say to the hills , ‘ Cover us ! ’
NCV	Luke	23	31	If they act like this now when life is good , what will happen when bad times come ? ” [ c ]
NCV	Luke	23	32	There were also two criminals led out with Jesus to be put to death .

NCV	Luke	23	51	But he had not agreed to the other leaders ’ plans and actions against Jesus . He was from the town of Arimathea and was waiting for the kingdom of God to come .
NCV	Luke	23	52	Joseph went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus .
NCV	Luke	23	53	He took the body down from the cross , wrapped it in cloth , and put it in a tomb that was cut out of a wall of rock . This tomb had never been used before .
NCV	Luke	23	54	This was late on Preparation Day , and when the sun went down , the Sabbath day would begin .
NCV	Luke	23	55	The women who had come from Galilee with Jesus followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how Jesus ’ body was laid .
NCV	Luke	23	56	Then the women left to prepare spices and perfumes . On the Sabbath day they rested , as the law of Moses commanded . Footnotes - 23:1 Pilate Pontius Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea from a.d.

NCV	Luke	24	24	So some of our group went to the tomb , too . They found it just as the women said , but they did not see Jesus. ”
NCV	Luke	24	2	They found the stone rolled away from the entrance of the tomb ,
NCV	Luke	24	3	but when they went in , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
NCV	Luke	24	4	While they were wondering about this , two men in shining clothes suddenly stood beside them .
NCV	Luke	24	5	The women were very afraid and bowed their heads to the ground . The men said to them , “ Why are you looking for a living person in this place for the dead ?
NCV	Luke	24	6	He is not here ; he has risen from the dead . Do you remember what he told you in Galilee ?
NCV	Luke	24	7	He said the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people , be crucified , and rise from the dead on the third day. ”
NCV	Luke	24	8	Then the women remembered what Jesus had said .
NCV	Luke	24	9	The women left the tomb and told all these things to the eleven apostles and the other followers .
NCV	Luke	24	10	It was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and some other women who told the apostles everything that had happened at the tomb .
NCV	Luke	24	11	But they did not believe the women , because it sounded like nonsense .
NCV	Luke	24	12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb . Bending down and looking in , he saw only the cloth that Jesus ’ body had been wrapped in . Peter went away to his home , wondering about what had happened . Jesus on the Road to Emmaus
NCV	Luke	24	13	That same day two of Jesus ’ followers were going to a town named Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem .
NCV	Luke	24	14	They were talking about everything that had happened .
NCV	Luke	24	15	While they were talking and discussing , Jesus himself came near and began walking with them ,
NCV	Luke	24	16	but they were kept from recognizing him .
NCV	Luke	24	17	Then he said , “ What are these things you are talking about while you walk ? ” The two followers stopped , looking very sad .
NCV	Luke	24	18	The one named Cleopas answered , “ Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not know what just happened there ? ”
NCV	Luke	24	19	Jesus said to them , “ What are you talking about ? ” They said , “ About Jesus of Nazareth . He was a prophet who said and did many powerful things before God and all the people .
NCV	Luke	24	20	Our leaders and the leading priests handed him over to be sentenced to death , and they crucified him .
NCV	Luke	24	21	But we were hoping that he would free Israel . Besides this , it is now the third day since this happened .
NCV	Luke	24	22	And today some women among us amazed us . Early this morning they went to the tomb ,
NCV	Luke	24	23	but they did not find his body there . They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said that Jesus was alive !
NCV	Luke	24	25	Then Jesus said to them , “ You are foolish and slow to believe everything the prophets said .
NCV	Luke	24	26	They said that the Christ must suffer these things before he enters his glory. ”
NCV	Luke	24	27	Then starting with what Moses and all the prophets had said about him , Jesus began to explain everything that had been written about himself in the Scriptures .
NCV	Luke	24	28	They came near the town of Emmaus , and Jesus acted as if he were going farther .
NCV	Luke	24	29	But they begged him , “ Stay with us , because it is late ; it is almost night. ” So he went in to stay with them .
NCV	Luke	24	30	When Jesus was at the table with them , he took some bread , gave thanks , divided it , and gave it to them .
NCV	Luke	24	31	And then , they were allowed to recognize Jesus . But when they saw who he was , he disappeared .
NCV	Luke	24	32	They said to each other , “ It felt like a fire burning in us when Jesus talked to us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us. ”
NCV	Luke	24	33	So the two followers got up at once and went back to Jerusalem . There they found the eleven apostles and others gathered .
NCV	Luke	24	34	They were saying , “ The Lord really has risen from the dead ! He showed himself to Simon. ”
NCV	Luke	24	35	Then the two followers told what had happened on the road and how they recognized Jesus when he divided the bread . Jesus Appears to His Followers
NCV	Luke	24	36	While the two followers were telling this , Jesus himself stood right in the middle of them and said , “ Peace be with you. ”
NCV	Luke	24	37	They were fearful and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost .
NCV	Luke	24	38	But Jesus said , “ Why are you troubled ? Why do you doubt what you see ?
NCV	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet . It is I myself ! Touch me and see , because a ghost does not have a living body as you see I have. ”
NCV	Luke	24	40	After Jesus said this , he showed them his hands and feet .
NCV	Luke	24	41	While they still could not believe it because they were amazed and happy , Jesus said to them , “ Do you have any food here ? ”
NCV	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of broiled fish .
NCV	Luke	24	43	While the followers watched , Jesus took the fish and ate it .
NCV	Luke	24	44	He said to them , “ Remember when I was with you before ? I said that everything written about me must happen—everything in the law of Moses , the books of the prophets , and the Psalms. ”
NCV	Luke	24	45	Then Jesus opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures .
NCV	Luke	24	46	He said to them , “ It is written that the Christ would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
NCV	Luke	24	47	and that a change of hearts and lives and forgiveness of sins would be preached in his name to all nations , starting at Jerusalem .
NCV	Luke	24	48	You are witnesses of these things .
NCV	Luke	24	49	I will send you what my Father has promised , but you must stay in Jerusalem until you have received that power from heaven. ” Jesus Goes Back to Heaven
NCV	Luke	24	50	Jesus led his followers as far as Bethany , and he raised his hands and blessed them .
NCV	Luke	24	51	While he was blessing them , he was separated from them and carried into heaven .
NCV	Luke	24	52	They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem very happy .

NCV	John	1	4	In him there was life , and that life was the light of all people .
NCV	John	1	5	The Light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overpowered [ b ] it .
NCV	John	1	6	There was a man named John [ c ] who was sent by God .
NCV	John	1	7	He came to tell people the truth about the Light so that through him all people could hear about the Light and believe .
NCV	John	1	8	John was not the Light , but he came to tell people the truth about the Light .
NCV	John	1	9	The true Light that gives light to all was coming into the world !
NCV	John	1	10	The Word was in the world , and the world was made by him , but the world did not know him .
NCV	John	1	11	He came to the world that was his own , but his own people did not accept him .
NCV	John	1	12	But to all who did accept him and believe in him he gave the right to become children of God .
NCV	John	1	13	They did not become his children in any human way—by any human parents or human desire . They were born of God .
NCV	John	1	14	The Word became a human and lived among us . We saw his glory—the glory that belongs to the only Son of the Father—and he was full of grace and truth .
NCV	John	1	15	John tells the truth about him and cries out , saying , “ This is the One I told you about : ‘ The One who comes after me is greater than I am , because he was living before me. ’ ”
NCV	John	1	16	Because he was full of grace and truth , from him we all received one gift after another .
NCV	John	1	17	The law was given through Moses , but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
NCV	John	1	18	No one has ever seen God . But God the only Son is very close to the Father , [ d ] and he has shown us what God is like . John Tells People About Jesus
NCV	John	1	19	Here is the truth John [ e ] told when the leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
NCV	John	1	20	John spoke freely and did not refuse to answer . He said , “ I am not the Christ. ”
NCV	John	1	21	So they asked him , “ Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? ” [ f ] He answered , “ No , I am not. ” “ Are you the Prophet ? ” [ g ] they asked . He answered , “ No. ”
NCV	John	1	22	Then they said , “ Who are you ? Give us an answer to tell those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
NCV	John	1	23	John told them in the words of the prophet Isaiah : “ I am the voice of one calling out in the desert : ‘ Make the road straight for the Lord. ’ ” Isaiah 40:3
NCV	John	1	24	Some Pharisees who had been sent asked John :
NCV	John	1	25	“ If you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet , why do you baptize people ? ”
NCV	John	1	26	John answered , “ I baptize with water , but there is one here with you that you don ’ t know about .
NCV	John	1	27	He is the One who comes after me . I am not good enough to untie the strings of his sandals. ”
NCV	John	1	28	This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River , where John was baptizing people .
NCV	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him . John said , “ Look , the Lamb of God , [ h ] who takes away the sin of the world !
NCV	John	1	30	This is the One I was talking about when I said , ‘ A man will come after me , but he is greater than I am , because he was living before me. ’
NCV	John	1	31	Even I did not know who he was , although I came baptizing with water so that the people of Israel would know who he is. ” 32-33 Then John said , “ I saw the Spirit come down from heaven in the form of a dove and rest on him . Until then I did not know who the Christ was . But the God who sent me to baptize with water told me , ‘ You will see the Spirit come down and rest on a man ; he is the One who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. ’
NCV	John	1	34	I have seen this happen , and I tell you the truth : This man is the Son of God. ” [ i ] The First Followers of Jesus
NCV	John	1	35	The next day John [ j ] was there again with two of his followers .
NCV	John	1	36	When he saw Jesus walking by , he said , “ Look , the Lamb of God ! ” [ k ]
NCV	John	1	37	The two followers heard John say this , so they followed Jesus .
NCV	John	1	38	When Jesus turned and saw them following him , he asked , “ What are you looking for ? ” They said , “ Rabbi , where are you staying ? ” ( “ Rabbi ” means “ Teacher. ” )
NCV	John	1	39	He answered , “ Come and see. ” So the two men went with Jesus and saw where he was staying and stayed there with him that day . It was about four o ’ clock in the afternoon .
NCV	John	1	40	One of the two men who followed Jesus after they heard John speak about him was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
NCV	John	1	41	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and say to him , “ We have found the Messiah. ” ( “ Messiah ” means “ Christ. ” )
NCV	John	1	42	Then Andrew took Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon son of John . You will be called Cephas. ” ( “ Cephas ” means “ Peter. ” [ l ] )
NCV	John	1	43	The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , “ Follow me. ”
NCV	John	1	44	Philip was from the town of Bethsaida , where Andrew and Peter lived .
NCV	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the man that Moses wrote about in the law , and the prophets also wrote about him . He is Jesus , the son of Joseph , from Nazareth. ”
NCV	John	1	46	But Nathanael said to Philip , “ Can anything good come from Nazareth ? ” Philip answered , “ Come and see. ”
NCV	John	1	47	As Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , he said , “ Here is truly an Israelite . There is nothing false in him. ”
NCV	John	1	48	Nathanael asked , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered , “ I saw you when you were under the fig tree , before Philip told you about me. ”
NCV	John	1	49	Then Nathanael said to Jesus , “ Teacher , you are the Son of God ; you are the King of Israel. ”
NCV	John	1	50	Jesus said to Nathanael , “ Do you believe simply because I told you I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see greater things than that. ”
NCV	John	1	51	And Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the truth , you will all see heaven open and ‘ angels of God going up and coming down ’ [ m ] on the Son of Man. ” Footnotes - 1:1 Word The Greek word is “ logos , ” meaning any kind of communication ; it could be translated “ message. ” Here , it means Christ , because Christ was the way God told people about himself . - 1:5 overpowered This can also be translated , “ understood. ” - 1:6 John John the Baptist , who preached to people about Christ ’ s coming ( Matthew

NCV	John	2	2	and Jesus and his followers were also invited to the wedding .
NCV	John	2	3	When all the wine was gone , Jesus ’ mother said to him , “ They have no more wine. ”
NCV	John	2	4	Jesus answered , “ Dear woman , why come to me ? My time has not yet come. ”
NCV	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you to do. ”
NCV	John	2	6	In that place there were six stone water jars that the Jews used in their washing ceremony . [ a ] Each jar held about twenty or thirty gallons .
NCV	John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill the jars with water. ” So they filled the jars to the top .
NCV	John	2	8	Then he said to them , “ Now take some out and give it to the master of the feast. ” So they took the water to the master .
NCV	John	2	9	When he tasted it , the water had become wine . He did not know where the wine came from , but the servants who had brought the water knew . The master of the wedding called the bridegroom
NCV	John	2	10	and said to him , “ People always serve the best wine first . Later , after the guests have been drinking awhile , they serve the cheaper wine . But you have saved the best wine till now. ”
NCV	John	2	11	So in Cana of Galilee Jesus did his first miracle . There he showed his glory , and his followers believed in him . Jesus in the Temple
NCV	John	2	12	After this , Jesus went to the town of Capernaum with his mother , brothers , and followers . They stayed there for just a few days .
NCV	John	2	13	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover Feast , Jesus went to Jerusalem .
NCV	John	2	14	In the Temple he found people selling cattle , sheep , and doves . He saw others sitting at tables , exchanging different kinds of money .
NCV	John	2	15	Jesus made a whip out of cords and forced all of them , both the sheep and cattle , to leave the Temple . He turned over the tables and scattered the money of those who were exchanging it .
NCV	John	2	16	Then he said to those who were selling pigeons , “ Take these things out of here ! Don ’ t make my Father ’ s house a place for buying and selling ! ”
NCV	John	2	17	When this happened , the followers remembered what was written in the Scriptures : “ My strong love for your Temple completely controls me. ” [ b ]
NCV	John	2	18	Some of his people said to Jesus , “ Show us a miracle to prove you have the right to do these things. ”
NCV	John	2	19	Jesus answered them , “ Destroy this temple , and I will build it again in three days. ”
NCV	John	2	20	They answered , “ It took forty-six years to build this Temple ! Do you really believe you can build it again in three days ? ”
NCV	John	2	21	( But the temple Jesus meant was his own body .
NCV	John	2	22	After Jesus was raised from the dead , his followers remembered that Jesus had said this . Then they believed the Scripture and the words Jesus had said . )
NCV	John	2	23	When Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Feast , many people believed in him because they saw the miracles he did .
NCV	John	2	24	But Jesus did not believe in them because he knew them all .
NCV	John	2	25	He did not need anyone to tell him about people , because he knew what was in people ’ s minds .

NCV	John	3	3	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , unless you are born again , you can not be in God ’ s kingdom. ”
NCV	John	3	2	One night Nicodemus came to Jesus and said , “ Teacher , we know you are a teacher sent from God , because no one can do the miracles you do unless God is with him. ”
NCV	John	3	4	Nicodemus said , “ But if a person is already old , how can he be born again ? He can not enter his mother ’ s womb again . So how can a person be born a second time ? ”
NCV	John	3	5	But Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , unless you are born from water and the Spirit , you can not enter God ’ s kingdom .
NCV	John	3	6	Human life comes from human parents , but spiritual life comes from the Spirit .
NCV	John	3	7	Don ’ t be surprised when I tell you , ‘ You must all be born again. ’
NCV	John	3	8	The wind blows where it wants to and you hear the sound of it , but you don ’ t know where the wind comes from or where it is going . It is the same with every person who is born from the Spirit. ”
NCV	John	3	9	Nicodemus asked , “ How can this happen ? ”
NCV	John	3	10	Jesus said , “ You are an important teacher in Israel , and you don ’ t understand these things ?
NCV	John	3	11	I tell you the truth , we talk about what we know , and we tell about what we have seen , but you don ’ t accept what we tell you .
NCV	John	3	12	I have told you about things here on earth , and you do not believe me . So you will not believe me if I tell you about things of heaven .
NCV	John	3	13	The only one who has ever gone up to heaven is the One who came down from heaven—the Son of Man . [ a ]
NCV	John	3	14	“ Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert , [ b ] the Son of Man must also be lifted up .
NCV	John	3	15	So that everyone who believes can have eternal life in him .
NCV	John	3	16	“ God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost , but have eternal life .
NCV	John	3	17	God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world guilty , but to save the world through him .
NCV	John	3	18	People who believe in God ’ s Son are not judged guilty . Those who do not believe have already been judged guilty , because they have not believed in God ’ s one and only Son .
NCV	John	3	19	They are judged by this fact : The Light has come into the world , but they did not want light . They wanted darkness , because they were doing evil things .
NCV	John	3	20	All who do evil hate the light and will not come to the light , because it will show all the evil things they do .
NCV	John	3	21	But those who follow the true way come to the light , and it shows that the things they do were done through God. ” Jesus and John the Baptist
NCV	John	3	22	After this , Jesus and his followers went into the area of Judea , where he stayed with his followers and baptized people .
NCV	John	3	23	John was also baptizing in Aenon , near Salim , because there was plenty of water there . People were going there to be baptized .
NCV	John	3	24	( This was before John was put into prison . )
NCV	John	3	25	Some of John ’ s followers had an argument with a Jew about religious washing . [ c ]
NCV	John	3	26	So they came to John and said , “ Teacher , remember the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River , the one you spoke about so much ? He is baptizing , and everyone is going to him. ”
NCV	John	3	27	John answered , “ A man can get only what God gives him .
NCV	John	3	28	You yourselves heard me say , ‘ I am not the Christ , but I am the one sent to prepare the way for him. ’
NCV	John	3	29	The bride belongs only to the bridegroom . But the friend who helps the bridegroom stands by and listens to him . He is thrilled that he gets to hear the bridegroom ’ s voice . In the same way , I am really happy .

NCV	John	3	31	“ The One who comes from above is greater than all . The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and talks about things on the earth . But the One who comes from heaven is greater than all .

NCV	John	4	4	But on the way he had to go through the country of Samaria .
NCV	John	4	2	although Jesus himself did not baptize people , but his followers did .
NCV	John	4	3	Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard about him , so he left Judea and went back to Galilee .
NCV	John	4	5	In Samaria Jesus came to the town called Sychar , which is near the field Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
NCV	John	4	6	Jacob ’ s well was there . Jesus was tired from his long trip , so he sat down beside the well . It was about twelve o ’ clock noon .
NCV	John	4	7	When a Samaritan woman came to the well to get some water , Jesus said to her , “ Please give me a drink. ”
NCV	John	4	8	( This happened while Jesus ’ followers were in town buying some food . )
NCV	John	4	9	The woman said , “ I am surprised that you ask me for a drink , since you are a Jewish man and I am a Samaritan woman. ” ( Jewish people are not friends with Samaritans . [ a ] )
NCV	John	4	10	Jesus said , “ If you only knew the free gift of God and who it is that is asking you for water , you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water. ”
NCV	John	4	11	The woman said , “ Sir , where will you get this living water ? The well is very deep , and you have nothing to get water with .
NCV	John	4	12	Are you greater than Jacob , our father , who gave us this well and drank from it himself along with his sons and flocks ? ”
NCV	John	4	13	Jesus answered , “ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again ,
NCV	John	4	14	but whoever drinks the water I give will never be thirsty . The water I give will become a spring of water gushing up inside that person , giving eternal life. ”
NCV	John	4	15	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water so I will never be thirsty again and will not have to come back here to get more water. ”
NCV	John	4	16	Jesus told her , “ Go get your husband and come back here. ”
NCV	John	4	17	The woman answered , “ I have no husband. ” Jesus said to her , “ You are right to say you have no husband .
NCV	John	4	18	Really you have had five husbands , and the man you live with now is not your husband . You told the truth. ”
NCV	John	4	19	The woman said , “ Sir , I can see that you are a prophet .
NCV	John	4	20	Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain , but you say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship. ”
NCV	John	4	21	Jesus said , “ Believe me , woman . The time is coming when neither in Jerusalem nor on this mountain will you actually worship the Father .
NCV	John	4	22	You Samaritans worship something you don ’ t understand . We understand what we worship , because salvation comes from the Jews .
NCV	John	4	23	The time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , and that time is here already . You see , the Father too is actively seeking such people to worship him .
NCV	John	4	24	God is spirit , and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. ”
NCV	John	4	25	The woman said , “ I know that the Messiah is coming. ” ( Messiah is the One called Christ . ) “ When the Messiah comes , he will explain everything to us. ”
NCV	John	4	26	Then Jesus said , “ I am he—I , the one talking to you. ”
NCV	John	4	27	Just then his followers came back from town and were surprised to see him talking with a woman . But none of them asked , “ What do you want ? ” or “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
NCV	John	4	28	Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town . She said to the people ,
NCV	John	4	29	“ Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did . Do you think he might be the Christ ? ”
NCV	John	4	30	So the people left the town and went to see Jesus .
NCV	John	4	31	Meanwhile , his followers were begging him , “ Teacher , eat something. ”
NCV	John	4	32	But Jesus answered , “ I have food to eat that you know nothing about. ”
NCV	John	4	33	So the followers asked themselves , “ Did somebody already bring him food ? ”
NCV	John	4	34	Jesus said , “ My food is to do what the One who sent me wants me to do and to finish his work .
NCV	John	4	35	You have a saying , ‘ Four more months till harvest. ’ But I tell you , open your eyes and look at the fields ready for harvest now .
NCV	John	4	36	Already , the one who harvests is being paid and is gathering crops for eternal life . So the one who plants and the one who harvests celebrate at the same time .
NCV	John	4	37	Here the saying is true , ‘ One person plants , and another harvests. ’
NCV	John	4	38	I sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work on . Others did the work , and you get to finish up their work. ” [ b ]
NCV	John	4	39	Many of the Samaritans in that town believed in Jesus because of what the woman said : “ He told me everything I ever did. ”
NCV	John	4	40	When the Samaritans came to Jesus , they begged him to stay with them , so he stayed there two more days .
NCV	John	4	41	And many more believed because of the things he said .
NCV	John	4	42	They said to the woman , “ First we believed in Jesus because of what you said , but now we believe because we heard him ourselves . We know that this man really is the Savior of the world. ” Jesus Heals an Officer ’ s Son
NCV	John	4	43	Two days later , Jesus left and went to Galilee .
NCV	John	4	44	( Jesus had said before that a prophet is not respected in his own country . )
NCV	John	4	45	When Jesus arrived in Galilee , the people there welcomed him . They had seen all the things he did at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem , because they had been there , too .
NCV	John	4	46	Jesus went again to visit Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine . One of the king ’ s important officers lived in the city of Capernaum , and his son was sick .
NCV	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , he went to Jesus and begged him to come to Capernaum and heal his son , because his son was almost dead .
NCV	John	4	48	Jesus said to him , “ You people must see signs and miracles before you will believe in me. ”
NCV	John	4	49	The officer said , “ Sir , come before my child dies. ”
NCV	John	4	50	Jesus answered , “ Go . Your son will live. ” The man believed what Jesus told him and went home .
NCV	John	4	51	On the way the man ’ s servants came and met him and told him , “ Your son is alive. ”
NCV	John	4	52	The man asked , “ What time did my son begin to get well ? ” They answered , “ Yesterday at one o ’ clock the fever left him. ”
NCV	John	4	53	The father knew that one o ’ clock was the exact time that Jesus had said , “ Your son will live. ” So the man and all the people who lived in his house believed in Jesus .

NCV	John	5	5	A man was lying there who had been sick for thirty-eight years .
NCV	John	5	2	In Jerusalem there is a pool with five covered porches , which is called Bethesda [ a ] in the Hebrew language . [ b ] This pool is near the Sheep Gate .
NCV	John	5	3	Many sick people were lying on the porches beside the pool . Some were blind , some were crippled , and some were paralyzed [ , and they waited for the water to move .
NCV	John	5	4	Sometimes an angel of the Lord came down to the pool and stirred up the water . After the angel did this , the first person to go into the pool was healed from any sickness he had ] . [ c ]
NCV	John	5	6	When Jesus saw the man and knew that he had been sick for such a long time , Jesus asked him , “ Do you want to be well ? ”
NCV	John	5	7	The sick man answered , “ Sir , there is no one to help me get into the pool when the water starts moving . While I am coming to the water , someone else always gets in before me. ”
NCV	John	5	8	Then Jesus said , “ Stand up . Pick up your mat and walk. ”
NCV	John	5	9	And immediately the man was well ; he picked up his mat and began to walk . The day this happened was a Sabbath day .
NCV	John	5	10	So the Jews said to the man who had been healed , “ Today is the Sabbath . It is against our law for you to carry your mat on the Sabbath day. ”
NCV	John	5	11	But he answered , “ The man who made me well told me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk. ’ ”
NCV	John	5	12	Then they asked him , “ Who is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk ? ”
NCV	John	5	13	But the man who had been healed did not know who it was , because there were many people in that place , and Jesus had left .
NCV	John	5	14	Later , Jesus found the man at the Temple and said to him , “ See , you are well now . Stop sinning so that something worse does not happen to you. ”
NCV	John	5	15	Then the man left and told his people that Jesus was the one who had made him well .
NCV	John	5	16	Because Jesus was doing this on the Sabbath day , some evil people began to persecute him .
NCV	John	5	17	But Jesus said to them , “ My Father never stops working , and so I keep working , too. ”
NCV	John	5	18	This made them try still harder to kill him . They said , “ First Jesus was breaking the law about the Sabbath day . Now he says that God is his own Father , making himself equal with God ! ” Jesus Has God ’ s Authority
NCV	John	5	19	But Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , the Son can do nothing alone . The Son does only what he sees the Father doing , because the Son does whatever the Father does .
NCV	John	5	20	The Father loves the Son and shows the Son all the things he himself does . But the Father will show the Son even greater things than this so that you can all be amazed .
NCV	John	5	21	Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , so also the Son gives life to those he wants to .
NCV	John	5	22	In fact , the Father judges no one , but he has given the Son power to do all the judging
NCV	John	5	23	so that all people will honor the Son as much as they honor the Father . Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
NCV	John	5	24	“ I tell you the truth , whoever hears what I say and believes in the One who sent me has eternal life . That person will not be judged guilty but has already left death and entered life .
NCV	John	5	25	I tell you the truth , the time is coming and is already here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear will have life .
NCV	John	5	26	Life comes from the Father himself , and he has allowed the Son to have life in himself as well .
NCV	John	5	27	And the Father has given the Son the approval to judge , because he is the Son of Man .
NCV	John	5	28	Don ’ t be surprised at this : A time is coming when all who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice .
NCV	John	5	29	Then they will come out of their graves . Those who did good will rise and have life forever , but those who did evil will rise to be judged guilty . Jesus Is God ’ s Son
NCV	John	5	30	“ I can do nothing alone . I judge only the way I am told , so my judgment is fair . I don ’ t try to please myself , but I try to please the One who sent me .
NCV	John	5	31	“ If only I tell people about myself , what I say is not true .
NCV	John	5	32	But there is another who tells about me , and I know that the things he says about me are true .
NCV	John	5	33	“ You have sent people to John , and he has told you the truth .
NCV	John	5	34	It is not that I need what humans say ; I tell you this so you can be saved .
NCV	John	5	35	John was like a burning and shining lamp , and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while .
NCV	John	5	36	“ But I have a proof about myself that is greater than that of John . The things I do , which are the things my Father gave me to do , prove that the Father sent me .
NCV	John	5	37	And the Father himself who sent me has given proof about me . You have never heard his voice or seen what he looks like .
NCV	John	5	38	His teaching does not live in you , because you don ’ t believe in the One the Father sent .
NCV	John	5	39	You carefully study the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life . They do in fact tell about me ,
NCV	John	5	40	but you refuse to come to me to have that life .
NCV	John	5	41	“ I don ’ t need praise from people .
NCV	John	5	42	But I know you—I know that you don ’ t have God ’ s love in you .
NCV	John	5	43	I have come from my Father and speak for him , but you don ’ t accept me . But when another person comes , speaking only for himself , you will accept him .
NCV	John	5	44	You try to get praise from each other , but you do not try to get the praise that comes from the only God . So how can you believe ?
NCV	John	5	45	Don ’ t think that I will stand before the Father and say you are wrong . The one who says you are wrong is Moses , the one you hoped would save you .
NCV	John	5	46	If you really believed Moses , you would believe me , because Moses wrote about me .
NCV	John	5	47	But if you don ’ t believe what Moses wrote , how can you believe what I say ? ” Footnotes The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	John	6	6	( Jesus asked Philip this question to test him , because Jesus already knew what he planned to do . )
NCV	John	6	2	Many people followed him because they saw the miracles he did to heal the sick .
NCV	John	6	3	Jesus went up on a hill and sat down there with his followers .
NCV	John	6	4	It was almost the time for the Jewish Passover Feast .
NCV	John	6	5	When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him , he said to Philip , “ Where can we buy enough bread for all these people to eat ? ”
NCV	John	6	7	Philip answered , “ Someone would have to work almost a year to buy enough bread for each person to have only a little piece. ”
NCV	John	6	8	Another one of his followers , Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , said ,
NCV	John	6	9	“ Here is a boy with five loaves of barley bread and two little fish , but that is not enough for so many people. ”
NCV	John	6	10	Jesus said , “ Tell the people to sit down. ” There was plenty of grass there , and about five thousand men sat down there .
NCV	John	6	11	Then Jesus took the loaves of bread , thanked God for them , and gave them to the people who were sitting there . He did the same with the fish , giving as much as the people wanted .
NCV	John	6	12	When they had all had enough to eat , Jesus said to his followers , “ Gather the leftover pieces of fish and bread so that nothing is wasted. ”
NCV	John	6	13	So they gathered up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with the pieces left from the five barley loaves .
NCV	John	6	14	When the people saw this miracle that Jesus did , they said , “ He must truly be the Prophet [ a ] who is coming into the world. ”
NCV	John	6	15	Jesus knew that the people planned to come and take him by force and make him their king , so he left and went into the hills alone . Jesus Walks on the Water
NCV	John	6	16	That evening Jesus ’ followers went down to Lake Galilee .
NCV	John	6	17	It was dark now , and Jesus had not yet come to them . The followers got into a boat and started across the lake to Capernaum .
NCV	John	6	18	By now a strong wind was blowing , and the waves on the lake were getting bigger .
NCV	John	6	19	When they had rowed the boat about three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the water , coming toward the boat . The followers were afraid ,
NCV	John	6	20	but Jesus said to them , “ It is I . Do not be afraid. ”
NCV	John	6	21	Then they were glad to take him into the boat . At once the boat came to land at the place where they wanted to go . The People Seek Jesus
NCV	John	6	22	The next day the people who had stayed on the other side of the lake knew that Jesus had not gone in the boat with his followers but that they had left without him . And they knew that only one boat had been there .
NCV	John	6	23	But then some boats came from Tiberias and landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
NCV	John	6	24	When the people saw that Jesus and his followers were not there now , they got into boats and went to Capernaum to find Jesus . Jesus , the Bread of Life
NCV	John	6	25	When the people found Jesus on the other side of the lake , they asked him , “ Teacher , when did you come here ? ”
NCV	John	6	26	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , you aren ’ t looking for me because you saw me do miracles . You are looking for me because you ate the bread and were satisfied .
NCV	John	6	27	Don ’ t work for the food that spoils . Work for the food that stays good always and gives eternal life . The Son of Man will give you this food , because on him God the Father has put his power. ”
NCV	John	6	28	The people asked Jesus , “ What are the things God wants us to do ? ”
NCV	John	6	29	Jesus answered , “ The work God wants you to do is this : Believe the One he sent. ”
NCV	John	6	30	So the people asked , “ What miracle will you do ? If we see a miracle , we will believe you . What will you do ?
NCV	John	6	31	Our ancestors ate the manna in the desert . This is written in the Scriptures : ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ ” [ b ]
NCV	John	6	32	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , it was not Moses who gave you bread from heaven ; it is my Father who is giving you the true bread from heaven .
NCV	John	6	33	God ’ s bread is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ”
NCV	John	6	34	The people said , “ Sir , give us this bread always. ”
NCV	John	6	35	Then Jesus said , “ I am the bread that gives life . Whoever comes to me will never be hungry , and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
NCV	John	6	36	But as I told you before , you have seen me and still don ’ t believe .
NCV	John	6	37	The Father gives me the people who are mine . Every one of them will come to me , and I will always accept them .
NCV	John	6	38	I came down from heaven to do what God wants me to do , not what I want to do .
NCV	John	6	39	Here is what the One who sent me wants me to do : I must not lose even one whom God gave me , but I must raise them all on the last day .
NCV	John	6	40	Those who see the Son and believe in him have eternal life , and I will raise them on the last day . This is what my Father wants. ”
NCV	John	6	41	Some people began to complain about Jesus because he said , “ I am the bread that comes down from heaven. ”
NCV	John	6	42	They said , “ This is Jesus , the son of Joseph . We know his father and mother . How can he say , ‘ I came down from heaven ’ ? ”
NCV	John	6	43	But Jesus answered , “ Stop complaining to each other .
NCV	John	6	44	The Father is the One who sent me . No one can come to me unless the Father draws him to me , and I will raise that person up on the last day .
NCV	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets , ‘ They will all be taught by God. ’ [ c ] Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me .
NCV	John	6	46	No one has seen the Father except the One who is from God ; only he has seen the Father .
NCV	John	6	47	I tell you the truth , whoever believes has eternal life .
NCV	John	6	48	I am the bread that gives life .
NCV	John	6	49	Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert , but still they died .
NCV	John	6	50	Here is the bread that comes down from heaven . Anyone who eats this bread will never die .
NCV	John	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Anyone who eats this bread will live forever . This bread is my flesh , which I will give up so that the world may have life. ”
NCV	John	6	52	Then the evil people began to argue among themselves , saying , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
NCV	John	6	53	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , you must eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood . Otherwise , you won ’ t have real life in you .
NCV	John	6	54	Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life , and I will raise them up on the last day .
NCV	John	6	55	My flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
NCV	John	6	56	Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me , and I live in them .
NCV	John	6	57	The living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father . So whoever eats me will live because of me .
NCV	John	6	58	I am not like the bread your ancestors ate . They ate that bread and still died . I am the bread that came down from heaven , and whoever eats this bread will live forever. ”
NCV	John	6	59	Jesus said all these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum . The Words of Eternal Life
NCV	John	6	60	When the followers of Jesus heard this , many of them said , “ This teaching is hard . Who can accept it ? ”
NCV	John	6	61	Knowing that his followers were complaining about this , Jesus said , “ Does this teaching bother you ?
NCV	John	6	62	Then will it also bother you to see the Son of Man going back to the place where he came from ?
NCV	John	6	63	It is the Spirit that gives life . The flesh doesn ’ t give life . The words I told you are spirit , and they give life .
NCV	John	6	64	But some of you don ’ t believe. ” ( Jesus knew from the beginning who did not believe and who would turn against him . )
NCV	John	6	65	Jesus said , “ That is the reason I said , ‘ If the Father does not bring a person to me , that one can not come. ’ ”
NCV	John	6	66	After Jesus said this , many of his followers left him and stopped following him .
NCV	John	6	67	Jesus asked the twelve followers , “ Do you want to leave , too ? ”
NCV	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , who would we go to ? You have the words that give eternal life .
NCV	John	6	69	We believe and know that you are the Holy One from God. ”
NCV	John	6	70	Then Jesus answered , “ I chose all twelve of you , but one of you is a devil. ”
NCV	John	6	71	Jesus was talking about Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . Judas was one of the twelve , but later he was going to turn against Jesus .

NCV	John	7	7	The world can not hate you , but it hates me , because I tell it the evil things it does .
NCV	John	7	2	It was time for the Feast of Shelters .
NCV	John	7	3	So Jesus ’ brothers said to him , “ You should leave here and go to Judea so your followers there can see the miracles you do .
NCV	John	7	4	Anyone who wants to be well known does not hide what he does . If you are doing these things , show yourself to the world. ”
NCV	John	7	5	( Even Jesus ’ brothers did not believe in him . )
NCV	John	7	6	Jesus said to his brothers , “ The right time for me has not yet come , but any time is right for you .
NCV	John	7	8	So you go to the feast . I will not go yet [ a ] to this feast , because the right time for me has not yet come. ”
NCV	John	7	9	After saying this , Jesus stayed in Galilee .
NCV	John	7	10	But after Jesus ’ brothers had gone to the feast , Jesus went also . But he did not let people see him .
NCV	John	7	11	At the feast some people were looking for him and saying , “ Where is that man ? ”
NCV	John	7	12	Within the large crowd there , many people were whispering to each other about Jesus . Some said , “ He is a good man. ” Others said , “ No , he fools the people. ”
NCV	John	7	13	But no one was brave enough to talk about Jesus openly , because they were afraid of the elders . Jesus Teaches at the Feast
NCV	John	7	14	When the feast was about half over , Jesus went to the Temple and began to teach .
NCV	John	7	15	The people were amazed and said , “ This man has never studied in school . How did he learn so much ? ”
NCV	John	7	16	Jesus answered , “ The things I teach are not my own , but they come from him who sent me .
NCV	John	7	17	If people choose to do what God wants , they will know that my teaching comes from God and not from me .
NCV	John	7	18	Those who teach their own ideas are trying to get honor for themselves . But those who try to bring honor to the one who sent them speak the truth , and there is nothing false in them .
NCV	John	7	19	Moses gave you the law , [ b ] but none of you obeys that law . Why are you trying to kill me ? ”
NCV	John	7	20	The people answered , “ A demon has come into you . We are not trying to kill you. ”
NCV	John	7	21	Jesus said to them , “ I did one miracle , and you are all amazed .
NCV	John	7	22	Moses gave you the law about circumcision . ( But really Moses did not give you circumcision ; it came from our ancestors . ) And yet you circumcise a baby boy on a Sabbath day .
NCV	John	7	23	If a baby boy can be circumcised on a Sabbath day to obey the law of Moses , why are you angry at me for healing a person ’ s whole body on the Sabbath day ?
NCV	John	7	24	Stop judging by the way things look , but judge by what is really right. ” Is Jesus the Christ ?
NCV	John	7	25	Then some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said , “ This is the man they are trying to kill .
NCV	John	7	26	But he is teaching where everyone can see and hear him , and no one is trying to stop him . Maybe the leaders have decided he really is the Christ .
NCV	John	7	27	But we know where this man is from . Yet when the real Christ comes , no one will know where he comes from. ”
NCV	John	7	28	Jesus , teaching in the Temple , cried out , “ Yes , you know me , and you know where I am from . But I have not come by my own authority . I was sent by the One who is true , whom you don ’ t know .
NCV	John	7	29	But I know him , because I am from him , and he sent me. ”
NCV	John	7	30	When Jesus said this , they tried to seize him . But no one was able to touch him , because it was not yet the right time .
NCV	John	7	31	But many of the people believed in Jesus . They said , “ When the Christ comes , will he do more miracles than this man has done ? ” The Leaders Try to Arrest Jesus
NCV	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus . So the leading priests and the Pharisees sent some Temple guards to arrest him .
NCV	John	7	33	Jesus said , “ I will be with you a little while longer . Then I will go back to the One who sent me .
NCV	John	7	34	You will look for me , but you will not find me . And you can not come where I am. ”
NCV	John	7	35	Some people said to each other , “ Where will this man go so we can not find him ? Will he go to the Greek cities where our people live and teach the Greek people there ?
NCV	John	7	36	What did he mean when he said , ‘ You will look for me , but you will not find me , ’ and ‘ You can not come where I am ’ ? ” Jesus Talks About the Spirit
NCV	John	7	37	On the last and most important day of the feast Jesus stood up and said in a loud voice , “ Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink .
NCV	John	7	38	If anyone believes in me , rivers of living water will flow out from that person ’ s heart , as the Scripture says. ”
NCV	John	7	39	Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit . The Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus had not yet been raised to glory . But later , those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit . The People Argue About Jesus
NCV	John	7	40	When the people heard Jesus ’ words , some of them said , “ This man really is the Prophet. ” [ c ]
NCV	John	7	41	Others said , “ He is the Christ. ” Still others said , “ The Christ will not come from Galilee .
NCV	John	7	42	The Scripture says that the Christ will come from David ’ s family and from Bethlehem , the town where David lived. ”
NCV	John	7	43	So the people did not agree with each other about Jesus .
NCV	John	7	44	Some of them wanted to arrest him , but no one was able to touch him . Some Leaders Won ’ t Believe
NCV	John	7	45	The Temple guards went back to the leading priests and the Pharisees , who asked , “ Why didn ’ t you bring Jesus ? ”
NCV	John	7	46	The guards answered , “ The words he says are greater than the words of any other person who has ever spoken ! ”
NCV	John	7	47	The Pharisees answered , “ So Jesus has fooled you also !
NCV	John	7	48	Have any of the leaders or the Pharisees believed in him ? No !
NCV	John	7	49	But these people , who know nothing about the law , are under God ’ s curse. ”
NCV	John	7	50	Nicodemus , who had gone to see Jesus before , was in that group . [ d ] He said ,
NCV	John	7	51	“ Our law does not judge a person without hearing him and knowing what he has done. ”
NCV	John	7	52	They answered , “ Are you from Galilee , too ? Study the Scriptures , and you will learn that no prophet comes from Galilee. ” Some of the earliest surviving Greek copies do not contain 7:53—8:11 . [

NCV	John	8	8	Then Jesus bent over again and wrote on the ground .
NCV	John	8	2	But early in the morning he went back to the Temple , and all the people came to him , and he sat and taught them .
NCV	John	8	3	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery . They forced her to stand before the people .
NCV	John	8	4	They said to Jesus , “ Teacher , this woman was caught having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband .
NCV	John	8	5	The law of Moses commands that we stone to death every woman who does this . What do you say we should do ? ”
NCV	John	8	6	They were asking this to trick Jesus so that they could have some charge against him . But Jesus bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger .
NCV	John	8	7	When they continued to ask Jesus their question , he raised up and said , “ Anyone here who has never sinned can throw the first stone at her. ”
NCV	John	8	9	Those who heard Jesus began to leave one by one , first the older men and then the others . Jesus was left there alone with the woman standing before him .
NCV	John	8	10	Jesus raised up again and asked her , “ Woman , where are they ? Has no one judged you guilty ? ”
NCV	John	8	11	She answered , “ No one , sir. ” Then Jesus said , “ I also don ’ t judge you guilty . You may go now , but don ’ t sin anymore. ” ] Jesus Is the Light of the World
NCV	John	8	12	Later , Jesus talked to the people again , saying , “ I am the light of the world . The person who follows me will never live in darkness but will have the light that gives life. ”
NCV	John	8	13	The Pharisees said to Jesus , “ When you talk about yourself , you are the only one to say these things are true . We can not accept what you say. ”
NCV	John	8	14	Jesus answered , “ Yes , I am saying these things about myself , but they are true . I know where I came from and where I am going . But you don ’ t know where I came from or where I am going .
NCV	John	8	15	You judge by human standards . I am not judging anyone .
NCV	John	8	16	But when I do judge , I judge truthfully , because I am not alone . The Father who sent me is with me .
NCV	John	8	17	Your own law says that when two witnesses say the same thing , you must accept what they say .
NCV	John	8	18	I am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself , and the Father who sent me is the other witness. ”
NCV	John	8	19	They asked , “ Where is your father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You don ’ t know me or my Father . If you knew me , you would know my Father , too. ”
NCV	John	8	20	Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the Temple , near where the money is kept . But no one arrested him , because the right time for him had not yet come . The People Misunderstand Jesus
NCV	John	8	21	Again , Jesus said to the people , “ I will leave you , and you will look for me , but you will die in your sins . You can not come where I am going. ”
NCV	John	8	22	So the Jews asked , “ Will he kill himself ? Is that why he said , ‘ You can not come where I am going ’ ? ”
NCV	John	8	23	Jesus said , “ You people are from here below , but I am from above . You belong to this world , but I don ’ t belong to this world .
NCV	John	8	24	So I told you that you would die in your sins . Yes , you will die in your sins if you don ’ t believe that I am he. ”
NCV	John	8	25	They asked , “ Then who are you ? ” Jesus answered , “ I am what I have told you from the beginning .
NCV	John	8	26	I have many things to say and decide about you . But I tell people only the things I have heard from the One who sent me , and he speaks the truth. ”
NCV	John	8	27	The people did not understand that he was talking to them about the Father .
NCV	John	8	28	So Jesus said to them , “ When you lift up the Son of Man , you will know that I am he . You will know that these things I do are not by my own authority but that I say only what the Father has taught me .
NCV	John	8	29	The One who sent me is with me . I always do what is pleasing to him , so he has not left me alone. ”
NCV	John	8	30	While Jesus was saying these things , many people believed in him . Freedom from Sin
NCV	John	8	31	So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him , “ If you continue to obey my teaching , you are truly my followers .
NCV	John	8	32	Then you will know the truth , and the truth will make you free. ”
NCV	John	8	33	They answered , “ We are Abraham ’ s children , and we have never been anyone ’ s slaves . So why do you say we will be free ? ”
NCV	John	8	34	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , everyone who lives in sin is a slave to sin .
NCV	John	8	35	A slave does not stay with a family forever , but a son belongs to the family forever .
NCV	John	8	36	So if the Son makes you free , you will be truly free .
NCV	John	8	37	I know you are Abraham ’ s children , but you want to kill me because you don ’ t accept my teaching .
NCV	John	8	38	I am telling you what my Father has shown me , but you do what your father has told you. ”
NCV	John	8	39	They answered , “ Our father is Abraham. ” Jesus said , “ If you were really Abraham ’ s children , you would do [ a ] the things Abraham did .
NCV	John	8	40	I am a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God , but you are trying to kill me . Abraham did nothing like that .
NCV	John	8	41	So you are doing the things your own father did. ” But they said , “ We are not like children who never knew who their father was . God is our Father ; he is the only Father we have. ”
NCV	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were really your Father , you would love me , because I came from God and now I am here . I did not come by my own authority ; God sent me .
NCV	John	8	43	You don ’ t understand what I say , because you can not accept my teaching .
NCV	John	8	44	You belong to your father the devil , and you want to do what he wants . He was a murderer from the beginning and was against the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he tells a lie , he shows what he is really like , because he is a liar and the father of lies .
NCV	John	8	45	But because I speak the truth , you don ’ t believe me .
NCV	John	8	46	Can any of you prove that I am guilty of sin ? If I am telling the truth , why don ’ t you believe me ?
NCV	John	8	47	The person who belongs to God accepts what God says . But you don ’ t accept what God says , because you don ’ t belong to God. ” Jesus Is Greater than Abraham
NCV	John	8	48	They answered , “ We say you are a Samaritan and have a demon in you . Are we not right ? ”
NCV	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I have no demon in me . I give honor to my Father , but you dishonor me .
NCV	John	8	50	I am not trying to get honor for myself . There is One who wants this honor for me , and he is the judge .
NCV	John	8	51	I tell you the truth , whoever obeys my teaching will never die. ”
NCV	John	8	52	They said to Jesus , “ Now we know that you have a demon in you ! Even Abraham and the prophets died . But you say , ‘ Whoever obeys my teaching will never die. ’
NCV	John	8	53	Do you think you are greater than our father Abraham , who died ? And the prophets died , too . Who do you think you are ? ”
NCV	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ If I give honor to myself , that honor is worth nothing . The One who gives me honor is my Father , and you say he is your God .
NCV	John	8	55	You don ’ t really know him , but I know him . If I said I did not know him , I would be a liar like you . But I do know him , and I obey what he says .
NCV	John	8	56	Your father Abraham was very happy that he would see my day . He saw that day and was glad. ”
NCV	John	8	57	They said to him , “ You have never seen Abraham ! You are not even fifty years old. ”
NCV	John	8	58	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , before Abraham was even born , I am ! ”
NCV	John	8	59	When Jesus said this , the people picked up stones to throw at him . But Jesus hid himself , and then he left the Temple . Footnotes - 8:39 If . . . do Some Greek copies read “ If you are really Abraham ’ s children , you will do. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	John	9	9	Some said , “ He is the one , ” but others said , “ No , he only looks like him. ” The man himself said , “ I am the man. ”
NCV	John	9	2	His followers asked him , “ Teacher , whose sin caused this man to be born blind—his own sin or his parents ’ sin ? ”
NCV	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ It is not this man ’ s sin or his parents ’ sin that made him blind . This man was born blind so that God ’ s power could be shown in him .
NCV	John	9	4	While it is daytime , we must continue doing the work of the One who sent me . Night is coming , when no one can work .
NCV	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world. ”
NCV	John	9	6	After Jesus said this , he spit on the ground and made some mud with it and put the mud on the man ’ s eyes .
NCV	John	9	7	Then he told the man , “ Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam. ” ( Siloam means Sent . ) So the man went , washed , and came back seeing .
NCV	John	9	8	The neighbors and some people who had earlier seen this man begging said , “ Isn ’ t this the same man who used to sit and beg ? ”
NCV	John	9	10	They asked , “ How did you get your sight ? ”
NCV	John	9	11	He answered , “ The man named Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes . Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash . So I went and washed , and then I could see. ”
NCV	John	9	12	They asked him , “ Where is this man ? ” “ I don ’ t know , ” he answered . Pharisees Question the Healing
NCV	John	9	13	Then the people took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind .
NCV	John	9	14	The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day .
NCV	John	9	15	So now the Pharisees asked the man , “ How did you get your sight ? ” He answered , “ He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and now I see. ”
NCV	John	9	16	So some of the Pharisees were saying , “ This man does not keep the Sabbath day , so he is not from God. ” But others said , “ A man who is a sinner can ’ t do miracles like these. ” So they could not agree with each other .
NCV	John	9	17	They asked the man again , “ What do you say about him since it was your eyes he opened ? ” The man answered , “ He is a prophet. ”
NCV	John	9	18	These leaders did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again . So they sent for the man ’ s parents
NCV	John	9	19	and asked them , “ Is this your son who you say was born blind ? Then how does he now see ? ”
NCV	John	9	20	His parents answered , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
NCV	John	9	21	But we don ’ t know how he can now see . We don ’ t know who opened his eyes . Ask him . He is old enough to speak for himself. ”
NCV	John	9	22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the elders , who had already decided that anyone who said Jesus was the Christ would be avoided .
NCV	John	9	23	That is why his parents said , “ He is old enough . Ask him. ”
NCV	John	9	24	So for the second time , they called the man who had been blind . They said , “ You should give God the glory by telling the truth . We know that this man is a sinner. ”
NCV	John	9	25	He answered , “ I don ’ t know if he is a sinner . One thing I do know : I was blind , and now I see. ”
NCV	John	9	26	They asked , “ What did he do to you ? How did he make you see again ? ”
NCV	John	9	27	He answered , “ I already told you , and you didn ’ t listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his followers , too ? ”
NCV	John	9	28	Then they insulted him and said , “ You are his follower , but we are followers of Moses .
NCV	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses , but we don ’ t even know where this man comes from. ”
NCV	John	9	30	The man answered , “ This is a very strange thing . You don ’ t know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
NCV	John	9	31	We all know that God does not listen to sinners , but he listens to anyone who worships and obeys him .
NCV	John	9	32	Nobody has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind .
NCV	John	9	33	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing. ”
NCV	John	9	34	They answered , “ You were born full of sin ! Are you trying to teach us ? ” And they threw him out . Spiritual Blindness
NCV	John	9	35	When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , Jesus found him and said , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
NCV	John	9	36	He asked , “ Who is the Son of Man , sir , so that I can believe in him ? ”
NCV	John	9	37	Jesus said to him , “ You have seen him . The Son of Man is the one talking with you. ”
NCV	John	9	38	He said , “ Lord , I believe ! ” Then the man worshiped Jesus .
NCV	John	9	39	Jesus said , “ I came into this world so that the world could be judged . I came so that the blind [ a ] would see and so that those who see will become blind. ”
NCV	John	9	40	Some of the Pharisees who were nearby heard Jesus say this and asked , “ Are you saying we are blind , too ? ”
NCV	John	9	41	Jesus said , “ If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin . But since you keep saying you see , your guilt remains. ” Footnotes - 9:39 blind Jesus is talking about people who are spiritually blind , not physically blind . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	John	10	10	A thief comes to steal and kill and destroy , but I came to give life—life in all its fullness .
NCV	John	10	2	The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
NCV	John	10	3	The one who guards the door opens it for him . And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
NCV	John	10	4	When he brings all his sheep out , he goes ahead of them , and they follow him because they know his voice .
NCV	John	10	5	But they will never follow a stranger . They will run away from him because they don ’ t know his voice. ”
NCV	John	10	6	Jesus told the people this story , but they did not understand what it meant . Jesus Is the Good Shepherd
NCV	John	10	7	So Jesus said again , “ I tell you the truth , I am the door for the sheep .
NCV	John	10	8	All the people who came before me were thieves and robbers . The sheep did not listen to them .
NCV	John	10	9	I am the door , and the person who enters through me will be saved and will be able to come in and go out and find pasture .
NCV	John	10	11	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep .
NCV	John	10	12	The worker who is paid to keep the sheep is different from the shepherd who owns them . When the worker sees a wolf coming , he runs away and leaves the sheep alone . Then the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them .
NCV	John	10	13	The man runs away because he is only a paid worker and does not really care about the sheep .
NCV	John	10	14	“ I am the good shepherd . I know my sheep , and my sheep know me ,
NCV	John	10	15	just as the Father knows me , and I know the Father . I give my life for the sheep .
NCV	John	10	16	I have other sheep that are not in this flock , and I must bring them also . They will listen to my voice , and there will be one flock and one shepherd .
NCV	John	10	17	The Father loves me because I give my life so that I can take it back again .
NCV	John	10	18	No one takes it away from me ; I give my own life freely . I have the right to give my life , and I have the right to take it back . This is what my Father commanded me to do. ”
NCV	John	10	19	Again the leaders did not agree with each other because of these words of Jesus .
NCV	John	10	20	Many of them said , “ A demon has come into him and made him crazy . Why listen to him ? ”
NCV	John	10	21	But others said , “ A man who is crazy with a demon does not say things like this . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? ” Jesus Is Rejected
NCV	John	10	22	The time came for the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
NCV	John	10	23	and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon ’ s Porch .
NCV	John	10	24	Some people gathered around him and said , “ How long will you make us wonder about you ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly. ”
NCV	John	10	25	Jesus answered , “ I told you already , but you did not believe . The miracles I do in my Father ’ s name show who I am .
NCV	John	10	26	But you don ’ t believe , because you are not my sheep .
NCV	John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice ; I know them , and they follow me .
NCV	John	10	28	I give them eternal life , and they will never die , and no one can steal them out of my hand .
NCV	John	10	29	My Father gave my sheep to me . He is greater than all , and no person can steal my sheep out of my Father ’ s hand .
NCV	John	10	30	The Father and I are one. ”
NCV	John	10	31	Again some of the people picked up stones to kill Jesus .
NCV	John	10	32	But he said to them , “ I have done many good works from the Father . Which of these good works are you killing me for ? ”
NCV	John	10	33	They answered , “ We are not killing you because of any good work you did , but because you speak against God . You are only a human , but you say you are the same as God ! ”
NCV	John	10	34	Jesus answered , “ It is written in your law that God said , ‘ I said , you are gods. ’ [ a ]
NCV	John	10	35	This Scripture called those people gods who received God ’ s message , and Scripture is always true .
NCV	John	10	36	So why do you say that I speak against God because I said , ‘ I am God ’ s Son ’ ? I am the one God chose and sent into the world .
NCV	John	10	37	If I don ’ t do what my Father does , then don ’ t believe me .
NCV	John	10	38	But if I do what my Father does , even though you don ’ t believe in me , believe what I do . Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. ”
NCV	John	10	39	They tried to take Jesus again , but he escaped from them .
NCV	John	10	40	Then he went back across the Jordan River to the place where John had first baptized . Jesus stayed there ,
NCV	John	10	41	and many people came to him and said , “ John never did a miracle , but everything John said about this man is true. ”
NCV	John	10	42	And in that place many believed in Jesus . Footnotes - 10:34 ‘ I . . . gods. ’ Quotation from Psalm 82:6 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	John	11	11	After Jesus said this , he added , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , but I am going there to wake him. ”
NCV	John	11	2	Mary was the woman who later put perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair . Mary ’ s brother was Lazarus , the man who was now sick .
NCV	John	11	3	So Mary and Martha sent someone to tell Jesus , “ Lord , the one you love is sick. ”
NCV	John	11	4	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ This sickness will not end in death . It is for the glory of God , to bring glory to the Son of God. ”
NCV	John	11	5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
NCV	John	11	6	But when he heard that Lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was for two more days .
NCV	John	11	7	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ Let ’ s go back to Judea. ”
NCV	John	11	8	The followers said , “ But Teacher , some people there tried to stone you to death only a short time ago . Now you want to go back there ? ”
NCV	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If anyone walks in the daylight , he will not stumble , because he can see by this world ’ s light .
NCV	John	11	10	But if anyone walks at night , he stumbles because there is no light to help him see. ”
NCV	John	11	12	The followers said , “ But Lord , if he is only asleep , he will be all right. ”
NCV	John	11	13	Jesus meant that Lazarus was dead , but his followers thought he meant Lazarus was really sleeping .
NCV	John	11	14	So then Jesus said plainly , “ Lazarus is dead .
NCV	John	11	15	And I am glad for your sakes I was not there so that you may believe . But let ’ s go to him now. ”
NCV	John	11	16	Then Thomas ( the one called Didymus ) said to the other followers , “ Let us also go so that we can die with him. ” Jesus in Bethany
NCV	John	11	17	When Jesus arrived , he learned that Lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days .
NCV	John	11	18	Bethany was about two miles from Jerusalem .
NCV	John	11	19	Many of the Jews had come there to comfort Martha and Mary about their brother .
NCV	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him , but Mary stayed home .
NCV	John	11	21	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
NCV	John	11	22	But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask. ”
NCV	John	11	23	Jesus said , “ Your brother will rise and live again. ”
NCV	John	11	24	Martha answered , “ I know that he will rise and live again in the resurrection [ a ] on the last day. ”
NCV	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . Those who believe in me will have life even if they die .
NCV	John	11	26	And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die . Martha , do you believe this ? ”
NCV	John	11	27	Martha answered , “ Yes , Lord . I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God , the One coming to the world. ” Jesus Cries
NCV	John	11	28	After Martha said this , she went back and talked to her sister Mary alone . Martha said , “ The Teacher is here and he is asking for you. ”
NCV	John	11	29	When Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to Jesus .
NCV	John	11	30	Jesus had not yet come into the town but was still at the place where Martha had met him .
NCV	John	11	31	The Jews were with Mary in the house , comforting her . When they saw her stand and leave quickly , they followed her , thinking she was going to the tomb to cry there .
NCV	John	11	32	But Mary went to the place where Jesus was . When she saw him , she fell at his feet and said , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
NCV	John	11	33	When Jesus saw Mary crying and the Jews who came with her also crying , he was upset and was deeply troubled .
NCV	John	11	34	He asked , “ Where did you bury him ? ” “ Come and see , Lord , ” they said .
NCV	John	11	35	Jesus cried .
NCV	John	11	36	So the Jews said , “ See how much he loved him. ”
NCV	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ If Jesus opened the eyes of the blind man , why couldn ’ t he keep Lazarus from dying ? ” Jesus Raises Lazarus
NCV	John	11	38	Again feeling very upset , Jesus came to the tomb . It was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance .
NCV	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Move the stone away. ” Martha , the sister of the dead man , said , “ But , Lord , it has been four days since he died . There will be a bad smell. ”
NCV	John	11	40	Then Jesus said to her , “ Didn ’ t I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God ? ”
NCV	John	11	41	So they moved the stone away from the entrance . Then Jesus looked up and said , “ Father , I thank you that you heard me .
NCV	John	11	42	I know that you always hear me , but I said these things because of the people here around me . I want them to believe that you sent me. ”
NCV	John	11	43	After Jesus said this , he cried out in a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
NCV	John	11	44	The dead man came out , his hands and feet wrapped with pieces of cloth , and a cloth around his face . Jesus said to them , “ Take the cloth off of him and let him go. ” The Plan to Kill Jesus
NCV	John	11	45	Many of the people , who had come to visit Mary and saw what Jesus did , believed in him .
NCV	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
NCV	John	11	47	Then the leading priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the council . They asked , “ What should we do ? This man is doing many miracles .
NCV	John	11	48	If we let him continue doing these things , everyone will believe in him . Then the Romans will come and take away our Temple and our nation. ”
NCV	John	11	49	One of the men there was Caiaphas , the high priest that year . He said , “ You people know nothing !
NCV	John	11	50	You don ’ t realize that it is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed. ”
NCV	John	11	51	Caiaphas did not think of this himself . As high priest that year , he was really prophesying that Jesus would die for their nation
NCV	John	11	52	and for God ’ s scattered children to bring them all together and make them one .
NCV	John	11	53	That day they started planning to kill Jesus .
NCV	John	11	54	So Jesus no longer traveled openly among the people . He left there and went to a place near the desert , to a town called Ephraim and stayed there with his followers .
NCV	John	11	55	It was almost time for the Passover Feast . Many from the country went up to Jerusalem before the Passover to do the special things to make themselves pure .
NCV	John	11	56	The people looked for Jesus and stood in the Temple asking each other , “ Is he coming to the Feast ? What do you think ? ”
NCV	John	11	57	But the leading priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where Jesus was , he must tell them . Then they could arrest him . Footnotes - 11:24 resurrection Being raised from the dead to live again . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	John	12	12	The next day a great crowd who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast heard that Jesus was coming there .
NCV	John	12	2	There they had a dinner for Jesus . Martha served the food , and Lazarus was one of the people eating with Jesus .
NCV	John	12	3	Mary brought in a pint of very expensive perfume made from pure nard . She poured the perfume on Jesus ’ feet , and then she wiped his feet with her hair . And the sweet smell from the perfume filled the whole house .
NCV	John	12	4	Judas Iscariot , one of Jesus ’ followers who would later turn against him , was there . Judas said ,
NCV	John	12	5	“ This perfume was worth an entire year ’ s wages . Why wasn ’ t it sold and the money given to the poor ? ”
NCV	John	12	6	But Judas did not really care about the poor ; he said this because he was a thief . He was the one who kept the money box , and he often stole from it .
NCV	John	12	7	Jesus answered , “ Leave her alone . It was right for her to save this perfume for today , the day for me to be prepared for burial .
NCV	John	12	8	You will always have the poor with you , but you will not always have me. ” The Plot Against Lazarus
NCV	John	12	9	A large crowd of people heard that Jesus was in Bethany . So they went there to see not only Jesus but Lazarus , whom Jesus raised from the dead .
NCV	John	12	10	So the leading priests made plans to kill Lazarus , too .
NCV	John	12	11	Because of Lazarus many of the Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus . Jesus Enters Jerusalem
NCV	John	12	13	So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Jesus , shouting , “ Praise [ a ] God ! God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord ! God bless the King of Israel ! ” Psalm 118:25–26
NCV	John	12	14	Jesus found a colt and sat on it . This was as the Scripture says ,
NCV	John	12	15	“ Don ’ t be afraid , people of Jerusalem ! Your king is coming , sitting on the colt of a donkey. ” Zechariah 9:9
NCV	John	12	16	The followers of Jesus did not understand this at first . But after Jesus was raised to glory , they remembered that this had been written about him and that they had done these things to him . People Tell About Jesus
NCV	John	12	17	There had been many people with Jesus when he raised Lazarus from the dead and told him to come out of the tomb . Now they were telling others about what Jesus did .
NCV	John	12	18	Many people went out to meet Jesus , because they had heard about this miracle .
NCV	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to each other , “ You can see that nothing is going right for us . Look ! The whole world is following him. ” Jesus Talks About His Death
NCV	John	12	20	There were some Greek people , too , who came to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover Feast .
NCV	John	12	21	They went to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and said , “ Sir , we would like to see Jesus. ”
NCV	John	12	22	Philip told Andrew , and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
NCV	John	12	23	Jesus said to them , “ The time has come for the Son of Man to receive his glory .
NCV	John	12	24	I tell you the truth , a grain of wheat must fall to the ground and die to make many seeds . But if it never dies , it remains only a single seed .
NCV	John	12	25	Those who love their lives will lose them , but those who hate their lives in this world will keep true life forever .
NCV	John	12	26	Whoever serves me must follow me . Then my servant will be with me everywhere I am . My Father will honor anyone who serves me .
NCV	John	12	27	“ Now I am very troubled . Should I say , ‘ Father , save me from this time ’ ? No , I came to this time so I could suffer .
NCV	John	12	28	Father , bring glory to your name ! ” Then a voice came from heaven , “ I have brought glory to it , and I will do it again. ”
NCV	John	12	29	The crowd standing there , who heard the voice , said it was thunder . But others said , “ An angel has spoken to him. ”
NCV	John	12	30	Jesus said , “ That voice was for your sake , not mine .
NCV	John	12	31	Now is the time for the world to be judged ; now the ruler of this world will be thrown down .
NCV	John	12	32	If I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw all people toward me. ”
NCV	John	12	33	Jesus said this to show how he would die .
NCV	John	12	34	The crowd said , “ We have heard from the law that the Christ will live forever . So why do you say , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this ‘ Son of Man ’ ? ”
NCV	John	12	35	Then Jesus said , “ The light will be with you for a little longer , so walk while you have the light . Then the darkness will not catch you . If you walk in the darkness , you will not know where you are going .
NCV	John	12	36	Believe in the light while you still have it so that you will become children of light. ” When Jesus had said this , he left and hid himself from them . Some People Won ’ t Believe in Jesus
NCV	John	12	37	Though Jesus had done many miracles in front of the people , they still did not believe in him .
NCV	John	12	38	This was to bring about what Isaiah the prophet had said : “ Lord , who believed what we told them ? Who saw the Lord ’ s power in this ? ” Isaiah 53:1
NCV	John	12	39	This is why the people could not believe : Isaiah also had said ,
NCV	John	12	40	“ He has blinded their eyes , and he has closed their minds . Otherwise they would see with their eyes and understand in their minds and come back to me and be healed. ” Isaiah 6:10
NCV	John	12	41	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus ’ glory and spoke about him .
NCV	John	12	42	But many believed in Jesus , even many of the leaders . But because of the Pharisees , they did not say they believed in him for fear they would be put out of the synagogue .
NCV	John	12	43	They loved praise from people more than praise from God .
NCV	John	12	44	Then Jesus cried out , “ Whoever believes in me is really believing in the One who sent me .
NCV	John	12	45	Whoever sees me sees the One who sent me .
NCV	John	12	46	I have come as light into the world so that whoever believes in me would not stay in darkness .
NCV	John	12	47	“ Anyone who hears my words and does not obey them , I do not judge , because I did not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
NCV	John	12	48	There is a judge for those who refuse to believe in me and do not accept my words . The word I have taught will be their judge on the last day .
NCV	John	12	49	The things I taught were not from myself . The Father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach .
NCV	John	12	50	And I know that eternal life comes from what the Father commands . So whatever I say is what the Father told me to say. ” Footnotes - 12:13 Praise Literally , “ Hosanna , ” a Hebrew word used at first in praying to God for help , but at this time it was probably a shout of joy used in praising God or his Messiah .

NCV	John	13	13	You call me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord , ’ and you are right , because that is what I am .
NCV	John	13	2	Jesus and his followers were at the evening meal . The devil had already persuaded Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to turn against Jesus .
NCV	John	13	3	Jesus knew that the Father had given him power over everything and that he had come from God and was going back to God .
NCV	John	13	4	So during the meal Jesus stood up and took off his outer clothing . Taking a towel , he wrapped it around his waist .
NCV	John	13	5	Then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers ’ feet , drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
NCV	John	13	6	Jesus came to Simon Peter , who said to him , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
NCV	John	13	7	Jesus answered , “ You don ’ t understand now what I am doing , but you will understand later. ”
NCV	John	13	8	Peter said , “ No , you will never wash my feet. ” Jesus answered , “ If I don ’ t wash your feet , you are not one of my people. ”
NCV	John	13	9	Simon Peter answered , “ Lord , then wash not only my feet , but wash my hands and my head , too ! ”
NCV	John	13	10	Jesus said , “ After a person has had a bath , his whole body is clean . He needs only to wash his feet . And you men are clean , but not all of you. ”
NCV	John	13	11	Jesus knew who would turn against him , and that is why he said , “ Not all of you are clean. ”
NCV	John	13	12	When he had finished washing their feet , he put on his clothes and sat down again . He asked , “ Do you understand what I have just done for you ?
NCV	John	13	14	If I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also should wash each other ’ s feet .
NCV	John	13	15	I did this as an example so that you should do as I have done for you .
NCV	John	13	16	I tell you the truth , a servant is not greater than his master . A messenger is not greater than the one who sent him .
NCV	John	13	17	If you know these things , you will be blessed if you do them .
NCV	John	13	18	“ I am not talking about all of you . I know those I have chosen . But this is to bring about what the Scripture said : ‘ The man who ate at my table has turned against me. ’ [ a ]
NCV	John	13	19	I am telling you this now before it happens so that when it happens , you will believe that I am he .
NCV	John	13	20	I tell you the truth , whoever accepts anyone I send also accepts me . And whoever accepts me also accepts the One who sent me. ” Jesus Talks About His Death
NCV	John	13	21	After Jesus said this , he was very troubled . He said openly , “ I tell you the truth , one of you will turn against me. ”
NCV	John	13	22	The followers all looked at each other , because they did not know whom Jesus was talking about .
NCV	John	13	23	One of the followers sitting [ b ] next to Jesus was the follower Jesus loved .
NCV	John	13	24	Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus whom he was talking about .
NCV	John	13	25	That follower leaned closer to Jesus and asked , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
NCV	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ I will dip this bread into the dish . The man I give it to is the man who will turn against me. ” So Jesus took a piece of bread , dipped it , and gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
NCV	John	13	27	As soon as Judas took the bread , Satan entered him . Jesus said to him , “ The thing that you will do—do it quickly. ”
NCV	John	13	28	No one at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas .
NCV	John	13	29	Since he was the one who kept the money box , some of the followers thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast or to give something to the poor .
NCV	John	13	30	Judas took the bread Jesus gave him and immediately went out . It was night .
NCV	John	13	31	When Judas was gone , Jesus said , “ Now the Son of Man receives his glory , and God receives glory through him .
NCV	John	13	32	If God receives glory through him , [ c ] then God will give glory to the Son through himself . And God will give him glory quickly. ”
NCV	John	13	33	Jesus said , “ My children , I will be with you only a little longer . You will look for me , and what I told the Jews , I tell you now : Where I am going you can not come .
NCV	John	13	34	“ I give you a new command : Love each other . You must love each other as I have loved you .
NCV	John	13	35	All people will know that you are my followers if you love each other. ” Peter Will Say He Doesn ’ t Know Jesus
NCV	John	13	36	Simon Peter asked Jesus , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus answered , “ Where I am going you can not follow now , but you will follow later. ”
NCV	John	13	37	Peter asked , “ Lord , why can ’ t I follow you now ? I am ready to die for you ! ”
NCV	John	13	38	Jesus answered , “ Are you ready to die for me ? I tell you the truth , before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ” Footnotes - 13:18 ‘ The man . . . me. ’ Quotation from Psalm 41:9 . - 13:23 sitting Literally , “ lying. ” The people of that time ate lying down and leaning on one arm . - 13:32 If . . . him Some Greek copies do not have this phrase .

NCV	John	14	14	If you ask me for anything in my name , I will do it . The Promise of the Holy Spirit
NCV	John	14	2	There are many rooms in my Father ’ s house ; I would not tell you this if it were not true . I am going there to prepare a place for you .
NCV	John	14	3	After I go and prepare a place for you , I will come back and take you to be with me so that you may be where I am .
NCV	John	14	4	You know the way to the place where I am going. ” [ a ]
NCV	John	14	5	Thomas said to Jesus , “ Lord , we don ’ t know where you are going . So how can we know the way ? ”
NCV	John	14	6	Jesus answered , “ I am the way , and the truth , and the life . The only way to the Father is through me .
NCV	John	14	7	If you really knew me , you would know my Father , too . But now you do know him , and you have seen him. ”
NCV	John	14	8	Philip said to him , “ Lord , show us the Father . That is all we need. ”
NCV	John	14	9	Jesus answered , “ I have been with you a long time now . Do you still not know me , Philip ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . So why do you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
NCV	John	14	10	Don ’ t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words I say to you don ’ t come from me , but the Father lives in me and does his own work .
NCV	John	14	11	Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me . Or believe because of the miracles I have done .
NCV	John	14	12	I tell you the truth , whoever believes in me will do the same things that I do . Those who believe will do even greater things than these , because I am going to the Father .
NCV	John	14	13	And if you ask for anything in my name , I will do it for you so that the Father ’ s glory will be shown through the Son .
NCV	John	14	15	“ If you love me , you will obey my commands .
NCV	John	14	16	I will ask the Father , and he will give you another Helper [ b ] to be with you forever—
NCV	John	14	17	the Spirit of truth . The world can not accept him , because it does not see him or know him . But you know him , because he lives with you and he will be in you .
NCV	John	14	18	“ I will not leave you all alone like orphans ; I will come back to you .
NCV	John	14	19	In a little while the world will not see me anymore , but you will see me . Because I live , you will live , too .
NCV	John	14	20	On that day you will know that I am in my Father , and that you are in me and I am in you .
NCV	John	14	21	Those who know my commands and obey them are the ones who love me , and my Father will love those who love me . I will love them and will show myself to them. ”
NCV	John	14	22	Then Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) said , “ But , Lord , why do you plan to show yourself to us and not to the rest of the world ? ”
NCV	John	14	23	Jesus answered , “ If people love me , they will obey my teaching . My Father will love them , and we will come to them and make our home with them .
NCV	John	14	24	Those who do not love me do not obey my teaching . This teaching that you hear is not really mine ; it is from my Father , who sent me .
NCV	John	14	25	“ I have told you all these things while I am with you .
NCV	John	14	26	But the Helper will teach you everything and will cause you to remember all that I told you . This Helper is the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name .
NCV	John	14	27	“ I leave you peace ; my peace I give you . I do not give it to you as the world does . So don ’ t let your hearts be troubled or afraid .
NCV	John	14	28	You heard me say to you , ‘ I am going , but I am coming back to you. ’ If you loved me , you should be happy that I am going back to the Father , because he is greater than I am .
NCV	John	14	29	I have told you this now , before it happens , so that when it happens , you will believe .
NCV	John	14	30	I will not talk with you much longer , because the ruler of this world is coming . He has no power over me ,
NCV	John	14	31	but the world must know that I love the Father , so I do exactly what the Father told me to do . “ Come now , let us go . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	John	15	15	I no longer call you servants , because a servant does not know what his master is doing . But I call you friends , because I have made known to you everything I heard from my Father .
NCV	John	15	2	He cuts off every branch of mine that does not produce fruit . And he trims and cleans every branch that produces fruit so that it will produce even more fruit .
NCV	John	15	3	You are already clean because of the words I have spoken to you .
NCV	John	15	4	Remain in me , and I will remain in you . A branch can not produce fruit alone but must remain in the vine . In the same way , you can not produce fruit alone but must remain in me .
NCV	John	15	5	“ I am the vine , and you are the branches . If any remain in me and I remain in them , they produce much fruit . But without me they can do nothing .
NCV	John	15	6	If any do not remain in me , they are like a branch that is thrown away and then dies . People pick up dead branches , throw them into the fire , and burn them .
NCV	John	15	7	If you remain in me and follow my teachings , you can ask anything you want , and it will be given to you .
NCV	John	15	8	You should produce much fruit and show that you are my followers , which brings glory to my Father .
NCV	John	15	9	I loved you as the Father loved me . Now remain in my love .
NCV	John	15	10	I have obeyed my Father ’ s commands , and I remain in his love . In the same way , if you obey my commands , you will remain in my love .
NCV	John	15	11	I have told you these things so that you can have the same joy I have and so that your joy will be the fullest possible joy .
NCV	John	15	12	“ This is my command : Love each other as I have loved you .
NCV	John	15	13	The greatest love a person can show is to die for his friends .
NCV	John	15	14	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
NCV	John	15	16	You did not choose me ; I chose you . And I gave you this work : to go and produce fruit , fruit that will last . Then the Father will give you anything you ask for in my name .
NCV	John	15	17	This is my command : Love each other . Jesus Warns His Followers
NCV	John	15	18	“ If the world hates you , remember that it hated me first .
NCV	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world , it would love you as it loves its own . But I have chosen you out of the world , so you don ’ t belong to it . That is why the world hates you .
NCV	John	15	20	Remember what I told you : A servant is not greater than his master . If people did wrong to me , they will do wrong to you , too . And if they obeyed my teaching , they will obey yours , too .
NCV	John	15	21	They will do all this to you on account of me , because they do not know the One who sent me .
NCV	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin , but now they have no excuse for their sin .
NCV	John	15	23	Whoever hates me also hates my Father .
NCV	John	15	24	I did works among them that no one else has ever done . If I had not done these works , they would not be guilty of sin . But now they have seen what I have done , and yet they have hated both me and my Father .
NCV	John	15	25	But this happened so that what is written in their law would be true : ‘ They hated me for no reason. ’ [ a ]
NCV	John	15	26	“ I will send you the Helper [ b ] from the Father ; he is the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father . When he comes , he will tell about me ,

NCV	John	16	16	“ After a little while you will not see me , and then after a little while you will see me again. ”
NCV	John	16	2	People will put you out of their synagogues . Yes , the time is coming when those who kill you will think they are offering service to God .
NCV	John	16	3	They will do this because they have not known the Father and they have not known me .
NCV	John	16	4	I have told you these things now so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you . The Work of the Holy Spirit “ I did not tell you these things at the beginning , because I was with you then .
NCV	John	16	5	Now I am going back to the One who sent me . But none of you asks me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
NCV	John	16	6	Your hearts are filled with sadness because I have told you these things .
NCV	John	16	7	But I tell you the truth , it is better for you that I go away . When I go away , I will send the Helper [ a ] to you . If I do not go away , the Helper will not come .
NCV	John	16	8	When the Helper comes , he will prove to the people of the world the truth about sin , about being right with God , and about judgment .
NCV	John	16	9	He will prove to them that sin is not believing in me .
NCV	John	16	10	He will prove to them that being right with God comes from my going to the Father and not being seen anymore .
NCV	John	16	11	And the Helper will prove to them that judgment happened when the ruler of this world was judged .
NCV	John	16	12	“ I have many more things to say to you , but they are too much for you now .
NCV	John	16	13	But when the Spirit of truth comes , he will lead you into all truth . He will not speak his own words , but he will speak only what he hears , and he will tell you what is to come .
NCV	John	16	14	The Spirit of truth will bring glory to me , because he will take what I have to say and tell it to you .
NCV	John	16	15	All that the Father has is mine . That is why I said that the Spirit will take what I have to say and tell it to you . Sadness Will Become Happiness
NCV	John	16	17	Some of the followers said to each other , “ What does Jesus mean when he says , ‘ After a little while you will not see me , and then after a little while you will see me again ’ ? And what does he mean when he says , ‘ Because I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
NCV	John	16	18	They also asked , “ What does he mean by ‘ a little while ’ ? We don ’ t understand what he is saying. ”
NCV	John	16	19	Jesus saw that the followers wanted to ask him about this , so he said to them , “ Are you asking each other what I meant when I said , ‘ After a little while you will not see me , and then after a little while you will see me again ’ ?
NCV	John	16	20	I tell you the truth , you will cry and be sad , but the world will be happy . You will be sad , but your sadness will become joy .
NCV	John	16	21	When a woman gives birth to a baby , she has pain , because her time has come . But when her baby is born , she forgets the pain , because she is so happy that a child has been born into the world .
NCV	John	16	22	It is the same with you . Now you are sad , but I will see you again and you will be happy , and no one will take away your joy .
NCV	John	16	23	In that day you will not ask me for anything . I tell you the truth , my Father will give you anything you ask for in my name .
NCV	John	16	24	Until now you have not asked for anything in my name . Ask and you will receive , so that your joy will be the fullest possible joy . Victory over the World
NCV	John	16	25	“ I have told you these things indirectly in stories . But the time will come when I will not use stories like that to tell you things ; I will speak to you in plain words about the Father .
NCV	John	16	26	In that day you will ask the Father for things in my name . I mean , I will not need to ask the Father for you .
NCV	John	16	27	The Father himself loves you . He loves you because you loved me and believed that I came from God .
NCV	John	16	28	I came from the Father into the world . Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father. ”
NCV	John	16	29	Then the followers of Jesus said , “ You are speaking clearly to us now and are not using stories that are hard to understand .
NCV	John	16	30	We can see now that you know all things . You can answer a person ’ s question even before it is asked . This makes us believe you came from God. ”
NCV	John	16	31	Jesus answered , “ So now you believe ?
NCV	John	16	32	Listen to me ; a time is coming when you will be scattered , each to your own home . That time is now here . You will leave me alone , but I am never really alone , because the Father is with me .

NCV	John	17	13	“ I am coming to you now . But I pray these things while I am still in the world so that these followers can have all of my joy in them .

NCV	John	18	2	Judas knew where this place was , because Jesus met there often with his followers . Judas was the one who turned against Jesus .

NCV	John	18	16	But Peter waited outside near the door . The follower who knew the high priest came back outside , spoke to the girl at the door , and brought Peter inside .
NCV	John	18	17	The girl at the door said to Peter , “ Aren ’ t you also one of that man ’ s followers ? ” Peter answered , “ No , I am not ! ”
NCV	John	18	19	The high priest asked Jesus questions about his followers and his teaching .
NCV	John	18	20	Jesus answered , “ I have spoken openly to everyone . I have always taught in synagogues and in the Temple , where all the Jews come together . I never said anything in secret .
NCV	John	18	21	So why do you question me ? Ask the people who heard my teaching . They know what I said. ”
NCV	John	18	22	When Jesus said this , one of the guards standing there hit him . The guard said , “ Is that the way you answer the high priest ? ”
NCV	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , “ If I said something wrong , then show what it was . But if what I said is true , why do you hit me ? ”
NCV	John	18	24	Then Annas sent Jesus , who was still tied , to Caiaphas the high priest . Peter Says Again He Doesn ’ t Know Jesus
NCV	John	18	25	As Simon Peter was standing and warming himself , they said to him , “ Aren ’ t you one of that man ’ s followers ? ” Peter said it was not true ; he said , “ No , I am not. ”
NCV	John	18	26	One of the servants of the high priest was there . This servant was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off . The servant said , “ Didn ’ t I see you with him in the garden ? ”
NCV	John	18	27	Again Peter said it wasn ’ t true . At once a rooster crowed . Jesus Is Brought Before Pilate
NCV	John	18	28	Early in the morning they led Jesus from Caiaphas ’ s house to the Roman governor ’ s palace . They would not go inside the palace , because they did not want to make themselves unclean ; [ b ] they wanted to eat the Passover meal .
NCV	John	18	29	So Pilate went outside to them and asked , “ What charges do you bring against this man ? ”
NCV	John	18	30	They answered , “ If he were not a criminal , we wouldn ’ t have brought him to you. ”
NCV	John	18	31	Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law. ” “ But we are not allowed to put anyone to death , ” the Jews answered .
NCV	John	18	32	( This happened so that what Jesus said about how he would die would come true . )
NCV	John	18	33	Then Pilate went back inside the palace and called Jesus to him and asked , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
NCV	John	18	34	Jesus said , “ Is that your own question , or did others tell you about me ? ”
NCV	John	18	35	Pilate answered , “ I am not one of you . It was your own people and their leading priests who handed you over to me . What have you done wrong ? ”
NCV	John	18	36	Jesus answered , “ My kingdom does not belong to this world . If it belonged to this world , my servants would have fought to keep me from being given over to the Jewish leaders . But my kingdom is from another place. ”
NCV	John	18	37	Pilate said , “ So you are a king ! ” Jesus answered , “ You are the one saying I am a king . This is why I was born and came into the world : to tell people the truth . And everyone who belongs to the truth listens to me. ”
NCV	John	18	38	Pilate said , “ What is truth ? ” After he said this , he went out to the crowd again and said to them , “ I find nothing against this man .
NCV	John	18	39	But it is your custom that I free one prisoner to you at Passover time . Do you want me to free the ‘ king of the Jews ’ ? ”
NCV	John	18	40	They shouted back , “ No , not him ! Let Barabbas go free ! ” ( Barabbas was a robber . ) The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	John	19	19	Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross . It read : jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews .
NCV	John	19	2	The soldiers made a crown from some thorny branches and put it on Jesus ’ head and put a purple robe around him .
NCV	John	19	3	Then they came to him many times and said , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ” and hit him in the face .
NCV	John	19	4	Again Pilate came out and said to them , “ Look , I am bringing Jesus out to you . I want you to know that I find nothing against him. ”
NCV	John	19	5	So Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , “ Here is the man ! ”
NCV	John	19	6	When the leading priests and the guards saw Jesus , they shouted , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ” But Pilate answered , “ Crucify him yourselves , because I find nothing against him. ”
NCV	John	19	7	The leaders answered , “ We have a law that says he should die , because he said he is the Son of God. ”
NCV	John	19	8	When Pilate heard this , he was even more afraid .
NCV	John	19	9	He went back inside the palace and asked Jesus , “ Where do you come from ? ” But Jesus did not answer him .
NCV	John	19	10	Pilate said , “ You refuse to speak to me ? Don ’ t you know I have power to set you free and power to have you crucified ? ”
NCV	John	19	11	Jesus answered , “ The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God . The man who turned me in to you is guilty of a greater sin. ”
NCV	John	19	12	After this , Pilate tried to let Jesus go . But some in the crowd cried out , “ Anyone who makes himself king is against Caesar . If you let this man go , you are no friend of Caesar. ”
NCV	John	19	13	When Pilate heard what they were saying , he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge ’ s seat at the place called The Stone Pavement . ( In the Hebrew language [ a ] the name is Gabbatha . )
NCV	John	19	14	It was about noon on Preparation Day of Passover week . Pilate said to the crowd , “ Here is your king ! ”
NCV	John	19	15	They shouted , “ Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to crucify your king ? ” The leading priests answered , “ The only king we have is Caesar. ”
NCV	John	19	16	So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be crucified . Jesus Is Crucified The soldiers took charge of Jesus .
NCV	John	19	17	Carrying his own cross , Jesus went out to a place called The Place of the Skull , which in the Hebrew language [ b ] is called Golgotha .
NCV	John	19	18	There they crucified Jesus . They also crucified two other men , one on each side , with Jesus in the middle .
NCV	John	19	20	The sign was written in Hebrew , in Latin , and in Greek . Many of the people read the sign , because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city .
NCV	John	19	21	The leading priests said to Pilate , “ Don ’ t write , ‘ The King of the Jews. ’ But write , ‘ This man said , “ I am the King of the Jews. ” ’ ”
NCV	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ What I have written , I have written. ”
NCV	John	19	23	After the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts , with each soldier getting one part . They also took his long shirt , which was all one piece of cloth , woven from top to bottom .
NCV	John	19	24	So the soldiers said to each other , “ We should not tear this into parts . Let ’ s throw lots to see who will get it. ” This happened so that this Scripture would come true : “ They divided my clothes among them , and they threw lots for my clothing. ” Psalm 22:18 So the soldiers did this .
NCV	John	19	25	Standing near his cross were Jesus ’ mother , his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
NCV	John	19	26	When Jesus saw his mother and the follower he loved standing nearby , he said to his mother , “ Dear woman , here is your son. ”
NCV	John	19	27	Then he said to the follower , “ Here is your mother. ” From that time on , the follower took her to live in his home . Jesus Dies
NCV	John	19	28	After this , Jesus knew that everything had been done . So that the Scripture would come true , he said , “ I am thirsty. ” [ c ]
NCV	John	19	29	There was a jar full of vinegar there , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it , put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant , and lifted it to Jesus ’ mouth .
NCV	John	19	30	When Jesus tasted the vinegar , he said , “ It is finished. ” Then he bowed his head and died .
NCV	John	19	31	This day was Preparation Day , and the next day was a special Sabbath day . Since the religious leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day , they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken [ d ] and the bodies be taken away .
NCV	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man on the cross beside Jesus . Then they broke the legs of the man on the other cross beside Jesus .
NCV	John	19	33	But when the soldiers came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
NCV	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus ’ side , and at once blood and water came out .
NCV	John	19	35	( The one who saw this happen is the one who told us this , and whatever he says is true . And he knows that he tells the truth , and he tells it so that you might believe . )
NCV	John	19	36	These things happened to make the Scripture come true : “ Not one of his bones will be broken. ” [ e ]
NCV	John	19	37	And another Scripture says , “ They will look at the one they stabbed. ” [ f ] Jesus Is Buried
NCV	John	19	38	Later , Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take the body of Jesus . ( Joseph was a secret follower of Jesus , because he was afraid of some of the leaders . ) Pilate gave his permission , so Joseph came and took Jesus ’ body away .
NCV	John	19	39	Nicodemus , who earlier had come to Jesus at night , went with Joseph . He brought about seventy-five pounds of myrrh and aloes .
NCV	John	19	40	These two men took Jesus ’ body and wrapped it with the spices in pieces of linen cloth , which is how they bury the dead .
NCV	John	19	41	In the place where Jesus was crucified , there was a garden . In the garden was a new tomb that had never been used before .
NCV	John	19	42	The men laid Jesus in that tomb because it was nearby , and they were preparing to start their Sabbath day .

NCV	John	20	20	After he said this , he showed them his hands and his side . His followers were thrilled when they saw the Lord .
NCV	John	20	2	she ran to Simon Peter and the follower whom Jesus loved . Mary said , “ They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we don ’ t know where they have put him. ”
NCV	John	20	3	So Peter and the other follower started for the tomb .
NCV	John	20	4	They were both running , but the other follower ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first .
NCV	John	20	5	He bent down and looked in and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there , but he did not go in .
NCV	John	20	6	Then following him , Simon Peter arrived and went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen lying there .
NCV	John	20	7	He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus ’ head , which was folded up and laid in a different place from the strips of linen .
NCV	John	20	8	Then the other follower , who had reached the tomb first , also went in . He saw and believed .
NCV	John	20	9	( They did not yet understand from the Scriptures that Jesus must rise from the dead . ) Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene
NCV	John	20	10	Then the followers went back home .
NCV	John	20	11	But Mary stood outside the tomb , crying . As she was crying , she bent down and looked inside the tomb .
NCV	John	20	12	She saw two angels dressed in white , sitting where Jesus ’ body had been , one at the head and one at the feet .
NCV	John	20	13	They asked her , “ Woman , why are you crying ? ” She answered , “ They have taken away my Lord , and I don ’ t know where they have put him. ”
NCV	John	20	14	When Mary said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not know it was Jesus .
NCV	John	20	15	Jesus asked her , “ Woman , why are you crying ? Whom are you looking for ? ” Thinking he was the gardener , she said to him , “ Did you take him away , sir ? Tell me where you put him , and I will get him. ”
NCV	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , “ Mary. ” Mary turned toward Jesus and said in the Hebrew language , [ a ] “ Rabboni. ” ( This means “ Teacher. ” )
NCV	John	20	17	Jesus said to her , “ Don ’ t hold on to me , because I have not yet gone up to the Father . But go to my brothers and tell them , ‘ I am going back to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God. ’ ”
NCV	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene went and said to the followers , “ I saw the Lord ! ” And she told them what Jesus had said to her . Jesus Appears to His Followers
NCV	John	20	19	When it was evening on the first day of the week , Jesus ’ followers were together . The doors were locked , because they were afraid of the elders . Then Jesus came and stood right in the middle of them and said , “ Peace be with you. ”
NCV	John	20	21	Then Jesus said again , “ Peace be with you . As the Father sent me , I now send you. ”
NCV	John	20	22	After he said this , he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
NCV	John	20	23	If you forgive anyone his sins , they are forgiven . If you don ’ t forgive them , they are not forgiven. ” Jesus Appears to Thomas
NCV	John	20	24	Thomas ( called Didymus ) , who was one of the twelve , was not with them when Jesus came .
NCV	John	20	25	The other followers kept telling Thomas , “ We saw the Lord. ” But Thomas said , “ I will not believe it until I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side. ”
NCV	John	20	26	A week later the followers were in the house again , and Thomas was with them . The doors were locked , but Jesus came in and stood right in the middle of them . He said , “ Peace be with you. ”
NCV	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here , and look at my hands . Put your hand here in my side . Stop being an unbeliever and believe. ”
NCV	John	20	28	Thomas said to him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
NCV	John	20	29	Then Jesus told him , “ You believe because you see me . Those who believe without seeing me will be truly blessed. ” Why John Wrote This Book
NCV	John	20	30	Jesus did many other miracles in the presence of his followers that are not written in this book .
NCV	John	20	31	But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God . Then , by believing , you may have life through his name .

NCV	John	21	21	When Peter saw him behind them , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
NCV	John	21	2	Some of the followers were together : Simon Peter , Thomas ( called Didymus ) , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , the two sons of Zebedee , and two other followers .
NCV	John	21	3	Simon Peter said , “ I am going out to fish. ” The others said , “ We will go with you. ” So they went out and got into the boat . They fished that night but caught nothing .
NCV	John	21	4	Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore , but the followers did not know it was Jesus .
NCV	John	21	5	Then he said to them , “ Friends , did you catch any fish ? ” They answered , “ No. ”
NCV	John	21	6	He said , “ Throw your net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some. ” So they did , and they caught so many fish they could not pull the net back into the boat .
NCV	John	21	7	The follower whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” When Peter heard him say this , he wrapped his coat around himself . ( Peter had taken his clothes off . ) Then he jumped into the water .
NCV	John	21	8	The other followers went to shore in the boat , dragging the net full of fish . They were not very far from shore , only about a hundred yards .
NCV	John	21	9	When the followers stepped out of the boat and onto the shore , they saw a fire of hot coals . There were fish on the fire , and there was bread .
NCV	John	21	10	Then Jesus said , “ Bring some of the fish you just caught. ”
NCV	John	21	11	Simon Peter went into the boat and pulled the net to the shore . It was full of big fish , one hundred fifty-three in all , but even though there were so many , the net did not tear .
NCV	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , “ Come and eat. ” None of the followers dared ask him , “ Who are you ? ” because they knew it was the Lord .
NCV	John	21	13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , along with the fish .
NCV	John	21	14	This was now the third time Jesus showed himself to his followers after he was raised from the dead . Jesus Talks to Peter
NCV	John	21	15	When they finished eating , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” He answered , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you. ” Jesus said , “ Feed my lambs. ”
NCV	John	21	16	Again Jesus said , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” He answered , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you. ” Jesus said , “ Take care of my sheep. ”
NCV	John	21	17	A third time he said , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time , “ Do you love me ? ” Peter said , “ Lord , you know everything ; you know that I love you ! ” He said to him , “ Feed my sheep .
NCV	John	21	18	I tell you the truth , when you were younger , you tied your own belt and went where you wanted . But when you are old , you will put out your hands and someone else will tie you and take you where you don ’ t want to go. ”
NCV	John	21	19	( Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God . ) Then Jesus said to Peter , “ Follow me ! ”
NCV	John	21	20	Peter turned and saw that the follower Jesus loved was walking behind them . ( This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and had said , “ Lord , who will turn against you ? ” )
NCV	John	21	22	Jesus answered , “ If I want him to live until I come back , that is not your business . You follow me. ”
NCV	John	21	23	So a story spread among the followers that this one would not die . But Jesus did not say he would not die . He only said , “ If I want him to live until I come back , that is not your business. ”
NCV	John	21	24	That follower is the one who is telling these things and who has now written them down . We know that what he says is true .
NCV	John	21	25	There are many other things Jesus did . If every one of them were written down , I suppose the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written .

NCV	Romans	1	1	From Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus . God called me to be an apostle and chose me to tell the Good News .
NCV	Romans	1	2	God promised this Good News long ago through his prophets , as it is written in the Holy Scriptures . 3-4 The Good News is about God ’ s Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . As a man , he was born from the family of David . But through the Spirit of holiness he was declared to be God ’ s Son with great power by rising from the dead .
NCV	Romans	1	5	Through Christ , God gave me the special work of an apostle , which was to lead people of all nations to believe and obey . I do this work for him .
NCV	Romans	1	6	And you who are in Rome are also called to belong to Jesus Christ .
NCV	Romans	1	7	To all of you in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his holy people : Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . A Prayer of Thanks
NCV	Romans	1	8	First I want to say that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because people everywhere in the world are talking about your faith .
NCV	Romans	1	9	God , whom I serve with my whole heart by telling the Good News about his Son , knows that I always mention you
NCV	Romans	1	10	every time I pray . I pray that I will be allowed to come to you , and this will happen if God wants it .
NCV	Romans	1	11	I want very much to see you , to give you some spiritual gift to make you strong .
NCV	Romans	1	12	I mean that I want us to help each other with the faith we have . Your faith will help me , and my faith will help you .
NCV	Romans	1	13	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that I planned many times to come to you , but this has not been possible . I wanted to come so that I could help you grow spiritually as I have helped the other non-Jewish people .
NCV	Romans	1	14	I have a duty to all people—Greeks and those who are not Greeks , the wise and the foolish .
NCV	Romans	1	15	That is why I want so much to preach the Good News to you in Rome .
NCV	Romans	1	16	I am not ashamed of the Good News , because it is the power God uses to save everyone who believes—to save the Jews first , and then to save non-Jews .
NCV	Romans	1	17	The Good News shows how God makes people right with himself—that it begins and ends with faith . As the Scripture says , “ But those who are right with God will live by faith. ” [ a ] All People Have Done Wrong
NCV	Romans	1	18	God ’ s anger is shown from heaven against all the evil and wrong things people do . By their own evil lives they hide the truth .
NCV	Romans	1	19	God shows his anger because some knowledge of him has been made clear to them . Yes , God has shown himself to them .
NCV	Romans	1	20	There are things about him that people can not see—his eternal power and all the things that make him God . But since the beginning of the world those things have been easy to understand by what God has made . So people have no excuse for the bad things they do .
NCV	Romans	1	21	They knew God , but they did not give glory to God or thank him . Their thinking became useless . Their foolish minds were filled with darkness .
NCV	Romans	1	22	They said they were wise , but they became fools .
NCV	Romans	1	23	They traded the glory of God who lives forever for the worship of idols made to look like earthly people , birds , animals , and snakes .
NCV	Romans	1	24	Because they did these things , God left them and let them go their sinful way , wanting only to do evil . As a result , they became full of sexual sin , using their bodies wrongly with each other .
NCV	Romans	1	25	They traded the truth of God for a lie . They worshiped and served what had been created instead of the God who created those things , who should be praised forever . Amen .
NCV	Romans	1	26	Because people did those things , God left them and let them do the shameful things they wanted to do . Women stopped having natural sex and started having sex with other women .
NCV	Romans	1	27	In the same way , men stopped having natural sex and began wanting each other . Men did shameful things with other men , and in their bodies they received the punishment for those wrongs .
NCV	Romans	1	28	People did not think it was important to have a true knowledge of God . So God left them and allowed them to have their own worthless thinking and to do things they should not do .
NCV	Romans	1	29	They are filled with every kind of sin , evil , selfishness , and hatred . They are full of jealousy , murder , fighting , lying , and thinking the worst about each other . They gossip
NCV	Romans	1	30	and say evil things about each other . They hate God . They are rude and conceited and brag about themselves . They invent ways of doing evil . They do not obey their parents .
NCV	Romans	1	31	They are foolish , they do not keep their promises , and they show no kindness or mercy to others .
NCV	Romans	1	32	They know God ’ s law says that those who live like this should die . But they themselves not only continue to do these evil things , they applaud others who do them .

NCV	Romans	2	2	God judges those who do wrong things , and we know that his judging is right .
NCV	Romans	2	3	You judge those who do wrong , but you do wrong yourselves . Do you think you will be able to escape the judgment of God ?
NCV	Romans	2	4	He has been very kind and patient , waiting for you to change , but you think nothing of his kindness . Perhaps you do not understand that God is kind to you so you will change your hearts and lives .
NCV	Romans	2	5	But you are stubborn and refuse to change , so you are making your own punishment even greater on the day he shows his anger . On that day everyone will see God ’ s right judgments .
NCV	Romans	2	6	God will reward or punish every person for what that person has done .
NCV	Romans	2	7	Some people , by always continuing to do good , live for God ’ s glory , for honor , and for life that has no end . God will give them life forever .
NCV	Romans	2	8	But other people are selfish . They refuse to follow truth and , instead , follow evil . God will give them his punishment and anger .
NCV	Romans	2	9	He will give trouble and suffering to everyone who does evil—to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews .
NCV	Romans	2	10	But he will give glory , honor , and peace to everyone who does good—to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews .
NCV	Romans	2	11	For God judges all people in the same way .
NCV	Romans	2	12	People who do not have the law and who are sinners will be lost , although they do not have the law . And , in the same way , those who have the law and are sinners will be judged by the law .
NCV	Romans	2	13	Hearing the law does not make people right with God . It is those who obey the law who will be right with him .
NCV	Romans	2	14	( Those who are not Jews do not have the law , but when they freely do what the law commands , they are the law for themselves . This is true even though they do not have the law .
NCV	Romans	2	15	They show that in their hearts they know what is right and wrong , just as the law commands . And they show this by their consciences . Sometimes their thoughts tell them they did wrong , and sometimes their thoughts tell them they did right . )
NCV	Romans	2	16	All these things will happen on the day when God , through Christ Jesus , will judge people ’ s secret thoughts . The Good News that I preach says this . The Jews and the Law
NCV	Romans	2	17	What about you ? You call yourself a Jew . You trust in the law of Moses and brag that you are close to God .
NCV	Romans	2	18	You know what he wants you to do and what is important , because you have learned the law .
NCV	Romans	2	19	You think you are a guide for the blind and a light for those who are in darkness .
NCV	Romans	2	20	You think you can show foolish people what is right and teach those who know nothing . You have the law ; so you think you know everything and have all truth .
NCV	Romans	2	21	You teach others , so why don ’ t you teach yourself ? You tell others not to steal , but you steal .
NCV	Romans	2	22	You say that others must not take part in adultery , but you are guilty of that sin . You hate idols , but you steal from temples .
NCV	Romans	2	23	You brag about having God ’ s law , but you bring shame to God by breaking his law ,
NCV	Romans	2	24	just as the Scriptures say : “ Those who are not Jews speak against God ’ s name because of you. ” [ a ]
NCV	Romans	2	25	If you follow the law , your circumcision has meaning . But if you break the law , it is as if you were never circumcised .
NCV	Romans	2	26	People who are not Jews are not circumcised , but if they do what the law says , it is as if they were circumcised .
NCV	Romans	2	27	You Jews have the written law and circumcision , but you break the law . So those who are not circumcised in their bodies , but still obey the law , will show that you are guilty .
NCV	Romans	2	28	They can do this because a person is not a true Jew if he is only a Jew in his physical body ; true circumcision is not only on the outside of the body .
NCV	Romans	2	29	A person is a Jew only if he is a Jew inside ; true circumcision is done in the heart by the Spirit , not by the written law . Such a person gets praise from God rather than from people . Footnotes - 2:24 “ Those . . . you. ” Quotation from Isaiah 52:5 ; Ezekiel 36:20 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Romans	3	3	If some Jews were not faithful to him , will that stop God from doing what he promised ?
NCV	Romans	3	2	Yes , of course , there is in every way . The most important thing is this : God trusted the Jews with his teachings .
NCV	Romans	3	4	No ! God will continue to be true even when every person is false . As the Scriptures say : “ So you will be shown to be right when you speak , and you will win your case. ” Psalm 51:4
NCV	Romans	3	5	When we do wrong , that shows more clearly that God is right . So can we say that God is wrong to punish us ? ( I am talking as people might talk . )
NCV	Romans	3	6	No ! If God could not punish us , he could not judge the world .
NCV	Romans	3	7	A person might say , “ When I lie , it really gives him glory , because my lie shows God ’ s truth . So why am I judged a sinner ? ”
NCV	Romans	3	8	It would be the same to say , “ We should do evil so that good will come. ” Some people find fault with us and say we teach this , but they are wrong and deserve the punishment they will receive . All People Are Guilty
NCV	Romans	3	9	So are we Jews better than others ? No ! We have already said that Jews and those who are not Jews are all guilty of sin .
NCV	Romans	3	10	As the Scriptures say : “ There is no one who always does what is right , not even one .
NCV	Romans	3	11	There is no one who understands . There is no one who looks to God for help .
NCV	Romans	3	12	All have turned away . Together , everyone has become useless . There is no one who does anything good ; there is not even one. ” Psalm 14:1–3
NCV	Romans	3	13	“ Their throats are like open graves ; they use their tongues for telling lies. ” Psalm 5:9 “ Their words are like snake poison. ” Psalm 140:3
NCV	Romans	3	14	“ Their mouths are full of cursing and hate. ” Psalm 10:7
NCV	Romans	3	15	“ They are always ready to kill people .
NCV	Romans	3	16	Everywhere they go they cause ruin and misery .
NCV	Romans	3	17	They don ’ t know how to live in peace. ” Isaiah 59:7–8
NCV	Romans	3	18	“ They have no fear of God. ” Psalm 36:1
NCV	Romans	3	19	We know that the law ’ s commands are for those who have the law . This stops all excuses and brings the whole world under God ’ s judgment ,
NCV	Romans	3	20	because no one can be made right with God by following the law . The law only shows us our sin . How God Makes People Right
NCV	Romans	3	21	But God has a way to make people right with him without the law , and he has now shown us that way which the law and the prophets told us about .
NCV	Romans	3	22	God makes people right with himself through their faith in Jesus Christ . This is true for all who believe in Christ , because all people are the same :
NCV	Romans	3	23	Everyone has sinned and fallen short of God ’ s glorious standard ,
NCV	Romans	3	24	and all need to be made right with God by his grace , which is a free gift . They need to be made free from sin through Jesus Christ .
NCV	Romans	3	25	God sent him to die in our place to take away our sins . We receive forgiveness through faith in the blood of Jesus ’ death . This showed that God always does what is right and fair , as in the past when he was patient and did not punish people for their sins .
NCV	Romans	3	26	And God gave Jesus to show today that he does what is right . God did this so he could judge rightly and so he could make right any person who has faith in Jesus .
NCV	Romans	3	27	So do we have a reason to brag about ourselves ? No ! And why not ? It is the way of faith that stops all bragging , not the way of trying to obey the law .
NCV	Romans	3	28	A person is made right with God through faith , not through obeying the law .
NCV	Romans	3	29	Is God only the God of the Jews ? Is he not also the God of those who are not Jews ?
NCV	Romans	3	30	Of course he is , because there is only one God . He will make Jews right with him by their faith , and he will also make those who are not Jews right with him through their faith .
NCV	Romans	3	31	So do we destroy the law by following the way of faith ? No ! Faith causes us to be what the law truly wants . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Romans	3	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Romans	4	4	When people work , their pay is not given as a gift , but as something earned .
NCV	Romans	4	2	If Abraham was made right by the things he did , he had a reason to brag . But this is not God ’ s view ,
NCV	Romans	4	3	because the Scripture says , “ Abraham believed God , and God accepted Abraham ’ s faith , and that faith made him right with God. ” [ b ]
NCV	Romans	4	5	But people can not do any work that will make them right with God . So they must trust in him , who makes even evil people right in his sight . Then God accepts their faith , and that makes them right with him .
NCV	Romans	4	6	David said the same thing . He said that people are truly blessed when God , without paying attention to their deeds , makes people right with himself .
NCV	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed are they whose sins are forgiven , whose wrongs are pardoned .
NCV	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the person whom the Lord does not consider guilty. ” Psalm 32:1–2
NCV	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing only for those who are circumcised or also for those who are not circumcised ? We have already said that God accepted Abraham ’ s faith and that faith made him right with God .
NCV	Romans	4	10	So how did this happen ? Did God accept Abraham before or after he was circumcised ? It was before his circumcision .
NCV	Romans	4	11	Abraham was circumcised to show that he was right with God through faith before he was circumcised . So Abraham is the father of all those who believe but are not circumcised ; he is the father of all believers who are accepted as being right with God .
NCV	Romans	4	12	And Abraham is also the father of those who have been circumcised and who live following the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised . God Keeps His Promise
NCV	Romans	4	13	Abraham [ c ] and his descendants received the promise that they would get the whole world . He did not receive that promise through the law , but through being right with God by his faith .
NCV	Romans	4	14	If people could receive what God promised by following the law , then faith is worthless . And God ’ s promise to Abraham is worthless ,
NCV	Romans	4	15	because the law can only bring God ’ s anger . But if there is no law , there is nothing to disobey .
NCV	Romans	4	16	So people receive God ’ s promise by having faith . This happens so the promise can be a free gift . Then all of Abraham ’ s children can have that promise . It is not only for those who live under the law of Moses but for anyone who lives with faith like that of Abraham , who is the father of us all .
NCV	Romans	4	17	As it is written in the Scriptures : “ I am making you a father of many nations. ” [ d ] This is true before God , the God Abraham believed , the God who gives life to the dead and who creates something out of nothing .
NCV	Romans	4	18	There was no hope that Abraham would have children . But Abraham believed God and continued hoping , and so he became the father of many nations . As God told him , “ Your descendants also will be too many to count. ” [ e ]
NCV	Romans	4	19	Abraham was almost a hundred years old , much past the age for having children , and Sarah could not have children . Abraham thought about all this , but his faith in God did not become weak .
NCV	Romans	4	20	He never doubted that God would keep his promise , and he never stopped believing . He grew stronger in his faith and gave praise to God .
NCV	Romans	4	21	Abraham felt sure that God was able to do what he had promised .
NCV	Romans	4	22	So , “ God accepted Abraham ’ s faith , and that faith made him right with God. ” [ f ]
NCV	Romans	4	23	Those words ( “ God accepted Abraham ’ s faith ” ) were written not only for Abraham
NCV	Romans	4	24	but also for us . God will accept us also because we believe in the One who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead .
NCV	Romans	4	25	Jesus was given to die for our sins , and he was raised from the dead to make us right with God . Footnotes - 4:1 Abraham Most respected ancestor of the Jews .

NCV	Romans	5	5	And this hope will never disappoint us , because God has poured out his love to fill our hearts . He gave us his love through the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to us .
NCV	Romans	5	2	who through our faith [ b ] has brought us into that blessing of God ’ s grace that we now enjoy . And we are happy because of the hope we have of sharing God ’ s glory .
NCV	Romans	5	3	We also have joy with our troubles , because we know that these troubles produce patience .
NCV	Romans	5	4	And patience produces character , and character produces hope .
NCV	Romans	5	6	When we were unable to help ourselves , at the right time , Christ died for us , although we were living against God .
NCV	Romans	5	7	Very few people will die to save the life of someone else . Although perhaps for a good person someone might possibly die .
NCV	Romans	5	8	But God shows his great love for us in this way : Christ died for us while we were still sinners .
NCV	Romans	5	9	So through Christ we will surely be saved from God ’ s anger , because we have been made right with God by the blood of Christ ’ s death .
NCV	Romans	5	10	While we were God ’ s enemies , he made us his friends through the death of his Son . Surely , now that we are his friends , he will save us through his Son ’ s life .
NCV	Romans	5	11	And not only that , but now we are also very happy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ . Through him we are now God ’ s friends again . Adam and Christ Compared
NCV	Romans	5	12	Sin came into the world because of what one man did , and with sin came death . This is why everyone must die—because everyone sinned .
NCV	Romans	5	13	Sin was in the world before the law of Moses , but sin is not counted against us as breaking a command when there is no law .
NCV	Romans	5	14	But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses , everyone had to die , even those who had not sinned by breaking a command , as Adam had . Adam was like the One who was coming in the future .
NCV	Romans	5	15	But God ’ s free gift is not like Adam ’ s sin . Many people died because of the sin of that one man . But the grace from God was much greater ; many people received God ’ s gift of life by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ .
NCV	Romans	5	16	After Adam sinned once , he was judged guilty . But the gift of God is different . God ’ s free gift came after many sins , and it makes people right with God .
NCV	Romans	5	17	One man sinned , and so death ruled all people because of that one man . But now those people who accept God ’ s full grace and the great gift of being made right with him will surely have true life and rule through the one man , Jesus Christ .
NCV	Romans	5	18	So as one sin of Adam brought the punishment of death to all people , one good act that Christ did makes all people right with God . And that brings true life for all .
NCV	Romans	5	19	One man disobeyed God , and many became sinners . In the same way , one man obeyed God , and many will be made right .
NCV	Romans	5	20	The law came to make sin worse . But when sin grew worse , God ’ s grace increased .
NCV	Romans	5	21	Sin once used death to rule us , but God gave people more of his grace so that grace could rule by making people right with him . And this brings life forever through Jesus Christ our Lord . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Romans	6	6	We know that our old life died with Christ on the cross so that our sinful selves would have no power over us and we would not be slaves to sin .
NCV	Romans	6	2	No ! We died to our old sinful lives , so how can we continue living with sin ?
NCV	Romans	6	3	Did you forget that all of us became part of Christ when we were baptized ? We shared his death in our baptism .
NCV	Romans	6	4	When we were baptized , we were buried with Christ and shared his death . So , just as Christ was raised from the dead by the wonderful power of the Father , we also can live a new life .
NCV	Romans	6	5	Christ died , and we have been joined with him by dying too . So we will also be joined with him by rising from the dead as he did .
NCV	Romans	6	7	Anyone who has died is made free from sin ’ s control .
NCV	Romans	6	8	If we died with Christ , we know we will also live with him .
NCV	Romans	6	9	Christ was raised from the dead , and we know that he can not die again . Death has no power over him now .
NCV	Romans	6	10	Yes , when Christ died , he died to defeat the power of sin one time—enough for all time . He now has a new life , and his new life is with God .
NCV	Romans	6	11	In the same way , you should see yourselves as being dead to the power of sin and alive with God through Christ Jesus .
NCV	Romans	6	12	So , do not let sin control your life here on earth so that you do what your sinful self wants to do .
NCV	Romans	6	13	Do not offer the parts of your body to serve sin , as things to be used in doing evil . Instead , offer yourselves to God as people who have died and now live . Offer the parts of your body to God to be used in doing good .
NCV	Romans	6	14	Sin will not be your master , because you are not under law but under God ’ s grace . Be Slaves of Righteousness
NCV	Romans	6	15	So what should we do ? Should we sin because we are under grace and not under law ? No !
NCV	Romans	6	16	Surely you know that when you give yourselves like slaves to obey someone , then you are really slaves of that person . The person you obey is your master . You can follow sin , which brings spiritual death , or you can obey God , which makes you right with him .
NCV	Romans	6	17	In the past you were slaves to sin—sin controlled you . But thank God , you fully obeyed the things that you were taught .
NCV	Romans	6	18	You were made free from sin , and now you are slaves to goodness .
NCV	Romans	6	19	I use this example because this is hard for you to understand . In the past you offered the parts of your body to be slaves to sin and evil ; you lived only for evil . In the same way now you must give yourselves to be slaves of goodness . Then you will live only for God .
NCV	Romans	6	20	In the past you were slaves to sin , and goodness did not control you .
NCV	Romans	6	21	You did evil things , and now you are ashamed of them . Those things only bring death .
NCV	Romans	6	22	But now you are free from sin and have become slaves of God . This brings you a life that is only for God , and this gives you life forever .

NCV	Romans	7	7	You might think I am saying that sin and the law are the same thing . That is not true . But the law was the only way I could learn what sin meant . I would never have known what it means to want to take something belonging to someone else if the law had not said , “ You must not want to take your neighbor ’ s things. ” [ a ]
NCV	Romans	7	2	For example , a woman must stay married to her husband as long as he is alive . But if her husband dies , she is free from the law of marriage .
NCV	Romans	7	3	But if she marries another man while her husband is still alive , the law says she is guilty of adultery . But if her husband dies , she is free from the law of marriage . Then if she marries another man , she is not guilty of adultery .
NCV	Romans	7	4	In the same way , my brothers and sisters , your old selves died , and you became free from the law through the body of Christ . This happened so that you might belong to someone else—the One who was raised from the dead—and so that we might be used in service to God .
NCV	Romans	7	5	In the past , we were ruled by our sinful selves . The law made us want to do sinful things that controlled our bodies , so the things we did were bringing us death .
NCV	Romans	7	6	In the past , the law held us like prisoners , but our old selves died , and we were made free from the law . So now we serve God in a new way with the Spirit , and not in the old way with written rules . Our Fight Against Sin
NCV	Romans	7	8	And sin found a way to use that command and cause me to want all kinds of things I should not want . But without the law , sin has no power .
NCV	Romans	7	9	I was alive before I knew the law . But when the law ’ s command came to me , then sin began to live ,
NCV	Romans	7	10	and I died . The command was meant to bring life , but for me it brought death .
NCV	Romans	7	11	Sin found a way to fool me by using the command to make me die .
NCV	Romans	7	12	So the law is holy , and the command is holy and right and good .
NCV	Romans	7	13	Does this mean that something that is good brought death to me ? No ! Sin used something that is good to bring death to me . This happened so that I could see what sin is really like ; the command was used to show that sin is very evil . The War Within Us
NCV	Romans	7	14	We know that the law is spiritual , but I am not spiritual since sin rules me as if I were its slave .
NCV	Romans	7	15	I do not understand the things I do . I do not do what I want to do , and I do the things I hate .
NCV	Romans	7	16	And if I do not want to do the hated things I do , that means I agree that the law is good .
NCV	Romans	7	17	But I am not really the one who is doing these hated things ; it is sin living in me that does them .
NCV	Romans	7	18	Yes , I know that nothing good lives in me—I mean nothing good lives in the part of me that is earthly and sinful . I want to do the things that are good , but I do not do them .
NCV	Romans	7	19	I do not do the good things I want to do , but I do the bad things I do not want to do .
NCV	Romans	7	20	So if I do things I do not want to do , then I am not the one doing them . It is sin living in me that does those things .
NCV	Romans	7	21	So I have learned this rule : When I want to do good , evil is there with me .
NCV	Romans	7	22	In my mind , I am happy with God ’ s law .
NCV	Romans	7	23	But I see another law working in my body , which makes war against the law that my mind accepts . That other law working in my body is the law of sin , and it makes me its prisoner .
NCV	Romans	7	24	What a miserable man I am ! Who will save me from this body that brings me death ?
NCV	Romans	7	25	I thank God for saving me through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So in my mind I am a slave to God ’ s law , but in my sinful self I am a slave to the law of sin . Footnotes - 7:7 “ You . . . things. ” Quotation from Exodus 20:17 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Romans	8	8	Those people who are ruled by their sinful selves can not please God .
NCV	Romans	8	2	Through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit that brings life made you [ b ] free from the law that brings sin and death .
NCV	Romans	8	3	The law was without power , because the law was made weak by our sinful selves . But God did what the law could not do . He sent his own Son to earth with the same human life that others use for sin . By sending his Son to be an offering for sin , God used a human life to destroy sin .
NCV	Romans	8	4	He did this so that we could be the kind of people the law correctly wants us to be . Now we do not live following our sinful selves , but we live following the Spirit .
NCV	Romans	8	5	Those who live following their sinful selves think only about things that their sinful selves want . But those who live following the Spirit are thinking about the things the Spirit wants them to do .
NCV	Romans	8	6	If people ’ s thinking is controlled by the sinful self , there is death . But if their thinking is controlled by the Spirit , there is life and peace .
NCV	Romans	8	7	When people ’ s thinking is controlled by the sinful self , they are against God , because they refuse to obey God ’ s law and really are not even able to obey God ’ s law .
NCV	Romans	8	9	But you are not ruled by your sinful selves . You are ruled by the Spirit , if that Spirit of God really lives in you . But the person who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ .
NCV	Romans	8	10	Your body will always be dead because of sin . But if Christ is in you , then the Spirit gives you life , because Christ made you right with God .
NCV	Romans	8	11	God raised Jesus from the dead , and if God ’ s Spirit is living in you , he will also give life to your bodies that die . God is the One who raised Christ from the dead , and he will give life through [ c ] his Spirit that lives in you .
NCV	Romans	8	12	So , my brothers and sisters , we must not be ruled by our sinful selves or live the way our sinful selves want .
NCV	Romans	8	13	If you use your lives to do the wrong things your sinful selves want , you will die spiritually . But if you use the Spirit ’ s help to stop doing the wrong things you do with your body , you will have true life .
NCV	Romans	8	14	The true children of God are those who let God ’ s Spirit lead them .
NCV	Romans	8	15	The Spirit we received does not make us slaves again to fear ; it makes us children of God . With that Spirit we cry out , “ Father. ” [ d ]
NCV	Romans	8	16	And the Spirit himself joins with our spirits to say we are God ’ s children .
NCV	Romans	8	17	If we are God ’ s children , we will receive blessings from God together with Christ . But we must suffer as Christ suffered so that we will have glory as Christ has glory . Our Future Glory
NCV	Romans	8	18	The sufferings we have now are nothing compared to the great glory that will be shown to us .
NCV	Romans	8	19	Everything God made is waiting with excitement for God to show his children ’ s glory completely .
NCV	Romans	8	20	Everything God made was changed to become useless , not by its own wish but because God wanted it and because all along there was this hope :
NCV	Romans	8	21	that everything God made would be set free from ruin to have the freedom and glory that belong to God ’ s children .
NCV	Romans	8	22	We know that everything God made has been waiting until now in pain , like a woman ready to give birth .
NCV	Romans	8	23	Not only the world , but we also have been waiting with pain inside us . We have the Spirit as the first part of God ’ s promise . So we are waiting for God to finish making us his own children , which means our bodies will be made free .
NCV	Romans	8	24	We were saved , and we have this hope . If we see what we are waiting for , that is not really hope . People do not hope for something they already have .
NCV	Romans	8	25	But we are hoping for something we do not have yet , and we are waiting for it patiently .
NCV	Romans	8	26	Also , the Spirit helps us with our weakness . We do not know how to pray as we should . But the Spirit himself speaks to God for us , even begs God for us with deep feelings that words can not explain .
NCV	Romans	8	27	God can see what is in people ’ s hearts . And he knows what is in the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit speaks to God for his people in the way God wants .
NCV	Romans	8	28	We know that in everything God works for the good of those who love him . [ e ] They are the people he called , because that was his plan .
NCV	Romans	8	29	God knew them before he made the world , and he chose them to be like his Son so that Jesus would be the firstborn [ f ] of many brothers and sisters .
NCV	Romans	8	30	God planned for them to be like his Son ; and those he planned to be like his Son , he also called ; and those he called , he also made right with him ; and those he made right , he also glorified . God ’ s Love in Christ Jesus
NCV	Romans	8	31	So what should we say about this ? If God is for us , no one can defeat us .
NCV	Romans	8	32	He did not spare his own Son but gave him for us all . So with Jesus , God will surely give us all things .
NCV	Romans	8	33	Who can accuse the people God has chosen ? No one , because God is the One who makes them right .
NCV	Romans	8	34	Who can say God ’ s people are guilty ? No one , because Christ Jesus died , but he was also raised from the dead , and now he is on God ’ s right side , appealing to God for us .
NCV	Romans	8	35	Can anything separate us from the love Christ has for us ? Can troubles or problems or sufferings or hunger or nakedness or danger or violent death ?
NCV	Romans	8	36	As it is written in the Scriptures : “ For you we are in danger of death all the time . People think we are worth no more than sheep to be killed. ” Psalm 44:22
NCV	Romans	8	37	But in all these things we are completely victorious through God who showed his love for us .
NCV	Romans	8	38	Yes , I am sure that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor ruling spirits , nothing now , nothing in the future , no powers ,
NCV	Romans	8	39	nothing above us , nothing below us , nor anything else in the whole world will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord .

NCV	Romans	9	9	God ’ s promise to Abraham was this : “ At the right time I will return , and Sarah will have a son. ” [ e ]
NCV	Romans	9	2	I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness .
NCV	Romans	9	3	I wish I could help my Jewish brothers and sisters , my people . I would even wish that I were cursed and cut off from Christ if that would help them .
NCV	Romans	9	4	They are the people of Israel , God ’ s chosen children . They have seen the glory of God , and they have the agreements that God made between himself and his people . God gave them the law of Moses and the right way of worship and his promises .
NCV	Romans	9	5	They are the descendants of our great ancestors , and they are the earthly family into which Christ was born , who is God over all . Praise him forever ! [ a ] Amen .
NCV	Romans	9	6	It is not that God failed to keep his promise to them . But only some of the people of Israel are truly God ’ s people , [ b ]
NCV	Romans	9	7	and only some of Abraham ’ s [ c ] descendants are true children of Abraham . But God said to Abraham : “ The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac. ” [ d ]
NCV	Romans	9	8	This means that not all of Abraham ’ s descendants are God ’ s true children . Abraham ’ s true children are those who become God ’ s children because of the promise God made to Abraham .
NCV	Romans	9	10	And that is not all . Rebekah ’ s sons had the same father , our father Isaac . 11-12 But before the two boys were born , God told Rebekah , “ The older will serve the younger. ” [ f ] This was before the boys had done anything good or bad . God said this so that the one chosen would be chosen because of God ’ s own plan . He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call , not because of anything he did .

NCV	Romans	9	15	God said to Moses , “ I will show kindness to anyone to whom I want to show kindness , and I will show mercy to anyone to whom I want to show mercy. ” [ h ]
NCV	Romans	9	16	So God will choose the one to whom he decides to show mercy ; his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do .
NCV	Romans	9	17	The Scripture says to the king of Egypt : “ I made you king for this reason : to show my power in you so that my name will be talked about in all the earth. ” [ i ]
NCV	Romans	9	18	So God shows mercy where he wants to show mercy , and he makes stubborn the people he wants to make stubborn .
NCV	Romans	9	19	So one of you will ask me : “ Then why does God blame us for our sins ? Who can fight his will ? ”
NCV	Romans	9	20	You are only human , and human beings have no right to question God . An object should not ask the person who made it , “ Why did you make me like this ? ”
NCV	Romans	9	21	The potter can make anything he wants to make . He can use the same clay to make one thing for special use and another thing for daily use .
NCV	Romans	9	22	It is the same way with God . He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power . But he patiently stayed with those people he was angry with—people who were made ready to be destroyed .
NCV	Romans	9	23	""
NCV	Romans	9	24	and we are those people whom God called . He called us not from the Jews only but also from those who are not Jews .
NCV	Romans	9	25	As the Scripture says in Hosea : “ I will say , ‘ You are my people ’ to those I had called ‘ not my people. ’ And I will show my love to those people I did not love. ” Hosea 2:1 ,
NCV	Romans	9	26	“ They were called , ‘ You are not my people , ’ but later they will be called ‘ children of the living God. ’ ” Hosea 1:10
NCV	Romans	9	27	And Isaiah cries out about Israel : “ The people of Israel are many , like the grains of sand by the sea . But only a few of them will be saved ,
NCV	Romans	9	28	because the Lord will quickly and completely punish the people on the earth. ” Isaiah 10:22–23
NCV	Romans	9	29	It is as Isaiah said : “ The Lord All-Powerful allowed a few of our descendants to live . Otherwise we would have been completely destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. ” [ j ] Isaiah 1:9
NCV	Romans	9	30	So what does all this mean ? Those who are not Jews were not trying to make themselves right with God , but they were made right with God because of their faith .
NCV	Romans	9	31	The people of Israel tried to follow a law to make themselves right with God . But they did not succeed ,
NCV	Romans	9	32	because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did instead of trusting in God to make them right . They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble .
NCV	Romans	9	33	As it is written in the Scripture : “ I will put in Jerusalem a stone that causes people to stumble , a rock that makes them fall . Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed. ” Isaiah 8:14 ; 28:16 Footnotes - 9:5 born . . . forever ! This can also mean “ born .

NCV	Romans	10	10	We believe with our hearts , and so we are made right with God . And we declare with our mouths that we believe , and so we are saved .
NCV	Romans	10	2	I can say this about them : They really try to follow God , but they do not know the right way .
NCV	Romans	10	3	Because they did not know the way that God makes people right with him , they tried to make themselves right in their own way . So they did not accept God ’ s way of making people right .
NCV	Romans	10	4	Christ ended the law so that everyone who believes in him may be right with God .
NCV	Romans	10	5	Moses writes about being made right by following the law . He says , “ A person who obeys these things will live because of them. ” [ a ]
NCV	Romans	10	6	But this is what the Scripture says about being made right through faith : “ Don ’ t say to yourself , ‘ Who will go up into heaven ? ’ ” ( That means , “ Who will go up to heaven and bring Christ down to earth ? ” )
NCV	Romans	10	7	“ And do not say , ‘ Who will go down into the world below ? ’ ” ( That means , “ Who will go down and bring Christ up from the dead ? ” )
NCV	Romans	10	8	This is what the Scripture says : “ The word is near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart. ” [ b ] That is the teaching of faith that we are telling .
NCV	Romans	10	9	If you declare with your mouth , “ Jesus is Lord , ” and if you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead , you will be saved .
NCV	Romans	10	11	As the Scripture says , “ Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed. ” [ c ]
NCV	Romans	10	12	That Scripture says “ anyone ” because there is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not . The same Lord is the Lord of all and gives many blessings to all who trust in him ,
NCV	Romans	10	13	as the Scripture says , “ Anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved. ” [ d ]
NCV	Romans	10	14	But before people can ask the Lord for help , they must believe in him ; and before they can believe in him , they must hear about him ; and for them to hear about the Lord , someone must tell them ;
NCV	Romans	10	15	and before someone can go and tell them , that person must be sent . It is written , “ How beautiful is the person who comes to bring good news. ” [ e ]
NCV	Romans	10	16	But not all the Jews accepted the good news . Isaiah said , “ Lord , who believed what we told them ? ” [ f ]
NCV	Romans	10	17	So faith comes from hearing the Good News , and people hear the Good News when someone tells them about Christ .
NCV	Romans	10	18	But I ask : Didn ’ t people hear the Good News ? Yes , they heard—as the Scripture says : “ Their message went out through all the world ; their words go everywhere on earth. ” Psalm 19:4
NCV	Romans	10	19	Again I ask : Didn ’ t the people of Israel understand ? Yes , they did understand . First , Moses says : “ I will use those who are not a nation to make you jealous . I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry. ” Deuteronomy 32:21
NCV	Romans	10	20	Then Isaiah is bold enough to say : “ I was found by those who were not asking me for help . I made myself known to people who were not looking for me. ” Isaiah 65:1
NCV	Romans	10	21	But about Israel God says , “ All day long I stood ready to accept people who disobey and are stubborn. ” Isaiah 65:2 Footnotes - 10:5 “ A person . . . them. ” Quotation from Leviticus 18:5 . - 10:6–8 But . . . heart. ” Quotations from Deuteronomy 9:4 ; 30:12–14 ; Psalm 107:26 . - 10:11 “ Anyone . . . disappointed. ” Quotation from Isaiah 28:16 . - 10:13 “ Anyone . . . saved. ” Quotation from Joel 2:32 . - 10:15 “ How . . . news. ” Quotation from Isaiah 52:7 . - 10:16 “ Lord , . . . them ? ” Quotation from Isaiah 53:1 .

NCV	Romans	11	11	So I ask : When the Jews fell , did that fall destroy them ? No ! But their failure brought salvation to those who are not Jews , in order to make the Jews jealous .
NCV	Romans	11	2	God chose the Israelites to be his people before they were born , and he has not thrown his people out . Surely you know what the Scripture says about Elijah , how he prayed to God against the people of Israel .
NCV	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , ” he said , “ they have killed your prophets , and they have destroyed your altars . I am the only prophet left , and now they are trying to kill me , too. ” [ a ]
NCV	Romans	11	4	But what answer did God give Elijah ? He said , “ But I have left seven thousand people in Israel who have never bowed down before Baal. ” [ b ]
NCV	Romans	11	5	It is the same now . There are a few people that God has chosen by his grace .
NCV	Romans	11	6	And if he chose them by grace , it is not for the things they have done . If they could be made God ’ s people by what they did , God ’ s gift of grace would not really be a gift .
NCV	Romans	11	7	So this is what has happened : Although the Israelites tried to be right with God , they did not succeed , but the ones God chose did become right with him . The others were made stubborn and refused to listen to God .
NCV	Romans	11	8	As it is written in the Scriptures : “ God gave the people a dull mind so they could not understand. ” Isaiah 29:10 “ He closed their eyes so they could not see and their ears so they could not hear . This continues until today. ” Deuteronomy 29:4
NCV	Romans	11	9	And David says : “ Let their own feasts trap them and cause their ruin ; let their feasts cause them to stumble and be paid back .
NCV	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be closed so they can not see and their backs be forever weak from troubles. ” Psalm 69:22–23
NCV	Romans	11	12	The Jews ’ failure brought rich blessings for the world , and the Jews ’ loss brought rich blessings for the non-Jewish people . So surely the world will receive much richer blessings when enough Jews become the kind of people God wants .
NCV	Romans	11	13	Now I am speaking to you who are not Jews . I am an apostle to those who are not Jews , and since I have that work , I will make the most of it .
NCV	Romans	11	14	. - 11:4 “ But . . . Baal. ” Quotation from
NCV	Romans	11	15	When God turned away from the Jews , he became friends with other people in the world . So when God accepts the Jews , surely that will bring them life after death .
NCV	Romans	11	16	If the first piece of bread is offered to God , then the whole loaf is made holy . If the roots of a tree are holy , then the tree ’ s branches are holy too .
NCV	Romans	11	17	It is as if some of the branches from an olive tree have been broken off . You non-Jewish people are like the branch of a wild olive tree that has been joined to that first tree . You now share the strength and life of the first tree , the Jews .
NCV	Romans	11	18	So do not brag about those branches that were broken off . If you brag , remember that you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
NCV	Romans	11	19	You will say , “ Branches were broken off so that I could be joined to their tree. ”
NCV	Romans	11	20	That is true . But those branches were broken off because they did not believe , and you continue to be part of the tree only because you believe . Do not be proud , but be afraid .
NCV	Romans	11	21	If God did not let the natural branches of that tree stay , then he will not let you stay if you don ’ t believe .
NCV	Romans	11	22	So you see that God is kind and also very strict . He punishes those who stop following him . But God is kind to you , if you continue following in his kindness . If you do not , you will be cut off from the tree .
NCV	Romans	11	23	And if the Jews will believe in God again , he will accept them back . God is able to put them back where they were .
NCV	Romans	11	24	It is not natural for a wild branch to be part of a good tree . And you who are not Jews are like a branch cut from a wild olive tree and joined to a good olive tree . But since those Jews are like a branch that grew from the good tree , surely they can be joined to their own tree again .
NCV	Romans	11	25	I want you to understand this secret , brothers and sisters , so you will understand that you do not know everything : Part of Israel has been made stubborn , but that will change when many who are not Jews have come to God .
NCV	Romans	11	26	And that is how all Israel will be saved . It is written in the Scriptures : “ The Savior will come from Jerusalem ; he will take away all evil from the family of Jacob . [ c ]
NCV	Romans	11	27	And I will make this agreement with those people when I take away their sins. ” Isaiah 59:20–21 ; 27:9
NCV	Romans	11	28	The Jews refuse to accept the Good News , so they are God ’ s enemies . This has happened to help you who are not Jews . But the Jews are still God ’ s chosen people , and he loves them very much because of the promises he made to their ancestors .
NCV	Romans	11	29	God never changes his mind about the people he calls and the things he gives them .
NCV	Romans	11	30	At one time you refused to obey God . But now you have received mercy , because those people refused to obey .
NCV	Romans	11	31	And now the Jews refuse to obey , because God showed mercy to you . But this happened so that they also can [ d ] receive mercy from him .
NCV	Romans	11	32	God has given all people over to their stubborn ways so that he can show mercy to all . Praise to God
NCV	Romans	11	33	Yes , God ’ s riches are very great , and his wisdom and knowledge have no end ! No one can explain the things God decides or understand his ways .
NCV	Romans	11	34	As the Scripture says , “ Who has known the mind of the Lord , or who has been able to give him advice ? ” Isaiah 40:13
NCV	Romans	11	35	“ No one has ever given God anything that he must pay back. ” Job 41:11

NCV	Romans	12	12	Be joyful because you have hope . Be patient when trouble comes , and pray at all times .
NCV	Romans	12	2	Do not be shaped by this world ; instead be changed within by a new way of thinking . Then you will be able to decide what God wants for you ; you will know what is good and pleasing to him and what is perfect .
NCV	Romans	12	3	Because God has given me a special gift , I have something to say to everyone among you . Do not think you are better than you are . You must decide what you really are by the amount of faith God has given you .
NCV	Romans	12	4	Each one of us has a body with many parts , and these parts all have different uses .
NCV	Romans	12	5	In the same way , we are many , but in Christ we are all one body . Each one is a part of that body , and each part belongs to all the other parts .
NCV	Romans	12	6	We all have different gifts , each of which came because of the grace God gave us . The person who has the gift of prophecy should use that gift in agreement with the faith .
NCV	Romans	12	7	Anyone who has the gift of serving should serve . Anyone who has the gift of teaching should teach .
NCV	Romans	12	8	Whoever has the gift of encouraging others should encourage . Whoever has the gift of giving to others should give freely . Anyone who has the gift of being a leader should try hard when he leads . Whoever has the gift of showing mercy to others should do so with joy .
NCV	Romans	12	9	Your love must be real . Hate what is evil , and hold on to what is good .
NCV	Romans	12	10	Love each other like brothers and sisters . Give each other more honor than you want for yourselves .
NCV	Romans	12	11	Do not be lazy but work hard , serving the Lord with all your heart .
NCV	Romans	12	13	Share with God ’ s people who need help . Bring strangers in need into your homes .
NCV	Romans	12	14	Wish good for those who harm you ; wish them well and do not curse them .
NCV	Romans	12	15	Be happy with those who are happy , and be sad with those who are sad .
NCV	Romans	12	16	Live in peace with each other . Do not be proud , but make friends with those who seem unimportant . Do not think how smart you are .
NCV	Romans	12	17	If someone does wrong to you , do not pay him back by doing wrong to him . Try to do what everyone thinks is right .
NCV	Romans	12	18	Do your best to live in peace with everyone .
NCV	Romans	12	19	My friends , do not try to punish others when they wrong you , but wait for God to punish them with his anger . It is written : “ I will punish those who do wrong ; I will repay them , ” [ a ] says the Lord .
NCV	Romans	12	20	But you should do this : “ If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him a drink . Doing this will be like pouring burning coals on his head. ” Proverbs 25:21–22

NCV	Romans	13	13	Let us live in a right way , like people who belong to the day . We should not have wild parties or get drunk . There should be no sexual sins of any kind , no fighting or jealousy .
NCV	Romans	13	2	So those who are against the government are really against what God has commanded . And they will bring punishment on themselves .
NCV	Romans	13	3	Those who do right do not have to fear the rulers ; only those who do wrong fear them . Do you want to be unafraid of the rulers ? Then do what is right , and they will praise you .
NCV	Romans	13	4	The ruler is God ’ s servant to help you . But if you do wrong , then be afraid . He has the power to punish ; he is God ’ s servant to punish those who do wrong .
NCV	Romans	13	5	So you must yield to the government , not only because you might be punished , but because you know it is right .
NCV	Romans	13	6	This is also why you pay taxes . Rulers are working for God and give their time to their work .
NCV	Romans	13	7	Pay everyone , then , what you owe . If you owe any kind of tax , pay it . Show respect and honor to them all . Loving Others
NCV	Romans	13	8	Do not owe people anything , except always owe love to each other , because the person who loves others has obeyed all the law .
NCV	Romans	13	9	The law says , “ You must not be guilty of adultery . You must not murder anyone . You must not steal . You must not want to take your neighbor ’ s things. ” [ a ] All these commands and all others are really only one rule : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ” [ b ]
NCV	Romans	13	10	Love never hurts a neighbor , so loving is obeying all the law .
NCV	Romans	13	11	Do this because we live in an important time . It is now time for you to wake up from your sleep , because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed .
NCV	Romans	13	12	The “ night ” [ c ] is almost finished , and the “ day ” [ d ] is almost here . So we should stop doing things that belong to darkness and take up the weapons used for fighting in the light .

NCV	Romans	14	14	I am in the Lord Jesus , and I know that there is no food that is wrong to eat . But if a person believes something is wrong , that thing is wrong for him .
NCV	Romans	14	2	One person believes it is right to eat all kinds of food . [ a ] But another , who is weak , believes it is right to eat only vegetables .
NCV	Romans	14	3	The one who knows that it is right to eat any kind of food must not reject the one who eats only vegetables . And the person who eats only vegetables must not think that the one who eats all foods is wrong , because God has accepted that person .
NCV	Romans	14	4	You can not judge another person ’ s servant . The master decides if the servant is doing well or not . And the Lord ’ s servant will do well because the Lord helps him do well .
NCV	Romans	14	5	Some think that one day is more important than another , and others think that every day is the same . Let all be sure in their own mind .
NCV	Romans	14	6	Those who think one day is more important than other days are doing that for the Lord . And those who eat all kinds of food are doing that for the Lord , and they give thanks to God . Others who refuse to eat some foods do that for the Lord , and they give thanks to God .
NCV	Romans	14	7	We do not live or die for ourselves .
NCV	Romans	14	8	If we live , we are living for the Lord , and if we die , we are dying for the Lord . So living or dying , we belong to the Lord .
NCV	Romans	14	9	The reason Christ died and rose from the dead to live again was so he would be Lord over both the dead and the living .
NCV	Romans	14	10	So why do you judge your brothers or sisters in Christ ? And why do you think you are better than they are ? We will all stand before God to be judged ,
NCV	Romans	14	11	because it is written in the Scriptures : “ ‘ As surely as I live , ’ says the Lord , ‘ Everyone will bow before me ; everyone will say that I am God. ’ ” Isaiah 45:23
NCV	Romans	14	12	So each of us will have to answer to God . Do Not Cause Others to Sin
NCV	Romans	14	13	For that reason we should stop judging each other . We must make up our minds not to do anything that will make another Christian sin .
NCV	Romans	14	15	If you hurt your brother ’ s or sister ’ s faith because of something you eat , you are not really following the way of love . Do not destroy someone ’ s faith by eating food he thinks is wrong , because Christ died for him .
NCV	Romans	14	16	Do not allow what you think is good to become what others say is evil .
NCV	Romans	14	17	In the kingdom of God , eating and drinking are not important . The important things are living right with God , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit .
NCV	Romans	14	18	Anyone who serves Christ by living this way is pleasing God and will be accepted by other people .
NCV	Romans	14	19	So let us try to do what makes peace and helps one another .
NCV	Romans	14	20	Do not let the eating of food destroy the work of God . All foods are all right to eat , but it is wrong to eat food that causes someone else to sin .
NCV	Romans	14	21	It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that will cause your brother or sister to sin .
NCV	Romans	14	22	Your beliefs about these things should be kept secret between you and God . People are happy if they can do what they think is right without feeling guilty .
NCV	Romans	14	23	But those who eat something without being sure it is right are wrong because they did not believe it was right . Anything that is done without believing it is right is a sin .

NCV	Romans	15	15	But I have written to you very openly about some things I wanted you to remember . I did this because God gave me this special gift :
NCV	Romans	15	2	Let each of us please our neighbors for their good , to help them be stronger in faith .
NCV	Romans	15	3	Even Christ did not live to please himself . It was as the Scriptures said : “ When people insult you , it hurts me. ” [ a ]
NCV	Romans	15	4	Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us . The Scriptures give us patience and encouragement so that we can have hope .
NCV	Romans	15	5	May the patience and encouragement that come from God allow you to live in harmony with each other the way Christ Jesus wants .
NCV	Romans	15	6	Then you will all be joined together , and you will give glory to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NCV	Romans	15	7	Christ accepted you , so you should accept each other , which will bring glory to God .
NCV	Romans	15	8	I tell you that Christ became a servant of the Jews to show that God ’ s promises to the Jewish ancestors are true .
NCV	Romans	15	9	And he also did this so that those who are not Jews could give glory to God for the mercy he gives to them . It is written in the Scriptures : “ So I will praise you among the non-Jewish people . I will sing praises to your name. ” Psalm 18:49
NCV	Romans	15	10	The Scripture also says , “ Be happy , you who are not Jews , together with his people. ” Deuteronomy 32:43
NCV	Romans	15	11	Again the Scripture says , “ All you who are not Jews , praise the Lord . All you people , sing praises to him. ” Psalm 117:1
NCV	Romans	15	12	And Isaiah says , “ A new king will come from the family of Jesse . [ b ] He will come to rule over the non-Jewish people , and they will have hope because of him. ” Isaiah 11:10
NCV	Romans	15	13	I pray that the God who gives hope will fill you with much joy and peace while you trust in him . Then your hope will overflow by the power of the Holy Spirit . Paul Talks About His Work
NCV	Romans	15	14	My brothers and sisters , I am sure that you are full of goodness . I know that you have all the knowledge you need and that you are able to teach each other .
NCV	Romans	15	16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to those who are not Jews . I served God by teaching his Good News , so that the non-Jewish people could be an offering that God would accept—an offering made holy by the Holy Spirit .
NCV	Romans	15	17	So I am proud of what I have done for God in Christ Jesus .
NCV	Romans	15	18	I will not talk about anything except what Christ has done through me in leading those who are not Jews to obey God . They have obeyed God because of what I have said and done ,
NCV	Romans	15	19	because of the power of miracles and the great things they saw , and because of the power of the Holy Spirit . I preached the Good News from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum , and so I have finished that part of my work .
NCV	Romans	15	20	I always want to preach the Good News in places where people have never heard of Christ , because I do not want to build on the work someone else has already started .
NCV	Romans	15	21	But it is written in the Scriptures : “ Those who were not told about him will see , and those who have not heard about him will understand. ” Isaiah 52:15 Paul ’ s Plan to Visit Rome
NCV	Romans	15	22	This is the reason I was stopped many times from coming to you .
NCV	Romans	15	23	Now I have finished my work here . Since for many years I have wanted to come to you ,
NCV	Romans	15	24	I hope to visit you on my way to Spain . After I enjoy being with you for a while , I hope you can help me on my trip .
NCV	Romans	15	25	Now I am going to Jerusalem to help God ’ s people .
NCV	Romans	15	26	The believers in Macedonia and Southern Greece were happy to give their money to help the poor among God ’ s people at Jerusalem .
NCV	Romans	15	27	They were happy to do this , and really they owe it to them . These who are not Jews have shared in the Jews ’ spiritual blessings , so they should use their material possessions to help the Jews .
NCV	Romans	15	28	After I am sure the poor in Jerusalem get the money that has been given for them , I will leave for Spain and stop and visit you .
NCV	Romans	15	29	I know that when I come to you I will bring Christ ’ s full blessing .
NCV	Romans	15	30	Brothers and sisters , I beg you to help me in my work by praying to God for me . Do this because of our Lord Jesus and the love that the Holy Spirit gives us .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	1	From Paul . God called me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus because that is what God wanted . Also from Sosthenes , our brother in Christ .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To the church of God in Corinth , to you who have been made holy in Christ Jesus . You were called to be God ’ s holy people with all people everywhere who pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours :
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Paul Gives Thanks to God
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I always thank my God for you because of the grace God has given you in Christ Jesus .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	5	I thank God because in Christ you have been made rich in every way , in all your speaking and in all your knowledge .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	6	Just as our witness about Christ has been guaranteed to you ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so you have every gift from God while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	8	Jesus will keep you strong until the end so that there will be no wrong in you on the day our Lord Jesus Christ comes again .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God , who has called you into fellowship with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord , is faithful . Problems in the Church
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	10	I beg you , brothers and sisters , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that all of you agree with each other and not be split into groups . I beg that you be completely joined together by having the same kind of thinking and the same purpose .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	11	My brothers and sisters , some people from Chloe ’ s family have told me quite plainly that there are quarrels among you .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	12	This is what I mean : One of you says , “ I follow Paul ” ; another says , “ I follow Apollos ” ; another says , “ I follow Peter ” ; and another says , “ I follow Christ. ”
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Christ has been divided up into different groups ! Did Paul die on the cross for you ? No ! Were you baptized in the name of Paul ? No !
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	15	so that now no one can say you were baptized in my name .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	16	( I also baptized the family of Stephanas , but I do not remember that I baptized anyone else . )
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	17	Christ did not send me to baptize people but to preach the Good News . And he sent me to preach the Good News without using words of human wisdom so that the cross [ a ] of Christ would not lose its power . Christ Is God ’ s Power and Wisdom
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	18	The teaching about the cross is foolishness to those who are being lost , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	19	It is written in the Scriptures : “ I will cause the wise to lose their wisdom ; I will make the wise unable to understand. ” Isaiah 29:14
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise person ? Where is the educated person ? Where is the skilled talker of this world ? God has made the wisdom of the world foolish .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	21	In the wisdom of God the world did not know God through its own wisdom . So God chose to use the message that sounds foolish to save those who believe .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	22	The Jews ask for miracles , and the Greeks want wisdom .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	23	But we preach a crucified Christ . This causes the Jews to stumble and is foolishness to non-Jews .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	24	But Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God to those people God has called—Jews and Greeks .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	25	Even the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	26	Brothers and sisters , look at what you were when God called you . Not many of you were wise in the way the world judges wisdom . Not many of you had great influence . Not many of you came from important families .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise , and he chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	28	He chose what the world thinks is unimportant and what the world looks down on and thinks is nothing in order to destroy what the world thinks is important .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	29	God did this so that no one can brag in his presence .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	30	Because of God you are in Christ Jesus , who has become for us wisdom from God . In Christ we are put right with God , and have been made holy , and have been set free from sin .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	1	31	So , as the Scripture says , “ If people want to brag , they should brag only about the Lord. ” [ b ] Footnotes - 1:17 cross Paul uses the cross as a picture of the Good News , the story of Christ ’ s death and rising from the dead for people ’ s sins .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	2	I decided that while I was with you I would forget about everything except Jesus Christ and his death on the cross .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	3	So when I came to you , I was weak and fearful and trembling .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	4	My teaching and preaching were not with words of human wisdom that persuade people but with proof of the power that the Spirit gives .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	5	This was so that your faith would be in God ’ s power and not in human wisdom . God ’ s Wisdom
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	6	However , I speak a wisdom to those who are mature . But this wisdom is not from this world or from the rulers of this world , who are losing their power .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	7	I speak God ’ s secret wisdom , which he has kept hidden . Before the world began , God planned this wisdom for our glory .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	8	None of the rulers of this world understood it . If they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written in the Scriptures : “ No one has ever seen this , and no one has ever heard about it . No one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him. ” Isaiah 64:4
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	10	But God has shown us these things through the Spirit . The Spirit searches out all things , even the deep secrets of God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	11	Who knows the thoughts that another person has ? Only a person ’ s spirit that lives within him knows his thoughts . It is the same with God . No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we did not receive the spirit of the world , but we received the Spirit that is from God so that we can know all that God has given us .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	13	And we speak about these things , not with words taught us by human wisdom but with words taught us by the Spirit . And so we explain spiritual truths to spiritual people .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	14	A person who does not have the Spirit does not accept the truths that come from the Spirit of God . That person thinks they are foolish and can not understand them , because they can only be judged to be true by the Spirit .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	15	The spiritual person is able to judge all things , but no one can judge him . The Scripture says :
NCV	1%20Corinthians	2	16	“ Who has known the mind of the Lord ? Who has been able to teach him ? ” Isaiah 40:13 But we have the mind of Christ . Footnotes - 2:1 God ’ s secret Some Greek copies read “ God ’ s message. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	3	You are still not spiritual , because there is jealousy and quarreling among you , and this shows that you are not spiritual . You are acting like people of the world .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	2	The teaching I gave you was like milk , not solid food , because you were not able to take solid food . And even now you are not ready .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	4	One of you says , “ I belong to Paul , ” and another says , “ I belong to Apollos. ” When you say things like this , you are acting like people of the world .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Is Apollos important ? No ! Is Paul important ? No ! We are only servants of God who helped you believe . Each one of us did the work God gave us to do .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted the seed , and Apollos watered it . But God is the One who made it grow .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So the one who plants is not important , and the one who waters is not important . Only God , who makes things grow , is important .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	8	The one who plants and the one who waters have the same purpose , and each will be rewarded for his own work .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	9	We are God ’ s workers , working together ; you are like God ’ s farm , God ’ s house .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	10	Using the gift God gave me , I laid the foundation of that house like an expert builder . Others are building on that foundation , but all people should be careful how they build on it .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	11	The foundation that has already been laid is Jesus Christ , and no one can lay down any other foundation .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	12	But if people build on that foundation , using gold , silver , jewels , wood , grass , or straw ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	13	their work will be clearly seen , because the Day of Judgment [ a ] will make it visible . That Day will appear with fire , and the fire will test everyone ’ s work to show what sort of work it was .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If the building that has been put on the foundation still stands , the builder will get a reward .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	15	But if the building is burned up , the builder will suffer loss . The builder will be saved , but it will be as one who escaped from a fire .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Don ’ t you know that you are God ’ s temple and that God ’ s Spirit lives in you ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys God ’ s temple , God will destroy that person , because God ’ s temple is holy and you are that temple .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Do not fool yourselves . If you think you are wise in this world , you should become a fool so that you can become truly wise ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	19	because the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . It is written in the Scriptures , “ He catches those who are wise in their own clever traps. ” [ b ]
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	20	It is also written in the Scriptures , “ The Lord knows what wise people think . He knows their thoughts are just a puff of wind. ” [ c ]
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So you should not brag about human leaders . All things belong to you :
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	22	Paul , Apollos , and Peter ; the world , life , death , the present , and the future—all these belong to you .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	3	23	And you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	4	I know of no wrong I have done , but this does not make me right before the Lord . The Lord is the One who judges me .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Now in this way those who are trusted with something valuable must show they are worthy of that trust .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	3	As for myself , I do not care if I am judged by you or by any human court . I do not even judge myself .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So do not judge before the right time ; wait until the Lord comes . He will bring to light things that are now hidden in darkness , and will make known the secret purposes of people ’ s hearts . Then God will praise each one of them .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Brothers and sisters , I have used Apollos and myself as examples so you could learn through us the meaning of the saying , “ Follow only what is written in the Scriptures. ” Then you will not be more proud of one person than another .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	7	Who says you are better than others ? What do you have that was not given to you ? And if it was given to you , why do you brag as if you did not receive it as a gift ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You think you already have everything you need . You think you are rich . You think you have become kings without us . I wish you really were kings so we could be kings together with you .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	9	But it seems to me that God has put us apostles in last place , like those sentenced to die . We are like a show for the whole world to see—angels and people .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ ’ s sake , but you are very wise in Christ . We are weak , but you are strong . You receive honor , but we are shamed .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Even to this very hour we do not have enough to eat or drink or to wear . We are often beaten , and we have no homes in which to live .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	12	We work hard with our own hands for our food . When people curse us , we bless them . When they hurt us , we put up with it .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	13	When they tell evil lies about us , we speak nice words about them . Even today , we are treated as though we were the garbage of the world—the filth of the earth .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I am not trying to make you feel ashamed . I am writing this to give you a warning as my own dear children .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For though you may have ten thousand teachers in Christ , you do not have many fathers . Through the Good News I became your father in Christ Jesus ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	16	so I beg you , please follow my example .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	17	That is why I am sending to you Timothy , my son in the Lord . I love Timothy , and he is faithful . He will help you remember my way of life in Christ Jesus , just as I teach it in all the churches everywhere .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Some of you have become proud , thinking that I will not come to you again .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you very soon if the Lord wishes . Then I will know what the proud ones do , not what they say ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	4	20	because the kingdom of God is present not in talk but in power .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	5	then hand this man over to Satan . So his sinful self [ a ] will be destroyed , and his spirit will be saved on the day of the Lord .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And you are proud ! You should have been filled with sadness so that the man who did this should be put out of your group .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	3	I am not there with you in person , but I am with you in spirit . And I have already judged the man who did that sin as if I were really there .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	4	When you meet together in the name of our Lord Jesus , and I meet with you in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your bragging is not good . You know the saying , “ Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise. ”
NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Take out all the old yeast so that you will be a new batch of dough without yeast , which you really are . For Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	8	So let us celebrate this feast , but not with the bread that has the old yeast—the yeast of sin and wickedness . Let us celebrate this feast with the bread that has no yeast—the bread of goodness and truth .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote you in my earlier letter not to associate with those who sin sexually .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	10	But I did not mean you should not associate with those of this world who sin sexually , or with the greedy , or robbers , or those who worship idols . To get away from them you would have to leave this world .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	5	11	I am writing to tell you that you must not associate with those who call themselves believers in Christ but who sin sexually , or are greedy , or worship idols , or abuse others with words , or get drunk , or cheat people . Do not even eat with people like that . 12-13 It is not my business to judge those who are not part of the church . God will judge them . But you must judge the people who are part of the church .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But now one believer goes to court against another believer—and you do this in front of unbelievers !
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Surely you know that God ’ s people will judge the world . So if you are to judge the world , are you not able to judge small cases as well ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	3	You know that in the future we will judge angels , so surely we can judge the ordinary things of this life .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	4	If you have ordinary cases that must be judged , are you going to appoint people as judges who mean nothing to the church ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say this to shame you . Surely there is someone among you wise enough to judge a complaint between believers .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	7	The fact that you have lawsuits against each other shows that you are already defeated . Why not let yourselves be wronged ? Why not let yourselves be cheated ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	8	But you yourselves do wrong and cheat , and you do this to other believers !
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	9	-
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	10	Surely you know that the people who do wrong will not inherit God ’ s kingdom . Do not be fooled . Those who sin sexually , worship idols , take part in adultery , those who are male prostitutes , or men who have sexual relations with other men , those who steal , are greedy , get drunk , lie about others , or rob—these people will not inherit God ’ s kingdom .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	11	In the past , some of you were like that , but you were washed clean . You were made holy , and you were made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God . Use Your Bodies for God ’ s Glory
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	12	“ I am allowed to do all things , ” but not all things are good for me to do . “ I am allowed to do all things , ” but I will not let anything make me its slave .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	13	“ Food is for the stomach , and the stomach for food , ” but God will destroy them both . The body is not for sexual sin but for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	14	By his power God has raised the Lord from the dead and will also raise us from the dead .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Surely you know that your bodies are parts of Christ himself . So I must never take the parts of Christ and join them to a prostitute !
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	16	It is written in the Scriptures , “ The two will become one body. ” [ a ] So you should know that anyone who joins with a prostitute becomes one body with the prostitute .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But the one who joins with the Lord is one spirit with the Lord .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	18	So run away from sexual sin . Every other sin people do is outside their bodies , but those who sin sexually sin against their own bodies .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	19	You should know that your body is a temple for the Holy Spirit who is in you . You have received the Holy Spirit from God . So you do not belong to yourselves ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	6	20	because you were bought by God for a price . So honor God with your bodies . Footnotes - 6:16 “ The two . . . body. ” Quotation from Genesis 2:24 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	7	I wish that everyone were like me , but each person has his own gift from God . One has one gift , another has another gift .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But because sexual sin is a danger , each man should have his own wife , and each woman should have her own husband .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband should give his wife all that he owes her as his wife . And the wife should give her husband all that she owes him as her husband .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife does not have full rights over her own body ; her husband shares them . And the husband does not have full rights over his own body ; his wife shares them .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Do not refuse to give your bodies to each other , unless you both agree to stay away from sexual relations for a time so you can give your time to prayer . Then come together again so Satan can not tempt you because of a lack of self-control .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	6	I say this to give you permission to stay away from sexual relations for a time . It is not a command to do so .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	8	Now for those who are not married and for the widows I say this : It is good for them to stay unmarried as I am .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can not control themselves , they should marry . It is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	10	Now I give this command for the married people . ( The command is not from me ; it is from the Lord . ) A wife should not leave her husband .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But if she does leave , she must not marry again , or she should make up with her husband . Also the husband should not divorce his wife .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	12	For all the others I say this ( I am saying this , not the Lord ) : If a Christian man has a wife who is not a believer , and she is happy to live with him , he must not divorce her .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And if a Christian woman has a husband who is not a believer , and he is happy to live with her , she must not divorce him .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	14	The husband who is not a believer is made holy through his believing wife . And the wife who is not a believer is made holy through her believing husband . If this were not true , your children would not be clean , but now your children are holy .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if those who are not believers decide to leave , let them leave . When this happens , the Christian man or woman is free . But God called us [ a ] to live in peace .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	16	Wife , you don ’ t know ; maybe you will save your husband . And husband , you don ’ t know ; maybe you will save your wife . Live as God Called You
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But in any case each one of you should continue to live the way God has given you to live—the way you were when God called you . This is a rule I make in all the churches .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	18	If a man was already circumcised when he was called , he should not undo his circumcision . If a man was without circumcision when he was called , he should not be circumcised .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	19	It is not important if a man is circumcised or not . The important thing is obeying God ’ s commands .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each one of you should stay the way you were when God called you .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	21	If you were a slave when God called you , do not let that bother you . But if you can be free , then make good use of your freedom .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	22	Those who were slaves when the Lord called them are free persons who belong to the Lord . In the same way , those who were free when they were called are now Christ ’ s slaves .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You all were bought at a great price , so do not become slaves of people .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brothers and sisters , each of you should stay as you were when you were called , and stay there with God . Questions About Getting Married
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now I write about people who are not married . I have no command from the Lord about this ; I give my opinion . But I can be trusted , because the Lord has shown me mercy .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	26	The present time is a time of trouble , so I think it is good for you to stay the way you are .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	27	If you have a wife , do not try to become free from her . If you are not married , do not try to find a wife .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you decide to marry , you have not sinned . And if a girl who has never married decides to marry , she has not sinned . But those who marry will have trouble in this life , and I want you to be free from trouble .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	29	Brothers and sisters , this is what I mean : We do not have much time left . So starting now , those who have wives should live as if they had no wives .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	30	Those who are crying should live as if they were not crying . Those who are happy should live as if they were not happy . Those who buy things should live as if they own nothing .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	31	Those who use the things of the world should live as if they were not using them , because this world in its present form will soon be gone .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	32	I want you to be free from worry . A man who is not married is busy with the Lord ’ s work , trying to please the Lord .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But a man who is married is busy with things of the world , trying to please his wife .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	34	He must think about two things—pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord . A woman who is not married or a girl who has never married is busy with the Lord ’ s work . She wants to be holy in body and spirit . But a married woman is busy with things of the world , as to how she can please her husband .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I am saying this to help you , not to limit you . But I want you to live in the right way , to give yourselves fully to the Lord without concern for other things .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	36	If a man thinks he is not doing the right thing with the girl he is engaged to , if she is almost past the best age to marry and he feels he should marry her , he should do what he wants . They should get married . It is no sin .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But if a man is sure in his mind that there is no need for marriage , and has his own desires under control , and has decided not to marry the one to whom he is engaged , he is doing the right thing .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So the man who marries his girl does right , but the man who does not marry will do better .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A woman must stay with her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry any man she wants , but she must marry another believer .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	7	40	The woman is happier if she does not marry again . This is my opinion , but I believe I also have God ’ s Spirit . Footnotes - 7:15 us Some Greek copies read “ you. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But food will not bring us closer to God . Refusing to eat does not make us less pleasing to God , and eating does not make us better in God ’ s sight .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	2	If you think you know something , you do not yet know anything as you should .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if any person loves God , that person is known by God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	4	So this is what I say about eating meat sacrificed to idols : We know that an idol is really nothing in the world , and we know there is only one God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	5	Even though there are things called gods , in heaven or on earth ( and there are many “ gods ” and “ lords ” ) ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	6	for us there is only one God—our Father . All things came from him , and we live for him . And there is only one Lord—Jesus Christ . All things were made through him , and we also were made through him .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But not all people know this . Some people are still so used to idols that when they eat meat , they still think of it as being sacrificed to an idol . Because their conscience is weak , when they eat it , they feel guilty .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But be careful that your freedom does not cause those who are weak in faith to fall into sin .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	10	Suppose one of you who has knowledge eats in an idol ’ s temple . [ a ] Someone who is weak in faith might see you eating there and be encouraged to eat meat sacrificed to idols while thinking it is wrong to do so .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	11	This weak believer for whom Christ died is ruined because of your “ knowledge. ”
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	12	When you sin against your brothers and sisters in Christ like this and cause them to do what they feel is wrong , you are also sinning against Christ .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	8	13	So if the food I eat causes them to fall into sin , I will never eat meat again so that I will not cause any of them to sin . Footnotes - 8:10 idol ’ s temple Building where a god is worshiped . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	9	It is written in the law of Moses : “ When an ox is working in the grain , do not cover its mouth to keep it from eating. ” [ a ] When God said this , was he thinking only about oxen ? No .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If others do not accept me as an apostle , surely you do , because you are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	3	This is the answer I give people who want to judge me :
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Do we not have the right to eat and drink ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Do we not have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel as do the other apostles and the Lord ’ s brothers and Peter ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	7	No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary . No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes . No person takes care of a flock without drinking some of the milk .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	8	I do not say this by human authority ; God ’ s law also says the same thing .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	10	He was really talking about us . Yes , that Scripture was written for us , because it goes on to say : “ The one who plows and the one who works in the grain should hope to get some of the grain for their work. ”
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	11	Since we planted spiritual seed among you , is it too much if we should harvest material things ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others have the right to get something from you , surely we have this right , too . But we do not use it . No , we put up with everything ourselves so that we will not keep anyone from believing the Good News of Christ .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple , and those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	14	In the same way , the Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have not used any of these rights . And I am not writing this now to get anything from you . I would rather die than to have my reason for bragging taken away .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	16	Telling the Good News does not give me any reason for bragging . Telling the Good News is my duty—something I must do . And how terrible it will be for me if I do not tell the Good News .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	17	If I preach because it is my own choice , I have a reward . But if I preach and it is not my choice to do so , I am only doing the duty that was given to me .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	18	So what reward do I get ? This is my reward : that when I tell the Good News I can offer it freely . I do not use my full rights in my work of preaching the Good News .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	19	I am free and belong to no one . But I make myself a slave to all people to win as many as I can .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became like a Jew to win the Jews . I myself am not ruled by the law . But to those who are ruled by the law I became like a person who is ruled by the law . I did this to win those who are ruled by the law .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To those who are without the law I became like a person who is without the law . I did this to win those people who are without the law . ( But really , I am not without God ’ s law—I am ruled by Christ ’ s law . )
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To those who are weak , I became weak so I could win the weak . I have become all things to all people so I could save some of them in any way possible .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all this because of the Good News and so I can share in its blessings .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	24	You know that in a race all the runners run , but only one gets the prize . So run to win !
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	25	All those who compete in the games use self-control so they can win a crown . That crown is an earthly thing that lasts only a short time , but our crown will never be destroyed .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	26	So I do not run without a goal . I fight like a boxer who is hitting something—not just the air .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	9	27	I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others . Footnotes - 9:9 “ When an ox . . . eating. ” Quotation from Deuteronomy 25:4 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	10	Do not complain as some of them did ; they were killed by the angel that destroys .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	2	They were all baptized as followers of Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	3	They all ate the same spiritual food ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same spiritual drink . They drank from that spiritual rock that followed them , and that rock was Christ .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	5	But God was not pleased with most of them , so they died in the desert .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	6	And these things happened as examples for us , to stop us from wanting evil things as those people did .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Do not worship idols , as some of them did . Just as it is written in the Scriptures : “ They sat down to eat and drink , and then they got up and sinned sexually. ” [ a ]
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	8	We must not take part in sexual sins , as some of them did . In one day twenty-three thousand of them died because of their sins .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	9	We must not test Christ as some of them did ; they were killed by snakes .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	11	The things that happened to those people are examples . They were written down to teach us , because we live in a time when all these things of the past have reached their goal .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	12	If you think you are strong , you should be careful not to fall .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	13	The only temptation that has come to you is that which everyone has . But you can trust God , who will not permit you to be tempted more than you can stand . But when you are tempted , he will also give you a way to escape so that you will be able to stand it .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	14	So , my dear friends , run away from the worship of idols .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I am speaking to you as to reasonable people ; judge for yourselves what I say .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	16	We give thanks for the cup of blessing , [ b ] which is a sharing in the blood of Christ . And the bread that we break is a sharing in the body of Christ .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	17	Because there is one loaf of bread , we who are many are one body , because we all share that one loaf .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Think about the Israelites : Do not those who eat the sacrifices share in the altar ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	19	I do not mean that the food sacrificed to an idol is important . I do not mean that an idol is anything at all .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	20	But I say that what is sacrificed to idols is offered to demons , not to God . And I do not want you to share anything with demons .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can not drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons also . You can not share in the Lord ’ s table and the table of demons .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Are we trying to make the Lord jealous ? We are not stronger than he is , are we ? How to Use Christian Freedom
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	23	“ We are allowed to do all things , ” but not all things are good for us to do . “ We are allowed to do all things , ” but not all things help others grow stronger .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Do not look out only for yourselves . Look out for the good of others also .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Eat any meat that is sold in the meat market . Do not ask questions about it .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	26	You may eat it , “ because the earth belongs to the Lord , and everything in it. ” [ c ]
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	27	Those who are not believers may invite you to eat with them . If you want to go , eat anything that is put before you . Do not ask questions about it .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if anyone says to you , “ That food was offered to idols , ” do not eat it . Do not eat it because of that person who told you and because eating it might be thought to be wrong .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	29	I don ’ t mean you think it is wrong , but the other person might . But why , you ask , should my freedom be judged by someone else ’ s conscience ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If I eat the meal with thankfulness , why am I criticized because of something for which I thank God ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	31	The answer is , if you eat or drink , or if you do anything , do it all for the glory of God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Never do anything that might hurt others—Jews , Greeks , or God ’ s church—
NCV	1%20Corinthians	10	33	just as I , also , try to please everybody in every way . I am not trying to do what is good for me but what is good for most people so they can be saved .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	11	But in the Lord women are not independent of men , and men are not independent of women .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	2	I praise you because you remember me in everything , and you follow closely the teachings just as I gave them to you .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to understand this : The head of every man is Christ , the head of a woman is the man , [ a ] and the head of Christ is God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame to his head .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered brings shame to her head . She is the same as a woman who has her head shaved .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	6	If a woman does not cover her head , she should have her hair cut off . But since it is shameful for a woman to cut off her hair or to shave her head , she should cover her head .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	7	But a man should not cover his head , because he is the likeness and glory of God . But woman is man ’ s glory .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	8	Man did not come from woman , but woman came from man .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	9	And man was not made for woman , but woman was made for man .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	10	So that is why a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	12	This is true because woman came from man , but also man is born from woman . But everything comes from God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Decide this for yourselves : Is it right for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Even nature itself teaches you that wearing long hair is shameful for a man .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But long hair is a woman ’ s glory . Long hair is given to her as a covering .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	16	Some people may still want to argue about this , but I would add that neither we nor the churches of God have any other practice . The Lord ’ s Supper
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	17	In the things I tell you now I do not praise you , because when you come together you do more harm than good .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	18	First , I hear that when you meet together as a church you are divided , and I believe some of this .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	19	( It is necessary to have differences among you so that it may be clear which of you really have God ’ s approval . )
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When you come together , you are not really eating the Lord ’ s Supper . [ b ]
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	21	This is because when you eat , each person eats without waiting for the others . Some people do not get enough to eat , while others have too much to drink .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	22	You can eat and drink in your own homes ! You seem to think God ’ s church is not important , and you embarrass those who are poor . What should I tell you ? Should I praise you ? I do not praise you for doing this .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	23	The teaching I gave you is the same teaching I received from the Lord : On the night when the Lord Jesus was handed over to be killed , he took bread
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and gave thanks for it . Then he broke the bread and said , “ This is my body ; it is [ c ] for you . Do this to remember me. ”
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same way , after they ate , Jesus took the cup . He said , “ This cup is the new agreement that is sealed with the blood of my death . When you drink this , do it to remember me. ”
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	26	Every time you eat this bread and drink this cup you are telling others about the Lord ’ s death until he comes .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	27	So a person who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is not worthy of it will be guilty of sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	28	Look into your own hearts before you eat the bread and drink the cup ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	29	because all who eat the bread and drink the cup without recognizing the body eat and drink judgment against themselves .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	30	That is why many in your group are sick and weak , and some of you have died .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we judged ourselves in the right way , God would not judge us .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when the Lord judges us , he disciplines us so that we will not be destroyed along with the world .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So my brothers and sisters , when you come together to eat , wait for each other .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	11	34	Anyone who is too hungry should eat at home so that in meeting together you will not bring God ’ s judgment on yourselves . I will tell you what to do about the other things when I come .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	12	A person ’ s body is one thing , but it has many parts . Though there are many parts to a body , all those parts make only one body . Christ is like that also .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know the way you lived before you were believers . You let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols—things that could not speak .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	3	So I want you to understand that no one who is speaking with the help of God ’ s Spirit says , “ Jesus be cursed. ” And no one can say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” without the help of the Holy Spirit .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	4	There are different kinds of gifts , but they are all from the same Spirit .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	5	There are different ways to serve but the same Lord to serve .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are different ways that God works through people but the same God . God works in all of us in everything we do .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	7	Something from the Spirit can be seen in each person , for the common good .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	8	The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak with wisdom , and the same Spirit gives another the ability to speak with knowledge .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	9	The same Spirit gives faith to one person . And , to another , that one Spirit gives gifts of healing .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	10	The Spirit gives to another person the power to do miracles , to another the ability to prophesy . And he gives to another the ability to know the difference between good and evil spirits . The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak in different kinds of languages [ a ] and to another the ability to interpret those languages .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	11	One Spirit , the same Spirit , does all these things , and the Spirit decides what to give each person . The Body of Christ Works Together
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	13	Some of us are Jews , and some are Greeks . Some of us are slaves , and some are free . But we were all baptized into one body through one Spirit . And we were all made to share in the one Spirit .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	14	The human body has many parts .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	15	The foot might say , “ Because I am not a hand , I am not part of the body. ” But saying this would not stop the foot from being a part of the body .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	16	The ear might say , “ Because I am not an eye , I am not part of the body. ” But saying this would not stop the ear from being a part of the body .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , it would not be able to hear . If the whole body were an ear , it would not be able to smell . 18-19 If each part of the body were the same part , there would be no body . But truly God put all the parts , each one of them , in the body as he wanted them .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	20	So then there are many parts , but only one body .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	21	The eye can not say to the hand , “ I don ’ t need you ! ” And the head can not say to the foot , “ I don ’ t need you ! ”
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	22	No ! Those parts of the body that seem to be the weaker are really necessary .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And the parts of the body we think are less deserving are the parts to which we give the most honor . We give special respect to the parts we want to hide .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	24	The more respectable parts of our body need no special care . But God put the body together and gave more honor to the parts that need it
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	25	so our body would not be divided . God wanted the different parts to care the same for each other .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	26	If one part of the body suffers , all the other parts suffer with it . Or if one part of our body is honored , all the other parts share its honor .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Together you are the body of Christ , and each one of you is a part of that body .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	28	In the church God has given a place first to apostles , second to prophets , and third to teachers . Then God has given a place to those who do miracles , those who have gifts of healing , those who can help others , those who are able to govern , and those who can speak in different languages . [ b ]
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Not all are apostles . Not all are prophets . Not all are teachers . Not all do miracles .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Not all have gifts of healing . Not all speak in different languages . Not all interpret those languages .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	3	I may give away everything I have , and I may even give my body as an offering to be burned . [ b ] But I gain nothing if I do not have love .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient and kind . Love is not jealous , it does not brag , and it is not proud .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	5	Love is not rude , is not selfish , and does not get upset with others . Love does not count up wrongs that have been done .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	6	Love takes no pleasure in evil but rejoices over the truth .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	7	Love patiently accepts all things . It always trusts , always hopes , and always endures .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never ends . There are gifts of prophecy , but they will be ended . There are gifts of speaking in different languages , but those gifts will stop . There is the gift of knowledge , but it will come to an end .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	9	The reason is that our knowledge and our ability to prophesy are not perfect .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But when perfection comes , the things that are not perfect will end .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . When I became a man , I stopped those childish ways .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	13	12	It is the same with us . Now we see a dim reflection , as if we were looking into a mirror , but then we shall see clearly . Now I know only a part , but then I will know fully , as God has known me .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	14	If I pray in a different language , my spirit is praying , but my mind does nothing .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	2	I will explain why . Those who have the gift of speaking in different languages [ a ] are not speaking to people ; they are speaking to God . No one understands them ; they are speaking secret things through the Spirit .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But those who prophesy are speaking to people to give them strength , encouragement , and comfort .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	4	The ones who speak in different languages are helping only themselves , but those who prophesy are helping the whole church .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I wish all of you had the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages , but more , I wish you would prophesy . Those who prophesy are greater than those who can only speak in different languages—unless someone is there who can explain what is said so that the whole church can be helped .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Brothers and sisters , will it help you if I come to you speaking in different languages ? No ! It will help you only if I bring you a new truth or some new knowledge , or prophecy , or teaching .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	7	It is the same as with lifeless things that make sounds—like a flute or a harp . If they do not make clear musical notes , you will not know what is being played .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	8	And in a war , if the trumpet does not give a clear sound , who will prepare for battle ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	9	It is the same with you . Unless you speak clearly with your tongue , no one can understand what you are saying . You will be talking into the air !
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	10	It may be true that there are all kinds of sounds in the world , and none is without meaning .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	11	But unless I understand the meaning of what someone says to me , we will be like foreigners to each other .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	12	It is the same with you . Since you want spiritual gifts very much , seek most of all to have the gifts that help the church grow stronger .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	13	The one who has the gift of speaking in a different language should pray for the gift to interpret what is spoken .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	15	So what should I do ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will also pray with my mind . I will sing with my spirit , but I will also sing with my mind .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	16	If you praise God with your spirit , those persons there without understanding can not say amen [ b ] to your prayer of thanks , because they do not know what you are saying .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	17	You may be thanking God in a good way , but the other person is not helped .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God that I speak in different kinds of languages more than all of you .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	19	But in the church meetings I would rather speak five words I understand in order to teach others than thousands of words in a different language .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brothers and sisters , do not think like children . In evil things be like babies , but in your thinking you should be like adults .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	21	It is written in the Scriptures : “ With people who use strange words and foreign languages I will speak to these people . But even then they will not listen to me , ” Isaiah 28:11–12 says the Lord .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	22	So the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages is a sign for those who do not believe , not for those who do believe . And prophecy is for people who believe , not for those who do not believe .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Suppose the whole church meets together and everyone speaks in different languages . If some people come in who do not understand or do not believe , they will say you are crazy .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But suppose everyone is prophesying and some people come in who do not believe or do not understand . If everyone is prophesying , their sin will be shown to them , and they will be judged by all that they hear .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	25	The secret things in their hearts will be made known . So they will bow down and worship God saying , “ Truly , God is with you. ” Meetings Should Help the Church
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	26	So , brothers and sisters , what should you do ? When you meet together , one person has a song , and another has a teaching . Another has a new truth from God . Another speaks in a different language , [ c ] and another person interprets that language . The purpose of all these things should be to help the church grow strong .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	27	When you meet together , if anyone speaks in a different language , it should be only two , or not more than three , who speak . They should speak one after the other , and someone should interpret .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no interpreter , then those who speak in a different language should be quiet in the church meeting . They should speak only to themselves and to God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Only two or three prophets should speak , and the others should judge what they say .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	30	If a message from God comes to another person who is sitting , the first speaker should stop .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	31	You can all prophesy one after the other . In this way all the people can be taught and encouraged .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	32	The spirits of prophets are under the control of the prophets themselves .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	33	God is not a God of confusion but a God of peace . As is true in all the churches of God ’ s people ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	34	women should keep quiet in the church meetings . They are not allowed to speak , but they must yield to this rule as the law says .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If they want to learn something , they should ask their own husbands at home . It is shameful for a woman to speak in the church meeting .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Did God ’ s teaching come from you ? Or are you the only ones to whom it has come ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	37	Those who think they are prophets or spiritual persons should understand that what I am writing to you is the Lord ’ s command .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	38	Those who ignore this will be ignored by God . [ d ]
NCV	1%20Corinthians	14	39	So my brothers and sisters , you should truly want to prophesy . But do not stop people from using the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	15	And also , we are guilty of lying about God , because we testified of him that he raised Christ from the dead . But if people are not raised from the dead , then God never raised Christ .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	2	And you are being saved by it if you continue believing what I told you . If you do not , then you believed for nothing .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	3	I passed on to you what I received , of which this was most important : that Christ died for our sins , as the Scriptures say ;
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried and was raised to life on the third day as the Scriptures say ;
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that he was seen by Peter and then by the twelve apostles .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that , Jesus was seen by more than five hundred of the believers at the same time . Most of them are still living today , but some have died .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	8	Last of all he was seen by me—as by a person not born at the normal time .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	9	All the other apostles are greater than I am . I am not even good enough to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But God ’ s grace has made me what I am , and his grace to me was not wasted . I worked harder than all the other apostles . ( But it was not I really ; it was God ’ s grace that was with me . )
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	11	So if I preached to you or the other apostles preached to you , we all preach the same thing , and this is what you believed . We Will Be Raised from the Dead
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now since we preached that Christ was raised from the dead , why do some of you say that people will not be raised from the dead ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	13	If no one is ever raised from the dead , then Christ has not been raised .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is worth nothing , and your faith is worth nothing .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	16	If the dead are not raised , Christ has not been raised either .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ has not been raised , then your faith has nothing to it ; you are still guilty of your sins .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	18	And those in Christ who have already died are lost .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If our hope in Christ is for this life only , we should be pitied more than anyone else in the world .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But Christ has truly been raised from the dead—the first one and proof that those who sleep in death will also be raised .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	21	Death has come because of what one man did , but the rising from death also comes because of one man .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	22	In Adam all of us die . In the same way , in Christ all of us will be made alive again .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But everyone will be raised to life in the right order . Christ was first to be raised . When Christ comes again , those who belong to him will be raised to life ,
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	24	and then the end will come . At that time Christ will destroy all rulers , authorities , and powers , and he will hand over the kingdom to God the Father .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	25	Christ must rule until he puts all enemies under his control .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be destroyed will be death .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	27	The Scripture says that God put all things under his control . [ a ] When it says “ all things ” are under him , it is clear this does not include God himself . God is the One who put everything under his control .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	28	After everything has been put under the Son , then he will put himself under God , who had put all things under him . Then God will be the complete ruler over everything .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	29	If the dead are never raised , what will people do who are being baptized for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people being baptized for them ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And what about us ? Why do we put ourselves in danger every hour ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I die every day . That is true , brothers and sisters , just as it is true that I brag about you in Christ Jesus our Lord .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If I fought wild animals in Ephesus only with human hopes , I have gained nothing . If the dead are not raised , “ Let us eat and drink , because tomorrow we will die. ” [ b ]
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Do not be fooled : “ Bad friends will ruin good habits. ”
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Come back to your right way of thinking and stop sinning . Some of you do not know God—I say this to shame you . What Kind of Body Will We Have ?
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone may ask , “ How are the dead raised ? What kind of body will they have ? ”
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Foolish person ! When you sow a seed , it must die in the ground before it can live and grow .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And when you sow it , it does not have the same “ body ” it will have later . What you sow is only a bare seed , maybe wheat or something else .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body that he has planned for it , and God gives each kind of seed its own body .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All things made of flesh are not the same : People have one kind of flesh , animals have another , birds have another , and fish have another .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	40	Also there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . But the beauty of the heavenly bodies is one kind , and the beauty of the earthly bodies is another .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun has one kind of beauty , the moon has another beauty , and the stars have another . And each star is different in its beauty .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	42	It is the same with the dead who are raised to life . The body that is “ planted ” will ruin and decay , but it is raised to a life that can not be destroyed .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	43	When the body is “ planted , ” it is without honor , but it is raised in glory . When the body is “ planted , ” it is weak , but when it is raised , it is powerful .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	44	The body that is “ planted ” is a physical body . When it is raised , it is a spiritual body . There is a physical body , and there is also a spiritual body .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	45	It is written in the Scriptures : “ The first man , Adam , became a living person. ” [ c ] But the last Adam became a spirit that gives life .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	46	The spiritual did not come first , but the physical and then the spiritual .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man came from the dust of the earth . The second man came from heaven .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	48	People who belong to the earth are like the first man of earth . But those people who belong to heaven are like the man of heaven .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	49	Just as we were made like the man of earth , so we will [ d ] also be made like the man of heaven .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	50	I tell you this , brothers and sisters : Flesh and blood can not have a part in the kingdom of God . Something that will ruin can not have a part in something that never ruins .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	51	But look ! I tell you this secret : We will not all sleep in death , but we will all be changed .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	52	It will take only a second—as quickly as an eye blinks—when the last trumpet sounds . The trumpet will sound , and those who have died will be raised to live forever , and we will all be changed .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	53	This body that can be destroyed must clothe itself with something that can never be destroyed . And this body that dies must clothe itself with something that can never die .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	54	So this body that can be destroyed will clothe itself with that which can never be destroyed , and this body that dies will clothe itself with that which can never die . When this happens , this Scripture will be made true : “ Death is destroyed forever in victory. ” Isaiah 25:8
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	55	“ Death , where is your victory ? Death , where is your pain ? ” Hosea 13:14
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Death ’ s power to hurt is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But we thank God ! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	15	58	So my dear brothers and sisters , stand strong . Do not let anything move you .

NCV	1%20Corinthians	16	7	I do not want to see you now just in passing . I hope to stay a longer time with you if the Lord allows it .
NCV	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost ,

NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Paul Gives Thanks to God
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . I am an apostle because that is what God wanted . Also from Timothy our brother in Christ . To the church of God in Corinth , and to all of God ’ s people everywhere in Southern Greece :
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . God is the Father who is full of mercy and all comfort .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	4	He comforts us every time we have trouble , so when others have trouble , we can comfort them with the same comfort God gives us .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	5	We share in the many sufferings of Christ . In the same way , much comfort comes to us through Christ .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	6	If we have troubles , it is for your comfort and salvation , and if we have comfort , you also have comfort . This helps you to accept patiently the same sufferings we have .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	7	Our hope for you is strong , knowing that you share in our sufferings and also in the comfort we receive .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	8	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about the trouble we suffered in Asia . We had great burdens there that were beyond our own strength . We even gave up hope of living .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	9	Truly , in our own hearts we believed we would die . But this happened so we would not trust in ourselves but in God , who raises people from the dead .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	10	God saved us from these great dangers of death , and he will continue to save us . We have put our hope in him , and he will save us again .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	11	And you can help us with your prayers . Then many people will give thanks for us—that God blessed us because of their many prayers . The Change in Paul ’ s Plans
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	12	This is what we are proud of , and I can say it with a clear conscience : In everything we have done in the world , and especially with you , we have had an honest [ a ] and sincere heart from God . We did this by God ’ s grace , not by the kind of wisdom the world has . 13-14 We write to you only what you can read and understand . And I hope that as you have understood some things about us , you may come to know everything about us . Then you can be proud of us , as we will be proud of you on the day our Lord Jesus Christ comes again .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	15	I was so sure of all this that I made plans to visit you first so you could be blessed twice .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	16	I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and again on my way back . I wanted to get help from you for my trip to Judea .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Do you think that I made these plans without really meaning it ? Or maybe you think I make plans as the world does , so that I say yes , yes and at the same time no , no .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But since you can believe God , you can believe that what we tell you is never both yes and no .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	19	The Son of God , Jesus Christ , that Silas and Timothy and I preached to you , was not yes and no . In Christ it has always been yes .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	20	The yes to all of God ’ s promises is in Christ , and through Christ we say yes to the glory of God .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Remember , God is the One who makes you and us strong in Christ . God made us his chosen people .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	22	He put his mark on us to show that we are his , and he put his Spirit in our hearts to be a guarantee for all he has promised .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	23	I tell you this , and I ask God to be my witness that this is true : The reason I did not come back to Corinth was to keep you from being punished or hurt .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	1	24	We are not trying to control your faith . You are strong in faith . But we are workers with you for your own joy . Footnotes - 1:12 honest Some Greek copies read “ holy. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	2	If I make you sad , who will make me glad ? Only you can make me glad—particularly the person whom I made sad .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	3	I wrote you a letter for this reason : that when I came to you I would not be made sad by the people who should make me happy . I felt sure of all of you , that you would share my joy .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	4	When I wrote to you before , I was very troubled and unhappy in my heart , and I wrote with many tears . I did not write to make you sad , but to let you know how much I love you . Forgive the Sinner
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	5	Someone there among you has caused sadness , not to me , but to all of you . I mean he caused sadness to all in some way . ( I do not want to make it sound worse than it really is . )
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	6	The punishment that most of you gave him is enough for him .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	7	But now you should forgive him and comfort him to keep him from having too much sadness and giving up completely .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	8	So I beg you to show that you love him .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	9	I wrote you to test you and to see if you obey in everything .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	10	If you forgive someone , I also forgive him . And what I have forgiven—if I had anything to forgive—I forgave it for you , as if Christ were with me .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	11	I did this so that Satan would not win anything from us , because we know very well what Satan ’ s plans are . Paul ’ s Concern in Troas
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	12	When I came to Troas to preach the Good News of Christ , the Lord gave me a good opportunity there .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	13	But I had no peace , because I did not find my brother Titus . So I said good-bye to them at Troas and went to Macedonia . Victory Through Christ
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thanks be to God , who always leads us as captives in Christ ’ s victory parade . God uses us to spread his knowledge everywhere like a sweet-smelling perfume .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	15	Our offering to God is this : We are the sweet smell of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are being lost .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	2	16	To those who are lost , we are the smell of death that brings death , but to those who are being saved , we are the smell of life that brings life . So who is able to do this work ?

NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	3	You show that you are a letter from Christ sent through us . This letter is not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God . It is not written on stone tablets [ a ] but on human hearts .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	4	We can say this , because through Christ we feel certain before God .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	5	We are not saying that we can do this work ourselves . It is God who makes us able to do all that we do .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	6	He made us able to be servants of a new agreement from himself to his people . This new agreement is not a written law , but it is of the Spirit . The written law brings death , but the Spirit gives life .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	7	The law that brought death was written in words on stone . It came with God ’ s glory , which made Moses ’ face so bright that the Israelites could not continue to look at it . But that glory later disappeared .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	8	So surely the new way that brings the Spirit has even more glory .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	9	If the law that judged people guilty of sin had glory , surely the new way that makes people right with God has much greater glory .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	10	That old law had glory , but it really loses its glory when it is compared to the much greater glory of this new way .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	11	If that law which disappeared came with glory , then this new way which continues forever has much greater glory .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	12	We have this hope , so we are very bold .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	13	We are not like Moses , who put a covering over his face so the Israelites would not see it . The glory was disappearing , and Moses did not want them to see it end .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were closed , and even today that same covering hides the meaning when they read the old agreement . That covering is taken away only through Christ .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	15	Even today , when they read the law of Moses , there is a covering over their minds .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But when a person changes and follows the Lord , that covering is taken away .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	17	The Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	3	18	Our faces , then , are not covered . We all show the Lord ’ s glory , and we are being changed to be like him . This change in us brings ever greater glory , which comes from the Lord , who is the Spirit .

NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	2	But we have turned away from secret and shameful ways . We use no trickery , and we do not change the teaching of God . We teach the truth plainly , showing everyone who we are . Then they can know in their hearts what kind of people we are in God ’ s sight .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	4	The devil who rules this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe . They can not see the light of the Good News—the Good News about the glory of Christ , who is exactly like God .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	3	If the Good News that we preach is hidden , it is hidden only to those who are lost .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	5	We do not preach about ourselves , but we preach that Jesus Christ is Lord and that we are your servants for Jesus .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	6	God once said , “ Let the light shine out of the darkness ! ” This is the same God who made his light shine in our hearts by letting us know the glory of God that is in the face of Christ . Spiritual Treasure in Clay Jars
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	7	We have this treasure from God , but we are like clay jars that hold the treasure . This shows that the great power is from God , not from us .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We have troubles all around us , but we are not defeated . We do not know what to do , but we do not give up the hope of living .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	9	We are persecuted , but God does not leave us . We are hurt sometimes , but we are not destroyed .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	10	We carry the death of Jesus in our own bodies so that the life of Jesus can also be seen in our bodies .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	11	We are alive , but for Jesus we are always in danger of death so that the life of Jesus can be seen in our bodies that die .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So death is working in us , but life is working in you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	13	It is written in the Scriptures , “ I believed , so I spoke. ” [ a ] Our faith is like this , too . We believe , and so we speak .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	14	God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead , and we know that God will also raise us with Jesus . God will bring us together with you , and we will stand before him .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	15	All these things are for you . And so the grace of God that is being given to more and more people will bring increasing thanks to God for his glory . Living by Faith
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	16	So we do not give up . Our physical body is becoming older and weaker , but our spirit inside us is made new every day .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	17	We have small troubles for a while now , but they are helping us gain an eternal glory that is much greater than the troubles .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	4	18	We set our eyes not on what we see but on what we can not see . What we see will last only a short time , but what we can not see will last forever . Footnotes - 4:13 “ I . . . spoke. ” Quotation from Psalm 116:10 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	2	But now we groan in this tent . We want God to give us our heavenly home ,
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	5	This is what God made us for , and he has given us the Spirit to be a guarantee for this new life .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	3	because it will clothe us so we will not be naked .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	4	While we live in this body , we have burdens , and we groan . We do not want to be naked , but we want to be clothed with our heavenly home . Then this body that dies will be fully covered with life .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So we always have courage . We know that while we live in this body , we are away from the Lord .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	7	We live by what we believe , not by what we can see .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	8	So I say that we have courage . We really want to be away from this body and be at home with the Lord .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Our only goal is to please God whether we live here or there ,
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	10	because we must all stand before Christ to be judged . Each of us will receive what we should get—good or bad—for the things we did in the earthly body . Becoming Friends with God
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Since we know what it means to fear the Lord , we try to help people accept the truth about us . God knows what we really are , and I hope that in your hearts you know , too .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not trying to prove ourselves to you again , but we are telling you about ourselves so you will be proud of us . Then you will have an answer for those who are proud about things that can be seen rather than what is in the heart .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	13	If we are out of our minds , it is for God . If we have our right minds , it is for you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	14	The love of Christ controls us , because we know that One died for all , so all have died .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	15	Christ died for all so that those who live would not continue to live for themselves . He died for them and was raised from the dead so that they would live for him .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	16	From this time on we do not think of anyone as the world does . In the past we thought of Christ as the world thinks , but we no longer think of him in that way .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	17	If anyone belongs to Christ , there is a new creation . The old things have gone ; everything is made new !
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	18	All this is from God . Through Christ , God made peace between us and himself , and God gave us the work of telling everyone about the peace we can have with him .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	19	God was in Christ , making peace between the world and himself . In Christ , God did not hold the world guilty of its sins . And he gave us this message of peace .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	20	So we have been sent to speak for Christ . It is as if God is calling to you through us . We speak for Christ when we beg you to be at peace with God .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	5	21	Christ had no sin , but God made him become sin so that in Christ we could become right with God . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	6	We show we are servants of God by our pure lives , our understanding , patience , and kindness , by the Holy Spirit , by true love ,
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We do not want anyone to find fault with our work , so nothing we do will be a problem for anyone .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	4	But in every way we show we are servants of God : in accepting many hard things , in troubles , in difficulties , and in great problems .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	5	We are beaten and thrown into prison . We meet those who become upset with us and start riots . We work hard , and sometimes we get no sleep or food .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	7	by speaking the truth , and by God ’ s power . We use our right living to defend ourselves against everything .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	8	Some people honor us , but others blame us . Some people say evil things about us , but others say good things . Some people say we are liars , but we speak the truth .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	9	We are not known , but we are well known . We seem to be dying , but we continue to live . We are punished , but we are not killed .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	10	We have much sadness , but we are always rejoicing . We are poor , but we are making many people rich in faith . We have nothing , but really we have everything .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	11	We have spoken freely to you in Corinth and have opened our hearts to you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	12	Our feelings of love for you have not stopped , but you have stopped your feelings of love for us .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	13	I speak to you as if you were my children . Do to us as we have done—open your hearts to us . Warning About Non-Christians
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	14	You are not the same as those who do not believe . So do not join yourselves to them . Good and bad do not belong together . Light and darkness can not share together .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	15	How can Christ and Belial , the devil , have any agreement ? What can a believer have together with a nonbeliever ?
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	16	The temple of God can not have any agreement with idols , and we are the temple of the living God . As God said : “ I will live with them and walk with them . And I will be their God , and they will be my people. ” [ a ]
NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	17	“ Leave those people , and be separate , says the Lord . Touch nothing that is unclean , and I will accept you. ” Isaiah 52:11 ; Ezekiel 20:34 ,

NCV	2%20Corinthians	6	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Open your hearts to us . We have not done wrong to anyone , we have not ruined the faith of anyone , and we have not cheated anyone .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	7	We were comforted , not only by his coming but also by the comfort you gave him . Titus told us about your wish to see me and that you are very sorry for what you did . He also told me about your great care for me , and when I heard this , I was much happier .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not say this to blame you . I told you before that we love you so much we would live or die with you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I feel very sure of you and am very proud of you . You give me much comfort , and in all of our troubles I have great joy .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	5	When we came into Macedonia , we had no rest . We found trouble all around us . We had fighting on the outside and fear on the inside .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God , who comforts those who are troubled , comforted us when Titus came .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	8	Even if my letter made you sad , I am not sorry I wrote it . At first I was sorry , because it made you sad , but you were sad only for a short time .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I am happy , not because you were made sad , but because your sorrow made you change your lives . You became sad in the way God wanted you to , so you were not hurt by us in any way .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	10	The kind of sorrow God wants makes people change their hearts and lives . This leads to salvation , and you can not be sorry for that . But the kind of sorrow the world has brings death .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	11	See what this sorrow—the sorrow God wanted you to have—has done to you : It has made you very serious . It made you want to restore yourselves . It made you angry and afraid . It made you want to see me . It made you care . It made you want to do the right thing . In every way you have regained your innocence .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	12	I wrote that letter , not because of the one who did the wrong or because of the person who was hurt . I wrote the letter so you could see , before God , the great care you have for us .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	13	That is why we were comforted . Not only were we very comforted , we were even happier to see that Titus was so happy . All of you made him feel much better .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	14	I bragged to Titus about you , and you showed that I was right . Everything we said to you was true , and you have proved that what we bragged about to Titus is true .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his love for you is stronger when he remembers that you were all ready to obey . You welcomed him with respect and fear .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I am very happy that I can trust you fully . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	2	They have been tested by great troubles , and they are very poor . But they gave much because of their great joy .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I am not commanding you to give . But I want to see if your love is true by comparing you with others that really want to help .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	3	I can tell you that they gave as much as they were able and even more than they could afford . No one told them to do it .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	4	But they begged and pleaded with us to let them share in this service for God ’ s people .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And they gave in a way we did not expect : They first gave themselves to the Lord and to us . This is what God wants .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So we asked Titus to help you finish this special work of grace since he is the one who started it .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	7	You are rich in everything—in faith , in speaking , in knowledge , in truly wanting to help , and in the love you learned from us . [ a ] In the same way , be strong also in the grace of giving .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	9	You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ . You know that Christ was rich , but for you he became poor so that by his becoming poor you might become rich .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	10	This is what I think you should do : Last year you were the first to want to give , and you were the first who gave .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	11	So now finish the work you started . Then your “ doing ” will be equal to your “ wanting to do. ” Give from what you have .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	12	If you want to give , your gift will be accepted . It will be judged by what you have , not by what you do not have .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	13	We do not want you to have troubles while other people are at ease , but we want everything to be equal .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	14	At this time you have plenty . What you have can help others who are in need . Then later , when they have plenty , they can help you when you are in need , and all will be equal .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As it is written in the Scriptures , “ The person who gathered more did not have too much , nor did the person who gathered less have too little. ” [ b ] Titus and His Companions Help
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	16	I thank God because he gave Titus the same love for you that I have .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	17	Titus accepted what we asked him to do . He wanted very much to go to you , and this was his own idea .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	18	We are sending with him the brother who is praised by all the churches because of his service in preaching the Good News .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	19	Also , this brother was chosen by the churches to go with us when we deliver this gift of money . We are doing this service to bring glory to the Lord and to show that we really want to help .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	20	We are being careful so that no one will criticize us for the way we are handling this large gift .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	21	We are trying hard to do what the Lord accepts as right and also what people think is right .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	22	Also , we are sending with them our brother , who is always ready to help . He has proved this to us in many ways , and he wants to help even more now , because he has much faith in you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Now about Titus—he is my partner who is working with me to help you . And about the other brothers—they are sent from the churches , and they bring glory to Christ .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	24	So show these men the proof of your love and the reason we are proud of you . Then all the churches can see it .

NCV	2%20Corinthians	8	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	2	I know you want to help . I have been bragging about this to the people in Macedonia , telling them that you in Southern Greece have been ready to give since last year . And your desire to give has made most of them ready to give also .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	9	It is written in the Scriptures : “ He gives freely to the poor . The things he does are right and will continue forever. ” Psalm 112:9
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But I am sending the brothers to you so that our bragging about you in this will not be empty words . I want you to be ready , as I said you would be .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	4	If any of the people from Macedonia come with me and find that you are not ready , we will be ashamed that we were so sure of you . ( And you will be ashamed , too ! )
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I thought I should ask these brothers to go to you before we do . They will finish getting in order the generous gift you promised so it will be ready when we come . And it will be a generous gift—not one that you did not want to give .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Remember this : The person who plants a little will have a small harvest , but the person who plants a lot will have a big harvest .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each of you should give as you have decided in your heart to give . You should not be sad when you give , and you should not give because you feel forced to give . God loves the person who gives happily .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God can give you more blessings than you need . Then you will always have plenty of everything—enough to give to every good work .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	10	God is the One who gives seed to the farmer and bread for food . He will give you all the seed you need and make it grow so there will be a great harvest from your goodness .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	11	He will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely . And your giving through us will cause many to give thanks to God .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	12	This service you do not only helps the needs of God ’ s people , it also brings many more thanks to God .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	13	It is a proof of your faith . Many people will praise God because you obey the Good News of Christ—the gospel you say you believe—and because you freely share with them and with all others .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And when they pray , they will wish they could be with you because of the great grace that God has given you .

NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	2	They think we live in a worldly way , and I plan to be very bold with them when I come . I beg you that when I come I will not need to use that same boldness with you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	10	Some people say , “ Paul ’ s letters are powerful and sound important , but when he is with us , he is weak . And his speaking is nothing. ”
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	3	We do live in the world , but we do not fight in the same way the world fights .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	4	We fight with weapons that are different from those the world uses . Our weapons have power from God that can destroy the enemy ’ s strong places . We destroy people ’ s arguments
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	5	and every proud thing that raises itself against the knowledge of God . We capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	6	We are ready to punish anyone there who does not obey , but first we want you to obey fully .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	7	You must look at the facts before you . If you feel sure that you belong to Christ , you must remember that we belong to Christ just as you do .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	8	It is true that we brag freely about the authority the Lord gave us . But this authority is to build you up , not to tear you down . So I will not be ashamed .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	9	I do not want you to think I am trying to scare you with my letters .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	11	They should know this : We are not there with you now , so we say these things in letters . But when we are there with you , we will show the same authority that we show in our letters .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	12	We do not dare to compare ourselves with those who think they are very important . They use themselves to measure themselves , and they judge themselves by what they themselves are . This shows that they know nothing .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not brag about things outside the work that was given us to do . We will limit our bragging to the work that God gave us , and this includes our work with you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	14	We are not bragging too much , as we would be if we had not already come to you . But we have come to you with the Good News of Christ .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	15	We limit our bragging to the work that is ours , not what others have done . We hope that as your faith continues to grow , you will help our work to grow much larger .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	16	We want to tell the Good News in the areas beyond your city . We do not want to brag about work that has already been done in another person ’ s area .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But , “ If people want to brag , they should brag only about the Lord. ” [ a ]
NCV	2%20Corinthians	10	18	It is not those who say they are good who are accepted but those the Lord thinks are good . Footnotes - 10:17 “ If . . . Lord. ” Quotation from Jeremiah 9:24 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	2	I am jealous over you with a jealousy that comes from God . I promised to give you to Christ , as your only husband . I want to give you as his pure bride .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	11	And why do I not depend on you ? Do you think it is because I do not love you ? God knows that I love you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that your minds will be led away from your true and pure following of Christ just as Eve was tricked by the snake with his evil ways .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	4	You are very patient with anyone who comes to you and preaches a different Jesus from the one we preached . You are very willing to accept a spirit or gospel that is different from the Spirit and Good News you received from us .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	5	I do not think that those “ great apostles ” are any better than I am .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	6	I may not be a trained speaker , but I do have knowledge . We have shown this to you clearly in every way .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	7	I preached God ’ s Good News to you without pay . I made myself unimportant to make you important . Do you think that was wrong ?
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I accepted pay from other churches , taking their money so I could serve you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	9	If I needed something when I was with you , I did not trouble any of you . The brothers who came from Macedonia gave me all that I needed . I did not allow myself to depend on you in any way , and I will never depend on you .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	10	No one in Southern Greece will stop me from bragging about that . I say this with the truth of Christ in me .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	12	And I will continue doing what I am doing now , because I want to stop those people from having a reason to brag . They would like to say that the work they brag about is the same as ours .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	13	Such men are not true apostles but are workers who lie . They change themselves to look like apostles of Christ .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	14	This does not surprise us . Even Satan changes himself to look like an angel of light . [ a ]
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	15	So it does not surprise us if Satan ’ s servants also make themselves look like servants who work for what is right . But in the end they will be punished for what they do . Paul Tells About His Sufferings
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I tell you again : No one should think I am a fool . But if you think so , accept me as you would accept a fool . Then I can brag a little , too .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	17	When I brag because I feel sure of myself , I am not talking as the Lord would talk but as a fool .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Many people are bragging about their lives in the world . So I will brag too .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	19	You are wise , so you will gladly be patient with fools !
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	20	You are even patient with those who order you around , or use you , or trick you , or think they are better than you , or hit you in the face .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	21	It is shameful to me to say this , but we were too “ weak ” to do those things to you ! But if anyone else is brave enough to brag , then I also will be brave and brag . ( I am talking as a fool . )
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? [ b ] So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they from Abraham ’ s family ? So am I .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they serving Christ ? I am serving him more . ( I am crazy to talk like this . ) I have worked much harder than they . I have been in prison more often . I have been hurt more in beatings . I have been near death many times .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times the Jews have given me their punishment of thirty-nine lashes with a whip .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three different times I was beaten with rods . One time I was almost stoned to death . Three times I was in ships that wrecked , and one of those times I spent a night and a day in the sea .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	26	I have gone on many travels and have been in danger from rivers , thieves , my own people , the Jews , and those who are not Jews . I have been in danger in cities , in places where no one lives , and on the sea . And I have been in danger with false Christians .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	11	27	I have done hard and tiring work , and many times I did not sleep . I have been hungry and thirsty , and many times I have been without food . I have been cold and without clothes .

NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ who was taken up to the third heaven fourteen years ago . I do not know whether the man was in his body or out of his body , but God knows . 3-4 And I know that this man was taken up to paradise . [ b ] I don ’ t know if he was in his body or away from his body , but God knows . He heard things he is not able to explain , things that no human is allowed to tell .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	12	When I was with you , I patiently did the things that prove I am an apostle—signs , wonders , and miracles .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	5	I will brag about a man like that , but I will not brag about myself , except about my weaknesses .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	6	But if I wanted to brag about myself , I would not be a fool , because I would be telling the truth . But I will not brag about myself . I do not want people to think more of me than what they see me do or hear me say .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	7	So that I would not become too proud of the wonderful things that were shown to me , a painful physical problem [ c ] was given to me . This problem was a messenger from Satan , sent to beat me and keep me from being too proud .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	8	I begged the Lord three times to take this problem away from me .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	9	But he said to me , “ My grace is enough for you . When you are weak , my power is made perfect in you. ” So I am very happy to brag about my weaknesses . Then Christ ’ s power can live in me .
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	10	For this reason I am happy when I have weaknesses , insults , hard times , sufferings , and all kinds of troubles for Christ . Because when I am weak , then I am truly strong . Paul ’ s Love for the Christians
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have been talking like a fool , but you made me do it . You are the ones who should say good things about me . I am worth nothing , but those “ great apostles ” are not worth any more than I am !
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	13	So you received everything that the other churches have received . Only one thing was different : I was not a burden to you . Forgive me for this !
NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	14	I am now ready to visit you the third time , and I will not be a burden to you . I want nothing from you , except you . Children should not have to save up to give to their parents . Parents should save to give to their children .

NCV	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that when I come to you again , my God will make me ashamed before you .

NCV	Galatians	1	1	From Paul , an apostle . I was not chosen to be an apostle by human beings , nor was I sent from human beings . I was made an apostle through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Jesus from the dead .
NCV	Galatians	1	2	This letter is also from all those of God ’ s family [ a ] who are with me . To the churches in Galatia : [ b ]
NCV	Galatians	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
NCV	Galatians	1	4	Jesus gave himself for our sins to free us from this evil world we live in , as God the Father planned .
NCV	Galatians	1	5	The glory belongs to God forever and ever . Amen . The Only Good News
NCV	Galatians	1	6	God , by his grace through Christ , called you to become his people . So I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly and believing something different than the Good News .
NCV	Galatians	1	7	Really , there is no other Good News . But some people are confusing you ; they want to change the Good News of Christ .
NCV	Galatians	1	8	We preached to you the Good News . So if we ourselves , or even an angel from heaven , should preach to you something different , we should be judged guilty !
NCV	Galatians	1	9	I said this before , and now I say it again : You have already accepted the Good News . If anyone is preaching something different to you , let that person be judged guilty !
NCV	Galatians	1	10	Do you think I am trying to make people accept me ? No , God is the One I am trying to please . Am I trying to please people ? If I still wanted to please people , I would not be a servant of Christ . Paul ’ s Authority Is from God
NCV	Galatians	1	11	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that the Good News I preached to you was not made up by human beings .

NCV	Galatians	1	15	But God had special plans for me and set me apart for his work even before I was born . He called me through his grace
NCV	Galatians	1	16	and showed his son to me so that I might tell the Good News about him to those who are not Jewish . When God called me , I did not get advice or help from any person .
NCV	Galatians	1	17	I did not go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was . But , without waiting , I went away to Arabia and later went back to Damascus .
NCV	Galatians	1	18	After three years I went to Jerusalem to meet Peter and stayed with him for fifteen days .
NCV	Galatians	1	19	I met no other apostles , except James , the brother of the Lord .

NCV	Galatians	1	21	Later , I went to the areas of Syria and Cilicia .
NCV	Galatians	1	22	In Judea the churches in Christ had never met me .

NCV	Galatians	2	2	I went because God showed me I should go . I met with the believers there , and in private I told their leaders the Good News that I preach to the non-Jewish people . I did not want my past work and the work I am now doing to be wasted .
NCV	Galatians	2	3	Titus was with me , but he was not forced to be circumcised , even though he was a Greek .
NCV	Galatians	2	4	We talked about this problem because some false believers had come into our group secretly . They came in like spies to overturn the freedom we have in Christ Jesus . They wanted to make us slaves .
NCV	Galatians	2	5	But we did not give in to those false believers for a minute . We wanted the truth of the Good News to continue for you .
NCV	Galatians	2	6	Those leaders who seemed to be important did not change the Good News that I preach . ( It doesn ’ t matter to me if they were “ important ” or not . To God everyone is the same . )
NCV	Galatians	2	7	But these leaders saw that I had been given the work of telling the Good News to those who are not Jewish , just as Peter had the work of telling the Jews .
NCV	Galatians	2	8	God gave Peter the power to work as an apostle for the Jewish people . But he also gave me the power to work as an apostle for those who are not Jews .
NCV	Galatians	2	9	James , Peter , and John , who seemed to be the leaders , understood that God had given me this special grace , so they accepted Barnabas and me . They agreed that they would go to the Jewish people and that we should go to those who are not Jewish .
NCV	Galatians	2	10	The only thing they asked us was to remember to help the poor—something I really wanted to do . Paul Shows that Peter Was Wrong
NCV	Galatians	2	11	When Peter came to Antioch , I challenged him to his face , because he was wrong .
NCV	Galatians	2	12	Peter ate with the non-Jewish people until some Jewish people sent from James came to Antioch . When they arrived , Peter stopped eating with those who weren ’ t Jewish , and he separated himself from them . He was afraid of the Jews .
NCV	Galatians	2	13	So Peter was a hypocrite , as were the other Jewish believers who joined with him . Even Barnabas was influenced by what these Jewish believers did .
NCV	Galatians	2	14	When I saw they were not following the truth of the Good News , I spoke to Peter in front of them all . I said , “ Peter , you are a Jew , but you are not living like a Jew . You are living like those who are not Jewish . So why do you now try to force those who are not Jewish to live like Jews ? ”
NCV	Galatians	2	15	We were not born as non-Jewish “ sinners , ” but as Jews .
NCV	Galatians	2	16	Yet we know that a person is made right with God not by following the law , but by trusting in Jesus Christ . So we , too , have put our faith in Christ Jesus , that we might be made right with God because we trusted in Christ . It is not because we followed the law , because no one can be made right with God by following the law .
NCV	Galatians	2	17	We Jews came to Christ , trying to be made right with God , and it became clear that we are sinners , too . Does this mean that Christ encourages sin ? No !
NCV	Galatians	2	18	But I would really be wrong to begin teaching again those things that I gave up .
NCV	Galatians	2	19	It was the law that put me to death , and I died to the law so that I can now live for God .
NCV	Galatians	2	20	I was put to death on the cross with Christ , and I do not live anymore—it is Christ who lives in me . I still live in my body , but I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself to save me .

NCV	Galatians	3	3	You began your life in Christ by the Spirit . Now are you trying to make it complete by your own power ? That is foolish .
NCV	Galatians	3	2	Tell me this one thing : How did you receive the Holy Spirit ? Did you receive the Spirit by following the law ? No , you received the Spirit because you heard the Good News and believed it .
NCV	Galatians	3	4	Were all your experiences wasted ? I hope not !
NCV	Galatians	3	5	Does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you because you follow the law ? No , he does these things because you heard the Good News and believed it .
NCV	Galatians	3	6	The Scriptures say the same thing about Abraham : “ Abraham believed God , and God accepted Abraham ’ s faith , and that faith made him right with God. ” [ a ]
NCV	Galatians	3	7	So you should know that the true children of Abraham are those who have faith .
NCV	Galatians	3	8	The Scriptures , telling what would happen in the future , said that God would make the non-Jewish people right through their faith . This Good News was told to Abraham beforehand , as the Scripture says : “ All nations will be blessed through you. ” [ b ]
NCV	Galatians	3	9	So all who believe as Abraham believed are blessed just as Abraham was .
NCV	Galatians	3	10	But those who depend on following the law to make them right are under a curse , because the Scriptures say , “ Anyone will be cursed who does not always obey what is written in the Book of the Law. ” [ c ]
NCV	Galatians	3	11	Now it is clear that no one can be made right with God by the law , because the Scriptures say , “ Those who are right with God will live by faith. ” [ d ]
NCV	Galatians	3	12	The law is not based on faith . It says , “ A person who obeys these things will live because of them. ” [ e ]
NCV	Galatians	3	13	Christ took away the curse the law put on us . He changed places with us and put himself under that curse . It is written in the Scriptures , “ Anyone whose body is displayed on a tree [ f ] is cursed. ”
NCV	Galatians	3	14	Christ did this so that God ’ s blessing promised to Abraham might come through Jesus Christ to those who are not Jews . Jesus died so that by our believing we could receive the Spirit that God promised . The Law and the Promise
NCV	Galatians	3	15	Brothers and sisters , let us think in human terms : Even an agreement made between two persons is firm . After that agreement is accepted by both people , no one can stop it or add anything to it .
NCV	Galatians	3	16	God made promises both to Abraham and to his descendant . God did not say , “ and to your descendants. ” That would mean many people . But God said , “ and to your descendant. ” That means only one person ; that person is Christ .
NCV	Galatians	3	17	This is what I mean : God had an agreement with Abraham and promised to keep it . The law , which came four hundred thirty years later , can not change that agreement and so destroy God ’ s promise to Abraham .
NCV	Galatians	3	18	If the law could give us Abraham ’ s blessing , then the promise would not be necessary . But that is not possible , because God freely gave his blessings to Abraham through the promise he had made .
NCV	Galatians	3	19	So what was the law for ? It was given to show that the wrong things people do are against God ’ s will . And it continued until the special descendant , who had been promised , came . The law was given through angels who used Moses for a mediator [ g ] to give the law to people .
NCV	Galatians	3	20	But a mediator is not needed when there is only one side , and God is only one . The Purpose of the Law of Moses
NCV	Galatians	3	21	Does this mean that the law is against God ’ s promises ? Never ! That would be true only if the law could make us right with God . But God did not give a law that can bring life .
NCV	Galatians	3	22	Instead , the Scriptures showed that the whole world is bound by sin . This was so the promise would be given through faith to people who believe in Jesus Christ .
NCV	Galatians	3	23	Before this faith came , we were all held prisoners by the law . We had no freedom until God showed us the way of faith that was coming .
NCV	Galatians	3	24	In other words , the law was our guardian leading us to Christ so that we could be made right with God through faith .
NCV	Galatians	3	25	Now the way of faith has come , and we no longer live under a guardian . 26-27 You were all baptized into Christ , and so you were all clothed with Christ . This means that you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus .
NCV	Galatians	3	28	In Christ , there is no difference between Jew and Greek , slave and free person , male and female . You are all the same in Christ Jesus .
NCV	Galatians	3	29	You belong to Christ , so you are Abraham ’ s descendants . You will inherit all of God ’ s blessings because of the promise God made to Abraham . Footnotes - 3:6 “ Abraham . . .

NCV	Galatians	4	4	But when the right time came , God sent his Son who was born of a woman and lived under the law .
NCV	Galatians	4	2	While they are children , they must obey those who are chosen to care for them . But when the children reach the age set by their fathers , they are free .
NCV	Galatians	4	3	It is the same for us . We were once like children , slaves to the useless rules of this world .
NCV	Galatians	4	5	God did this so he could buy freedom for those who were under the law and so we could become his children .
NCV	Galatians	4	6	Since you are God ’ s children , God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , and the Spirit cries out , “ Father. ” [ a ]
NCV	Galatians	4	7	So now you are not a slave ; you are God ’ s child , and God will give you the blessing he promised , because you are his child . Paul ’ s Love for the Christians
NCV	Galatians	4	8	In the past you did not know God . You were slaves to gods that were not real .
NCV	Galatians	4	9	But now you know the true God . Really , it is God who knows you . So why do you turn back to those weak and useless rules you followed before ? Do you want to be slaves to those things again ?
NCV	Galatians	4	10	You still follow teachings about special days , months , seasons , and years .
NCV	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid for you , that my work for you has been wasted .
NCV	Galatians	4	12	Brothers and sisters , I became like you , so I beg you to become like me . You were very good to me before .
NCV	Galatians	4	13	You remember that it was because of an illness that I came to you the first time , preaching the Good News .
NCV	Galatians	4	14	Though my sickness was a trouble for you , you did not hate me or make me leave . But you welcomed me as an angel from God , as if I were Jesus Christ himself !
NCV	Galatians	4	15	You were very happy then , but where is that joy now ? I am ready to testify that you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me if that were possible .
NCV	Galatians	4	16	Now am I your enemy because I tell you the truth ?
NCV	Galatians	4	17	Those people [ b ] are working hard to persuade you , but this is not good for you . They want to persuade you to turn against us and follow only them .

NCV	Galatians	4	21	Some of you still want to be under the law . Tell me , do you know what the law says ?
NCV	Galatians	4	22	The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons . The mother of one son was a slave woman , and the mother of the other son was a free woman .
NCV	Galatians	4	23	Abraham ’ s son from the slave woman was born in the normal human way . But the son from the free woman was born because of the promise God made to Abraham .
NCV	Galatians	4	24	This story teaches something else : The two women are like the two agreements between God and his people . One agreement is the law that God made on Mount Sinai , [ c ] and the people who are under this agreement are like slaves . The mother named Hagar is like that agreement .
NCV	Galatians	4	25	She is like Mount Sinai in Arabia and is a picture of the earthly city of Jerusalem . This city and its people are slaves to the law .
NCV	Galatians	4	26	But the heavenly Jerusalem , which is above , is like the free woman . She is our mother .
NCV	Galatians	4	27	It is written in the Scriptures : “ Be happy , Jerusalem . You are like a woman who never gave birth to children . Start singing and shout for joy . You never felt the pain of giving birth , but you will have more children than the woman who has a husband. ” Isaiah 54:1
NCV	Galatians	4	28	My brothers and sisters , you are God ’ s children because of his promise , as Isaac was then .
NCV	Galatians	4	29	The son who was born in the normal way treated the other son badly . It is the same today .
NCV	Galatians	4	30	But what does the Scripture say ? “ Throw out the slave woman and her son . The son of the slave woman should not inherit anything . The son of the free woman should receive it all. ” [ d ]
NCV	Galatians	4	31	So , my brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman , but of the free woman .

NCV	Galatians	5	5	But we have the true hope that comes from being made right with God , and by the Spirit we wait eagerly for this hope .
NCV	Galatians	5	2	Listen , I Paul tell you that if you go back to the law by being circumcised , Christ does you no good .
NCV	Galatians	5	3	Again , I warn every man : If you allow yourselves to be circumcised , you must follow all the law .
NCV	Galatians	5	4	If you try to be made right with God through the law , your life with Christ is over—you have left God ’ s grace .
NCV	Galatians	5	6	When we are in Christ Jesus , it is not important if we are circumcised or not . The important thing is faith—the kind of faith that works through love .
NCV	Galatians	5	7	You were running a good race . Who stopped you from following the true way ?
NCV	Galatians	5	8	This change did not come from the One who chose you .
NCV	Galatians	5	9	Be careful ! “ Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise. ”
NCV	Galatians	5	10	But I trust in the Lord that you will not believe those different ideas . Whoever is confusing you with such ideas will be punished .
NCV	Galatians	5	11	My brothers and sisters , I do not teach that a man must be circumcised . If I teach circumcision , why am I still being attacked ? If I still taught circumcision , my preaching about the cross would not be a problem .
NCV	Galatians	5	12	I wish the people who are bothering you would castrate [ a ] themselves !
NCV	Galatians	5	13	My brothers and sisters , God called you to be free , but do not use your freedom as an excuse to do what pleases your sinful self . Serve each other with love .
NCV	Galatians	5	14	The whole law is made complete in this one command : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ” [ b ]
NCV	Galatians	5	15	If you go on hurting each other and tearing each other apart , be careful , or you will completely destroy each other . The Spirit and Human Nature
NCV	Galatians	5	16	So I tell you : Live by following the Spirit . Then you will not do what your sinful selves want .
NCV	Galatians	5	17	Our sinful selves want what is against the Spirit , and the Spirit wants what is against our sinful selves . The two are against each other , so you can not do just what you please .
NCV	Galatians	5	18	But if the Spirit is leading you , you are not under the law .
NCV	Galatians	5	19	The wrong things the sinful self does are clear : being sexually unfaithful , not being pure , taking part in sexual sins ,
NCV	Galatians	5	20	worshiping gods , doing witchcraft , hating , making trouble , being jealous , being angry , being selfish , making people angry with each other , causing divisions among people ,

NCV	Galatians	6	6	Anyone who is learning the teaching of God should share all the good things he has with his teacher . Life Is like Planting a Field
NCV	Galatians	6	2	By helping each other with your troubles , you truly obey the law of Christ .
NCV	Galatians	6	3	If anyone thinks he is important when he really is not , he is only fooling himself .
NCV	Galatians	6	4	Each person should judge his own actions and not compare himself with others . Then he can be proud for what he himself has done .
NCV	Galatians	6	5	Each person must be responsible for himself .
NCV	Galatians	6	7	Do not be fooled : You can not cheat God . People harvest only what they plant .
NCV	Galatians	6	8	If they plant to satisfy their sinful selves , their sinful selves will bring them ruin . But if they plant to please the Spirit , they will receive eternal life from the Spirit .
NCV	Galatians	6	9	We must not become tired of doing good . We will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time if we do not give up .
NCV	Galatians	6	10	When we have the opportunity to help anyone , we should do it . But we should give special attention to those who are in the family of believers . Paul Ends His Letter
NCV	Galatians	6	11	See what large letters I use to write this myself .
NCV	Galatians	6	12	Some people are trying to force you to be circumcised so the Jews will accept them . They are afraid they will be attacked if they follow only the cross of Christ . [ a ]
NCV	Galatians	6	13	Those who are circumcised do not obey the law themselves , but they want you to be circumcised so they can brag about what they forced you to do .
NCV	Galatians	6	14	I hope I will never brag about things like that . The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ is my only reason for bragging . Through the cross of Jesus my world was crucified , and I died to the world .
NCV	Galatians	6	15	It is not important if a man is circumcised or uncircumcised . The important thing is being the new people God has made .
NCV	Galatians	6	16	Peace and mercy to those who follow this rule—and to all of God ’ s people .

NCV	Ephesians	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . I am an apostle because that is what God wanted . To God ’ s holy people living in Ephesus , [ a ] believers in Christ Jesus :
NCV	Ephesians	1	2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Spiritual Blessings in Christ
NCV	Ephesians	1	3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . In Christ , God has given us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly world .
NCV	Ephesians	1	4	That is , in Christ , he chose us before the world was made so that we would be his holy people—people without blame before him .
NCV	Ephesians	1	5	Because of his love , God had already decided to make us his own children through Jesus Christ . That was what he wanted and what pleased him ,
NCV	Ephesians	1	6	and it brings praise to God because of his wonderful grace . God gave that grace to us freely , in Christ , the One he loves .
NCV	Ephesians	1	7	In Christ we are set free by the blood of his death , and so we have forgiveness of sins . How rich is God ’ s grace ,
NCV	Ephesians	1	8	which he has given to us so fully and freely . God , with full wisdom and understanding ,
NCV	Ephesians	1	9	let us know his secret purpose . This was what God wanted , and he planned to do it through Christ .
NCV	Ephesians	1	10	His goal was to carry out his plan , when the right time came , that all things in heaven and on earth would be joined together in Christ as the head .
NCV	Ephesians	1	11	In Christ we were chosen to be God ’ s people , because from the very beginning God had decided this in keeping with his plan . And he is the One who makes everything agree with what he decides and wants .
NCV	Ephesians	1	12	We are the first people who hoped in Christ , and we were chosen so that we would bring praise to God ’ s glory .
NCV	Ephesians	1	13	So it is with you . When you heard the true teaching—the Good News about your salvation—you believed in Christ . And in Christ , God put his special mark of ownership on you by giving you the Holy Spirit that he had promised .
NCV	Ephesians	1	14	That Holy Spirit is the guarantee that we will receive what God promised for his people until God gives full freedom to those who are his—to bring praise to God ’ s glory . Paul ’ s Prayer
NCV	Ephesians	1	15	That is why since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God ’ s people ,
NCV	Ephesians	1	16	I have not stopped giving thanks to God for you . I always remember you in my prayers ,
NCV	Ephesians	1	17	asking the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the glorious Father , to give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that you will know him better .
NCV	Ephesians	1	18	I pray also that you will have greater understanding in your heart so you will know the hope to which he has called us and that you will know how rich and glorious are the blessings God has promised his holy people .
NCV	Ephesians	1	19	And you will know that God ’ s power is very great for us who believe . That power is the same as the great strength
NCV	Ephesians	1	20	God used to raise Christ from the dead and put him at his right side in the heavenly world .
NCV	Ephesians	1	21	God has put Christ over all rulers , authorities , powers , and kings , not only in this world but also in the next .
NCV	Ephesians	1	22	God put everything under his power and made him the head over everything for the church ,
NCV	Ephesians	1	23	which is Christ ’ s body . The church is filled with Christ , and Christ fills everything in every way . Footnotes - 1:1 in Ephesus Some Greek copies do not have this phrase . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ephesians	2	2	Yes , in the past you lived the way the world lives , following the ruler of the evil powers that are above the earth . That same spirit is now working in those who refuse to obey God .
NCV	Ephesians	2	3	In the past all of us lived like them , trying to please our sinful selves and doing all the things our bodies and minds wanted . We should have suffered God ’ s anger because we were sinful by nature . We were the same as all other people .
NCV	Ephesians	2	4	But God ’ s mercy is great , and he loved us very much .
NCV	Ephesians	2	5	Though we were spiritually dead because of the things we did against God , he gave us new life with Christ . You have been saved by God ’ s grace .
NCV	Ephesians	2	6	And he raised us up with Christ and gave us a seat with him in the heavens . He did this for those in Christ Jesus
NCV	Ephesians	2	7	so that for all future time he could show the very great riches of his grace by being kind to us in Christ Jesus .
NCV	Ephesians	2	8	I mean that you have been saved by grace through believing . You did not save yourselves ; it was a gift from God .
NCV	Ephesians	2	9	It was not the result of your own efforts , so you can not brag about it .
NCV	Ephesians	2	10	God has made us what we are . In Christ Jesus , God made us to do good works , which God planned in advance for us to live our lives doing . One in Christ
NCV	Ephesians	2	11	You were not born Jewish . You are the people the Jews call “ uncircumcised. ” [ a ] Those who call you “ uncircumcised ” call themselves “ circumcised. ” ( Their circumcision is only something they themselves do on their bodies . )
NCV	Ephesians	2	12	Remember that in the past you were without Christ . You were not citizens of Israel , and you had no part in the agreements [ b ] with the promise that God made to his people . You had no hope , and you did not know God .
NCV	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus , you who were far away from God are brought near through the blood of Christ ’ s death .
NCV	Ephesians	2	14	Christ himself is our peace . He made both Jewish people and those who are not Jews one people . They were separated as if there were a wall between them , but Christ broke down that wall of hate by giving his own body .
NCV	Ephesians	2	15	The Jewish law had many commands and rules , but Christ ended that law . His purpose was to make the two groups of people become one new people in him and in this way make peace .
NCV	Ephesians	2	16	It was also Christ ’ s purpose to end the hatred between the two groups , to make them into one body , and to bring them back to God . Christ did all this with his death on the cross .
NCV	Ephesians	2	17	Christ came and preached peace to you who were far away from God , and to those who were near to God .
NCV	Ephesians	2	18	Yes , it is through Christ we all have the right to come to the Father in one Spirit .
NCV	Ephesians	2	19	Now you who are not Jewish are not foreigners or strangers any longer , but are citizens together with God ’ s holy people . You belong to God ’ s family .
NCV	Ephesians	2	20	You are like a building that was built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets . Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone [ c ] in that building ,
NCV	Ephesians	2	21	and that whole building is joined together in Christ . He makes it grow and become a holy temple in the Lord .
NCV	Ephesians	2	22	And in Christ you , too , are being built together with the Jews into a place where God lives through the Spirit . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ephesians	3	3	He let me know his secret by showing it to me . I have already written a little about this .
NCV	Ephesians	3	2	Surely you have heard that God gave me this work to tell you about his grace .
NCV	Ephesians	3	4	If you read what I wrote then , you can see that I truly understand the secret about the Christ .
NCV	Ephesians	3	5	People who lived in other times were not told that secret . But now , through the Spirit , God has shown that secret to his holy apostles and prophets .
NCV	Ephesians	3	6	This is that secret : that through the Good News those who are not Jews will share with the Jews in God ’ s blessing . They belong to the same body , and they share together in the promise that God made in Christ Jesus .
NCV	Ephesians	3	7	By God ’ s special gift of grace given to me through his power , I became a servant to tell that Good News .
NCV	Ephesians	3	8	I am the least important of all God ’ s people , but God gave me this gift—to tell those who are not Jews the Good News about the riches of Christ , which are too great to understand fully .
NCV	Ephesians	3	9	And God gave me the work of telling all people about the plan for his secret , which has been hidden in him since the beginning of time . He is the One who created everything .
NCV	Ephesians	3	10	His purpose was that through the church all the rulers and powers in the heavenly world will now know God ’ s wisdom , which has so many forms .
NCV	Ephesians	3	11	This agrees with the purpose God had since the beginning of time , and he carried out his plan through Christ Jesus our Lord .
NCV	Ephesians	3	12	In Christ we can come before God with freedom and without fear . We can do this through faith in Christ .
NCV	Ephesians	3	13	So I ask you not to become discouraged because of the sufferings I am having for you . My sufferings are for your glory . The Love of Christ
NCV	Ephesians	3	14	So I bow in prayer before the Father
NCV	Ephesians	3	15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth gets its true name .
NCV	Ephesians	3	16	I ask the Father in his great glory to give you the power to be strong inwardly through his Spirit .
NCV	Ephesians	3	17	I pray that Christ will live in your hearts by faith and that your life will be strong in love and be built on love .
NCV	Ephesians	3	18	And I pray that you and all God ’ s holy people will have the power to understand the greatness of Christ ’ s love—how wide and how long and how high and how deep that love is .
NCV	Ephesians	3	19	Christ ’ s love is greater than anyone can ever know , but I pray that you will be able to know that love . Then you can be filled with the fullness of God .
NCV	Ephesians	3	20	With God ’ s power working in us , God can do much , much more than anything we can ask or imagine .
NCV	Ephesians	3	21	To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus for all time , forever and ever . Amen . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ephesians	4	4	There is one body and one Spirit , and God called you to have one hope .
NCV	Ephesians	4	2	Always be humble , gentle , and patient , accepting each other in love .
NCV	Ephesians	4	3	You are joined together with peace through the Spirit , so make every effort to continue together in this way .
NCV	Ephesians	4	5	There is one Lord , one faith , and one baptism .
NCV	Ephesians	4	6	There is one God and Father of everything . He rules everything and is everywhere and is in everything .
NCV	Ephesians	4	7	Christ gave each one of us the special gift of grace , showing how generous he is .
NCV	Ephesians	4	8	That is why it says in the Scriptures , “ When he went up to the heights , he led a parade of captives , and he gave gifts to people. ” Psalm 68:18
NCV	Ephesians	4	9	When it says , “ He went up , ” what does it mean ? It means that he first came down to the earth .
NCV	Ephesians	4	10	So Jesus came down , and he is the same One who went up above all the heaven . Christ did that to fill everything with his presence .
NCV	Ephesians	4	11	And Christ gave gifts to people—he made some to be apostles , some to be prophets , some to go and tell the Good News , and some to have the work of caring for and teaching God ’ s people .
NCV	Ephesians	4	12	Christ gave those gifts to prepare God ’ s holy people for the work of serving , to make the body of Christ stronger .
NCV	Ephesians	4	13	This work must continue until we are all joined together in the same faith and in the same knowledge of the Son of God . We must become like a mature person , growing until we become like Christ and have his perfection .
NCV	Ephesians	4	14	Then we will no longer be babies . We will not be tossed about like a ship that the waves carry one way and then another . We will not be influenced by every new teaching we hear from people who are trying to fool us . They make plans and try any kind of trick to fool people into following the wrong path .
NCV	Ephesians	4	15	No ! Speaking the truth with love , we will grow up in every way into Christ , who is the head .
NCV	Ephesians	4	16	The whole body depends on Christ , and all the parts of the body are joined and held together . Each part does its own work to make the whole body grow and be strong with love . The Way You Should Live
NCV	Ephesians	4	17	In the Lord ’ s name , I tell you this . Do not continue living like those who do not believe . Their thoughts are worth nothing .
NCV	Ephesians	4	18	They do not understand , and they know nothing , because they refuse to listen . So they can not have the life that God gives .
NCV	Ephesians	4	19	They have lost all feeling of shame , and they use their lives for doing evil . They continually want to do all kinds of evil .
NCV	Ephesians	4	20	But what you learned in Christ was not like this .
NCV	Ephesians	4	21	I know that you heard about him , and you are in him , so you were taught the truth that is in Jesus .
NCV	Ephesians	4	22	You were taught to leave your old self—to stop living the evil way you lived before . That old self becomes worse , because people are fooled by the evil things they want to do .
NCV	Ephesians	4	23	But you were taught to be made new in your hearts ,
NCV	Ephesians	4	24	to become a new person . That new person is made to be like God—made to be truly good and holy .
NCV	Ephesians	4	25	So you must stop telling lies . Tell each other the truth , because we all belong to each other in the same body . [ a ]
NCV	Ephesians	4	26	When you are angry , do not sin , and be sure to stop being angry before the end of the day .
NCV	Ephesians	4	27	Do not give the devil a way to defeat you .
NCV	Ephesians	4	28	Those who are stealing must stop stealing and start working . They should earn an honest living for themselves . Then they will have something to share with those who are poor .
NCV	Ephesians	4	29	When you talk , do not say harmful things , but say what people need—words that will help others become stronger . Then what you say will do good to those who listen to you .
NCV	Ephesians	4	30	And do not make the Holy Spirit sad . The Spirit is God ’ s proof that you belong to him . God gave you the Spirit to show that God will make you free when the final day comes .
NCV	Ephesians	4	31	Do not be bitter or angry or mad . Never shout angrily or say things to hurt others . Never do anything evil .
NCV	Ephesians	4	32	Be kind and loving to each other , and forgive each other just as God forgave you in Christ . Footnotes - 4:25 Tell . . . body . Quotation from Zechariah 8:16 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ephesians	5	5	You can be sure of this : No one will have a place in the kingdom of Christ and of God who sins sexually , or does evil things , or is greedy . Anyone who is greedy is serving a false god .
NCV	Ephesians	5	2	Live a life of love just as Christ loved us and gave himself for us as a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God .
NCV	Ephesians	5	3	But there must be no sexual sin among you , or any kind of evil or greed . Those things are not right for God ’ s holy people .
NCV	Ephesians	5	4	Also , there must be no evil talk among you , and you must not speak foolishly or tell evil jokes . These things are not right for you . Instead , you should be giving thanks to God .
NCV	Ephesians	5	6	Do not let anyone fool you by telling you things that are not true , because these things will bring God ’ s anger on those who do not obey him .
NCV	Ephesians	5	7	So have nothing to do with them .
NCV	Ephesians	5	8	In the past you were full of darkness , but now you are full of light in the Lord . So live like children who belong to the light .
NCV	Ephesians	5	9	Light brings every kind of goodness , right living , and truth .
NCV	Ephesians	5	10	Try to learn what pleases the Lord .
NCV	Ephesians	5	11	Have nothing to do with the things done in darkness , which are not worth anything . But show that they are wrong .
NCV	Ephesians	5	12	It is shameful even to talk about what those people do in secret .
NCV	Ephesians	5	13	But the light makes all things easy to see ,
NCV	Ephesians	5	14	and everything that is made easy to see can become light . This is why it is said : “ Wake up , sleeper ! Rise from death , and Christ will shine on you. ”
NCV	Ephesians	5	15	So be very careful how you live . Do not live like those who are not wise , but live wisely .
NCV	Ephesians	5	16	Use every chance you have for doing good , because these are evil times .
NCV	Ephesians	5	17	So do not be foolish but learn what the Lord wants you to do .
NCV	Ephesians	5	18	Do not be drunk with wine , which will ruin you , but be filled with the Spirit .
NCV	Ephesians	5	19	Speak to each other with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs , singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord .
NCV	Ephesians	5	20	Always give thanks to God the Father for everything , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . Wives and Husbands
NCV	Ephesians	5	21	Yield to obey each other as you would to Christ .
NCV	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , yield to your husbands , as you do to the Lord ,
NCV	Ephesians	5	23	because the husband is the head of the wife , as Christ is the head of the church . And he is the Savior of the body , which is the church .
NCV	Ephesians	5	24	As the church yields to Christ , so you wives should yield to your husbands in everything .
NCV	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it
NCV	Ephesians	5	26	to make it belong to God . Christ used the word to make the church clean by washing it with water .
NCV	Ephesians	5	27	He died so that he could give the church to himself like a bride in all her beauty . He died so that the church could be pure and without fault , with no evil or sin or any other wrong thing in it .
NCV	Ephesians	5	28	In the same way , husbands should love their wives as they love their own bodies . The man who loves his wife loves himself .
NCV	Ephesians	5	29	No one ever hates his own body , but feeds and takes care of it . And that is what Christ does for the church ,
NCV	Ephesians	5	30	because we are parts of his body .
NCV	Ephesians	5	31	The Scripture says , “ So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife , and the two will become one body. ” [ a ]
NCV	Ephesians	5	32	That secret is very important—I am talking about Christ and the church .
NCV	Ephesians	5	33	But each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself , and a wife must respect her husband . Footnotes - 5:31 “ So . . . body. ” Quotation from Genesis 2:24 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ephesians	6	6	You must do this not only while they are watching you , to please them . With all your heart you must do what God wants as people who are obeying Christ .
NCV	Ephesians	6	2	The command says , “ Honor your father and mother. ” [ a ] This is the first command that has a promise with it—
NCV	Ephesians	6	3	“ Then everything will be well with you , and you will have a long life on the earth. ” [ b ]
NCV	Ephesians	6	4	Fathers , do not make your children angry , but raise them with the training and teaching of the Lord . Slaves and Masters
NCV	Ephesians	6	5	Slaves , obey your masters here on earth with fear and respect and from a sincere heart , just as you obey Christ .
NCV	Ephesians	6	7	Do your work with enthusiasm . Work as if you were serving the Lord , not as if you were serving only men and women .
NCV	Ephesians	6	8	Remember that the Lord will give a reward to everyone , slave or free , for doing good .
NCV	Ephesians	6	9	Masters , in the same way , be good to your slaves . Do not threaten them . Remember that the One who is your Master and their Master is in heaven , and he treats everyone alike . Wear the Full Armor of God
NCV	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , be strong in the Lord and in his great power .
NCV	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the full armor of God so that you can fight against the devil ’ s evil tricks .
NCV	Ephesians	6	12	Our fight is not against people on earth but against the rulers and authorities and the powers of this world ’ s darkness , against the spiritual powers of evil in the heavenly world .
NCV	Ephesians	6	13	That is why you need to put on God ’ s full armor . Then on the day of evil you will be able to stand strong . And when you have finished the whole fight , you will still be standing .
NCV	Ephesians	6	14	So stand strong , with the belt of truth tied around your waist and the protection of right living on your chest .
NCV	Ephesians	6	15	On your feet wear the Good News of peace to help you stand strong .
NCV	Ephesians	6	16	And also use the shield of faith with which you can stop all the burning arrows of the Evil One .
NCV	Ephesians	6	17	Accept God ’ s salvation as your helmet , and take the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
NCV	Ephesians	6	18	Pray in the Spirit at all times with all kinds of prayers , asking for everything you need . To do this you must always be ready and never give up . Always pray for all God ’ s people .
NCV	Ephesians	6	19	Also pray for me that when I speak , God will give me words so that I can tell the secret of the Good News without fear .
NCV	Ephesians	6	20	I have been sent to preach this Good News , and I am doing that now , here in prison . Pray that when I preach the Good News I will speak without fear , as I should . Final Greetings
NCV	Ephesians	6	21	I am sending to you Tychicus , our brother whom we love and a faithful servant of the Lord ’ s work . He will tell you everything that is happening with me . Then you will know how I am and what I am doing .
NCV	Ephesians	6	22	I am sending him to you for this reason—so that you will know how we are , and he can encourage you .
NCV	Ephesians	6	23	Peace and love with faith to you brothers and sisters from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .

NCV	Philippians	1	1	From Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus . To all of God ’ s holy people in Christ Jesus who live in Philippi , including your overseers and deacons :
NCV	Philippians	1	2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Paul ’ s Prayer
NCV	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God every time I remember you ,
NCV	Philippians	1	4	always praying with joy for all of you .
NCV	Philippians	1	5	I thank God for the help you gave me while I preached the Good News—help you gave from the first day you believed until now .
NCV	Philippians	1	6	God began doing a good work in you , and I am sure he will continue it until it is finished when Jesus Christ comes again .
NCV	Philippians	1	7	And I know that I am right to think like this about all of you , because I have you in my heart . All of you share in God ’ s grace with me while I am in prison and while I am defending and proving the truth of the Good News .
NCV	Philippians	1	8	God knows that I want to see you very much , because I love all of you with the love of Christ Jesus .
NCV	Philippians	1	9	This is my prayer for you : that your love will grow more and more ; that you will have knowledge and understanding with your love ;
NCV	Philippians	1	10	that you will see the difference between good and bad and will choose the good ; that you will be pure and without wrong for the coming of Christ ;
NCV	Philippians	1	11	that you will be filled with the good things produced in your life by Christ to bring glory and praise to God . Paul ’ s Troubles Help the Work
NCV	Philippians	1	12	I want you brothers and sisters to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the Good News .
NCV	Philippians	1	13	All the palace guards and everyone else knows that I am in prison because I am a believer in Christ .
NCV	Philippians	1	14	Because I am in prison , most of the believers have become more bold in Christ and are not afraid to speak the word of God .
NCV	Philippians	1	15	It is true that some preach about Christ because they are jealous and ambitious , but others preach about Christ because they want to help .
NCV	Philippians	1	16	They preach because they have love , and they know that God gave me the work of defending the Good News .
NCV	Philippians	1	17	But the others preach about Christ for selfish and wrong reasons , wanting to make trouble for me in prison .
NCV	Philippians	1	18	But it doesn ’ t matter . The important thing is that in every way , whether for right or wrong reasons , they are preaching about Christ . So I am happy , and I will continue to be happy .
NCV	Philippians	1	19	Because you are praying for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is helping me , I know this trouble will bring my freedom .
NCV	Philippians	1	20	I expect and hope that I will not fail Christ in anything but that I will have the courage now , as always , to show the greatness of Christ in my life here on earth , whether I live or die .
NCV	Philippians	1	21	To me the only important thing about living is Christ , and dying would be profit for me .
NCV	Philippians	1	22	If I continue living in my body , I will be able to work for the Lord . I do not know what to choose—living or dying .
NCV	Philippians	1	23	It is hard to choose between the two . I want to leave this life and be with Christ , which is much better ,
NCV	Philippians	1	24	but you need me here in my body .
NCV	Philippians	1	25	Since I am sure of this , I know I will stay with you to help you grow and have joy in your faith .
NCV	Philippians	1	26	You will be very happy in Christ Jesus when I am with you again .
NCV	Philippians	1	27	Only one thing concerns me : Be sure that you live in a way that brings honor to the Good News of Christ . Then whether I come and visit you or am away from you , I will hear that you are standing strong with one purpose , that you work together as one for the faith of the Good News ,
NCV	Philippians	1	28	and that you are not afraid of those who are against you . All of this is proof that your enemies will be destroyed but that you will be saved by God .
NCV	Philippians	1	29	God gave you the honor not only of believing in Christ but also of suffering for him , both of which bring glory to Christ .

NCV	Philippians	2	2	If so , make me very happy by having the same thoughts , sharing the same love , and having one mind and purpose .
NCV	Philippians	2	3	When you do things , do not let selfishness or pride be your guide . Instead , be humble and give more honor to others than to yourselves .
NCV	Philippians	2	4	Do not be interested only in your own life , but be interested in the lives of others . Be Unselfish Like Christ
NCV	Philippians	2	5	In your lives you must think and act like Christ Jesus .
NCV	Philippians	2	6	Christ himself was like God in everything . But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for his own benefit .
NCV	Philippians	2	7	But he gave up his place with God and made himself nothing . He was born as a man and became like a servant .
NCV	Philippians	2	8	And when he was living as a man , he humbled himself and was fully obedient to God , even when that caused his death—death on a cross .
NCV	Philippians	2	9	So God raised him to the highest place . God made his name greater than every other name
NCV	Philippians	2	10	so that every knee will bow to the name of Jesus— everyone in heaven , on earth , and under the earth .
NCV	Philippians	2	11	And everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and bring glory to God the Father . Be the People God Wants You to Be
NCV	Philippians	2	12	My dear friends , you have always obeyed God when I was with you . It is even more important that you obey now while I am away from you . Keep on working to complete your salvation with fear and trembling ,
NCV	Philippians	2	13	because God is working in you to help you want to do and be able to do what pleases him .
NCV	Philippians	2	14	Do everything without complaining or arguing .
NCV	Philippians	2	15	Then you will be innocent and without any wrong . You will be God ’ s children without fault . But you are living with crooked and mean people all around you , among whom you shine like stars in the dark world .
NCV	Philippians	2	16	You offer the teaching that gives life . So when Christ comes again , I can be happy because my work was not wasted . I ran the race and won .
NCV	Philippians	2	17	Your faith makes you offer your lives as a sacrifice in serving God . If I have to offer my own blood with your sacrifice , I will be happy and full of joy with all of you .
NCV	Philippians	2	18	You also should be happy and full of joy with me . Timothy and Epaphroditus
NCV	Philippians	2	19	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon . I will be happy to learn how you are .
NCV	Philippians	2	20	I have no one else like Timothy , who truly cares for you .
NCV	Philippians	2	21	Other people are interested only in their own lives , not in the work of Jesus Christ .
NCV	Philippians	2	22	You know the kind of person Timothy is . You know he has served with me in telling the Good News , as a son serves his father .
NCV	Philippians	2	23	I plan to send him to you quickly when I know what will happen to me .
NCV	Philippians	2	24	I am sure that the Lord will help me to come to you soon .
NCV	Philippians	2	25	Epaphroditus , my brother in Christ , works and serves with me in the army of Christ . When I needed help , you sent him to me . I think now that I must send him back to you ,
NCV	Philippians	2	26	because he wants very much to see all of you . He is worried because you heard that he was sick .
NCV	Philippians	2	27	Yes , he was sick , and nearly died , but God had mercy on him and me too so that I would not have more sadness .
NCV	Philippians	2	28	I want very much to send him to you so that when you see him you can be happy , and I can stop worrying about you .
NCV	Philippians	2	29	Welcome him in the Lord with much joy . Give honor to people like him ,
NCV	Philippians	2	30	because he almost died for the work of Christ . He risked his life to give me the help you could not give in your service to me . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Philippians	3	3	We are the ones who are truly circumcised . We worship God through his Spirit , and our pride is in Christ Jesus . We do not put trust in ourselves or anything we can do ,
NCV	Philippians	3	2	Watch out for those who do evil , who are like dogs , who demand to cut [ a ] the body .
NCV	Philippians	3	4	although I might be able to put trust in myself . If anyone thinks he has a reason to trust in himself , he should know that I have greater reason for trusting in myself .
NCV	Philippians	3	5	I was circumcised eight days after my birth . I am from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin . I am a Hebrew , and my parents were Hebrews . I had a strict view of the law , which is why I became a Pharisee .
NCV	Philippians	3	6	I was so enthusiastic I tried to hurt the church . No one could find fault with the way I obeyed the law of Moses .
NCV	Philippians	3	7	Those things were important to me , but now I think they are worth nothing because of Christ .
NCV	Philippians	3	8	Not only those things , but I think that all things are worth nothing compared with the greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . Because of him , I have lost all those things , and now I know they are worthless trash . This allows me to have Christ
NCV	Philippians	3	9	and to belong to him . Now I am right with God , not because I followed the law , but because I believed in Christ . God uses my faith to make me right with him .
NCV	Philippians	3	10	I want to know Christ and the power that raised him from the dead . I want to share in his sufferings and become like him in his death .
NCV	Philippians	3	11	Then I have hope that I myself will be raised from the dead . Continuing Toward Our Goal
NCV	Philippians	3	12	I do not mean that I am already as God wants me to be . I have not yet reached that goal , but I continue trying to reach it and to make it mine . Christ wants me to do that , which is the reason he made me his .
NCV	Philippians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , I know that I have not yet reached that goal , but there is one thing I always do . Forgetting the past and straining toward what is ahead ,
NCV	Philippians	3	14	I keep trying to reach the goal and get the prize for which God called me through Christ to the life above .
NCV	Philippians	3	15	All of us who are spiritually mature should think this way , too . And if there are things you do not agree with , God will make them clear to you .
NCV	Philippians	3	16	But we should continue following the truth we already have .
NCV	Philippians	3	17	Brothers and sisters , all of you should try to follow my example and to copy those who live the way we showed you .
NCV	Philippians	3	18	Many people live like enemies of the cross of Christ . I have often told you about them , and it makes me cry to tell you about them now .
NCV	Philippians	3	19	In the end , they will be destroyed . They do whatever their bodies want , they are proud of their shameful acts , and they think only about earthly things .
NCV	Philippians	3	20	But our homeland is in heaven , and we are waiting for our Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ , to come from heaven .
NCV	Philippians	3	21	By his power to rule all things , he will change our humble bodies and make them like his own glorious body . Footnotes - 3:2 cut The word in Greek is like the word “ circumcise , ” but it means “ to cut completely off. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Philippians	4	4	Be full of joy in the Lord always . I will say again , be full of joy .
NCV	Philippians	4	2	I ask Euodia and Syntyche to agree in the Lord .
NCV	Philippians	4	3	And I ask you , my faithful friend , to help these women . They served with me in telling the Good News , together with Clement and others who worked with me , whose names are written in the book of life . [ a ]
NCV	Philippians	4	5	Let everyone see that you are gentle and kind . The Lord is coming soon .
NCV	Philippians	4	6	Do not worry about anything , but pray and ask God for everything you need , always giving thanks .
NCV	Philippians	4	7	And God ’ s peace , which is so great we can not understand it , will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
NCV	Philippians	4	8	Brothers and sisters , think about the things that are good and worthy of praise . Think about the things that are true and honorable and right and pure and beautiful and respected .
NCV	Philippians	4	9	Do what you learned and received from me , what I told you , and what you saw me do . And the God who gives peace will be with you . Paul Thanks the Christians
NCV	Philippians	4	10	I am very happy in the Lord that you have shown your care for me again . You continued to care about me , but there was no way for you to show it .
NCV	Philippians	4	11	I am not telling you this because I need anything . I have learned to be satisfied with the things I have and with everything that happens .
NCV	Philippians	4	12	I know how to live when I am poor , and I know how to live when I have plenty . I have learned the secret of being happy at any time in everything that happens , when I have enough to eat and when I go hungry , when I have more than I need and when I do not have enough .
NCV	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through Christ , because he gives me strength .
NCV	Philippians	4	14	But it was good that you helped me when I needed it .
NCV	Philippians	4	15	You Philippians remember when I first preached the Good News there . When I left Macedonia , you were the only church that gave me help .
NCV	Philippians	4	16	Several times you sent me things I needed when I was in Thessalonica .
NCV	Philippians	4	17	Really , it is not that I want to receive gifts from you , but I want you to have the good that comes from giving .
NCV	Philippians	4	18	And now I have everything , and more . I have all I need , because Epaphroditus brought your gift to me . It is like a sweet-smelling sacrifice offered to God , who accepts that sacrifice and is pleased with it .
NCV	Philippians	4	19	My God will use his wonderful riches in Christ Jesus to give you everything you need .
NCV	Philippians	4	20	Glory to our God and Father forever and ever ! Amen .
NCV	Philippians	4	21	Greet each of God ’ s people in Christ Jesus . Those who are with me send greetings to you .

NCV	Colossians	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . I am an apostle because that is what God wanted . Also from Timothy , our brother .
NCV	Colossians	1	2	To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ that live in Colossae : Grace and peace to you from God our Father . [ a ]
NCV	Colossians	1	3	In our prayers for you we always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NCV	Colossians	1	4	because we have heard about the faith you have in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all of God ’ s people .
NCV	Colossians	1	5	You have this faith and love because of your hope , and what you hope for is kept safe for you in heaven . You learned about this hope when you heard the message about the truth , the Good News
NCV	Colossians	1	6	that was told to you . Everywhere in the world that Good News is bringing blessings and is growing . This has happened with you , too , since you heard the Good News and understood the truth about the grace of God .
NCV	Colossians	1	7	You learned about God ’ s grace from Epaphras , whom we love . He works together with us and is a faithful servant of Christ for us . [ b ]
NCV	Colossians	1	8	He also told us about the love you have from the Holy Spirit .
NCV	Colossians	1	9	Because of this , since the day we heard about you , we have continued praying for you , asking God that you will know fully what he wants . We pray that you will also have great wisdom and understanding in spiritual things
NCV	Colossians	1	10	so that you will live the kind of life that honors and pleases the Lord in every way . You will produce fruit in every good work and grow in the knowledge of God .
NCV	Colossians	1	11	God will strengthen you with his own great power so that you will not give up when troubles come , but you will be patient .
NCV	Colossians	1	12	And you will joyfully give thanks to the Father who has made you [ c ] able to have a share in all that he has prepared for his people in the kingdom of light .
NCV	Colossians	1	13	God has freed us from the power of darkness , and he brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son .
NCV	Colossians	1	14	The Son paid for our sins , [ d ] and in him we have forgiveness . The Importance of Christ
NCV	Colossians	1	15	No one can see God , but Jesus Christ is exactly like him . He ranks higher than everything that has been made .
NCV	Colossians	1	16	Through his power all things were made—things in heaven and on earth , things seen and unseen , all powers , authorities , lords , and rulers . All things were made through Christ and for Christ .
NCV	Colossians	1	17	He was there before anything was made , and all things continue because of him .
NCV	Colossians	1	18	He is the head of the body , which is the church . Everything comes from him . He is the first one who was raised from the dead . So in all things Jesus has first place .
NCV	Colossians	1	19	God was pleased for all of himself to live in Christ .
NCV	Colossians	1	20	And through Christ , God has brought all things back to himself again—things on earth and things in heaven . God made peace through the blood of Christ ’ s death on the cross .
NCV	Colossians	1	21	At one time you were separated from God . You were his enemies in your minds , and the evil things you did were against God .
NCV	Colossians	1	22	But now God has made you his friends again . He did this through Christ ’ s death in the body so that he might bring you into God ’ s presence as people who are holy , with no wrong , and with nothing of which God can judge you guilty .
NCV	Colossians	1	23	This will happen if you continue strong and sure in your faith . You must not be moved away from the hope brought to you by the Good News that you heard . That same Good News has been told to everyone in the world , and I , Paul , help in preaching that Good News . Paul ’ s Work for the Church
NCV	Colossians	1	24	I am happy in my sufferings for you . There are things that Christ must still suffer through his body , the church . I am accepting , in my body , my part of these things that must be suffered .
NCV	Colossians	1	25	I became a servant of the church because God gave me a special work to do that helps you , and that work is to tell fully the message of God .
NCV	Colossians	1	26	This message is the secret that was hidden from everyone since the beginning of time , but now it is made known to God ’ s holy people .
NCV	Colossians	1	27	God decided to let his people know this rich and glorious secret which he has for all people . This secret is Christ himself , who is in you . He is our only hope for glory .
NCV	Colossians	1	28	So we continue to preach Christ to each person , using all wisdom to warn and to teach everyone , in order to bring each one into God ’ s presence as a mature person in Christ .
NCV	Colossians	1	29	To do this , I work and struggle , using Christ ’ s great strength that works so powerfully in me . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Colossians	1	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Colossians	2	2	I want them to be strengthened and joined together with love so that they may be rich in their understanding . This leads to their knowing fully God ’ s secret , that is , Christ himself .
NCV	Colossians	2	3	In him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are safely kept .
NCV	Colossians	2	4	I say this so that no one can fool you by arguments that seem good , but are false .
NCV	Colossians	2	5	Though I am absent from you in my body , my heart is with you , and I am happy to see your good lives and your strong faith in Christ . Continue to Live in Christ
NCV	Colossians	2	6	As you received Christ Jesus the Lord , so continue to live in him .
NCV	Colossians	2	7	Keep your roots deep in him and have your lives built on him . Be strong in the faith , just as you were taught , and always be thankful .
NCV	Colossians	2	8	Be sure that no one leads you away with false and empty teaching that is only human , which comes from the ruling spirits of this world , and not from Christ .
NCV	Colossians	2	9	All of God lives fully in Christ ( even when Christ was on earth ) ,
NCV	Colossians	2	10	and you have a full and true life in Christ , who is ruler over all rulers and powers .
NCV	Colossians	2	11	Also in Christ you had a different kind of circumcision , a circumcision not done by hands . It was through Christ ’ s circumcision , that is , his death , that you were made free from the power of your sinful self .
NCV	Colossians	2	12	When you were baptized , you were buried with Christ , and you were raised up with him through your faith in God ’ s power that was shown when he raised Christ from the dead .
NCV	Colossians	2	13	When you were spiritually dead because of your sins and because you were not free from the power of your sinful self , God made you alive with Christ , and he forgave all our sins .
NCV	Colossians	2	14	He canceled the debt , which listed all the rules we failed to follow . He took away that record with its rules and nailed it to the cross .
NCV	Colossians	2	15	God stripped the spiritual rulers and powers of their authority . With the cross , he won the victory and showed the world that they were powerless . Don ’ t Follow People ’ s Rules
NCV	Colossians	2	16	So do not let anyone make rules for you about eating and drinking or about a religious feast , a New Moon Festival , or a Sabbath day .
NCV	Colossians	2	17	These things were like a shadow of what was to come . But what is true and real has come and is found in Christ .
NCV	Colossians	2	18	Do not let anyone disqualify you by making you humiliate yourself and worship angels . Such people enter into visions , which fill them with foolish pride because of their human way of thinking .
NCV	Colossians	2	19	They do not hold tightly to Christ , the head . It is from him that all the parts of the body are cared for and held together . So it grows in the way God wants it to grow .
NCV	Colossians	2	20	Since you died with Christ and were made free from the ruling spirits of the world , why do you act as if you still belong to this world by following rules like these :
NCV	Colossians	2	21	“ Don ’ t handle this , ” “ Don ’ t taste that , ” “ Don ’ t even touch that thing ” ?
NCV	Colossians	2	22	These rules refer to earthly things that are gone as soon as they are used . They are only human commands and teachings .
NCV	Colossians	2	23	They seem to be wise , but they are only part of a human religion . They make people pretend not to be proud and make them punish their bodies , but they do not really control the evil desires of the sinful self . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Colossians	3	3	Your old sinful self has died , and your new life is kept with Christ in God .
NCV	Colossians	3	2	Think only about the things in heaven , not the things on earth .
NCV	Colossians	3	4	Christ is your [ a ] life , and when he comes again , you will share in his glory .
NCV	Colossians	3	5	So put all evil things out of your life : sexual sinning , doing evil , letting evil thoughts control you , wanting things that are evil , and greed . This is really serving a false god .
NCV	Colossians	3	6	These things make God angry . [ b ]
NCV	Colossians	3	7	In your past , evil life you also did these things .
NCV	Colossians	3	8	But now also put these things out of your life : anger , bad temper , doing or saying things to hurt others , and using evil words when you talk .
NCV	Colossians	3	9	Do not lie to each other . You have left your old sinful life and the things you did before .
NCV	Colossians	3	10	You have begun to live the new life , in which you are being made new and are becoming like the One who made you . This new life brings you the true knowledge of God .
NCV	Colossians	3	11	In the new life there is no difference between Greeks and Jews , those who are circumcised and those who are not circumcised , or people who are foreigners , or Scythians . [ c ] There is no difference between slaves and free people . But Christ is in all believers , and Christ is all that is important .
NCV	Colossians	3	12	God has chosen you and made you his holy people . He loves you . So you should always clothe yourselves with mercy , kindness , humility , gentleness , and patience .
NCV	Colossians	3	13	Bear with each other , and forgive each other . If someone does wrong to you , forgive that person because the Lord forgave you .
NCV	Colossians	3	14	Even more than all this , clothe yourself in love . Love is what holds you all together in perfect unity .
NCV	Colossians	3	15	Let the peace that Christ gives control your thinking , because you were all called together in one body [ d ] to have peace . Always be thankful .
NCV	Colossians	3	16	Let the teaching of Christ live in you richly . Use all wisdom to teach and instruct each other by singing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God .
NCV	Colossians	3	17	Everything you do or say should be done to obey Jesus your Lord . And in all you do , give thanks to God the Father through Jesus . Your New Life with Other People
NCV	Colossians	3	18	Wives , yield to the authority of your husbands , because this is the right thing to do in the Lord .
NCV	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives and be gentle with them .
NCV	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in all things , because this pleases the Lord .
NCV	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , do not nag your children . If you are too hard to please , they may want to stop trying .
NCV	Colossians	3	22	Slaves , obey your masters in all things . Do not obey just when they are watching you , to gain their favor , but serve them honestly , because you respect the Lord .
NCV	Colossians	3	23	In all the work you are doing , work the best you can . Work as if you were doing it for the Lord , not for people .
NCV	Colossians	3	24	Remember that you will receive your reward from the Lord , which he promised to his people . You are serving the Lord Christ .

NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	We were not looking for human praise , from you or anyone else ,
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	even though as apostles of Christ we could have used our authority over you . But we were very gentle with you , [ a ] like a mother caring for her little children .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	Because we loved you , we were happy to share not only God ’ s Good News with you , but even our own lives . You had become so dear to us !
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	Brothers and sisters , I know you remember our hard work and difficulties . We worked night and day so we would not burden any of you while we preached God ’ s Good News to you .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	When we were with you , we lived in a holy and honest way , without fault . You know this is true , and so does God .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	You know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	We encouraged you , we urged you , and we insisted that you live good lives for God , who calls you to his glorious kingdom .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	Also , we always thank God because when you heard his message from us , you accepted it as the word of God , not the words of humans . And it really is God ’ s message which works in you who believe .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	Brothers and sisters , your experiences have been like those of God ’ s churches in Christ that are in Judea . [ b ] You suffered from the people of your own country , as they suffered from the Jews
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and forced us to leave that country . They do not please God and are against all people .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	They try to stop us from teaching those who are not Jews so they may be saved . By doing this , they are increasing their sins to the limit . The anger of God has come to them at last . Paul Wants to Visit Them Again
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	Brothers and sisters , though we were separated from you for a short time , our thoughts were still with you . We wanted very much to see you and tried hard to do so .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	We wanted to come to you . I , Paul , tried to come more than once , but Satan stopped us .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	You are our hope , our joy , and the crown we will take pride in when our Lord Jesus Christ comes .

NCV	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	so none of you would be upset by these troubles . You yourselves know that we must face these troubles .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	and send Timothy to you . Timothy , our brother , works with us for God and helps us tell people the Good News about Christ . We sent him to strengthen and encourage you in your faith
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	Even when we were with you , we told you we all would have to suffer , and you know it has happened .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	Because of this , when I could wait no longer , I sent Timothy to you so I could learn about your faith . I was afraid the devil had tempted you , and perhaps our hard work would have been wasted .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But Timothy now has come back to us from you and has brought us good news about your faith and love . He told us that you always remember us in a good way and that you want to see us just as much as we want to see you .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	So , brothers and sisters , while we have much trouble and suffering , we are encouraged about you because of your faith .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	Our life is really full if you stand strong in the Lord .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	We have so much joy before our God because of you . We can not thank him enough for all the joy we feel .

NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	Don ’ t use your body for sexual sin like the people who do not know God .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	Also , do not wrong or cheat another Christian in this way . The Lord will punish people who do those things as we have already told you and warned you .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	God called us to be holy and does not want us to live in sin .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	So the person who refuses to obey this teaching is disobeying God , not simply a human teaching . And God is the One who gives us his Holy Spirit .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	We do not need to write you about having love for your Christian family , because God has already taught you to love each other .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	And truly you do love the Christians in all of Macedonia . Brothers and sisters , now we encourage you to love them even more .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	Do all you can to live a peaceful life . Take care of your own business , and do your own work as we have already told you .

NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about those Christians who have died so you will not be sad , as others who have no hope .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	We believe that Jesus died and that he rose again . So , because of him , God will raise with Jesus those who have died .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	What we tell you now is the Lord ’ s own message . We who are living when the Lord comes again will not go before those who have already died .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	The Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command , with the voice of the archangel , [ b ] and with the trumpet call of God . And those who have died believing in Christ will rise first .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	After that , we who are still alive will be gathered up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And we will be with the Lord forever .

NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	5	You are all people who belong to the light and to the day . We do not belong to the night or to darkness .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	You know very well that the day the Lord comes again will be a surprise , like a thief that comes in the night .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	While people are saying , “ We have peace and we are safe , ” they will be destroyed quickly . It is like pains that come quickly to a woman having a baby . Those people will not escape .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But you , brothers and sisters , are not living in darkness , and so that day will not surprise you like a thief .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	So we should not be like other people who are sleeping , but we should be alert and have self-control .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	Those who sleep , sleep at night . Those who get drunk , get drunk at night .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But we belong to the day , so we should control ourselves . We should wear faith and love to protect us , and the hope of salvation should be our helmet .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	God did not choose us to suffer his anger but to have salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	Jesus died for us so that we can live together with him , whether we are alive or dead when he comes .

NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	Now , brothers and sisters , we ask you to appreciate those who work hard among you , who lead you in the Lord and teach you .
NCV	1%20Thessalonians	5	13	Respect them with a very special love because of the work they do . Live in peace with each other .

NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	2	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Paul Talks About God ’ s Judgment
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	From Paul , Silas , and Timothy . To the church in Thessalonica in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We must always thank God for you , brothers and sisters . This is only right , because your faith is growing more and more , and the love that every one of you has for each other is increasing .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	So we brag about you to the other churches of God . We tell them about the way you continue to be strong and have faith even though you are being treated badly and are suffering many troubles .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	This is proof that God is right in his judgment . He wants you to be counted worthy of his kingdom for which you are suffering .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	God will do what is right . He will give trouble to those who trouble you .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	And he will give rest to you who are troubled and to us also when the Lord Jesus appears with burning fire from heaven with his powerful angels .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	Then he will punish those who do not know God and who do not obey the Good News about our Lord Jesus Christ .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	Those people will be punished with a destruction that continues forever . They will be kept away from the Lord and from his great power .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	This will happen on the day when the Lord Jesus comes to receive glory because of his holy people . And all the people who have believed will be amazed at Jesus . You will be in that group , because you believed what we told you .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	That is why we always pray for you , asking our God to help you live the kind of life he called you to live . We pray that with his power God will help you do the good things you want and perform the works that come from your faith .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	We pray all this so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ will have glory in you , and you will have glory in him . That glory comes from the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	2	Do not become easily upset in your thinking or afraid if you hear that the day of the Lord has already come . Someone may have said this in a prophecy or in a message or in a letter as if it came from us .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Do not let anyone fool you in any way . That day of the Lord will not come until the turning away [ a ] from God happens and the Man of Evil , [ b ] who is on his way to hell , appears .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	He will be against and put himself above any so-called god or anything that people worship . And that Man of Evil will even go into God ’ s Temple and sit there and say that he is God .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	I told you when I was with you that all this would happen . Do you not remember ?
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And now you know what is stopping that Man of Evil so he will appear at the right time .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	The secret power of evil is already working in the world , but there is one who is stopping that power . And he will continue to stop it until he is taken out of the way .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	Then that Man of Evil will appear , and the Lord Jesus will kill him with the breath that comes from his mouth and will destroy him with the glory of his coming .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	The Man of Evil will come by the power of Satan . He will have great power , and he will do many different false miracles , signs , and wonders .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	He will use every kind of evil to trick those who are lost . They will die , because they refused to love the truth . ( If they loved the truth , they would be saved . )
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	For this reason God sends them something powerful that leads them away from the truth so they will believe a lie .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	So all those will be judged guilty who did not believe the truth , but enjoyed doing evil . You Are Chosen for Salvation
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	Brothers and sisters , whom the Lord loves , God chose you from the beginning [ c ] to be saved . So we must always thank God for you . You are saved by the Spirit that makes you holy and by your faith in the truth .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	God used the Good News that we preached to call you to be saved so you can share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	So , brothers and sisters , stand strong and continue to believe the teachings we gave you in our speaking and in our letter . 16-17 May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father encourage you and strengthen you in every good thing you do and say .

NCV	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Brothers and sisters , by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ we command you to stay away from any believer who refuses to work and does not follow the teaching we gave you .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	You yourselves know that you should live as we live . We were not lazy when we were with you .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	And when we ate another person ’ s food , we always paid for it . We worked very hard night and day so we would not be an expense to any of you .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	We had the right to ask you to help us , but we worked to take care of ourselves so we would be an example for you to follow .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	When we were with you , we gave you this rule : “ Anyone who refuses to work should not eat. ”
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	We hear that some people in your group refuse to work . They do nothing but busy themselves in other people ’ s lives .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	We command those people and beg them in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and earn their own food .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	But you , brothers and sisters , never become tired of doing good .
NCV	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	If some people do not obey what we tell you in this letter , then take note of them . Have nothing to do with them so they will feel ashamed .

NCV	1%20Timothy	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus , by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , a true child to me because you believe : Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . Warning Against False Teaching
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	3	I asked you to stay longer in Ephesus when I went into Macedonia so you could command some people there to stop teaching false things .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	4	Tell them not to spend their time on stories that are not true and on long lists of names in family histories . These things only bring arguments ; they do not help God ’ s work , which is done in faith .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	5	The purpose of this command is for people to have love , a love that comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a true faith .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	6	Some people have missed these things and turned to useless talk .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	7	They want to be teachers of the law , but they do not understand either what they are talking about or what they are sure about .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good if someone uses it lawfully .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	9	We also know that the law is not made for good people but for those who are against the law and for those who refuse to follow it . It is for people who are against God and are sinful , who are unholy and ungodly , who kill their fathers and mothers , who murder ,
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	10	who take part in sexual sins , who have sexual relations with people of the same sex , who sell slaves , who tell lies , who speak falsely , and who do anything against the true teaching of God .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	11	That teaching is part of the Good News of the blessed God that he gave me to tell . Thanks for God ’ s Mercy
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who gave me strength , because he trusted me and gave me this work of serving him .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	13	In the past I spoke against Christ and persecuted him and did all kinds of things to hurt him . But God showed me mercy , because I did not know what I was doing . I did not believe .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	14	But the grace of our Lord was fully given to me , and with that grace came the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	15	What I say is true , and you should fully accept it : Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , of whom I am the worst .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	16	But I was given mercy so that in me , the worst of all sinners , Christ Jesus could show that he has patience without limit . His patience with me made me an example for those who would believe in him and have life forever .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	17	To the King that rules forever , who will never die , who can not be seen , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	18	Timothy , my child , I am giving you a command that agrees with the prophecies that were given about you in the past . I tell you this so you can follow them and fight the good fight .
NCV	1%20Timothy	1	19	Continue to have faith and do what you know is right . Some people have rejected this , and their faith has been shipwrecked .

NCV	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	2	Pray for rulers and for all who have authority so that we can have quiet and peaceful lives full of worship and respect for God .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	3	This is good , and it pleases God our Savior ,
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	4	who wants all people to be saved and to know the truth .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	5	There is one God and one mediator so that human beings can reach God . That way is through Christ Jesus , who is himself human .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	6	He gave himself as a payment to free all people . He is proof that came at the right time .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	7	That is why I was chosen to tell the Good News and to be an apostle . ( I am telling the truth ; I am not lying . ) I was chosen to teach those who are not Jews to believe and to know the truth .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	8	So , I want the men everywhere to pray , lifting up their hands in a holy manner , without anger and arguments .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	9	Also , women should wear proper clothes that show respect and self-control , not using braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	10	Instead , they should do good deeds , which is right for women who say they worship God .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let a woman learn by listening quietly and being ready to cooperate in everything .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	12	But I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man , but to listen quietly ,
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	13	because Adam was formed first and then Eve .
NCV	1%20Timothy	2	14	And Adam was not tricked , but the woman was tricked and became a sinner .

NCV	1%20Timothy	3	1	Timothy
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	3	He must not drink too much wine or like to fight , but rather be gentle and peaceable , not loving money .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	2	An overseer must not give people a reason to criticize him , and he must have only one wife . He must be self-controlled , wise , respected by others , ready to welcome guests , and able to teach .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	4	He must be a good family leader , having children who cooperate with full respect .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	5	( If someone does not know how to lead the family , how can that person take care of God ’ s church ? )
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	6	But an elder must not be a new believer , or he might be too proud of himself and be judged guilty just as the devil was .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	7	An elder must also have the respect of people who are not in the church so he will not be criticized by others and caught in the devil ’ s trap . Deacons in the Church
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	8	In the same way , deacons must be respected by others , not saying things they do not mean . They must not drink too much wine or try to get rich by cheating others .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	9	With a clear conscience they must follow the secret of the faith that God made known to us .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	10	Test them first . Then let them serve as deacons if you find nothing wrong in them .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	11	In the same way , women [ a ] must be respected by others . They must not speak evil of others . They must be self-controlled and trustworthy in everything .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	12	Deacons must have only one wife and be good leaders of their children and their own families .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	13	Those who serve well as deacons are making an honorable place for themselves , and they will be very bold in their faith in Christ Jesus . The Secret of Our Life
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	14	Although I hope I can come to you soon , I am writing these things to you now .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	15	Then , even if I am delayed , you will know how to live in the family of God . That family is the church of the living God , the support and foundation of the truth .
NCV	1%20Timothy	3	16	Without doubt , the secret of our life of worship is great : He [ b ] was shown to us in a human body , proved right in spirit , and seen by angels .

NCV	1%20Timothy	4	4	Everything God made is good , and nothing should be refused if it is accepted with thanks ,
NCV	1%20Timothy	4	2	Such teachings come from the false words of liars whose consciences are destroyed as if by a hot iron .
NCV	1%20Timothy	4	3	They forbid people to marry and tell them not to eat certain foods which God created to be eaten with thanks by people who believe and know the truth .
NCV	1%20Timothy	4	5	because it is made holy by what God has said and by prayer . Be a Good Servant of Christ
NCV	1%20Timothy	4	6	By telling these things to the brothers and sisters , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus . You will be made strong by the words of the faith and the good teaching which you have been following .
NCV	1%20Timothy	4	7	But do not follow foolish stories that disagree with God ’ s truth , but train yourself to serve God .
NCV	1%20Timothy	4	8	Training your body helps you in some ways , but serving God helps you in every way by bringing you blessings in this life and in the future life , too .

NCV	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	5	The true widow , who is all alone , puts her hope in God and continues to pray night and day for God ’ s help .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	2	older women like mothers , and younger women like sisters . Always treat them in a pure way .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	3	Take care of widows who are truly widows .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , let them first learn to do their duty to their own family and to repay their parents or grandparents . That pleases God .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	6	But the widow who uses her life to please herself is really dead while she is alive .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	7	Tell the believers to do these things so that no one can criticize them .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	8	Whoever does not care for his own relatives , especially his own family members , has turned against the faith and is worse than someone who does not believe in God .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	9	To be on the list of widows , a woman must be at least sixty years old . She must have been faithful to her husband .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	10	She must be known for her good works—works such as raising her children , welcoming strangers , washing the feet of God ’ s people , helping those in trouble , and giving her life to do all kinds of good deeds .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	11	But do not put younger widows on that list . After they give themselves to Christ , they are pulled away from him by their physical desires , and then they want to marry again .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	12	They will be judged for not doing what they first promised to do .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	13	Besides that , they learn to waste their time , going from house to house . And they not only waste their time but also begin to gossip and busy themselves with other people ’ s lives , saying things they should not say .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	14	So I want the younger widows to marry , have children , and manage their homes . Then no enemy will have any reason to criticize them .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	15	But some have already turned away to follow Satan .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family , she should care for them herself . The church should not have to care for them . Then it will be able to take care of those who are truly widows .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	17	The elders who lead the church well should receive double honor , especially those who work hard by speaking and teaching ,
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	18	because the Scripture says : “ When an ox is working in the grain , do not cover its mouth to keep it from eating , ” [ a ] and “ A worker should be given his pay. ” [ b ]
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	19	Do not listen to someone who accuses an elder , without two or three witnesses .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	20	Tell those who continue sinning that they are wrong . Do this in front of the whole church so that the others will have a warning .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	21	Before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels , I command you to do these things without showing favor of any kind to anyone .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	22	Think carefully before you lay your hands on [ c ] anyone , and don ’ t share in the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	23	Stop drinking only water , but drink a little wine to help your stomach and your frequent sicknesses .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some people are easy to see even before they are judged , but the sins of others are seen only later .
NCV	1%20Timothy	5	25	So also good deeds are easy to see , but even those that are not easily seen can not stay hidden .

NCV	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	6	Serving God does make us very rich , if we are satisfied with what we have .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	2	The slaves whose masters are believers should not show their masters any less respect because they are believers . They should serve their masters even better , because they are helping believers they love . You must teach and preach these things . False Teaching and True Riches
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	3	Anyone who has a different teaching does not agree with the true teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that shows the true way to serve God .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	4	This person is full of pride and understands nothing , but is sick with a love for arguing and fighting about words . This brings jealousy , fighting , speaking against others , evil mistrust ,
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	5	and constant quarrels from those who have evil minds and have lost the truth . They think that serving God is a way to get rich .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	7	We brought nothing into the world , so we can take nothing out .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	8	But , if we have food and clothes , we will be satisfied with that .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	9	Those who want to become rich bring temptation to themselves and are caught in a trap . They want many foolish and harmful things that ruin and destroy people .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	10	The love of money causes all kinds of evil . Some people have left the faith , because they wanted to get more money , but they have caused themselves much sorrow . Some Things to Remember
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	11	But you , man of God , run away from all those things . Instead , live in the right way , serve God , have faith , love , patience , and gentleness .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith , grabbing hold of the life that continues forever . You were called to have that life when you confessed the good confession before many witnesses .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	13	In the sight of God , who gives life to everything , and of Christ Jesus , I give you a command . Christ Jesus made the good confession when he stood before Pontius Pilate .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	14	Do what you were commanded to do without wrong or blame until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	15	God will make that happen at the right time . He is the blessed and only Ruler , the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	16	He is the only One who never dies . He lives in light so bright no one can go near it . No one has ever seen God , or can see him . May honor and power belong to God forever . Amen .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	17	Command those who are rich with things of this world not to be proud . Tell them to hope in God , not in their uncertain riches . God richly gives us everything to enjoy .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	18	Tell the rich people to do good , to be rich in doing good deeds , to be generous and ready to share .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	19	By doing that , they will be saving a treasure for themselves as a strong foundation for the future . Then they will be able to have the life that is true life .
NCV	1%20Timothy	6	20	Timothy , guard what God has trusted to you . Stay away from foolish , useless talk and from the arguments of what is falsely called “ knowledge. ”

NCV	2%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , a dear child to me : Grace , mercy , and peace to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . Encouragement for Timothy
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God . God sent me to tell about the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	3	I thank God as I always mention you in my prayers , day and night . I serve him , doing what I know is right as my ancestors did .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	4	Remembering that you cried for me , I want very much to see you so I can be filled with joy .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	5	I remember your true faith . That faith first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice , and I know you now have that same faith .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	6	This is why I remind you to keep using the gift God gave you when I laid my hands on [ a ] you . Now let it grow , as a small flame grows into a fire .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	7	God did not give us a spirit that makes us afraid but a spirit of power and love and self-control .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	8	So do not be ashamed to tell people about our Lord Jesus , and do not be ashamed of me , in prison for the Lord . But suffer with me for the Good News . God , who gives us the strength to do that ,
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	9	saved us and made us his holy people . That was not because of anything we did ourselves but because of God ’ s purpose and grace . That grace was given to us through Christ Jesus before time began ,
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	10	but it is now shown to us by the coming of our Savior Christ Jesus . He destroyed death , and through the Good News he showed us the way to have life that can not be destroyed .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	11	I was chosen to tell that Good News and to be an apostle and a teacher .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	12	I am suffering now because I tell the Good News , but I am not ashamed , because I know Jesus , the One in whom I have believed . And I am sure he is able to protect what he has trusted me with until that day . [ b ]
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	13	Follow the pattern of true teachings that you heard from me in faith and love , which are in Christ Jesus .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	14	Protect the truth that you were given ; protect it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	15	You know that everyone in Asia has left me , even Phygelus and Hermogenes .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	16	May the Lord show mercy to the family of Onesiphorus , who has often helped me and was not ashamed that I was in prison .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	17	When he came to Rome , he looked eagerly for me until he found me .
NCV	2%20Timothy	1	18	May the Lord allow him to find mercy from the Lord on that day . You know how many ways he helped me in Ephesus . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Timothy	2	2	You should teach people whom you can trust the things you and many others have heard me say . Then they will be able to teach others .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	3	Share in the troubles we have like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	4	A soldier wants to please the enlisting officer , so no one serving in the army wastes time with everyday matters .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	5	Also an athlete who takes part in a contest must obey all the rules in order to win .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	6	The farmer who works hard should be the first person to get some of the food that was grown .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	7	Think about what I am saying , because the Lord will give you the ability to understand everything .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ , who was raised from the dead , who is from the family of David . This is the Good News I preach ,
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	9	and I am suffering because of it to the point of being bound with chains like a criminal . But God ’ s teaching is not in chains .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	10	So I patiently accept all these troubles so that those whom God has chosen can have the salvation that is in Christ Jesus . With that salvation comes glory that never ends .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	11	This teaching is true : If we died with him , we will also live with him .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we accept suffering , we will also rule with him . If we say we don ’ t know him , he will say he doesn ’ t know us .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we are not faithful , he will still be faithful , because he must be true to who he is . A Worker Pleasing to God
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	14	Continue teaching these things , warning people in God ’ s presence not to argue about words . It does not help anyone , and it ruins those who listen .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	15	Make every effort to give yourself to God as the kind of person he will approve . Be a worker who is not ashamed and who uses the true teaching in the right way .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	16	Stay away from foolish , useless talk , because that will lead people further away from God .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	17	Their evil teaching will spread like a sickness inside the body . Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	18	They have left the true teaching , saying that the rising from the dead has already taken place , and so they are destroying the faith of some people .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	19	But God ’ s strong foundation continues to stand . These words are written on the seal : “ The Lord knows those who belong to him , ” [ a ] and “ Everyone who wants to belong to the Lord must stop doing wrong. ”
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	20	In a large house there are not only things made of gold and silver , but also things made of wood and clay . Some things are used for special purposes , and others are made for ordinary jobs .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	21	All who make themselves clean from evil will be used for special purposes . They will be made holy , useful to the Master , ready to do any good work .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	22	But run away from the evil desires of youth . Try hard to live right and to have faith , love , and peace , together with those who trust in the Lord from pure hearts .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	23	Stay away from foolish and stupid arguments , because you know they grow into quarrels .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	24	And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone , a good teacher , and patient .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	25	The Lord ’ s servant must gently teach those who disagree . Then maybe God will let them change their minds so they can accept the truth .
NCV	2%20Timothy	2	26	And they may wake up and escape from the trap of the devil , who catches them to do what he wants . Footnotes - 2:19 “ The Lord . . . him. ” Quotation from Numbers 16:5 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Timothy	3	2	because people will love themselves , love money , brag , and be proud . They will say evil things against others and will not obey their parents or be thankful or be the kind of people God wants .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	3	They will not love others , will refuse to forgive , will gossip , and will not control themselves . They will be cruel , will hate what is good ,
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	4	will turn against their friends , and will do foolish things without thinking . They will be conceited , will love pleasure instead of God ,
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	5	and will act as if they serve God but will not have his power . Stay away from those people .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	6	Some of them go into homes and get control of silly women who are full of sin and are led by many evil desires .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	7	These women are always learning new teachings , but they are never able to understand the truth fully .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	8	Just as Jannes and Jambres were against Moses , these people are against the truth . Their thinking has been ruined , and they have failed in trying to follow the faith .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they will not be successful in what they do , because as with Jannes and Jambres , everyone will see that they are foolish . Obey the Teachings
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	10	But you have followed what I teach , the way I live , my goal , faith , patience , and love . You know I never give up .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	11	You know how I have been hurt and have suffered , as in Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . I have suffered , but the Lord saved me from all those troubles .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	12	Everyone who wants to live as God desires , in Christ Jesus , will be persecuted .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	13	But people who are evil and cheat others will go from bad to worse . They will fool others , but they will also be fooling themselves .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	14	But you should continue following the teachings you learned . You know they are true , because you trust those who taught you .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	15	Since you were a child you have known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise . And that wisdom leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
NCV	2%20Timothy	3	16	All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching , for showing people what is wrong in their lives , for correcting faults , and for teaching how to live right .

NCV	2%20Timothy	4	2	Preach the Good News . Be ready at all times , and tell people what they need to do . Tell them when they are wrong . Encourage them with great patience and careful teaching ,
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	4	They will stop listening to the truth and will begin to follow false stories .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	3	because the time will come when people will not listen to the true teaching but will find many more teachers who please them by saying the things they want to hear .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	5	But you should control yourself at all times , accept troubles , do the work of telling the Good News , and complete all the duties of a servant of God .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	6	My life is being given as an offering to God , and the time has come for me to leave this life .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	7	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	8	Now , a crown is being held for me—a crown for being right with God . The Lord , the judge who judges rightly , will give the crown to me on that day [ a ] —not only to me but to all those who have waited with love for him to come again . Personal Words
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	9	Do your best to come to me as soon as you can ,
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	10	because Demas , who loved this world , left me and went to Thessalonica . Crescens went to Galatia , and Titus went to Dalmatia .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	11	Luke is the only one still with me . Get Mark and bring him with you when you come , because he can help me in my work here .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	12	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	13	When I was in Troas , I left my coat there with Carpus . So when you come , bring it to me , along with my books , particularly the ones written on parchment . [ b ]
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	14	Alexander the metalworker did many harmful things against me . The Lord will punish him for what he did .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	15	You also should be careful that he does not hurt you , because he fought strongly against our teaching .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	16	The first time I defended myself , no one helped me ; everyone left me . May they be forgiven .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stayed with me and gave me strength so I could fully tell the Good News to all those who are not Jews . So I was saved from the lion ’ s mouth .
NCV	2%20Timothy	4	18	The Lord will save me when anyone tries to hurt me , and he will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom . Glory forever and ever be the Lord ’ s . Amen . Final Greetings

NCV	Titus	1	1	From Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I was sent to help the faith of God ’ s chosen people and to help them know the truth that shows people how to serve God .
NCV	Titus	1	2	That faith and that knowledge come from the hope for life forever , which God promised to us before time began . And God can not lie .
NCV	Titus	1	3	At the right time God let the world know about that life through preaching . He trusted me with that work , and I preached by the command of God our Savior .
NCV	Titus	1	4	To Titus , my true child in the faith we share : Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior . Titus ’ Work in Crete
NCV	Titus	1	5	I left you in Crete so you could finish doing the things that still needed to be done and so you could appoint elders in every town , as I directed you .
NCV	Titus	1	6	An elder must not be guilty of doing wrong , must have only one wife , and must have believing children . They must not be known as children who are wild and do not cooperate .
NCV	Titus	1	7	As God ’ s managers , overseers must not be guilty of doing wrong , being selfish , or becoming angry quickly . They must not drink too much wine , like to fight , or try to get rich by cheating others .
NCV	Titus	1	8	Overseers must be ready to welcome guests , love what is good , be wise , live right , and be holy and self-controlled .
NCV	Titus	1	9	By holding on to the trustworthy word just as we teach it , overseers can help people by using true teaching , and they can show those who are against the true teaching that they are wrong .
NCV	Titus	1	10	There are many people who refuse to cooperate , who talk about worthless things and lead others into the wrong way—mainly those who insist on circumcision to be saved .
NCV	Titus	1	11	These people must be stopped , because they are upsetting whole families by teaching things they should not teach , which they do to get rich by cheating people .
NCV	Titus	1	12	Even one of their own prophets said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil animals , and lazy people who do nothing but eat. ”
NCV	Titus	1	13	The words that prophet said are true . So firmly tell those people they are wrong so they may become strong in the faith ,
NCV	Titus	1	14	not accepting Jewish false stories and the commands of people who reject the truth .
NCV	Titus	1	15	To those who are pure , all things are pure , but to those who are full of sin and do not believe , nothing is pure . Both their minds and their consciences have been ruined .

NCV	Titus	2	2	Teach older men to be self-controlled , serious , wise , strong in faith , in love , and in patience .
NCV	Titus	2	3	In the same way , teach older women to be holy in their behavior , not speaking against others or enslaved to too much wine , but teaching what is good .
NCV	Titus	2	4	Then they can teach the young women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
NCV	Titus	2	5	to be wise and pure , to be good workers at home , to be kind , and to yield to their husbands . Then no one will be able to criticize the teaching God gave us .
NCV	Titus	2	6	In the same way , encourage young men to be wise .
NCV	Titus	2	7	In every way be an example of doing good deeds . When you teach , do it with honesty and seriousness .
NCV	Titus	2	8	Speak the truth so that you can not be criticized . Then those who are against you will be ashamed because there is nothing bad to say about us .
NCV	Titus	2	9	Slaves should yield to their own masters at all times , trying to please them and not arguing with them .
NCV	Titus	2	10	They should not steal from them but should show their masters they can be fully trusted so that in everything they do they will make the teaching of God our Savior attractive .
NCV	Titus	2	11	That is the way we should live , because God ’ s grace that can save everyone has come .
NCV	Titus	2	12	It teaches us not to live against God nor to do the evil things the world wants to do . Instead , that grace teaches us to live in the present age in a wise and right way and in a way that shows we serve God .
NCV	Titus	2	13	We should live like that while we wait for our great hope and the coming of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ .
NCV	Titus	2	14	He gave himself for us so he might pay the price to free us from all evil and to make us pure people who belong only to him—people who are always wanting to do good deeds .

NCV	Titus	3	3	In the past we also were foolish . We did not obey , we were wrong , and we were slaves to many things our bodies wanted and enjoyed . We spent our lives doing evil and being jealous . People hated us , and we hated each other .
NCV	Titus	3	2	to speak no evil about anyone , to live in peace , and to be gentle and polite to all people .
NCV	Titus	3	4	But when the kindness and love of God our Savior was shown ,
NCV	Titus	3	5	he saved us because of his mercy . It was not because of good deeds we did to be right with him . He saved us through the washing that made us new people through the Holy Spirit .
NCV	Titus	3	6	God poured out richly upon us that Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ our Savior .
NCV	Titus	3	7	Being made right with God by his grace , we could have the hope of receiving the life that never ends .
NCV	Titus	3	8	This teaching is true , and I want you to be sure the people understand these things . Then those who believe in God will be careful to use their lives for doing good . These things are good and will help everyone .
NCV	Titus	3	9	But stay away from those who have foolish arguments and talk about useless family histories and argue and quarrel about the law . Those things are worth nothing and will not help anyone .
NCV	Titus	3	10	After a first and second warning , avoid someone who causes arguments .
NCV	Titus	3	11	You can know that such people are evil and sinful ; their own sins prove them wrong . Some Things to Remember
NCV	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis , because I have decided to stay there this winter .
NCV	Titus	3	13	Do all you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey so that they have everything they need .
NCV	Titus	3	14	Our people must learn to use their lives for doing good deeds to provide what is necessary so that their lives will not be useless .

NCV	Philemon	1	7	I have great joy and comfort , my brother , because the love you have shown to God ’ s people has refreshed them . Accept Onesimus as a Brother
NCV	Philemon	1	8	So , in Christ , I could be bold and order you to do what is right .
NCV	Philemon	1	9	But because I love you , I am pleading with you instead . I , Paul , an old man now and also a prisoner for Christ Jesus ,
NCV	Philemon	1	10	am pleading with you for my child Onesimus , who became my child while I was in prison .
NCV	Philemon	1	11	In the past he was useless to you , but now he has become useful for both you and me .
NCV	Philemon	1	12	I am sending him back to you , and with him I am sending my own heart .
NCV	Philemon	1	13	I wanted to keep him with me so that in your place he might help me while I am in prison for the Good News .
NCV	Philemon	1	14	But I did not want to do anything without asking you first so that any good you do for me will be because you want to do it , not because I forced you .
NCV	Philemon	1	15	Maybe Onesimus was separated from you for a short time so you could have him back forever—
NCV	Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave , but better than a slave , as a loved brother . I love him very much , but you will love him even more , both as a person and as a believer in the Lord .
NCV	Philemon	1	17	So if you consider me your partner , welcome Onesimus as you would welcome me .
NCV	Philemon	1	18	If he has done anything wrong to you or if he owes you anything , charge that to me .
NCV	Philemon	1	19	I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand . I will pay it back , and I will say nothing about what you owe me for your own life .
NCV	Philemon	1	20	So , my brother , I ask that you do this for me in the Lord : Refresh my heart in Christ .
NCV	Philemon	1	21	I write this letter , knowing that you will do what I ask you and even more .
NCV	Philemon	1	22	One more thing—prepare a room for me in which to stay , because I hope God will answer your prayers and I will be able to come to you . Final Greetings
NCV	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras , a prisoner with me for Christ Jesus , sends greetings to you .
NCV	Philemon	1	24	And also Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , workers together with me , send greetings .

NCV	Hebrews	1	1	In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets many times and in many different ways .
NCV	Hebrews	1	2	Samuel 7:14
NCV	Hebrews	1	3	The Son reflects the glory of God and shows exactly what God is like . He holds everything together with his powerful word . When the Son made people clean from their sins , he sat down at the right side of God , the Great One in heaven .
NCV	Hebrews	1	4	The Son became much greater than the angels , and God gave him a name that is much greater than theirs .
NCV	Hebrews	1	5	This is because God never said to any of the angels , “ You are my Son . Today I have become your Father. ” Psalm 2:7 Nor did God say of any angel , “ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son. ”
NCV	Hebrews	1	6	And when God brings his firstborn Son into the world , he says , “ Let all God ’ s angels worship him. ” [ a ] Psalm 97:7
NCV	Hebrews	1	7	This is what God said about the angels : “ God makes his angels become like winds . He makes his servants become like flames of fire. ” Psalm 104:4
NCV	Hebrews	1	8	But God said this about his Son : “ God , your throne will last forever and ever . You will rule your kingdom with fairness .
NCV	Hebrews	1	9	You love right and hate evil , so God has chosen you from among your friends ; he has set you apart with much joy. ” Psalm 45:6–7
NCV	Hebrews	1	10	God also says , “ Lord , in the beginning you made the earth , and your hands made the skies .
NCV	Hebrews	1	11	They will be destroyed , but you will remain . They will all wear out like clothes .
NCV	Hebrews	1	12	You will fold them like a coat . And , like clothes , you will change them . But you never change , and your life will never end. ” Psalm 102:25–27
NCV	Hebrews	1	13	And God never said this to an angel : “ Sit by me at my right side until I put your enemies under your control. ” [ b ] Psalm 110:1
NCV	Hebrews	1	14	All the angels are spirits who serve God and are sent to help those who will receive salvation .

NCV	Hebrews	2	2	The teaching God spoke through angels was shown to be true , and anyone who did not follow it or obey it received the punishment that was earned .
NCV	Hebrews	2	3	So surely we also will be punished if we ignore this great salvation . The Lord himself first told about this salvation , and those who heard him testified it was true .
NCV	Hebrews	2	4	God also testified to the truth of the message by using wonders , great signs , many kinds of miracles , and by giving people gifts through the Holy Spirit , just as he wanted . Christ Became like Humans
NCV	Hebrews	2	5	God did not choose angels to be the rulers of the new world that was coming , which is what we have been talking about .
NCV	Hebrews	2	6	It is written in the Scriptures , “ Why are people even important to you ? Why do you take care of human beings ?
NCV	Hebrews	2	7	You made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor . [ a ]
NCV	Hebrews	2	8	You put all things under their control. ” Psalm 8:4–6 When God put everything under their control , there was nothing left that they did not rule . Still , we do not yet see them ruling over everything .
NCV	Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus , who for a short time was made lower than the angels . And now he is wearing a crown of glory and honor because he suffered and died . And by God ’ s grace , he died for everyone .
NCV	Hebrews	2	10	God is the One who made all things , and all things are for his glory . He wanted to have many children share his glory , so he made the One who leads people to salvation perfect through suffering .
NCV	Hebrews	2	11	Jesus , who makes people holy , and those who are made holy are from the same family . So he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters .
NCV	Hebrews	2	12	He says , “ Then , I will tell my brothers and sisters about you ; I will praise you in the public meeting. ” Psalm 22:22
NCV	Hebrews	2	13	He also says , “ I will trust in God. ” Isaiah 8:17 And he also says , “ I am here , and with me are the children God has given me. ” Isaiah 8:18
NCV	Hebrews	2	14	Since these children are people with physical bodies , Jesus himself became like them . He did this so that , by dying , he could destroy the one who has the power of death—the devil—
NCV	Hebrews	2	15	and free those who were like slaves all their lives because of their fear of death .
NCV	Hebrews	2	16	Clearly , it is not angels that Jesus helps , but the people who are from Abraham . [ b ]
NCV	Hebrews	2	17	For this reason Jesus had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every way so he could be their merciful and faithful high priest in service to God . Then Jesus could die in their place to take away their sins .
NCV	Hebrews	2	18	And now he can help those who are tempted , because he himself suffered and was tempted . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Hebrews	3	3	Jesus has more honor than Moses , just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself .
NCV	Hebrews	3	2	Jesus was faithful to God as Moses was in God ’ s family .
NCV	Hebrews	3	4	Every house is built by someone , but the builder of everything is God himself .
NCV	Hebrews	3	5	Moses was faithful in God ’ s family as a servant , and he told what God would say in the future .
NCV	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ is faithful as a Son over God ’ s house . And we are God ’ s house if we confidently maintain our hope . We Must Continue to Follow God
NCV	Hebrews	3	7	So it is as the Holy Spirit says : “ Today listen to what he says .
NCV	Hebrews	3	8	Do not be stubborn as in the past when you turned against God , when you tested God in the desert .
NCV	Hebrews	3	9	There your ancestors tried me and tested me and saw the things I did for forty years .
NCV	Hebrews	3	10	I was angry with them . I said , ‘ They are not loyal to me and have not understood my ways. ’
NCV	Hebrews	3	11	I was angry and made a promise , ‘ They will never enter my rest. ’ ” [ a ] Psalm 95:7–11
NCV	Hebrews	3	12	So brothers and sisters , be careful that none of you has an evil , unbelieving heart that will turn you away from the living God .
NCV	Hebrews	3	13	But encourage each other every day while it is “ today. ” [ b ] Help each other so none of you will become hardened because sin has tricked you .
NCV	Hebrews	3	14	We all share in Christ if we keep till the end the sure faith we had in the beginning .
NCV	Hebrews	3	15	This is what the Scripture says : “ Today listen to what he says . Do not be stubborn as in the past when you turned against God. ” Psalm 95:7–8
NCV	Hebrews	3	16	Who heard God ’ s voice and was against him ? It was all those people Moses led out of Egypt .
NCV	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was God angry for forty years ? He was angry with those who sinned , who died in the desert .
NCV	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom was God talking when he promised that they would never enter his rest ? He was talking to those who did not obey him .
NCV	Hebrews	3	19	So we see they were not allowed to enter and have God ’ s rest , because they did not believe . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Hebrews	3	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Hebrews	4	4	In the Scriptures he talked about the seventh day of the week : “ And on the seventh day God rested from all his works. ” [ b ]
NCV	Hebrews	4	2	The Good News was preached to us just as it was to them . But the teaching they heard did not help them , because they heard it but did not accept it with faith . [ a ]
NCV	Hebrews	4	3	We who have believed are able to enter and have God ’ s rest . As God has said , “ I was angry and made a promise , ‘ They will never enter my rest. ’ ” Psalm 95:11 But God ’ s work was finished from the time he made the world .
NCV	Hebrews	4	5	And again in the Scripture God said , “ They will never enter my rest. ”
NCV	Hebrews	4	6	It is still true that some people will enter God ’ s rest , but those who first heard the way to be saved did not enter , because they did not obey .
NCV	Hebrews	4	7	So God planned another day , called “ today. ” He spoke about that day through David a long time later in the same Scripture used before : “ Today listen to what he says . Do not be stubborn. ” Psalm 95:7–8
NCV	Hebrews	4	8	We know that Joshua [ c ] did not lead the people into that rest , because God spoke later about another day .
NCV	Hebrews	4	9	This shows that the rest [ d ] for God ’ s people is still coming .
NCV	Hebrews	4	10	Anyone who enters God ’ s rest will rest from his work as God did .
NCV	Hebrews	4	11	Let us try as hard as we can to enter God ’ s rest so that no one will fail by following the example of those who refused to obey .
NCV	Hebrews	4	12	God ’ s word is alive and working and is sharper than a double-edged sword . It cuts all the way into us , where the soul and the spirit are joined , to the center of our joints and bones . And it judges the thoughts and feelings in our hearts .
NCV	Hebrews	4	13	Nothing in all the world can be hidden from God . Everything is clear and lies open before him , and to him we must explain the way we have lived . Jesus Is Our High Priest
NCV	Hebrews	4	14	Since we have a great high priest , Jesus the Son of God , who has gone into heaven , let us hold on to the faith we have .
NCV	Hebrews	4	15	For our high priest is able to understand our weaknesses . He was tempted in every way that we are , but he did not sin .
NCV	Hebrews	4	16	Let us , then , feel very sure that we can come before God ’ s throne where there is grace . There we can receive mercy and grace to help us when we need it .

NCV	Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ did not choose himself to have the honor of being a high priest , but God chose him . God said to him , “ You are my Son . Today I have become your Father. ” Psalm 2:7
NCV	Hebrews	5	2	Since he himself is weak , he is able to be gentle with those who do not understand and who are doing wrong things .
NCV	Hebrews	5	3	Because he is weak , the high priest must offer sacrifices for his own sins and also for the sins of the people .
NCV	Hebrews	5	4	To be a high priest is an honor , but no one chooses himself for this work . He must be called by God as Aaron [ a ] was .
NCV	Hebrews	5	6	And in another Scripture God says , “ You are a priest forever , a priest like Melchizedek. ” [ b ] Psalm 110:4
NCV	Hebrews	5	7	While Jesus lived on earth , he prayed to God and asked God for help . He prayed with loud cries and tears to the One who could save him from death , and his prayer was heard because he trusted God .
NCV	Hebrews	5	8	Even though Jesus was the Son of God , he learned obedience by what he suffered .
NCV	Hebrews	5	9	And because his obedience was perfect , he was able to give eternal salvation to all who obey him .
NCV	Hebrews	5	10	In this way God made Jesus a high priest , a priest like Melchizedek . Warning Against Falling Away
NCV	Hebrews	5	11	We have much to say about this , but it is hard to explain because you are so slow to understand .
NCV	Hebrews	5	12	By now you should be teachers , but you need someone to teach you again the first lessons of God ’ s message . You still need the teaching that is like milk . You are not ready for solid food .
NCV	Hebrews	5	13	Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and knows nothing about right teaching .
NCV	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for those who are grown up . They are mature enough to know the difference between good and evil .

NCV	Hebrews	6	6	But they fell away from Christ . It is impossible to bring them back to a changed life again , because they are nailing the Son of God to a cross again and are shaming him in front of others .
NCV	Hebrews	6	2	We should not return to the teaching about baptisms , [ a ] about laying on of hands , [ b ] about the raising of the dead and eternal judgment .
NCV	Hebrews	6	3	And we will go on to grown-up teaching if God allows .
NCV	Hebrews	6	4	Some people can not be brought back again to a changed life . They were once in God ’ s light , and enjoyed heaven ’ s gift , and shared in the Holy Spirit .
NCV	Hebrews	6	5	They found out how good God ’ s word is , and they received the powers of his new world .
NCV	Hebrews	6	7	Some people are like land that gets plenty of rain . The land produces a good crop for those who work it , and it receives God ’ s blessings .
NCV	Hebrews	6	8	Other people are like land that grows thorns and weeds and is worthless . It is about to be cursed by God and will be destroyed by fire .
NCV	Hebrews	6	9	Dear friends , we are saying this to you , but we really expect better things from you that will lead to your salvation .
NCV	Hebrews	6	10	God is fair ; he will not forget the work you did and the love you showed for him by helping his people . And he will remember that you are still helping them .
NCV	Hebrews	6	11	We want each of you to go on with the same hard work all your lives so you will surely get what you hope for .
NCV	Hebrews	6	12	We do not want you to become lazy . Be like those who through faith and patience will receive what God has promised .
NCV	Hebrews	6	13	God made a promise to Abraham . And as there is no one greater than God , he used himself when he swore to Abraham ,
NCV	Hebrews	6	14	saying , “ I will surely bless you and give you many descendants. ” [ c ]
NCV	Hebrews	6	15	Abraham waited patiently for this to happen , and he received what God promised .
NCV	Hebrews	6	16	People always use the name of someone greater than themselves when they swear . The oath proves that what they say is true , and this ends all arguing .
NCV	Hebrews	6	17	God wanted to prove that his promise was true to those who would get what he promised . And he wanted them to understand clearly that his purposes never change , so he made an oath .
NCV	Hebrews	6	18	These two things can not change : God can not lie when he makes a promise , and he can not lie when he makes an oath . These things encourage us who came to God for safety . They give us strength to hold on to the hope we have been given .
NCV	Hebrews	6	19	We have this hope as an anchor for the soul , sure and strong . It enters behind the curtain in the Most Holy Place in heaven ,
NCV	Hebrews	6	20	where Jesus has gone ahead of us and for us . He has become the high priest forever , a priest like Melchizedek .

NCV	Hebrews	7	7	Now everyone knows that the more important person blesses the less important person .
NCV	Hebrews	7	2	and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had brought back from the battle . First , Melchizedek ’ s name means “ king of goodness , ” and he is king of Salem , which means “ king of peace. ”
NCV	Hebrews	7	3	No one knows who Melchizedek ’ s father or mother was , [ b ] where he came from , when he was born , or when he died . Melchizedek is like the Son of God ; he continues being a priest forever .
NCV	Hebrews	7	4	You can see how great Melchizedek was . Abraham , the great father , gave him a tenth of everything that he won in battle .
NCV	Hebrews	7	5	Now the law says that those in the tribe of Levi who become priests must collect a tenth from the people—their own people—even though the priests and the people are from the family of Abraham .
NCV	Hebrews	7	6	Melchizedek was not from the tribe of Levi , but he collected a tenth from Abraham . And he blessed Abraham , the man who had God ’ s promises .
NCV	Hebrews	7	8	Priests receive a tenth , even though they are only men who live and then die . But Melchizedek , who received a tenth from Abraham , continues living , as the Scripture says .
NCV	Hebrews	7	9	We might even say that Levi , who receives a tenth , also paid it when Abraham paid Melchizedek a tenth .
NCV	Hebrews	7	10	Levi was not yet born , but he was in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham .
NCV	Hebrews	7	11	The people were given the law [ c ] concerning the system of priests from the tribe of Levi , but they could not be made perfect through that system . So there was a need for another priest to come , a priest like Melchizedek , not Aaron .
NCV	Hebrews	7	12	And when a different kind of priest comes , the law must be changed , too .
NCV	Hebrews	7	13	We are saying these things about Christ , who belonged to a different tribe . No one from that tribe ever served as a priest at the altar .
NCV	Hebrews	7	14	It is clear that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah , and Moses said nothing about priests belonging to that tribe . Jesus Is like Melchizedek
NCV	Hebrews	7	15	And this becomes even more clear when we see that another priest comes who is like Melchizedek . [ d ]
NCV	Hebrews	7	16	He was not made a priest by human rules and laws but through the power of his life , which continues forever .
NCV	Hebrews	7	17	It is said about him , “ You are a priest forever , a priest like Melchizedek. ” Psalm 110:4
NCV	Hebrews	7	18	The old rule is now set aside , because it was weak and useless .
NCV	Hebrews	7	19	The law of Moses could not make anything perfect . But now a better hope has been given to us , and with this hope we can come near to God .
NCV	Hebrews	7	20	It is important that God did this with an oath . Others became priests without an oath ,
NCV	Hebrews	7	21	but Christ became a priest with God ’ s oath . God said : “ The Lord has made a promise and will not change his mind . ‘ You are a priest forever. ’ ” Psalm 110:4
NCV	Hebrews	7	22	This means that Jesus is the guarantee of a better agreement [ e ] from God to his people .
NCV	Hebrews	7	23	When one of the other priests died , he could not continue being a priest . So there were many priests .
NCV	Hebrews	7	24	But because Jesus lives forever , he will never stop serving as priest .
NCV	Hebrews	7	25	So he is able always to save those who come to God through him because he always lives , asking God to help them .
NCV	Hebrews	7	26	Jesus is the kind of high priest we need . He is holy , sinless , pure , not influenced by sinners , and he is raised above the heavens .
NCV	Hebrews	7	27	He is not like the other priests who had to offer sacrifices every day , first for their own sins , and then for the sins of the people . Christ offered his sacrifice only once and for all time when he offered himself .
NCV	Hebrews	7	28	The law chooses high priests who are people with weaknesses , but the word of God ’ s oath came later than the law . It made God ’ s Son to be the high priest , and that Son has been made perfect forever . Footnotes - 7:1 Melchizedek A priest and king who lived in the time of Abraham .

NCV	Hebrews	8	8	But God found something wrong with his people . He says : [ c ] “ Look , the time is coming , says the Lord , when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and the people of Judah .
NCV	Hebrews	8	2	Our high priest serves in the Most Holy Place , the true place of worship that was made by God , not by humans .
NCV	Hebrews	8	3	Every high priest has the work of offering gifts and sacrifices to God . So our high priest must also offer something to God .
NCV	Hebrews	8	4	If our high priest were now living on earth , he would not be a priest , because there are already priests here who follow the law by offering gifts to God .
NCV	Hebrews	8	5	The work they do as priests is only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven . This is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the Holy Tent : “ Be very careful to make everything by the plan I showed you on the mountain. ” [ a ]
NCV	Hebrews	8	6	But the priestly work that has been given to Jesus is much greater than the work that was given to the other priests . In the same way , the new agreement that Jesus brought from God to his people is much greater than the old one . And the new agreement is based on promises of better things .
NCV	Hebrews	8	7	If there had been nothing wrong with the first agreement , [ b ] there would have been no need for a second agreement .
NCV	Hebrews	8	9	It will not be like the agreement I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of Egypt . But they broke that agreement , and I turned away from them , says the Lord .
NCV	Hebrews	8	10	This is the agreement I will make with the people of Israel at that time , says the Lord . I will put my teachings in their minds and write them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
NCV	Hebrews	8	11	People will no longer have to teach their neighbors and relatives to know the Lord , because all people will know me , from the least to the most important .

NCV	Hebrews	9	9	This is an example for the present time . It shows that the gifts and sacrifices offered can not make the conscience of the worshiper perfect .
NCV	Hebrews	9	2	The Holy Tent was set up for this . The first area in the Tent was called the Holy Place . In it were the lamp and the table with the bread that was made holy for God .
NCV	Hebrews	9	3	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place .
NCV	Hebrews	9	4	In it was a golden altar for burning incense and the Ark covered with gold that held the old agreement . Inside this Ark was a golden jar of manna , Aaron ’ s rod that once grew leaves , and the stone tablets of the old agreement .
NCV	Hebrews	9	5	Above the Ark were the creatures that showed God ’ s glory , whose wings reached over the lid . But we can not tell everything about these things now .
NCV	Hebrews	9	6	When everything in the Tent was made ready in this way , the priests went into the first room every day to worship .
NCV	Hebrews	9	7	But only the high priest could go into the second room , and he did that only once a year . He could never enter the inner room without taking blood with him , which he offered to God for himself and for sins the people did without knowing they did them .
NCV	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Spirit uses this to show that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the system of the old Holy Tent was still being used .
NCV	Hebrews	9	10	These gifts and sacrifices were only about food and drink and special washings . They were rules for the body , to be followed until the time of God ’ s new way . The New Agreement
NCV	Hebrews	9	11	But when Christ came as the high priest of the good things we now have , [ b ] he entered the greater and more perfect tent . It is not made by humans and does not belong to this world .
NCV	Hebrews	9	12	Christ entered the Most Holy Place only once—and for all time . He did not take with him the blood of goats and calves . His sacrifice was his own blood , and by it he set us free from sin forever .
NCV	Hebrews	9	13	The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow are sprinkled on the people who are unclean , and this makes their bodies clean again .
NCV	Hebrews	9	14	How much more is done by the blood of Christ . He offered himself through the eternal Spirit [ c ] as a perfect sacrifice to God . His blood will make our consciences pure from useless acts so we may serve the living God .

NCV	Hebrews	9	16	When there is a will , [ d ] it must be proven that the one who wrote that will is dead .
NCV	Hebrews	9	17	A will means nothing while the person is alive ; it can be used only after the person dies .
NCV	Hebrews	9	18	This is why even the first agreement could not begin without blood to show death .
NCV	Hebrews	9	19	First , Moses told all the people every command in the law . Next he took the blood of calves and mixed it with water . Then he used red wool and a branch of the hyssop plant to sprinkle it on the book of the law and on all the people .
NCV	Hebrews	9	20	He said , “ This is the blood that begins the Agreement that God commanded you to obey. ” [ e ]
NCV	Hebrews	9	21	In the same way , Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent and over all the things used in worship .
NCV	Hebrews	9	22	The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood , and sins can not be forgiven without blood to show death . Christ ’ s Death Takes Away Sins
NCV	Hebrews	9	23	So the copies of the real things in heaven had to be made clean by animal sacrifices . But the real things in heaven need much better sacrifices .
NCV	Hebrews	9	24	Christ did not go into the Most Holy Place made by humans , which is only a copy of the real one . He went into heaven itself and is there now before God to help us .
NCV	Hebrews	9	25	The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year with blood that is not his own . But Christ did not offer himself many times .
NCV	Hebrews	9	26	Then he would have had to suffer many times since the world was made . But Christ came only once and for all time at just the right time to take away all sin by sacrificing himself .
NCV	Hebrews	9	27	Just as everyone must die once and then be judged ,
NCV	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people . And he will come a second time , not to offer himself for sin , but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him .

NCV	Hebrews	9	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Hebrews	10	10	And because of this , we are made holy through the sacrifice Christ made in his body once and for all time .
NCV	Hebrews	10	2	If the law could make them perfect , the sacrifices would have already stopped . The worshipers would be made clean , and they would no longer have a sense of sin .
NCV	Hebrews	10	3	But these sacrifices remind them of their sins every year ,
NCV	Hebrews	10	4	because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
NCV	Hebrews	10	5	So when Christ came into the world , he said : “ You do not want sacrifices and offerings , but you have prepared a body for me .
NCV	Hebrews	10	6	You do not ask for burnt offerings and offerings to take away sins .
NCV	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , ‘ Look , I have come . It is written about me in the book . God , I have come to do what you want. ’ ” Psalm 40:6–8
NCV	Hebrews	10	8	In this Scripture he first said , “ You do not want sacrifices and offerings . You do not ask for burnt offerings and offerings to take away sins. ” ( These are all sacrifices that the law commands . )
NCV	Hebrews	10	9	Then he said , “ Look , I have come to do what you want. ” God ends the first system of sacrifices so he can set up the new system .
NCV	Hebrews	10	11	Every day the priests stand and do their religious service , often offering the same sacrifices . Those sacrifices can never take away sins .
NCV	Hebrews	10	12	But after Christ offered one sacrifice for sins , forever , he sat down at the right side of God .
NCV	Hebrews	10	13	And now Christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power .
NCV	Hebrews	10	14	With one sacrifice he made perfect forever those who are being made holy .
NCV	Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also tells us about this . First he says :
NCV	Hebrews	10	16	“ This is the agreement [ a ] I will make with them at that time , says the Lord . I will put my teachings in their hearts and write them on their minds. ” Jeremiah 31:33
NCV	Hebrews	10	17	Then he says : “ Their sins and the evil things they do— I will not remember anymore. ” Jeremiah 31:34
NCV	Hebrews	10	18	Now when these have been forgiven , there is no more need for a sacrifice for sins . Continue to Trust God
NCV	Hebrews	10	19	So , brothers and sisters , we are completely free to enter the Most Holy Place without fear because of the blood of Jesus ’ death .
NCV	Hebrews	10	20	We can enter through a new and living way that Jesus opened for us . It leads through the curtain—Christ ’ s body .
NCV	Hebrews	10	21	And since we have a great priest over God ’ s house ,
NCV	Hebrews	10	22	let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith , because we have been made free from a guilty conscience , and our bodies have been washed with pure water .
NCV	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold firmly to the hope that we have confessed , because we can trust God to do what he promised .
NCV	Hebrews	10	24	Let us think about each other and help each other to show love and do good deeds .
NCV	Hebrews	10	25	You should not stay away from the church meetings , as some are doing , but you should meet together and encourage each other . Do this even more as you see the day [ b ] coming .
NCV	Hebrews	10	26	If we decide to go on sinning after we have learned the truth , there is no longer any sacrifice for sins .
NCV	Hebrews	10	27	There is nothing but fear in waiting for the judgment and the terrible fire that will destroy all those who live against God .
NCV	Hebrews	10	28	Anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was found guilty from the proof given by two or three witnesses . He was put to death without mercy .
NCV	Hebrews	10	29	So what do you think should be done to those who do not respect the Son of God , who look at the blood of the agreement that made them holy as no different from others ’ blood , who insult the Spirit of God ’ s grace ? Surely they should have a much worse punishment .
NCV	Hebrews	10	30	We know that God said , “ I will punish those who do wrong ; I will repay them. ” [ c ] And he also said , “ The Lord will judge his people. ” [ d ]
NCV	Hebrews	10	31	It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
NCV	Hebrews	10	32	Remember those days in the past when you first learned the truth . You had a hard struggle with many sufferings , but you continued strong .
NCV	Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes you were hurt and attacked before crowds of people , and sometimes you shared with those who were being treated that way .
NCV	Hebrews	10	34	You helped the prisoners . You even had joy when all that you owned was taken from you , because you knew you had something better and more lasting .
NCV	Hebrews	10	35	So do not lose the courage you had in the past , which has a great reward .
NCV	Hebrews	10	36	You must hold on , so you can do what God wants and receive what he has promised .
NCV	Hebrews	10	37	For in a very short time , “ The One who is coming will come and will not be delayed .
NCV	Hebrews	10	38	Those who are right with me will live by faith . But if they turn back with fear , I will not be pleased with them. ” Habakkuk 2:3–4
NCV	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not those who turn back and are lost . We are people who have faith and are saved . Footnotes - 10:16 agreement God gives a contract or agreement to his people .

NCV	Hebrews	11	11	He was too old to have children , and Sarah could not have children . It was by faith that Abraham was made able to become a father , because he trusted God to do what he had promised . [ b ]
NCV	Hebrews	11	2	Faith is the reason we remember great people who lived in the past .
NCV	Hebrews	11	3	It is by faith we understand that the whole world was made by God ’ s command so what we see was made by something that can not be seen .
NCV	Hebrews	11	4	It was by faith that Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did . God said he was pleased with the gifts Abel offered and called Abel a good man because of his faith . Abel died , but through his faith he is still speaking .
NCV	Hebrews	11	5	It was by faith that Enoch was taken to heaven so he would not die . He could not be found , because God had taken him away . Before he was taken , the Scripture says that he was a man who truly pleased God .
NCV	Hebrews	11	6	Without faith no one can please God . Anyone who comes to God must believe that he is real and that he rewards those who truly want to find him .
NCV	Hebrews	11	7	It was by faith that Noah heard God ’ s warnings about things he could not yet see . He obeyed God and built a large boat to save his family . By his faith , Noah showed that the world was wrong , and he became one of those who are made right with God through faith .
NCV	Hebrews	11	8	It was by faith Abraham obeyed God ’ s call to go to another place God promised to give him . He left his own country , not knowing where he was to go .
NCV	Hebrews	11	9	It was by faith that he lived like a foreigner in the country God promised to give him . He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob , who had received that same promise from God .
NCV	Hebrews	11	10	Abraham was waiting for the city [ a ] that has real foundations—the city planned and built by God .
NCV	Hebrews	11	12	This man was so old he was almost dead , but from him came as many descendants as there are stars in the sky . Like the sand on the seashore , they could not be counted .
NCV	Hebrews	11	13	All these great people died in faith . They did not get the things that God promised his people , but they saw them coming far in the future and were glad . They said they were like visitors and strangers on earth .
NCV	Hebrews	11	14	When people say such things , they show they are looking for a country that will be their own .
NCV	Hebrews	11	15	If they had been thinking about the country they had left , they could have gone back .
NCV	Hebrews	11	16	But they were waiting for a better country—a heavenly country . So God is not ashamed to be called their God , because he has prepared a city for them .
NCV	Hebrews	11	17	It was by faith that Abraham , when God tested him , offered his son Isaac as a sacrifice . God made the promises to Abraham , but Abraham was ready to offer his own son as a sacrifice .
NCV	Hebrews	11	18	God had said , “ The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac. ” [ c ]
NCV	Hebrews	11	19	Abraham believed that God could raise the dead , and really , it was as if Abraham got Isaac back from death .
NCV	Hebrews	11	20	It was by faith that Isaac blessed the future of Jacob and Esau .
NCV	Hebrews	11	21	It was by faith that Jacob , as he was dying , blessed each one of Joseph ’ s sons . Then he worshiped as he leaned on the top of his walking stick .
NCV	Hebrews	11	22	It was by faith that Joseph , while he was dying , spoke about the Israelites leaving Egypt and gave instructions about what to do with his body .
NCV	Hebrews	11	23	It was by faith that Moses ’ parents hid him for three months after he was born . They saw that Moses was a beautiful baby , and they were not afraid to disobey the king ’ s order .
NCV	Hebrews	11	24	It was by faith that Moses , when he grew up , refused to be called the son of the king of Egypt ’ s daughter .
NCV	Hebrews	11	25	He chose to suffer with God ’ s people instead of enjoying sin for a short time .
NCV	Hebrews	11	26	He thought it was better to suffer for the Christ than to have all the treasures of Egypt , because he was looking for God ’ s reward .
NCV	Hebrews	11	27	It was by faith that Moses left Egypt and was not afraid of the king ’ s anger . Moses continued strong as if he could see the God that no one can see .
NCV	Hebrews	11	28	It was by faith that Moses prepared the Passover and spread the blood on the doors so the one who brings death would not kill the firstborn sons of Israel .
NCV	Hebrews	11	29	It was by faith that the people crossed the Red Sea as if it were dry land . But when the Egyptians tried it , they were drowned .
NCV	Hebrews	11	30	It was by faith that the walls of Jericho fell after the people had marched around them for seven days .
NCV	Hebrews	11	31	It was by faith that Rahab , the prostitute , welcomed the spies and was not killed with those who refused to obey God .
NCV	Hebrews	11	32	Do I need to give more examples ? I do not have time to tell you about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
NCV	Hebrews	11	33	Through their faith they defeated kingdoms . They did what was right , received God ’ s promises , and shut the mouths of lions .
NCV	Hebrews	11	34	They stopped great fires and were saved from being killed with swords . They were weak , and yet were made strong . They were powerful in battle and defeated other armies .
NCV	Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead relatives raised back to life . Others were tortured and refused to accept their freedom so they could be raised from the dead to a better life .
NCV	Hebrews	11	36	Some were laughed at and beaten . Others were put in chains and thrown into prison .
NCV	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned to death , they were cut in half , [ d ] and they were killed with swords . Some wore the skins of sheep and goats . They were poor , abused , and treated badly .
NCV	Hebrews	11	38	The world was not good enough for them ! They wandered in deserts and mountains , living in caves and holes in the earth .
NCV	Hebrews	11	39	All these people are known for their faith , but none of them received what God had promised .
NCV	Hebrews	11	40	God planned to give us something better so that they would be made perfect , but only together with us .

NCV	Hebrews	11	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Hebrews	12	12	You have become weak , so make yourselves strong again .
NCV	Hebrews	12	2	Let us look only to Jesus , the One who began our faith and who makes it perfect . He suffered death on the cross . But he accepted the shame as if it were nothing because of the joy that God put before him . And now he is sitting at the right side of God ’ s throne .
NCV	Hebrews	12	3	Think about Jesus ’ example . He held on while wicked people were doing evil things to him . So do not get tired and stop trying . God Is like a Father
NCV	Hebrews	12	4	You are struggling against sin , but your struggles have not yet caused you to be killed .
NCV	Hebrews	12	5	You have forgotten the encouraging words that call you his children : “ My child , don ’ t think the Lord ’ s discipline is worth nothing , and don ’ t stop trying when he corrects you .
NCV	Hebrews	12	6	The Lord disciplines those he loves , and he punishes everyone he accepts as his child. ” Proverbs 3:11–12
NCV	Hebrews	12	7	So hold on through your sufferings , because they are like a father ’ s discipline . God is treating you as children . All children are disciplined by their fathers .
NCV	Hebrews	12	8	If you are never disciplined ( and every child must be disciplined ) , you are not true children .
NCV	Hebrews	12	9	We have all had fathers here on earth who disciplined us , and we respected them . So it is even more important that we accept discipline from the Father of our spirits so we will have life .
NCV	Hebrews	12	10	Our fathers on earth disciplined us for a short time in the way they thought was best . But God disciplines us to help us , so we can become holy as he is .
NCV	Hebrews	12	11	We do not enjoy being disciplined . It is painful at the time , but later , after we have learned from it , we have peace , because we start living in the right way . Be Careful How You Live
NCV	Hebrews	12	13	Keep on the right path , so the weak will not stumble but rather be strengthened .
NCV	Hebrews	12	14	Try to live in peace with all people , and try to live free from sin . Anyone whose life is not holy will never see the Lord .
NCV	Hebrews	12	15	Be careful that no one fails to receive God ’ s grace and begins to cause trouble among you . A person like that can ruin many of you .
NCV	Hebrews	12	16	Be careful that no one takes part in sexual sin or is like Esau and never thinks about God . As the oldest son , Esau would have received everything from his father , but he sold all that for a single meal .
NCV	Hebrews	12	17	You remember that after Esau did this , he wanted to get his father ’ s blessing , but his father refused . Esau could find no way to change what he had done , even though he wanted the blessing so much that he cried .
NCV	Hebrews	12	18	You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire . You have not come to darkness , sadness , and storms .
NCV	Hebrews	12	19	You have not come to the noise of a trumpet or to the sound of a voice like the one the people of Israel heard and begged not to hear another word .
NCV	Hebrews	12	20	They did not want to hear the command : “ If anything , even an animal , touches the mountain , it must be put to death with stones. ” [ a ]
NCV	Hebrews	12	21	. The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion , [ c ] to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem . You have come to thousands of angels gathered together with joy .
NCV	Hebrews	12	23	You have come to the meeting of God ’ s firstborn [ d ] children whose names are written in heaven . You have come to God , the judge of all people , and to the spirits of good people who have been made perfect .
NCV	Hebrews	12	24	You have come to Jesus , the One who brought the new agreement from God to his people , and you have come to the sprinkled blood [ e ] that has a better message than the blood of Abel . [ f ]
NCV	Hebrews	12	25	So be careful and do not refuse to listen when God speaks . Others refused to listen to him when he warned them on earth , and they did not escape . So it will be worse for us if we refuse to listen to God who warns us from heaven .
NCV	Hebrews	12	26	When he spoke before , his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , “ Once again I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens. ” [ g ]
NCV	Hebrews	12	27	The words “ once again ” clearly show us that everything that was made—things that can be shaken—will be destroyed . Only the things that can not be shaken will remain .
NCV	Hebrews	12	28	So let us be thankful , because we have a kingdom that can not be shaken . We should worship God in a way that pleases him with respect and fear ,
NCV	Hebrews	12	29	because our God is like a fire that burns things up .

NCV	Hebrews	13	13	So let us go to Jesus outside the camp , holding on as he did when we are abused .
NCV	Hebrews	13	2	Remember to welcome strangers , because some who have done this have welcomed angels without knowing it .
NCV	Hebrews	13	3	Remember those who are in prison as if you were in prison with them . Remember those who are suffering as if you were suffering with them .
NCV	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage should be honored by everyone , and husband and wife should keep their marriage pure . God will judge as guilty those who take part in sexual sins .
NCV	Hebrews	13	5	Keep your lives free from the love of money , and be satisfied with what you have . God has said , “ I will never leave you ; I will never abandon you. ” Deuteronomy 31:6
NCV	Hebrews	13	6	So we can be sure when we say , “ I will not be afraid , because the Lord is my helper . People can ’ t do anything to me. ” Psalm 118:6
NCV	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders who taught God ’ s message to you . Remember how they lived and died , and copy their faith .
NCV	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
NCV	Hebrews	13	9	Do not let all kinds of strange teachings lead you into the wrong way . Your hearts should be strengthened by God ’ s grace , not by obeying rules about foods , which do not help those who obey them .
NCV	Hebrews	13	10	We have a sacrifice , but the priests who serve in the Holy Tent can not eat from it .
NCV	Hebrews	13	11	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place where he offers this blood for sins . But the bodies of the animals are burned outside the camp .
NCV	Hebrews	13	12	So Jesus also suffered outside the city to make his people holy with his own blood .
NCV	Hebrews	13	14	Here on earth we do not have a city that lasts forever , but we are looking for the city that we will have in the future .
NCV	Hebrews	13	15	So through Jesus let us always offer to God our sacrifice of praise , coming from lips that speak his name .
NCV	Hebrews	13	16	Do not forget to do good to others , and share with them , because such sacrifices please God .
NCV	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders and act under their authority . They are watching over you , because they are responsible for your souls . Obey them so that they will do this work with joy , not sadness . It will not help you to make their work hard .
NCV	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us . We are sure that we have a clear conscience , because we always want to do the right thing .
NCV	Hebrews	13	19	I especially beg you to pray so that God will send me back to you soon . 20-21 I pray that the God of peace will give you every good thing you need so you can do what he wants . God raised from the dead our Lord Jesus , the Great Shepherd of the sheep , because of the blood of his death . His blood began the eternal agreement that God made with his people . I pray that God will do in us what pleases him , through Jesus Christ , and to him be glory forever and ever . Amen .
NCV	Hebrews	13	22	My brothers and sisters , I beg you to listen patiently to this message I have written to encourage you , because it is not very long .
NCV	Hebrews	13	23	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been let out of prison . If he arrives soon , we will both come to see you .
NCV	Hebrews	13	24	Greet all your leaders and all of God ’ s people . Those from Italy send greetings to you .

NCV	James	1	1	From James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ . To all of God ’ s people who are scattered everywhere in the world : Greetings . Faith and Wisdom
NCV	James	1	2	My brothers and sisters , when you have many kinds of troubles , you should be full of joy ,
NCV	James	1	3	because you know that these troubles test your faith , and this will give you patience .
NCV	James	1	4	Let your patience show itself perfectly in what you do . Then you will be perfect and complete and will have everything you need .
NCV	James	1	5	But if any of you needs wisdom , you should ask God for it . He is generous to everyone and will give you wisdom without criticizing you .
NCV	James	1	6	But when you ask God , you must believe and not doubt . Anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea , blown up and down by the wind . 7-8 Such doubters are thinking two different things at the same time , and they can not decide about anything they do . They should not think they will receive anything from the Lord . True Riches
NCV	James	1	9	Believers who are poor should take pride that God has made them spiritually rich .
NCV	James	1	10	Those who are rich should take pride that God has shown them that they are spiritually poor . The rich will die like a wild flower in the grass .
NCV	James	1	11	The sun rises with burning heat and dries up the plants . The flower falls off , and its beauty is gone . In the same way the rich will die while they are still taking care of business . Temptation Is Not from God
NCV	James	1	12	When people are tempted and still continue strong , they should be happy . After they have proved their faith , God will reward them with life forever . God promised this to all those who love him .
NCV	James	1	13	When people are tempted , they should not say , “ God is tempting me. ” Evil can not tempt God , and God himself does not tempt anyone .
NCV	James	1	14	But people are tempted when their own evil desire leads them away and traps them .
NCV	James	1	15	This desire leads to sin , and then the sin grows and brings death .
NCV	James	1	16	My dear brothers and sisters , do not be fooled about this .
NCV	James	1	17	Every good action and every perfect gift is from God . These good gifts come down from the Creator of the sun , moon , and stars , who does not change like their shifting shadows .
NCV	James	1	18	God decided to give us life through the word of truth so we might be the most important of all the things he made . Listening and Obeying
NCV	James	1	19	My dear brothers and sisters , always be willing to listen and slow to speak . Do not become angry easily ,
NCV	James	1	20	because anger will not help you live the right kind of life God wants .
NCV	James	1	21	So put out of your life every evil thing and every kind of wrong . Then in gentleness accept God ’ s teaching that is planted in your hearts , which can save you .
NCV	James	1	22	Do what God ’ s teaching says ; when you only listen and do nothing , you are fooling yourselves .
NCV	James	1	23	Those who hear God ’ s teaching and do nothing are like people who look at themselves in a mirror .
NCV	James	1	24	They see their faces and then go away and quickly forget what they looked like .
NCV	James	1	25	But the truly happy people are those who carefully study God ’ s perfect law that makes people free , and they continue to study it . They do not forget what they heard , but they obey what God ’ s teaching says . Those who do this will be made happy . The True Way to Worship God
NCV	James	1	26	People who think they are religious but say things they should not say are just fooling themselves . Their “ religion ” is worth nothing .
NCV	James	1	27	Religion that God accepts as pure and without fault is this : caring for orphans or widows who need help , and keeping yourself free from the world ’ s evil influence . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	James	2	3	You show special attention to the one wearing nice clothes and say , “ Please , sit here in this good seat. ” But you say to the poor person , “ Stand over there , ” or , “ Sit on the floor by my feet. ”
NCV	James	2	4	What are you doing ? You are making some people more important than others , and with evil thoughts you are deciding that one person is better .
NCV	James	2	5	Listen , my dear brothers and sisters ! God chose the poor in the world to be rich with faith and to receive the kingdom God promised to those who love him .
NCV	James	2	6	But you show no respect to the poor . The rich are always trying to control your lives . They are the ones who take you to court .
NCV	James	2	7	And they are the ones who speak against Jesus , who owns you .
NCV	James	2	8	This royal law is found in the Scriptures : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ” [ a ] If you obey this law , you are doing right .
NCV	James	2	9	But if you treat one person as being more important than another , you are sinning . You are guilty of breaking God ’ s law .
NCV	James	2	10	A person who follows all of God ’ s law but fails to obey even one command is guilty of breaking all the commands in that law .
NCV	James	2	11	The same God who said , “ You must not be guilty of adultery , ” [ b ] also said , “ You must not murder anyone. ” [ c ] So if you do not take part in adultery but you murder someone , you are guilty of breaking all of God ’ s law .
NCV	James	2	12	In everything you say and do , remember that you will be judged by the law that makes people free .
NCV	James	2	13	So you must show mercy to others , or God will not show mercy to you when he judges you . But the person who shows mercy can stand without fear at the judgment . Faith and Good Works
NCV	James	2	14	My brothers and sisters , if people say they have faith , but do nothing , their faith is worth nothing . Can faith like that save them ?
NCV	James	2	15	A brother or sister in Christ might need clothes or food .
NCV	James	2	16	If you say to that person , “ God be with you ! I hope you stay warm and get plenty to eat , ” but you do not give what that person needs , your words are worth nothing .
NCV	James	2	17	In the same way , faith by itself—that does nothing—is dead .
NCV	James	2	18	Someone might say , “ You have faith , but I have deeds. ” Show me your faith without doing anything , and I will show you my faith by what I do .
NCV	James	2	19	You believe there is one God . Good ! But the demons believe that , too , and they tremble with fear .
NCV	James	2	20	You foolish person ! Must you be shown that faith that does nothing is worth nothing ?
NCV	James	2	21	Abraham , our ancestor , was made right with God by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar .
NCV	James	2	22	So you see that Abraham ’ s faith and the things he did worked together . His faith was made perfect by what he did .
NCV	James	2	23	This shows the full meaning of the Scripture that says : “ Abraham believed God , and God accepted Abraham ’ s faith , and that faith made him right with God. ” [ d ] And Abraham was called God ’ s friend . [ e ]
NCV	James	2	24	So you see that people are made right with God by what they do , not by faith only .
NCV	James	2	25	Another example is Rahab , a prostitute , who was made right with God by something she did . She welcomed the spies into her home and helped them escape by a different road .
NCV	James	2	26	Just as a person ’ s body that does not have a spirit is dead , so faith that does nothing is dead !

NCV	James	3	3	When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us , we can control their whole bodies .
NCV	James	3	2	We all make many mistakes . If people never said anything wrong , they would be perfect and able to control their entire selves , too .
NCV	James	3	4	Also a ship is very big , and it is pushed by strong winds . But a very small rudder controls that big ship , making it go wherever the pilot wants .
NCV	James	3	5	It is the same with the tongue . It is a small part of the body , but it brags about great things . A big forest fire can be started with only a little flame .
NCV	James	3	6	And the tongue is like a fire . It is a whole world of evil among the parts of our bodies . The tongue spreads its evil through the whole body . The tongue is set on fire by hell , and it starts a fire that influences all of life .
NCV	James	3	7	People can tame every kind of wild animal , bird , reptile , and fish , and they have tamed them ,
NCV	James	3	8	but no one can tame the tongue . It is wild and evil and full of deadly poison .
NCV	James	3	9	We use our tongues to praise our Lord and Father , but then we curse people , whom God made like himself .
NCV	James	3	10	Praises and curses come from the same mouth ! My brothers and sisters , this should not happen .
NCV	James	3	11	Do good and bad water flow from the same spring ?
NCV	James	3	12	My brothers and sisters , can a fig tree make olives , or can a grapevine make figs ? No ! And a well full of salty water can not give good water . True Wisdom
NCV	James	3	13	Are there those among you who are truly wise and understanding ? Then they should show it by living right and doing good things with a gentleness that comes from wisdom .
NCV	James	3	14	But if you are selfish and have bitter jealousy in your hearts , do not brag . Your bragging is a lie that hides the truth .
NCV	James	3	15	That kind of “ wisdom ” does not come from God but from the world . It is not spiritual ; it is from the devil .
NCV	James	3	16	Where jealousy and selfishness are , there will be confusion and every kind of evil .
NCV	James	3	17	But the wisdom that comes from God is first of all pure , then peaceful , gentle , and easy to please . This wisdom is always ready to help those who are troubled and to do good for others . It is always fair and honest .

NCV	James	4	4	So , you are not loyal to God ! You should know that loving the world is the same as hating God . Anyone who wants to be a friend of the world becomes God ’ s enemy .
NCV	James	4	2	You want things , but you do not have them . So you are ready to kill and are jealous of other people , but you still can not get what you want . So you argue and fight . You do not get what you want , because you do not ask God .
NCV	James	4	3	Or when you ask , you do not receive because the reason you ask is wrong . You want things so you can use them for your own pleasures .
NCV	James	4	5	Do you think the Scripture means nothing that says , “ The Spirit that God made to live in us wants us for himself alone ” ? [ a ]
NCV	James	4	6	But God gives us even more grace , as the Scripture says , “ God is against the proud , but he gives grace to the humble. ” Proverbs 3:34
NCV	James	4	7	So give yourselves completely to God . Stand against the devil , and the devil will run from you .
NCV	James	4	8	Come near to God , and God will come near to you . You sinners , clean sin out of your lives . You who are trying to follow God and the world at the same time , make your thinking pure .
NCV	James	4	9	Be sad , cry , and weep ! Change your laughter into crying and your joy into sadness .
NCV	James	4	10	Humble yourself in the Lord ’ s presence , and he will honor you . You Are Not the Judge
NCV	James	4	11	Brothers and sisters , do not tell evil lies about each other . If you speak against your fellow believers or judge them , you are judging and speaking against the law they follow . And when you are judging the law , you are no longer a follower of the law . You have become a judge .
NCV	James	4	12	God is the only Lawmaker and Judge . He is the only One who can save and destroy . So it is not right for you to judge your neighbor . Let God Plan Your Life
NCV	James	4	13	Some of you say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to some city . We will stay there a year , do business , and make money. ”
NCV	James	4	14	But you do not know what will happen tomorrow ! Your life is like a mist . You can see it for a short time , but then it goes away .
NCV	James	4	15	So you should say , “ If the Lord wants , we will live and do this or that. ”
NCV	James	4	16	But now you are proud and you brag . All of this bragging is wrong .
NCV	James	4	17	Anyone who knows the right thing to do , but does not do it , is sinning . Footnotes - 4:5 “ The Spirit . . . alone. ” These words may be from Exodus 20:5 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	James	5	5	Your life on earth was full of rich living and pleasing yourselves with everything you wanted . You made yourselves fat , like an animal ready to be killed .
NCV	James	5	2	Your riches have rotted , and your clothes have been eaten by moths .
NCV	James	5	3	Your gold and silver have rusted , and that rust will be a proof that you were wrong . It will eat your bodies like fire . You saved your treasure for the last days .
NCV	James	5	4	The pay you did not give the workers who mowed your fields cries out against you , and the cries of the workers have been heard by the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	James	5	6	You have judged guilty and then murdered innocent people , who were not against you . Be Patient
NCV	James	5	7	Brothers and sisters , be patient until the Lord comes again . A farmer patiently waits for his valuable crop to grow from the earth and for it to receive the autumn and spring rains .
NCV	James	5	8	You , too , must be patient . Do not give up hope , because the Lord is coming soon .
NCV	James	5	9	Brothers and sisters , do not complain against each other or you will be judged guilty . And the Judge is ready to come !
NCV	James	5	10	Brothers and sisters , follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the Lord . They suffered many hard things , but they were patient .
NCV	James	5	11	We say they are happy because they did not give up . You have heard about Job ’ s patience , and you know the Lord ’ s purpose for him in the end . You know the Lord is full of mercy and is kind . Be Careful What You Say
NCV	James	5	12	My brothers and sisters , above all , do not use an oath when you make a promise . Don ’ t use the name of heaven , earth , or anything else to prove what you say . When you mean yes , say only yes , and when you mean no , say only no so you will not be judged guilty . The Power of Prayer
NCV	James	5	13	Anyone who is having troubles should pray . Anyone who is happy should sing praises .
NCV	James	5	14	Anyone who is sick should call the church ’ s elders . They should pray for and pour oil on the person [ a ] in the name of the Lord .
NCV	James	5	15	And the prayer that is said with faith will make the sick person well ; the Lord will heal that person . And if the person has sinned , the sins will be forgiven .
NCV	James	5	16	Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you . When a believing person prays , great things happen .
NCV	James	5	17	Elijah was a human being just like us . He prayed that it would not rain , and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years !
NCV	James	5	18	Then Elijah prayed again , and the rain came down from the sky , and the land produced crops again . Saving a Soul
NCV	James	5	19	My brothers and sisters , if one of you wanders away from the truth , and someone helps that person come back ,
NCV	James	5	20	remember this : Anyone who brings a sinner back from the wrong way will save that sinner ’ s soul from death and will cause many sins to be forgiven .

NCV	1%20Peter	1	1	From Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ . To God ’ s chosen people who are away from their homes and are scattered all around Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	2	God planned long ago to choose you by making you his holy people , which is the Spirit ’ s work . God wanted you to obey him and to be made clean by the blood of the death of Jesus Christ . Grace and peace be yours more and more . We Have a Living Hope
NCV	1%20Peter	1	3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . In God ’ s great mercy he has caused us to be born again into a living hope , because Jesus Christ rose from the dead .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	4	Now we hope for the blessings God has for his children . These blessings , which can not be destroyed or be spoiled or lose their beauty , are kept in heaven for you .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	5	God ’ s power protects you through your faith until salvation is shown to you at the end of time .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	6	This makes you very happy , even though now for a short time different kinds of troubles may make you sad .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	7	These troubles come to prove that your faith is pure . This purity of faith is worth more than gold , which can be proved to be pure by fire but will ruin . But the purity of your faith will bring you praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is shown to you .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	8	You have not seen Christ , but still you love him . You can not see him now , but you believe in him . So you are filled with a joy that can not be explained , a joy full of glory .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	9	And you are receiving the goal of your faith—the salvation of your souls .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	10	The prophets searched carefully and tried to learn about this salvation . They prophesied about the grace that was coming to you .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	11	The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets , telling in advance about the sufferings of Christ and about the glory that would follow those sufferings . The prophets tried to learn about what the Spirit was showing them , when those things would happen , and what the world would be like at that time .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	12	It was shown them that their service was not for themselves but for you , when they told about the truths you have now heard . Those who preached the Good News to you told you those things with the help of the Holy Spirit who was sent from heaven—things into which angels desire to look . A Call to Holy Living
NCV	1%20Peter	1	13	So prepare your minds for service and have self-control . All your hope should be for the gift of grace that will be yours when Jesus Christ is shown to you .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	14	Now that you are obedient children of God do not live as you did in the past . You did not understand , so you did the evil things you wanted .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	15	But be holy in all you do , just as God , the One who called you , is holy .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	16	It is written in the Scriptures : “ You must be holy , because I am holy. ” [ a ]
NCV	1%20Peter	1	17	You pray to God and call him Father , and he judges each person ’ s work equally . So while you are here on earth , you should live with respect for God .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	18	You know that in the past you were living in a worthless way , a way passed down from the people who lived before you . But you were saved from that useless life . You were bought , not with something that ruins like gold or silver ,
NCV	1%20Peter	1	19	but with the precious blood of Christ , who was like a pure and perfect lamb .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	20	Christ was chosen before the world was made , but he was shown to the world in these last times for your sake .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	21	Through Christ you believe in God , who raised Christ from the dead and gave him glory . So your faith and your hope are in God .
NCV	1%20Peter	1	22	Now that your obedience to the truth has purified your souls , you can have true love for your Christian brothers and sisters . So love each other deeply with all your heart . [ b ]

NCV	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter
NCV	1%20Peter	2	2	As newborn babies want milk , you should want the pure and simple teaching . By it you can mature in your salvation ,
NCV	1%20Peter	2	3	because you have already examined and seen how good the Lord is .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	4	Come to the Lord Jesus , the “ stone ” [ a ] that lives . The people of the world did not want this stone , but he was the stone God chose , and he was precious .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	5	You also are like living stones , so let yourselves be used to build a spiritual temple—to be holy priests who offer spiritual sacrifices to God . He will accept those sacrifices through Jesus Christ .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	6	The Scripture says : “ I will put a stone in the ground in Jerusalem . Everything will be built on this important and precious rock . Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed. ” Isaiah 28:16
NCV	1%20Peter	2	7	This stone is worth much to you who believe . But to the people who do not believe , “ the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. ” Psalm 118:22
NCV	1%20Peter	2	8	Also , he is “ a stone that causes people to stumble , a rock that makes them fall. ” Isaiah 8:14 They stumble because they do not obey what God says , which is what God planned to happen to them .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	9	But you are a chosen people , royal priests , a holy nation , a people for God ’ s own possession . You were chosen to tell about the wonderful acts of God , who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	10	At one time you were not a people , but now you are God ’ s people . In the past you had never received mercy , but now you have received God ’ s mercy . Live for God
NCV	1%20Peter	2	11	Dear friends , you are like foreigners and strangers in this world . I beg you to avoid the evil things your bodies want to do that fight against your soul .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	12	People who do not believe are living all around you and might say that you are doing wrong . Live such good lives that they will see the good things you do and will give glory to God on the day when Christ comes again . Yield to Every Human Authority
NCV	1%20Peter	2	13	For the Lord ’ s sake , yield to the people who have authority in this world : the king , who is the highest authority ,
NCV	1%20Peter	2	14	and the leaders who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	15	It is God ’ s desire that by doing good you should stop foolish people from saying stupid things about you .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	16	Live as free people , but do not use your freedom as an excuse to do evil . Live as servants of God .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	17	Show respect for all people : Love the brothers and sisters of God ’ s family , respect God , honor the king . Follow Christ ’ s Example
NCV	1%20Peter	2	18	Slaves , yield to the authority of your masters with all respect , not only those who are good and kind , but also those who are dishonest .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	19	A person might have to suffer even when it is unfair , but if he thinks of God and can stand the pain , God is pleased .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	20	If you are beaten for doing wrong , there is no reason to praise you for being patient in your punishment . But if you suffer for doing good , and you are patient , then God is pleased .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	21	This is what you were called to do , because Christ suffered for you and gave you an example to follow . So you should do as he did .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	22	“ He had never sinned , and he had never lied. ” Isaiah 53:9
NCV	1%20Peter	2	23	People insulted Christ , but he did not insult them in return . Christ suffered , but he did not threaten . He let God , the One who judges rightly , take care of him .
NCV	1%20Peter	2	24	Christ carried our sins in his body on the cross so we would stop living for sin and start living for what is right . And you are healed because of his wounds .

NCV	1%20Peter	3	3	It is not fancy hair , gold jewelry , or fine clothes that should make you beautiful .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	2	Your husbands will see the pure lives you live with your respect for God .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	4	No , your beauty should come from within you—the beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit that will never be destroyed and is very precious to God .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	5	In this same way the holy women who lived long ago and followed God made themselves beautiful , yielding to their own husbands .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	6	Sarah obeyed Abraham , her husband , and called him her master . And you women are true children of Sarah if you always do what is right and are not afraid .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	7	In the same way , you husbands should live with your wives in an understanding way , since they are weaker than you . But show them respect , because God gives them the same blessing he gives you—the grace that gives true life . Do this so that nothing will stop your prayers . Suffering for Doing Right
NCV	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , all of you should be in agreement , understanding each other , loving each other as family , being kind and humble .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	9	Do not do wrong to repay a wrong , and do not insult to repay an insult . But repay with a blessing , because you yourselves were called to do this so that you might receive a blessing .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	10	The Scripture says , “ A person must do these things to enjoy life and have many happy days . He must not say evil things , and he must not tell lies .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	11	He must stop doing evil and do good . He must look for peace and work for it .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	12	The Lord sees the good people and listens to their prayers . But the Lord is against those who do evil. ” Psalm 34:12–16
NCV	1%20Peter	3	13	If you are trying hard to do good , no one can really hurt you .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	14	But even if you suffer for doing right , you are blessed . “ Don ’ t be afraid of what they fear ; do not dread those things. ” Isaiah 8:12–13
NCV	1%20Peter	3	15	But respect Christ as the holy Lord in your hearts . Always be ready to answer everyone who asks you to explain about the hope you have ,
NCV	1%20Peter	3	16	but answer in a gentle way and with respect . Keep a clear conscience so that those who speak evil of your good life in Christ will be made ashamed .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	17	It is better to suffer for doing good than for doing wrong if that is what God wants .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	18	Christ himself suffered for sins once . He was not guilty , but he suffered for those who are guilty to bring you to God . His body was killed , but he was made alive in the spirit .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	19	And in the spirit he went and preached to the spirits in prison
NCV	1%20Peter	3	20	who refused to obey God long ago in the time of Noah . God was waiting patiently for them while Noah was building the boat . Only a few people—eight in all—were saved by water .
NCV	1%20Peter	3	21	And that water is like baptism that now saves you—not the washing of dirt from the body , but the promise made to God from a good conscience . And this is because Jesus Christ was raised from the dead .

NCV	1%20Peter	4	4	Nonbelievers think it is strange that you do not do the many wild and wasteful things they do , so they insult you .
NCV	1%20Peter	4	2	Strengthen yourselves so that you will live here on earth doing what God wants , not the evil things people want .
NCV	1%20Peter	4	3	In the past you wasted too much time doing what nonbelievers enjoy . You were guilty of sexual sins , evil desires , drunkenness , wild and drunken parties , and hateful idol worship .
NCV	1%20Peter	4	5	But they will have to explain this to God , who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
NCV	1%20Peter	4	6	For this reason the Good News was preached to those who are now dead . Even though they were judged like all people , the Good News was preached to them so they could live in the spirit as God lives . Use God ’ s Gifts Wisely
NCV	1%20Peter	4	7	The time is near when all things will end . So think clearly and control yourselves so you will be able to pray .
NCV	1%20Peter	4	8	Most importantly , love each other deeply , because love will cause people to forgive each other for many sins .

NCV	1%20Peter	4	13	But be happy that you are sharing in Christ ’ s sufferings so that you will be happy and full of joy when Christ comes again in glory .
NCV	1%20Peter	4	14	When people insult you because you follow Christ , you are blessed , because the glorious Spirit , the Spirit of God , is with you .
NCV	1%20Peter	4	15	Do not suffer for murder , theft , or any other crime , nor because you trouble other people .
NCV	1%20Peter	4	16	But if you suffer because you are a Christian , do not be ashamed . Praise God because you wear that name .
NCV	1%20Peter	4	17	It is time for judgment to begin with God ’ s family . And if that judging begins with us , what will happen to those people who do not obey the Good News of God ?

NCV	2%20Peter	1	2	Grace and peace be given to you more and more , because you truly know God and Jesus our Lord . God Has Given Us Blessings
NCV	2%20Peter	1	1	From Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ . To you who have received a faith as valuable as ours , because our God and Savior Jesus Christ does what is right .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	3	Jesus has the power of God , by which he has given us everything we need to live and to serve God . We have these things because we know him . Jesus called us by his glory and goodness .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	4	Through these he gave us the very great and precious promises . With these gifts you can share in God ’ s nature , and the world will not ruin you with its evil desires .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	5	Because you have these blessings , do your best to add these things to your lives : to your faith , add goodness ; and to your goodness , add knowledge ;
NCV	2%20Peter	1	6	and to your knowledge , add self-control ; and to your self-control , add patience ; and to your patience , add service for God ;
NCV	2%20Peter	1	7	and to your service for God , add kindness for your brothers and sisters in Christ ; and to this kindness , add love .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	8	If all these things are in you and are growing , they will help you to be useful and productive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	9	But anyone who does not have these things can not see clearly . He is blind and has forgotten that he was made clean from his past sins .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	10	My brothers and sisters , try hard to be certain that you really are called and chosen by God . If you do all these things , you will never fall .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	11	And you will be given a very great welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	12	You know these things , and you are very strong in the truth , but I will always help you remember them .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	13	I think it is right for me to help you remember as long as I am in this body .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	14	I know I must soon leave this body , as our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	15	I will try my best so that you may be able to remember these things even after I am gone . We Saw Christ ’ s Glory
NCV	2%20Peter	1	16	When we told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , we were not telling just clever stories that someone invented . But we saw the greatness of Jesus with our own eyes .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	17	Jesus heard the voice of God , the Greatest Glory , when he received honor and glory from God the Father . The voice said , “ This is my Son , whom I love , and I am very pleased with him. ”
NCV	2%20Peter	1	18	We heard that voice from heaven while we were with Jesus on the holy mountain .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	19	This makes us more sure about the message the prophets gave . It is good for you to follow closely what they said as you would follow a light shining in a dark place , until the day begins and the morning star rises in your hearts .
NCV	2%20Peter	1	20	Most of all , you must understand this : No prophecy in the Scriptures ever comes from the prophet ’ s own interpretation .

NCV	2%20Peter	2	2	Many will follow their evil ways and say evil things about the way of truth .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	3	Those false teachers only want your money , so they will use you by telling you lies . Their judgment spoken against them long ago is still coming , and their ruin is certain .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	4	When angels sinned , God did not let them go free without punishment . He sent them to hell and put them in caves [ a ] of darkness where they are being held for judgment .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	5	And God punished the world long ago when he brought a flood to the world that was full of people who were against him . But God saved Noah , who preached about being right with God , and seven other people with him .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	6	And God also destroyed the evil cities of Sodom and Gomorrah [ b ] by burning them until they were ashes . He made those cities an example of what will happen to those who are against God .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	7	But he saved Lot from those cities . Lot , a good man , was troubled because of the filthy lives of evil people .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	8	( Lot was a good man , but because he lived with evil people every day , his good heart was hurt by the evil things he saw and heard . )
NCV	2%20Peter	2	9	So the Lord knows how to save those who serve him when troubles come . He will hold evil people and punish them , while waiting for the Judgment Day .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	10	That punishment is especially for those who live by doing the evil things their sinful selves want and who hate authority . These false teachers are bold and do anything they want . They are not afraid to speak against the angels .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	11	But even the angels , who are much stronger and more powerful than false teachers , do not accuse them with insults before [ c ] the Lord .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	12	But these people speak against things they do not understand . They are like animals that act without thinking , animals born to be caught and killed . And , like animals , these false teachers will be destroyed .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	13	They have caused many people to suffer , so they themselves will suffer . That is their pay for what they have done . They take pleasure in openly doing evil , so they are like dirty spots and stains among you . They delight in deceiving you while eating meals with you .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	14	Every time they look at a woman they want her , and their desire for sin is never satisfied . They lead weak people into the trap of sin , and they have taught their hearts to be greedy . God will punish them !
NCV	2%20Peter	2	15	These false teachers left the right road and lost their way , following the way Balaam went . Balaam was the son of Beor , who loved being paid for doing wrong .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	16	But a donkey , which can not talk , told Balaam he was sinning . It spoke with a man ’ s voice and stopped the prophet ’ s crazy thinking .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	17	Those false teachers are like springs without water and clouds blown by a storm . A place in the blackest darkness has been kept for them .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	18	They brag with words that mean nothing . By their evil desires they lead people into the trap of sin—people who are just beginning to escape from others who live in error .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	19	They promise them freedom , but they themselves are not free . They are slaves of things that will be destroyed . For people are slaves of anything that controls them .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	20	They were made free from the evil in the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . But if they return to evil things and those things control them , then it is worse for them than it was before .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	21	Yes , it would be better for them to have never known the right way than to know it and to turn away from the holy teaching that was given to them .
NCV	2%20Peter	2	22	What they did is like this true saying : “ A dog goes back to what it has thrown up , ” [ d ] and , “ After a pig is washed , it goes back and rolls in the mud. ” Footnotes - 2:4 caves Some Greek copies read “ chains. ” - 2:6 Sodom and Gomorrah Two cities God destroyed because the people were so evil . - 2:11 before Some Greek copies read “ from. ” - 2:22 “ A dog . . . up. ” Quotation from Proverbs 26:11 .

NCV	2%20Peter	3	2	I want you to think about the words the holy prophets spoke in the past , and remember the command our Lord and Savior gave us through your apostles .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	3	It is most important for you to understand what will happen in the last days . People will laugh at you . They will live doing the evil things they want to do .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	4	They will say , “ Jesus promised to come again . Where is he ? Our fathers have died , but the world continues the way it has been since it was made. ”
NCV	2%20Peter	3	5	But they do not want to remember what happened long ago . By the word of God heaven was made , and the earth was made from water and with water .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	6	Then the world was flooded and destroyed with water .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	7	And that same word of God is keeping heaven and earth that we now have in order to be destroyed by fire . They are being kept for the Judgment Day and the destruction of all who are against God .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	8	But do not forget this one thing , dear friends : To the Lord one day is as a thousand years , and a thousand years is as one day .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow in doing what he promised—the way some people understand slowness . But God is being patient with you . He does not want anyone to be lost , but he wants all people to change their hearts and lives .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . The skies will disappear with a loud noise . Everything in them will be destroyed by fire , and the earth and everything in it will be exposed . [ a ]
NCV	2%20Peter	3	11	In that way everything will be destroyed . So what kind of people should you be ? You should live holy lives and serve God ,
NCV	2%20Peter	3	12	as you wait for and look forward to the coming of the day of God . When that day comes , the skies will be destroyed with fire , and everything in them will melt with heat .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	13	But God made a promise to us , and we are waiting for a new heaven and a new earth where goodness lives .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	14	Dear friends , since you are waiting for this to happen , do your best to be without sin and without fault . Try to be at peace with God .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	15	Remember that we are saved because our Lord is patient . Our dear brother Paul told you the same thing when he wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	16	He writes about this in all his letters . Some things in Paul ’ s letters are hard to understand , and people who are ignorant and weak in faith explain these things falsely . They also falsely explain the other Scriptures , but they are destroying themselves by doing this .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	17	Dear friends , since you already know about this , be careful . Do not let those evil people lead you away by the wrong they do . Be careful so you will not fall from your strong faith .
NCV	2%20Peter	3	18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . Glory be to him now and forever ! Amen . Footnotes - 3:10 and . . . exposed Some Greek copies read “ and everything in it will be burned up. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20John	1	1	We write you now about what has always existed , which we have heard , we have seen with our own eyes , we have looked at , and we have touched with our hands . We write to you about the Word [ a ] that gives life .
NCV	1%20John	1	2	He who gives life was shown to us . We saw him and can give proof about it . And now we announce to you that he has life that continues forever . He was with God the Father and was shown to us .
NCV	1%20John	1	3	We announce to you what we have seen and heard , because we want you also to have fellowship with us . Our fellowship is with God the Father and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
NCV	1%20John	1	4	We write this to you so we may be full of joy . [ b ] God Forgives Our Sins
NCV	1%20John	1	5	Here is the message we have heard from Christ and now announce to you : God is light , [ c ] and in him there is no darkness at all .
NCV	1%20John	1	6	So if we say we have fellowship with God , but we continue living in darkness , we are liars and do not follow the truth .
NCV	1%20John	1	7	But if we live in the light , as God is in the light , we can share fellowship with each other . Then the blood of Jesus , God ’ s Son , cleanses us from every sin .
NCV	1%20John	1	8	If we say we have no sin , we are fooling ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
NCV	1%20John	1	9	But if we confess our sins , he will forgive our sins , because we can trust God to do what is right . He will cleanse us from all the wrongs we have done .

NCV	1%20John	2	1	John
NCV	1%20John	2	2	He died in our place to take away our sins , and not only our sins but the sins of all people .
NCV	1%20John	2	3	We can be sure that we know God if we obey his commands .
NCV	1%20John	2	4	Anyone who says , “ I know God , ” but does not obey God ’ s commands is a liar , and the truth is not in that person .
NCV	1%20John	2	5	But if someone obeys God ’ s teaching , then in that person God ’ s love has truly reached its goal . This is how we can be sure we are living in God :
NCV	1%20John	2	6	Whoever says that he lives in God must live as Jesus lived . The Command to Love Others
NCV	1%20John	2	7	My dear friends , I am not writing a new command to you but an old command you have had from the beginning . It is the teaching you have already heard .
NCV	1%20John	2	8	But also I am writing a new command to you , and you can see its truth in Jesus and in you , because the darkness is passing away , and the true light is already shining .
NCV	1%20John	2	9	Anyone who says , “ I am in the light , ” [ a ] but hates a brother or sister , is still in the darkness .
NCV	1%20John	2	10	Whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light and will not cause anyone to stumble in his faith .
NCV	1%20John	2	11	But whoever hates a brother or sister is in darkness , lives in darkness , and does not know where to go , because the darkness has made that person blind .
NCV	1%20John	2	12	I write to you , dear children , because your sins are forgiven through Christ .
NCV	1%20John	2	13	I write to you , fathers , because you know the One who existed from the beginning . I write to you , young people , because you have defeated the Evil One .
NCV	1%20John	2	14	I write to you , children , because you know the Father . I write to you , fathers , because you know the One who existed from the beginning . I write to you , young people , because you are strong ; the teaching of God lives in you , and you have defeated the Evil One .
NCV	1%20John	2	15	Do not love the world or the things in the world . If you love the world , the love of the Father is not in you .
NCV	1%20John	2	16	These are the ways of the world : wanting to please our sinful selves , wanting the sinful things we see , and being too proud of what we have . None of these come from the Father , but all of them come from the world .
NCV	1%20John	2	17	The world and everything that people want in it are passing away , but the person who does what God wants lives forever . Reject the Enemies of Christ
NCV	1%20John	2	18	My dear children , these are the last days . You have heard that the enemy of Christ is coming , and now many enemies of Christ are already here . This is how we know that these are the last days .
NCV	1%20John	2	19	These enemies of Christ were in our fellowship , but they left us . They never really belonged to us ; if they had been a part of us , they would have stayed with us . But they left , and this shows that none of them really belonged to us .
NCV	1%20John	2	20	You have the gift [ b ] that the Holy One gave you , so you all know the truth . [ c ]
NCV	1%20John	2	21	I do not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know the truth . And you know that no lie comes from the truth .
NCV	1%20John	2	22	Who is the liar ? It is the person who does not accept Jesus as the Christ . This is the enemy of Christ : the person who does not accept the Father and his Son .
NCV	1%20John	2	23	Whoever does not accept the Son does not have the Father . But whoever confesses the Son has the Father , too .
NCV	1%20John	2	24	Be sure you continue to follow the teaching you heard from the beginning . If you continue to follow what you heard from the beginning , you will stay in the Son and in the Father .
NCV	1%20John	2	25	And this is what the Son promised to us—life forever .
NCV	1%20John	2	26	I am writing this letter about those people who are trying to lead you the wrong way .
NCV	1%20John	2	27	Christ gave you a special gift that is still in you , so you do not need any other teacher . His gift teaches you about everything , and it is true , not false . So continue to live in Christ , as his gift taught you .
NCV	1%20John	2	28	Yes , my dear children , live in him so that when Christ comes back , we can be without fear and not be ashamed in his presence .

NCV	1%20John	3	3	Christ is pure , and all who have this hope in Christ keep themselves pure like Christ .
NCV	1%20John	3	2	Dear friends , now we are children of God , and we have not yet been shown what we will be in the future . But we know that when Christ comes again , we will be like him , because we will see him as he really is .
NCV	1%20John	3	4	The person who sins breaks God ’ s law . Yes , sin is living against God ’ s law .
NCV	1%20John	3	5	You know that Christ came to take away sins and that there is no sin in Christ .
NCV	1%20John	3	6	So anyone who lives in Christ does not go on sinning . Anyone who goes on sinning has never really understood Christ and has never known him .
NCV	1%20John	3	7	Dear children , do not let anyone lead you the wrong way . Christ is righteous . So to be like Christ a person must do what is right .
NCV	1%20John	3	8	The devil has been sinning since the beginning , so anyone who continues to sin belongs to the devil . The Son of God came for this purpose : to destroy the devil ’ s work .
NCV	1%20John	3	9	Those who are God ’ s children do not continue sinning , because the new life from God remains in them . They are not able to go on sinning , because they have become children of God .
NCV	1%20John	3	10	So we can see who God ’ s children are and who the devil ’ s children are : Those who do not do what is right are not God ’ s children , and those who do not love their brothers and sisters are not God ’ s children . We Must Love Each Other
NCV	1%20John	3	11	This is the teaching you have heard from the beginning : We must love each other .
NCV	1%20John	3	12	Do not be like Cain who belonged to the Evil One and killed his brother . And why did he kill him ? Because the things Cain did were evil , and the things his brother did were good .
NCV	1%20John	3	13	Brothers and sisters , do not be surprised when the people of the world hate you .
NCV	1%20John	3	14	We know we have left death and have come into life because we love each other . Whoever does not love is still dead .
NCV	1%20John	3	15	Everyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer , [ a ] and you know that no murderers have eternal life in them .
NCV	1%20John	3	16	This is how we know what real love is : Jesus gave his life for us . So we should give our lives for our brothers and sisters .
NCV	1%20John	3	17	Suppose someone has enough to live and sees a brother or sister in need , but does not help . Then God ’ s love is not living in that person .
NCV	1%20John	3	18	My children , we should love people not only with words and talk , but by our actions and true caring .
NCV	1%20John	3	19	-
NCV	1%20John	3	20	This is the way we know that we belong to the way of truth . When our hearts make us feel guilty , we can still have peace before God . God is greater than our hearts , and he knows everything .
NCV	1%20John	3	21	My dear friends , if our hearts do not make us feel guilty , we can come without fear into God ’ s presence .
NCV	1%20John	3	22	And God gives us what we ask for because we obey God ’ s commands and do what pleases him .
NCV	1%20John	3	23	This is what God commands : that we believe in his Son , Jesus Christ , and that we love each other , just as he commanded .
NCV	1%20John	3	24	The people who obey God ’ s commands live in God , and God lives in them . We know that God lives in us because of the Spirit God gave us .

NCV	1%20John	4	4	My dear children , you belong to God and have defeated them ; because God ’ s Spirit , who is in you , is greater than the devil , who is in the world .
NCV	1%20John	4	2	This is how you can know God ’ s Spirit : Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ came to earth as a human is from God .
NCV	1%20John	4	3	And every spirit who refuses to say this about Jesus is not from God . It is the spirit of the enemy of Christ , which you have heard is coming , and now he is already in the world .
NCV	1%20John	4	5	And they belong to the world , so what they say is from the world , and the world listens to them .
NCV	1%20John	4	6	But we belong to God , and those who know God listen to us . But those who are not from God do not listen to us . That is how we know the Spirit that is true and the spirit that is false . Love Comes from God
NCV	1%20John	4	7	Dear friends , we should love each other , because love comes from God . Everyone who loves has become God ’ s child and knows God .
NCV	1%20John	4	8	Whoever does not love does not know God , because God is love .
NCV	1%20John	4	9	This is how God showed his love to us : He sent his one and only Son into the world so that we could have life through him .
NCV	1%20John	4	10	This is what real love is : It is not our love for God ; it is God ’ s love for us . He sent his Son to die in our place to take away our sins .
NCV	1%20John	4	11	Dear friends , if God loved us that much we also should love each other .
NCV	1%20John	4	12	No one has ever seen God , but if we love each other , God lives in us , and his love is made perfect in us .
NCV	1%20John	4	13	We know that we live in God and he lives in us , because he gave us his Spirit .
NCV	1%20John	4	14	We have seen and can testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world .
NCV	1%20John	4	15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God has God living inside , and that person lives in God .
NCV	1%20John	4	16	And so we know the love that God has for us , and we trust that love . God is love . Those who live in love live in God , and God lives in them .
NCV	1%20John	4	17	This is how love is made perfect in us : that we can be without fear on the day God judges us , because in this world we are like him .
NCV	1%20John	4	18	Where God ’ s love is , there is no fear , because God ’ s perfect love drives out fear . It is punishment that makes a person fear , so love is not made perfect in the person who fears .
NCV	1%20John	4	19	We love because God first loved us .
NCV	1%20John	4	20	If people say , “ I love God , ” but hate their brothers or sisters , they are liars . Those who do not love their brothers and sisters , whom they have seen , can not love God , whom they have never seen .

NCV	1%20John	5	3	Loving God means obeying his commands . And God ’ s commands are not too hard for us ,

NCV	1%20John	5	10	Anyone who believes in the Son of God has the truth that God told us . Anyone who does not believe makes God a liar , because that person does not believe what God told us about his Son .
NCV	1%20John	5	11	This is what God told us : God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
NCV	1%20John	5	12	Whoever has the Son has life , but whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life . We Have Eternal Life Now
NCV	1%20John	5	13	I write this letter to you who believe in the Son of God so you will know you have eternal life .
NCV	1%20John	5	14	And this is the boldness we have in God ’ s presence : that if we ask God for anything that agrees with what he wants , he hears us .
NCV	1%20John	5	15	If we know he hears us every time we ask him , we know we have what we ask from him .
NCV	1%20John	5	16	If anyone sees a brother or sister sinning ( sin that does not lead to eternal death ) , that person should pray , and God will give the sinner life . I am talking about people whose sin does not lead to eternal death . There is sin that leads to death . I do not mean that a person should pray about that sin .
NCV	1%20John	5	17	Doing wrong is always sin , but there is sin that does not lead to eternal death .
NCV	1%20John	5	18	We know that those who are God ’ s children do not continue to sin . The Son of God keeps them safe , and the Evil One can not touch them .
NCV	1%20John	5	19	We know that we belong to God , but the Evil One controls the whole world .
NCV	1%20John	5	20	We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we can know the True One . And our lives are in the True One and in his Son , Jesus Christ . He is the true God and the eternal life .

NCV	2%20John	1	3	Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and his Son , Jesus Christ , will be with us in truth and love .
NCV	2%20John	1	4	I was very happy to learn that some of your children are following the way of truth , as the Father commanded us .
NCV	2%20John	1	5	And now , dear lady , this is not a new command but is the same command we have had from the beginning . I ask you that we all love each other .
NCV	2%20John	1	6	And love means living the way God commanded us to live . As you have heard from the beginning , his command is this : Live a life of love .
NCV	2%20John	1	7	Many false teachers are in the world now who do not confess that Jesus Christ came to earth as a human . Anyone who does not confess this is a false teacher and an enemy of Christ .
NCV	2%20John	1	8	you Some Greek copies read “ we. ” -
NCV	2%20John	1	9	Anyone who goes beyond Christ ’ s teaching and does not continue to follow only his teaching does not have God . But whoever continues to follow the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son .
NCV	2%20John	1	10	If someone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not welcome or accept that person into your house .
NCV	2%20John	1	11	If you welcome such a person , you share in the evil work .
NCV	2%20John	1	12	I have many things to write to you , but I do not want to use paper and ink . Instead , I hope to come to you and talk face to face so we can be full of joy .

NCV	3%20John	1	3	I was very happy when some brothers and sisters came and told me about the truth in your life and how you are following the way of truth .
NCV	3%20John	1	1	From the Elder . [ a ] To my dear friend Gaius , whom I love in the truth : [ b ]
NCV	3%20John	1	2	My dear friend , I know your soul is doing fine , and I pray that you are doing well in every way and that your health is good .
NCV	3%20John	1	4	Nothing gives me greater joy than to hear that my children are following the way of truth .
NCV	3%20John	1	5	My dear friend , it is good that you help the brothers and sisters , even those you do not know .
NCV	3%20John	1	6	They told the church about your love . Please help them to continue their trip in a way worthy of God .
NCV	3%20John	1	7	They started out in service to Christ , and they have been accepting nothing from nonbelievers .
NCV	3%20John	1	8	So we should help such people ; when we do , we share in their work for the truth .
NCV	3%20John	1	9	I wrote something to the church , but Diotrephes , who loves to be their leader , will not listen to us .
NCV	3%20John	1	10	So if I come , I will talk about what Diotrephes is doing , about how he lies and says evil things about us . But more than that , he refuses to accept the other brothers and sisters ; he even stops those who do want to accept them and puts them out of the church .
NCV	3%20John	1	11	My dear friend , do not follow what is bad ; follow what is good . The one who does good belongs to God . But the one who does evil has never known God .
NCV	3%20John	1	12	Everyone says good things about Demetrius , and the truth agrees with what they say . We also speak well of him , and you know what we say is true .
NCV	3%20John	1	13	I have many things I want to write you , but I do not want to use pen and ink .
NCV	3%20John	1	14	I hope to see you soon and talk face to face .
NCV	3%20John	1	15	Peace to you . The friends here greet you . Please greet each friend there by name . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jude	1	1	From Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James . To all who have been called by God . God the Father loves you , and you have been kept safe in Jesus Christ :
NCV	Jude	1	2	Mercy , peace , and love be yours richly . God Will Punish Sinners
NCV	Jude	1	3	Dear friends , I wanted very much to write you about the salvation we all share . But I felt the need to write you about something else : I want to encourage you to fight hard for the faith that was given the holy people of God once and for all time .
NCV	Jude	1	4	Some people have secretly entered your group . Long ago the prophets wrote about these people who will be judged guilty . They are against God and have changed the grace of our God into a reason for sexual sin . They also refuse to accept Jesus Christ , our only Master and Lord .
NCV	Jude	1	5	I want to remind you of some things you already know : Remember that the Lord [ a ] saved his people by bringing them out of the land of Egypt . But later he destroyed all those who did not believe .
NCV	Jude	1	6	And remember the angels who did not keep their place of power but left their proper home . The Lord has kept these angels in darkness , bound with everlasting chains , to be judged on the great day .
NCV	Jude	1	7	Also remember the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah [ b ] and the other towns around them . In the same way they were full of sexual sin and people who desired sexual relations that God does not allow . They suffer the punishment of eternal fire , as an example for all to see .
NCV	Jude	1	8	It is the same with these people who have entered your group . They are guided by dreams and make themselves filthy with sin . They reject God ’ s authority and speak against the angels .
NCV	Jude	1	9	Not even the archangel [ c ] Michael , when he argued with the devil about who would have the body of Moses , dared to judge the devil guilty . Instead , he said , “ The Lord punish you. ”
NCV	Jude	1	10	But these people speak against things they do not understand . And what they do know , by feeling , as dumb animals know things , are the very things that destroy them .
NCV	Jude	1	11	It will be terrible for them . They have followed the way of Cain , and for money they have given themselves to doing the wrong that Balaam did . They have fought against God as Korah did , and like Korah , they surely will be destroyed .
NCV	Jude	1	12	They are like dirty spots in your special Christian meals you share . They eat with you and have no fear , caring only for themselves . They are clouds without rain , which the wind blows around . They are autumn trees without fruit that are pulled out of the ground . So they are twice dead .
NCV	Jude	1	13	They are like wild waves of the sea , tossing up their own shameful actions like foam . They are like stars that wander in the sky . A place in the blackest darkness has been kept for them forever .
NCV	Jude	1	14	Enoch , the seventh descendant from Adam , said about these people : “ Look , the Lord is coming with many thousands of his holy angels to
NCV	Jude	1	15	judge every person . He is coming to punish all who are against God for all the evil they have done against him . And he will punish the sinners who are against God for all the evil they have said against him. ”
NCV	Jude	1	16	These people complain and blame others , doing the evil things they want to do . They brag about themselves , and they flatter others to get what they want . A Warning and Things to Do
NCV	Jude	1	17	Dear friends , remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said before .
NCV	Jude	1	18	They said to you , “ In the last times there will be people who laugh about God , following their own evil desires which are against God. ”
NCV	Jude	1	19	These are the people who divide you , people whose thoughts are only of this world , who do not have the Spirit .
NCV	Jude	1	20	But dear friends , use your most holy faith to build yourselves up , praying in the Holy Spirit .
NCV	Jude	1	21	Keep yourselves in God ’ s love as you wait for the Lord Jesus Christ with his mercy to give you life forever .
NCV	Jude	1	22	Show mercy to some people who have doubts .
NCV	Jude	1	23	Take others out of the fire , and save them . Show mercy mixed with fear to others , hating even their clothes which are dirty from sin . Praise God
NCV	Jude	1	24	God is strong and can help you not to fall . He can bring you before his glory without any wrong in you and can give you great joy .
NCV	Jude	1	25	He is the only God , the One who saves us . To him be glory , greatness , power , and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord for all time past , now , and forever . Amen . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Revelation	1	1	This is the revelation [ a ] of Jesus Christ , which God gave to him , to show his servants what must soon happen . And Jesus sent his angel to show it to his servant John ,
NCV	Revelation	1	2	who has told everything he has seen . It is the word of God ; it is the message from Jesus Christ .
NCV	Revelation	1	3	Blessed is the one who reads the words of God ’ s message , and blessed are the people who hear this message and do what is written in it . The time is near when all of this will happen . Jesus ’ Message to the Churches
NCV	Revelation	1	4	From John . To the seven churches in Asia : Grace and peace to you from the One who is and was and is coming , and from the seven spirits before his throne ,
NCV	Revelation	1	5	and from Jesus Christ . Jesus is the faithful witness , the first among those raised from the dead . He is the ruler of the kings of the earth . He is the One who loves us , who made us free from our sins with the blood of his death .
NCV	Revelation	1	6	He made us to be a kingdom of priests who serve God his Father . To Jesus Christ be glory and power forever and ever ! Amen .
NCV	Revelation	1	7	Look , Jesus is coming with the clouds , and everyone will see him , even those who stabbed him . And all peoples of the earth will cry loudly because of him . Yes , this will happen ! Amen .
NCV	Revelation	1	8	The Lord God says , “ I am the Alpha and the Omega . [ b ] I am the One who is and was and is coming . I am the Almighty. ”
NCV	Revelation	1	9	I , John , am your brother . All of us share with Christ in suffering , in the kingdom , and in patience to continue . I was on the island of Patmos , [ c ] because I had preached the word of God and the message about Jesus .
NCV	Revelation	1	10	On the Lord ’ s day I was in the Spirit , and I heard a loud voice behind me that sounded like a trumpet .
NCV	Revelation	1	11	The voice said , “ Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea. ”
NCV	Revelation	1	12	I turned to see who was talking to me . When I turned , I saw seven golden lampstands
NCV	Revelation	1	13	and someone among the lampstands who was “ like a Son of Man. ” [ d ] He was dressed in a long robe and had a gold band around his chest .
NCV	Revelation	1	14	His head and hair were white like wool , as white as snow , and his eyes were like flames of fire .
NCV	Revelation	1	15	His feet were like bronze that glows hot in a furnace , and his voice was like the noise of flooding water .
NCV	Revelation	1	16	He held seven stars in his right hand , and a sharp double-edged sword came out of his mouth . He looked like the sun shining at its brightest time .
NCV	Revelation	1	17	When I saw him , I fell down at his feet like a dead man . He put his right hand on me and said , “ Do not be afraid . I am the First and the Last .
NCV	Revelation	1	18	I am the One who lives ; I was dead , but look , I am alive forever and ever ! And I hold the keys to death and to the place of the dead .
NCV	Revelation	1	19	So write the things you see , what is now and what will happen later .
NCV	Revelation	1	20	Here is the secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands : The seven lampstands are the seven churches , and the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches .

NCV	Revelation	2	2	I know what you do , how you work hard and never give up . I know you do not put up with the false teachings of evil people . You have tested those who say they are apostles but really are not , and you found they are liars .
NCV	Revelation	2	3	You have patience and have suffered troubles for my name and have not given up .
NCV	Revelation	2	4	“ But I have this against you : You have left the love you had in the beginning .
NCV	Revelation	2	5	So remember where you were before you fell . Change your hearts and do what you did at first . If you do not change , I will come to you and will take away your lampstand from its place .
NCV	Revelation	2	6	But there is something you do that is right : You hate what the Nicolaitans [ a ] do , as much as I .
NCV	Revelation	2	7	“ Every person who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches . To those who win the victory I will give the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life , which is in the garden of God . To the Church in Smyrna
NCV	Revelation	2	8	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Smyrna : “ The One who is the First and the Last , who died and came to life again , says this :
NCV	Revelation	2	9	I know your troubles and that you are poor , but really you are rich ! I know the bad things some people say about you . They say they are Jews , but they are not true Jews . They are a synagogue that belongs to Satan .
NCV	Revelation	2	10	Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer . I tell you , the devil will put some of you in prison to test you , and you will suffer for ten days . But be faithful , even if you have to die , and I will give you the crown of life .

NCV	Revelation	2	13	I know where you live . It is where Satan has his throne . But you are true to me . You did not refuse to tell about your faith in me even during the time of Antipas , my faithful witness who was killed in your city , where Satan lives .
NCV	Revelation	2	14	“ But I have a few things against you : You have some there who follow the teaching of Balaam . He taught Balak how to cause the people of Israel to sin by eating food offered to idols and by taking part in sexual sins .
NCV	Revelation	2	15	You also have some who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans . [ b ]
NCV	Revelation	2	16	So change your hearts and lives . If you do not , I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword that comes out of my mouth .
NCV	Revelation	2	17	“ Everyone who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches . “ I will give some of the hidden manna to everyone who wins the victory . I will also give to each one who wins the victory a white stone with a new name written on it . No one knows this new name except the one who receives it . To the Church in Thyatira
NCV	Revelation	2	18	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Thyatira : “ The Son of God , who has eyes that blaze like fire and feet like shining bronze , says this :
NCV	Revelation	2	19	I know what you do . I know about your love , your faith , your service , and your patience . I know that you are doing more now than you did at first .
NCV	Revelation	2	20	“ But I have this against you : You let that woman Jezebel spread false teachings . She says she is a prophetess , but by her teaching she leads my people to take part in sexual sins and to eat food that is offered to idols .
NCV	Revelation	2	21	I have given her time to change her heart and turn away from her sin , but she does not want to change .
NCV	Revelation	2	22	So I will throw her on a bed of suffering . And all those who take part in adultery with her will suffer greatly if they do not turn away from the wrongs she does .
NCV	Revelation	2	23	I will also kill her followers . Then all the churches will know I am the One who searches hearts and minds , and I will repay each of you for what you have done .
NCV	Revelation	2	24	“ But others of you in Thyatira have not followed her teaching and have not learned what some call Satan ’ s deep secrets . I say to you that I will not put any other load on you .

NCV	Revelation	3	3	So do not forget what you have received and heard . Obey it , and change your hearts and lives . So you must wake up , or I will come like a thief , and you will not know when I will come to you .
NCV	Revelation	3	2	Wake up ! Strengthen what you have left before it dies completely . I have found that what you are doing is less than what my God wants .
NCV	Revelation	3	4	But you have a few there in Sardis who have kept their clothes unstained , so they will walk with me and will wear white clothes , because they are worthy .
NCV	Revelation	3	5	Those who win the victory will be dressed in white clothes like them . And I will not erase their names from the book of life , but I will say they belong to me before my Father and before his angels .
NCV	Revelation	3	6	Everyone who has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches . To the Church in Philadelphia
NCV	Revelation	3	7	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Philadelphia : “ This is what the One who is holy and true , who holds the key of David , says . When he opens a door , no one can close it . And when he closes it , no one can open it .

NCV	Revelation	3	14	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Laodicea : “ The Amen , [ b ] the faithful and true witness , the ruler of all God has made , says this :
NCV	Revelation	3	15	I know what you do , that you are not hot or cold . I wish that you were hot or cold !
NCV	Revelation	3	16	But because you are lukewarm—neither hot , nor cold—I am ready to spit you out of my mouth .
NCV	Revelation	3	17	You say , ‘ I am rich , and I have become wealthy and do not need anything. ’ But you do not know that you are really miserable , pitiful , poor , blind , and naked .
NCV	Revelation	3	18	I advise you to buy from me gold made pure in fire so you can be truly rich . Buy from me white clothes so you can be clothed and so you can cover your shameful nakedness . Buy from me medicine to put on your eyes so you can truly see .

NCV	Revelation	4	4	Around the throne there were twenty-four other thrones with twenty-four elders sitting on them . They were dressed in white and had golden crowns on their heads .
NCV	Revelation	4	2	Immediately I was in the Spirit , and before me was a throne in heaven , and someone was sitting on it .
NCV	Revelation	4	3	The One who sat on the throne looked like precious stones , like jasper and carnelian . All around the throne was a rainbow the color of an emerald .
NCV	Revelation	4	5	Lightning flashes and noises and thunder came from the throne . Before the throne seven lamps were burning , which are the seven spirits of God .
NCV	Revelation	4	6	Also before the throne there was something that looked like a sea of glass , clear like crystal . In the center and around the throne were four living creatures with eyes all over them , in front and in back .
NCV	Revelation	4	7	The first living creature was like a lion . The second was like a calf . The third had a face like a man . The fourth was like a flying eagle .
NCV	Revelation	4	8	Each of these four living creatures had six wings and was covered all over with eyes , inside and out . Day and night they never stop saying : “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God Almighty . He was , he is , and he is coming. ”
NCV	Revelation	4	9	These living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to the One who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever .
NCV	Revelation	4	10	Then the twenty-four elders bow down before the One who sits on the throne , and they worship him who lives forever and ever . They put their crowns down before the throne and say :
NCV	Revelation	4	11	“ You are worthy , our Lord and God , to receive glory and honor and power , because you made all things . Everything existed and was made , because you wanted it. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Revelation	5	5	But one of the elders said to me , “ Do not cry ! The Lion [ a ] from the tribe of Judah , David ’ s descendant , has won the victory so that he is able to open the scroll and its seven seals. ”
NCV	Revelation	5	2	And I saw a powerful angel calling in a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll ? ”
NCV	Revelation	5	3	But there was no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth who could open the scroll or look inside it .
NCV	Revelation	5	4	I cried bitterly because there was no one who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside .
NCV	Revelation	5	6	Then I saw a Lamb standing in the center of the throne and in the middle of the four living creatures and the elders . The Lamb looked as if he had been killed . He had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God that were sent into all the world .
NCV	Revelation	5	7	The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One sitting on the throne .
NCV	Revelation	5	8	When he took the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders bowed down before the Lamb . Each one of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of God ’ s holy people .
NCV	Revelation	5	9	And they all sang a new song to the Lamb : “ You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals , because you were killed , and with the blood of your death you bought people for God from every tribe , language , people , and nation .
NCV	Revelation	5	10	You made them to be a kingdom of priests for our God , and they will rule on the earth. ”
NCV	Revelation	5	11	Then I looked , and I heard the voices of many angels around the throne , and the four living creatures , and the elders . There were thousands and thousands of angels ,
NCV	Revelation	5	12	saying in a loud voice : “ The Lamb who was killed is worthy to receive power , wealth , wisdom , and strength , honor , glory , and praise ! ”
NCV	Revelation	5	13	Then I heard all creatures in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea saying : “ To the One who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever. ”
NCV	Revelation	5	14	The four living creatures said , “ Amen , ” and the elders bowed down and worshiped . Footnotes - 5:5 Lion Here refers to Christ . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Revelation	6	6	Then I heard something that sounded like a voice coming from the middle of the four living creatures . The voice said , “ A quart of wheat for a day ’ s pay , and three quarts of barley for a day ’ s pay , and do not damage the olive oil and wine ! ”
NCV	Revelation	6	2	I looked , and there before me was a white horse . The rider on the horse held a bow , and he was given a crown , and he rode out , determined to win the victory .
NCV	Revelation	6	3	When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , “ Come ! ”
NCV	Revelation	6	4	Then another horse came out , a red one . Its rider was given power to take away peace from the earth and to make people kill each other , and he was given a big sword .
NCV	Revelation	6	5	When the Lamb opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , “ Come ! ” I looked , and there before me was a black horse , and its rider held a pair of scales in his hand .
NCV	Revelation	6	7	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , “ Come ! ”
NCV	Revelation	6	8	I looked , and there before me was a pale horse . Its rider was named death , and Hades [ a ] was following close behind him . They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill people by war , by starvation , by disease , and by the wild animals of the earth .
NCV	Revelation	6	9	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the word of God and to the message they had received .
NCV	Revelation	6	10	These souls shouted in a loud voice , “ Holy and true Lord , how long until you judge the people of the earth and punish them for killing us ? ”
NCV	Revelation	6	11	Then each one of them was given a white robe and was told to wait a short time longer . There were still some of their fellow servants and brothers and sisters in the service of Christ who must be killed as they were . They had to wait until all of this was finished .
NCV	Revelation	6	12	Then I watched while the Lamb opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . The sun became black like rough black cloth , and the whole moon became red like blood .
NCV	Revelation	6	13	And the stars in the sky fell to the earth like figs falling from a fig tree when the wind blows .
NCV	Revelation	6	14	The sky disappeared as a scroll when it is rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
NCV	Revelation	6	15	Then the kings of the earth , the rulers , the generals , the rich people , the powerful people , the slaves , and the free people hid themselves in caves and in the rocks on the mountains .
NCV	Revelation	6	16	They called to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us . Hide us from the face of the One who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb !
NCV	Revelation	6	17	The great day for their anger has come , and who can stand against it ? ” Footnotes - 6:8 Hades The unseen world of the dead . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Revelation	7	7	from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand , from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand , from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand ,
NCV	Revelation	7	2	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east who had the seal of the living God . And he called out in a loud voice to the four angels to whom God had given power to harm the earth and the sea .
NCV	Revelation	7	3	He said to them , “ Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we mark with a sign the foreheads of the people who serve our God. ”
NCV	Revelation	7	4	Then I heard how many people were marked with the sign . There were one hundred forty-four thousand from every tribe of the people of Israel .

NCV	Revelation	7	9	After the vision of these things I looked , and there was a great number of people , so many that no one could count them . They were from every nation , tribe , people , and language of the earth . They were all standing before the throne and before the Lamb , wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands .
NCV	Revelation	7	10	They were shouting in a loud voice , “ Salvation belongs to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb. ”
NCV	Revelation	7	11	All the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures . They all bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God ,
NCV	Revelation	7	12	saying , “ Amen ! Praise , glory , wisdom , thanks , honor , power , and strength belong to our God forever and ever . Amen ! ”
NCV	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders asked me , “ Who are these people dressed in white robes ? Where did they come from ? ”
NCV	Revelation	7	14	I answered , “ You know , sir. ” And the elder said to me , “ These are the people who have come out of the great distress . They have washed their robes [ a ] and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
NCV	Revelation	7	15	Because of this , they are before the throne of God . They worship him day and night in his temple . And the One who sits on the throne will be present with them .

NCV	Revelation	8	8	Then the second angel blew his trumpet , and something that looked like a big mountain , burning with fire , was thrown into the sea . And a third of the sea became blood ,
NCV	Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God and to whom were given seven trumpets .
NCV	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came and stood at the altar , holding a golden pan for incense . He was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all God ’ s holy people . The angel put this offering on the golden altar before the throne .
NCV	Revelation	8	4	The smoke from the incense went up from the angel ’ s hand to God with the prayers of God ’ s people .
NCV	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel filled the incense pan with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth , and there were flashes of lightning , thunder and loud noises , and an earthquake . The Seven Angels and Trumpets
NCV	Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them .
NCV	Revelation	8	7	The first angel blew his trumpet , and hail and fire mixed with blood were poured down on the earth . And a third of the earth , and all the green grass , and a third of the trees were burned up .
NCV	Revelation	8	9	a third of the living things in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
NCV	Revelation	8	10	Then the third angel blew his trumpet , and a large star , burning like a torch , fell from the sky . It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
NCV	Revelation	8	11	The name of the star is Wormwood . [ a ] And a third of all the water became bitter , and many people died from drinking the water that was bitter .
NCV	Revelation	8	12	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and a third of the sun , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars were struck . So a third of them became dark , and a third of the day was without light , and also the night .
NCV	Revelation	8	13	While I watched , I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air cry out in a loud voice , “ Trouble ! Trouble !

NCV	Revelation	9	9	Their chests looked like iron breastplates , and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .
NCV	Revelation	9	2	Then it opened up the hole that leads to the bottomless pit , and smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace . Then the sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .
NCV	Revelation	9	3	Then locusts came down to the earth out of the smoke , and they were given the power to sting like scorpions . [ a ]
NCV	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or tree . They could harm only the people who did not have the sign of God on their foreheads .
NCV	Revelation	9	5	These locusts were not given the power to kill anyone , but to cause pain to the people for five months . And the pain they felt was like the pain a scorpion gives when it stings someone .
NCV	Revelation	9	6	During those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it . They will want to die , but death will run away from them .
NCV	Revelation	9	7	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle . On their heads they wore what looked like crowns of gold , and their faces looked like human faces .
NCV	Revelation	9	8	Their hair was like women ’ s hair , and their teeth were like lions ’ teeth .
NCV	Revelation	9	10	The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions , and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months .
NCV	Revelation	9	11	The locusts had a king who was the angel of the bottomless pit . His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon and in the Greek language is Apollyon . [ b ]
NCV	Revelation	9	12	The first trouble is past ; there are still two other troubles that will come .
NCV	Revelation	9	13	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and I heard a voice coming from the horns on the golden altar that is before God .
NCV	Revelation	9	14	The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ Free the four angels who are tied at the great river Euphrates. ”
NCV	Revelation	9	15	And they let loose the four angels who had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year so they could kill a third of all people on the earth .
NCV	Revelation	9	16	I heard how many troops on horses were in their army—two hundred million .
NCV	Revelation	9	17	The horses and their riders I saw in the vision looked like this : They had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur . The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions , with fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
NCV	Revelation	9	18	A third of all the people on earth were killed by these three terrible disasters coming out of the horses ’ mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .
NCV	Revelation	9	19	The horses ’ power was in their mouths and in their tails ; their tails were like snakes with heads , and with them they hurt people .
NCV	Revelation	9	20	The other people who were not killed by these terrible disasters still did not change their hearts and turn away from what they had made with their own hands . They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood—things that can not see or hear or walk .

NCV	Revelation	10	10	So I took the small scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . In my mouth it tasted sweet as honey , but after I ate it , it was sour in my stomach .
NCV	Revelation	10	2	The angel was holding a small scroll open in his hand . He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
NCV	Revelation	10	3	Then he shouted loudly like the roaring of a lion . And when he shouted , the voices of seven thunders spoke .
NCV	Revelation	10	4	When the seven thunders spoke , I started to write . But I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Keep hidden what the seven thunders said , and do not write them down. ”
NCV	Revelation	10	5	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven ,
NCV	Revelation	10	6	and he made a promise by the power of the One who lives forever and ever . He is the One who made the skies and all that is in them , the earth and all that is in it , and the sea and all that is in it . The angel promised , “ There will be no more waiting !
NCV	Revelation	10	7	In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet , God ’ s secret will be finished . This secret is the Good News God told to his servants , the prophets. ”
NCV	Revelation	10	8	Then I heard the same voice from heaven again , saying to me : “ Go and take the open scroll that is in the hand of the angel that is standing on the sea and on the land. ”
NCV	Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll . And he said to me , “ Take the scroll and eat it . It will be sour in your stomach , but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey. ”

NCV	Revelation	11	11	But after three and one-half days , God put the breath of life into the two prophets again . They stood on their feet , and everyone who saw them became very afraid .
NCV	Revelation	11	2	But do not measure the yard outside the temple . Leave it alone , because it has been given to those who are not God ’ s people . And they will trample on the holy city for forty-two months .
NCV	Revelation	11	3	And I will give power to my two witnesses to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days , and they will be dressed in rough cloth to show their sadness. ”
NCV	Revelation	11	4	These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth .
NCV	Revelation	11	5	And if anyone tries to hurt them , fire comes from their mouths and kills their enemies . And if anyone tries to hurt them in whatever way , in that same way that person will die .
NCV	Revelation	11	6	These witnesses have the power to stop the sky from raining during the time they are prophesying . And they have power to make the waters become blood , and they have power to send every kind of trouble to the earth as many times as they want .
NCV	Revelation	11	7	When the two witnesses have finished telling their message , the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will fight a war against them . He will defeat them and kill them .
NCV	Revelation	11	8	The bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city where the Lord was killed . This city is named Sodom [ a ] and Egypt , which has a spiritual meaning .
NCV	Revelation	11	9	Those from every race of people , tribe , language , and nation will look at the bodies of the two witnesses for three and one-half days , and they will refuse to bury them .
NCV	Revelation	11	10	People who live on the earth will rejoice and be happy because these two are dead . They will send each other gifts , because these two prophets brought much suffering to those who live on the earth .
NCV	Revelation	11	12	Then the two prophets heard a loud voice from heaven saying , “ Come up here ! ” And they went up into heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched .
NCV	Revelation	11	13	In the same hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city was destroyed . Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and those who did not die were very afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven .
NCV	Revelation	11	14	The second trouble is finished . Pay attention : The third trouble is coming soon . The Seventh Trumpet
NCV	Revelation	11	15	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet . And there were loud voices in heaven , saying : “ The power to rule the world now belongs to our Lord and his Christ , and he will rule forever and ever. ”
NCV	Revelation	11	16	Then the twenty-four elders , who sit on their thrones before God , bowed down on their faces and worshiped God .
NCV	Revelation	11	17	They said : “ We give thanks to you , Lord God Almighty , who is and who was , because you have used your great power and have begun to rule !
NCV	Revelation	11	18	The people of the world were angry , but your anger has come . The time has come to judge the dead , and to reward your servants the prophets and your holy people , all who respect you , great and small . The time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth ! ”
NCV	Revelation	11	19	Then God ’ s temple in heaven was opened . The Ark that holds the agreement God gave to his people could be seen in his temple .

NCV	Revelation	12	12	So rejoice , you heavens and all who live there ! But it will be terrible for the earth and the sea , because the devil has come down to you ! He is filled with anger , because he knows he does not have much time. ”
NCV	Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant and cried out with pain , because she was about to give birth .
NCV	Revelation	12	3	Then another wonder appeared in heaven : There was a giant red dragon with seven heads and seven crowns on each head . He also had ten horns .
NCV	Revelation	12	4	His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth . He stood in front of the woman who was ready to give birth so he could eat her baby as soon as it was born .
NCV	Revelation	12	5	Then the woman gave birth to a son who will rule all the nations with an iron rod . And her child was taken up to God and to his throne .
NCV	Revelation	12	6	The woman ran away into the desert to a place God prepared for her where she would be taken care of for one thousand two hundred sixty days .
NCV	Revelation	12	7	Then there was a war in heaven . Michael [ a ] and his angels fought against the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought back .
NCV	Revelation	12	8	But the dragon was not strong enough , and he and his angels lost their place in heaven .
NCV	Revelation	12	9	The giant dragon was thrown down out of heaven . ( He is that old snake called the devil or Satan , who tricks the whole world . ) The dragon with his angels was thrown down to the earth .
NCV	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying : “ The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have now come . The accuser of our brothers and sisters , who accused them day and night before our God , has been thrown down .
NCV	Revelation	12	11	And our brothers and sisters defeated him by the blood of the Lamb ’ s death and by the message they preached . They did not love their lives so much that they were afraid of death .
NCV	Revelation	12	13	When the dragon saw he had been thrown down to the earth , he hunted for the woman who had given birth to the son .
NCV	Revelation	12	14	But the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so she could fly to the place prepared for her in the desert . There she would be taken care of for three and one-half years , away from the snake .
NCV	Revelation	12	15	Then the snake poured water out of its mouth like a river toward the woman so the flood would carry her away .
NCV	Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that came from the mouth of the dragon .
NCV	Revelation	12	17	Then the dragon was very angry at the woman , and he went off to make war against all her other children—those who obey God ’ s commands and who have the message Jesus taught .

NCV	Revelation	13	13	And the second beast does great miracles so that it even makes fire come down from heaven to earth while people are watching .
NCV	Revelation	13	2	This beast looked like a leopard , with feet like a bear ’ s feet and a mouth like a lion ’ s mouth . And the dragon gave the beast all of his power and his throne and great authority .
NCV	Revelation	13	3	One of the heads of the beast looked as if it had been killed by a wound , but this death wound was healed . Then the whole world was amazed and followed the beast .
NCV	Revelation	13	4	People worshiped the dragon because he had given his power to the beast . And they also worshiped the beast , asking , “ Who is like the beast ? Who can make war against it ? ”
NCV	Revelation	13	5	The beast was allowed to say proud words and words against God , and it was allowed to use its power for forty-two months .
NCV	Revelation	13	6	It used its mouth to speak against God , against God ’ s name , against the place where God lives , and against all those who live in heaven .
NCV	Revelation	13	7	It was given power to make war against God ’ s holy people and to defeat them . It was given power over every tribe , people , language , and nation .
NCV	Revelation	13	8	And all who live on earth will worship the beast—all the people since the beginning of the world whose names are not written in the Lamb ’ s book of life . The Lamb is the One who was killed .
NCV	Revelation	13	9	Anyone who has ears should listen :
NCV	Revelation	13	10	If you are to be a prisoner , then you will be a prisoner . If you are to be killed with the sword , then you will be killed with the sword . This means that God ’ s holy people must have patience and faith .
NCV	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth . It had two horns like a lamb , but it spoke like a dragon .
NCV	Revelation	13	12	This beast stands before the first beast and uses the same power the first beast has . By this power it makes everyone living on earth worship the first beast , who had the death wound that was healed .
NCV	Revelation	13	14	It fools those who live on earth by the miracles it has been given the power to do . It does these miracles to serve the first beast . The second beast orders people to make an idol to honor the first beast , the one that was wounded by the deadly sword but sprang to life again .
NCV	Revelation	13	15	The second beast was given power to give life to the idol of the first one so that the idol could speak . And the second beast was given power to command all who will not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
NCV	Revelation	13	16	The second beast also forced all people , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead .
NCV	Revelation	13	17	No one could buy or sell without this mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of its name .
NCV	Revelation	13	18	This takes wisdom . Let the one who has understanding find the meaning of the number , which is the number of a person . Its number is

NCV	Revelation	14	14	Then I looked , and there before me was a white cloud , and sitting on the white cloud was One who looked like a Son of Man . [ b ] He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle [ c ] in his hand .
NCV	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a sound from heaven like the noise of flooding water and like the sound of loud thunder . The sound I heard was like people playing harps .
NCV	Revelation	14	3	And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn the new song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been bought from the earth .
NCV	Revelation	14	4	These are the ones who did not do sinful things with women , because they kept themselves pure . They follow the Lamb every place he goes . These one hundred forty-four thousand were bought from among the people of the earth as people to be offered to God and the Lamb .
NCV	Revelation	14	5	They were not guilty of telling lies ; they are without fault . The Three Angels
NCV	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel flying high in the air . He had the eternal Good News to preach to those who live on earth—to every nation , tribe , language , and people .
NCV	Revelation	14	7	He preached in a loud voice , “ Fear God and give him praise , because the time has come for God to judge all people . So worship God who made the heavens , and the earth , and the sea , and the springs of water. ”
NCV	Revelation	14	8	Then the second angel followed the first angel and said , “ Ruined , ruined is the great city of Babylon ! She made all the nations drink the wine of the anger of her adultery. ”
NCV	Revelation	14	9	Then a third angel followed the first two angels , saying in a loud voice : “ If anyone worships the beast and his idol and gets the beast ’ s mark on the forehead or on the hand ,
NCV	Revelation	14	10	that one also will drink the wine of God ’ s anger , which is prepared with all its strength in the cup of his anger . And that person will be put in pain with burning sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb .
NCV	Revelation	14	11	And the smoke from their burning pain will rise forever and ever . There will be no rest , day or night , for those who worship the beast and his idol or who get the mark of his name. ”
NCV	Revelation	14	12	This means God ’ s holy people must be patient . They must obey God ’ s commands and keep their faith in Jesus .
NCV	Revelation	14	13	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Write this : Blessed are the dead who die from now on in the Lord. ” The Spirit says , “ Yes , they will rest from their hard work , and the reward of all they have done stays with them. ” The Earth Is Harvested
NCV	Revelation	14	15	Then another angel came out of the temple and called out in a loud voice to the One who was sitting on the cloud , “ Take your sickle and harvest from the earth , because the time to harvest has come , and the fruit of the earth is ripe. ”
NCV	Revelation	14	16	So the One who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
NCV	Revelation	14	17	Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he also had a sharp sickle .
NCV	Revelation	14	18	And then another angel , who has power over the fire , came from the altar . This angel called to the angel with the sharp sickle , saying , “ Take your sharp sickle and gather the bunches of grapes from the earth ’ s vine , because its grapes are ripe. ”
NCV	Revelation	14	19	Then the angel swung his sickle over the earth . He gathered the earth ’ s grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God ’ s anger .
NCV	Revelation	14	20	They were trampled in the winepress outside the city , and blood flowed out of the winepress as high as horses ’ bridles for a distance of about one hundred eighty miles . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Revelation	15	15	Then I saw another wonder in heaven that was great and amazing . There were seven angels bringing seven disasters . These are the last disasters , because after them , God ’ s anger is finished .
NCV	Revelation	15	2	I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire . All of those who had won the victory over the beast and his idol and over the number of his name were standing by the sea of glass . They had harps that God had given them .
NCV	Revelation	15	3	They sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb : “ You do great and wonderful things , Psalm 111:2 Lord God Almighty . Amos 3:13 Everything the Lord does is right and true , Psalm 145:17 King of the nations . [ a ]

NCV	Revelation	15	5	After this I saw that the temple ( the Tent of the Agreement ) in heaven was opened .
NCV	Revelation	15	6	And the seven angels bringing the seven disasters came out of the temple . They were dressed in clean , shining linen and wore golden bands tied around their chests .
NCV	Revelation	15	7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the anger of God , who lives forever and ever .
NCV	Revelation	15	8	The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and the power of God , and no one could enter the temple until the seven disasters of the seven angels were finished .

NCV	Revelation	16	16	Then the evil spirits gathered the kings together to the place that is called Armageddon in the Hebrew language .
NCV	Revelation	16	2	The first angel left and poured out his bowl on the land . Then ugly and painful sores came upon all those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his idol .
NCV	Revelation	16	3	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea , and it became blood like that of a dead man , and every living thing in the sea died .
NCV	Revelation	16	4	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water , and they became blood .
NCV	Revelation	16	5	Then I heard the angel of the waters saying : “ Holy One , you are the One who is and who was . You are right to decide to punish these evil people .
NCV	Revelation	16	6	They have poured out the blood of your holy people and your prophets . So now you have given them blood to drink as they deserve. ”
NCV	Revelation	16	7	And I heard a voice coming from the altar saying : “ Yes , Lord God Almighty , the way you punish evil people is right and fair. ”
NCV	Revelation	16	8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and he was given power to burn the people with fire .
NCV	Revelation	16	9	They were burned by the great heat , and they cursed the name of God , who had control over these disasters . But the people refused to change their hearts and lives and give glory to God .
NCV	Revelation	16	10	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and darkness covered its kingdom . People gnawed their tongues because of the pain .
NCV	Revelation	16	11	They also cursed the God of heaven because of their pain and the sores they had , but they refused to change their hearts and turn away from the evil things they did .
NCV	Revelation	16	12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates so that the water in the river was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east to come .
NCV	Revelation	16	13	Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon , out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
NCV	Revelation	16	14	These evil spirits are the spirits of demons , which have power to do miracles . They go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them together for the battle on the great day of God Almighty .
NCV	Revelation	16	15	“ Listen ! I will come as a thief comes ! Blessed are those who stay awake and keep their clothes on so that they will not walk around naked and have people see their shame. ”
NCV	Revelation	16	17	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air . Then a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne , saying , “ It is finished ! ”
NCV	Revelation	16	18	Then there were flashes of lightning , noises , thunder , and a big earthquake—the worst earthquake that has ever happened since people have been on earth .
NCV	Revelation	16	19	The great city split into three parts , and the cities of the nations were destroyed . And God remembered the sins of Babylon the Great , so he gave that city the cup filled with the wine of his terrible anger .

NCV	Revelation	17	2	The kings of the earth sinned sexually with her , and the people of the earth became drunk from the wine of her sexual sin. ”
NCV	Revelation	17	3	Then the angel carried me away by the Spirit to the desert . There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast . It was covered with names against God written on it , and it had seven heads and ten horns .
NCV	Revelation	17	4	The woman was dressed in purple and red and was shining with the gold , precious jewels , and pearls she was wearing . She had a golden cup in her hand , a cup filled with evil things and the uncleanness of her sexual sin .
NCV	Revelation	17	5	On her forehead a title was written that was secret . This is what was written : the great babylon mother of prostitutes and of the evil things of the earth
NCV	Revelation	17	6	Then I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God ’ s holy people and with the blood of those who were killed because of their faith in Jesus . When I saw the woman , I was very amazed .
NCV	Revelation	17	7	Then the angel said to me , “ Why are you amazed ? I will tell you the secret of this woman and the beast she rides—the one with seven heads and ten horns .
NCV	Revelation	17	8	The beast you saw was once alive but is not alive now . But soon it will come up out of the bottomless pit and go away to be destroyed . There are people who live on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life since the beginning of the world . They will be amazed when they see the beast , because he was once alive , is not alive now , but will come again .
NCV	Revelation	17	9	“ You need a wise mind to understand this . The seven heads on the beast are seven mountains where the woman sits .
NCV	Revelation	17	10	And they are seven kings . Five of the kings have already been destroyed , one of the kings lives now , and another has not yet come . When he comes , he must stay a short time .
NCV	Revelation	17	11	The beast that was once alive , but is not alive now , is also an eighth king . He belongs to the first seven kings , and he will go away to be destroyed .
NCV	Revelation	17	12	“ The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet begun to rule , but they will receive power to rule with the beast for one hour .
NCV	Revelation	17	13	All ten of these kings have the same purpose , and they will give their power and authority to the beast .
NCV	Revelation	17	14	They will make war against the Lamb , but the Lamb will defeat them , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings . He will defeat them with his called , chosen , and faithful followers. ”
NCV	Revelation	17	15	Then the angel said to me , “ The waters that you saw , where the prostitute sits , are peoples , races , nations , and languages .
NCV	Revelation	17	16	The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute . They will take everything she has and leave her naked . They will eat her body and burn her with fire .

NCV	Revelation	18	18	As they saw the smoke from her burning , they cried out loudly , “ There was never a city like this great city ! ”
NCV	Revelation	18	2	He shouted in a powerful voice : “ Ruined , ruined is the great city of Babylon ! She has become a home for demons and a prison for every evil spirit , and a prison for every unclean bird and unclean beast .
NCV	Revelation	18	3	She has been ruined , because all the peoples of the earth have drunk the wine of the desire of her sexual sin . She has been ruined also because the kings of the earth have sinned sexually with her , and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the great wealth of her luxury. ”
NCV	Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying : “ Come out of that city , my people , so that you will not share in her sins , so that you will not receive the disasters that will come to her .
NCV	Revelation	18	5	Her sins have piled up as high as the sky , and God has not forgotten the wrongs she has done .
NCV	Revelation	18	6	Give that city the same as she gave to others . Pay her back twice as much as she did . Prepare wine for her that is twice as strong as the wine she prepared for others .
NCV	Revelation	18	7	She gave herself much glory and rich living . Give her that much suffering and sadness . She says to herself , ‘ I am a queen sitting on my throne . I am not a widow ; I will never be sad. ’
NCV	Revelation	18	8	So these disasters will come to her in one day : death , and crying , and great hunger , and she will be destroyed by fire , because the Lord God who judges her is powerful. ”
NCV	Revelation	18	9	The kings of the earth who sinned sexually with her and shared her wealth will see the smoke from her burning . Then they will cry and be sad because of her death .
NCV	Revelation	18	10	They will be afraid of her suffering and stand far away and say : “ Terrible ! How terrible for you , great city , powerful city of Babylon , because your punishment has come in one hour ! ”
NCV	Revelation	18	11	And the merchants of the earth will cry and be sad about her , because now there is no one to buy their cargoes—
NCV	Revelation	18	12	cargoes of gold , silver , jewels , pearls , fine linen , purple cloth , silk , red cloth ; all kinds of citron wood and all kinds of things made from ivory , expensive wood , bronze , iron , and marble ;
NCV	Revelation	18	13	cinnamon , spice , incense , myrrh , frankincense , wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat , cattle , sheep , horses , carriages , slaves , and human lives .
NCV	Revelation	18	14	The merchants will say , “ Babylon , the good things you wanted are gone from you . All your rich and fancy things have disappeared . You will never have them again. ”
NCV	Revelation	18	15	The merchants who became rich from selling to her will be afraid of her suffering and will stand far away . They will cry and be sad
NCV	Revelation	18	16	and say : “ Terrible ! How terrible for the great city ! She was dressed in fine linen , purple and red cloth , and she was shining with gold , precious jewels , and pearls !
NCV	Revelation	18	17	All these riches have been destroyed in one hour ! ” Every sea captain , every passenger , the sailors , and all those who earn their living from the sea stood far away from Babylon .
NCV	Revelation	18	19	And they threw dust on their heads and cried out , weeping and being sad . They said : “ Terrible ! How terrible for the great city ! All the people who had ships on the sea became rich because of her wealth ! But she has been destroyed in one hour !
NCV	Revelation	18	20	Be happy because of this , heaven ! Be happy , God ’ s holy people and apostles and prophets ! God has punished her because of what she did to you. ”
NCV	Revelation	18	21	Then a powerful angel picked up a large stone , like one used for grinding grain , and threw it into the sea . He said : “ In the same way , the great city of Babylon will be thrown down , and it will never be found again .
NCV	Revelation	18	22	The music of people playing harps and other instruments , flutes , and trumpets , will never be heard in you again . No workman doing any job will ever be found in you again . The sound of grinding grain will never be heard in you again .
NCV	Revelation	18	23	The light of a lamp will never shine in you again , and the voices of a bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again . Your merchants were the world ’ s great people , and all the nations were tricked by your magic .
NCV	Revelation	18	24	You are guilty of the death of the prophets and God ’ s holy people and all who have been killed on earth. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Revelation	19	19	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth . Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .
NCV	Revelation	19	2	because his judgments are true and right . He has punished the prostitute who made the earth evil with her sexual sin . He has paid her back for the death of his servants. ”
NCV	Revelation	19	3	Again they said : “ Hallelujah ! She is burning , and her smoke will rise forever and ever. ”
NCV	Revelation	19	4	Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures bowed down and worshiped God , who sits on the throne . They said : “ Amen , Hallelujah ! ”
NCV	Revelation	19	5	Then a voice came from the throne , saying : “ Praise our God , all you who serve him and all you who honor him , both small and great ! ”
NCV	Revelation	19	6	Then I heard what sounded like a great many people , like the noise of flooding water , and like the noise of loud thunder . The people were saying : “ Hallelujah ! Our Lord God , the Almighty , rules .
NCV	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and be happy and give God glory , because the wedding of the Lamb has come , and the Lamb ’ s bride has made herself ready .
NCV	Revelation	19	8	Fine linen , bright and clean , was given to her to wear. ” ( The fine linen means the good things done by God ’ s holy people . )
NCV	Revelation	19	9	And the angel said to me , “ Write this : Blessed are those who have been invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb ! ” And the angel said , “ These are the true words of God. ”
NCV	Revelation	19	10	Then I bowed down at the angel ’ s feet to worship him , but he said to me , “ Do not worship me ! I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the message of Jesus . Worship God , because the message about Jesus is the spirit that gives all prophecy. ” The Rider on the White Horse
NCV	Revelation	19	11	Then I saw heaven opened , and there before me was a white horse . The rider on the horse is called Faithful and True , and he is right when he judges and makes war .
NCV	Revelation	19	12	His eyes are like burning fire , and on his head are many crowns . He has a name written on him , which no one but himself knows .
NCV	Revelation	19	13	He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood , and his name is the Word of God .
NCV	Revelation	19	14	The armies of heaven , dressed in fine linen , white and clean , were following him on white horses .
NCV	Revelation	19	15	Out of the rider ’ s mouth comes a sharp sword that he will use to defeat the nations , and he will rule them with a rod of iron . He will crush out the wine in the winepress of the terrible anger of God the Almighty .
NCV	Revelation	19	16	On his robe and on his upper leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords .
NCV	Revelation	19	17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and he called with a loud voice to all the birds flying in the sky : “ Come and gather together for the great feast of God
NCV	Revelation	19	18	so that you can eat the bodies of kings , generals , mighty people , horses and their riders , and the bodies of all people—free , slave , small , and great. ”
NCV	Revelation	19	20	But the beast was captured and with him the false prophet who did the miracles for the beast . The false prophet had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his idol . The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
NCV	Revelation	19	21	And their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse , and all the birds ate the bodies until they were full . Footnotes - 19:1 Hallelujah This means “ praise God ! ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Revelation	20	20	I saw an angel coming down from heaven . He had the key to the bottomless pit and a large chain in his hand .
NCV	Revelation	20	2	The angel grabbed the dragon , that old snake who is the devil and Satan , and tied him up for a thousand years .
NCV	Revelation	20	3	Then he threw him into the bottomless pit , closed it , and locked it over him . The angel did this so he could not trick the people of the earth anymore until the thousand years were ended . After a thousand years he must be set free for a short time .
NCV	Revelation	20	4	Then I saw some thrones and people sitting on them who had been given the power to judge . And I saw the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the message of Jesus and the message from God . They had not worshiped the beast or his idol , and they had not received the mark of the beast on their foreheads or on their hands . They came back to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years .
NCV	Revelation	20	5	( The others that were dead did not live again until the thousand years were ended . ) This is the first raising of the dead .
NCV	Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy are those who share in this first raising of the dead . The second death has no power over them . They will be priests for God and for Christ and will rule with him for a thousand years .
NCV	Revelation	20	7	When the thousand years are over , Satan will be set free from his prison .
NCV	Revelation	20	8	Then he will go out to trick the nations in all the earth—Gog and Magog—to gather them for battle . There are so many people they will be like sand on the seashore .
NCV	Revelation	20	9	And Satan ’ s army marched across the earth and gathered around the camp of God ’ s people and the city God loves . But fire came down from heaven and burned them up .
NCV	Revelation	20	10	And Satan , who tricked them , was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur with the beast and the false prophet . There they will be punished day and night forever and ever . People of the World Are Judged
NCV	Revelation	20	11	Then I saw a great white throne and the One who was sitting on it . Earth and sky ran away from him and disappeared .
NCV	Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead , great and small , standing before the throne . Then books were opened , and the book of life was opened . The dead were judged by what they had done , which was written in the books .
NCV	Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up the dead who were in it , and Death and Hades [ a ] gave up the dead who were in them . Each person was judged by what he had done .
NCV	Revelation	20	14	And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . The lake of fire is the second death .
NCV	Revelation	20	15	And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire . Footnotes - 20:13 Hades The place of the dead . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Revelation	21	21	The twelve gates were twelve pearls , each gate having been made from a single pearl . And the street of the city was made of pure gold as clear as glass .
NCV	Revelation	21	2	And I saw the holy city , the new Jerusalem , [ a ] coming down out of heaven from God . It was prepared like a bride dressed for her husband .
NCV	Revelation	21	3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne , saying , “ Now God ’ s presence is with people , and he will live with them , and they will be his people . God himself will be with them and will be their God . [ b ]
NCV	Revelation	21	4	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes , and there will be no more death , sadness , crying , or pain , because all the old ways are gone. ”
NCV	Revelation	21	5	The One who was sitting on the throne said , “ Look ! I am making everything new ! ” Then he said , “ Write this , because these words are true and can be trusted. ”
NCV	Revelation	21	6	The One on the throne said to me , “ It is finished . I am the Alpha and the Omega , [ c ] the Beginning and the End . I will give free water from the spring of the water of life to anyone who is thirsty .
NCV	Revelation	21	7	Those who win the victory will receive this , and I will be their God , and they will be my children .
NCV	Revelation	21	8	But cowards , those who refuse to believe , who do evil things , who kill , who sin sexually , who do evil magic , who worship idols , and who tell lies—all these will have a place in the lake of burning sulfur . This is the second death. ”
NCV	Revelation	21	9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last troubles came to me , saying , “ Come with me , and I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb. ”
NCV	Revelation	21	10	And the angel carried me away by the Spirit to a very large and high mountain . He showed me the holy city , Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God .
NCV	Revelation	21	11	It was shining with the glory of God and was bright like a very expensive jewel , like a jasper , clear as crystal .
NCV	Revelation	21	12	The city had a great high wall with twelve gates with twelve angels at the gates , and on each gate was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel .
NCV	Revelation	21	13	There were three gates on the east , three on the north , three on the south , and three on the west .
NCV	Revelation	21	14	The walls of the city were built on twelve foundation stones , and on the stones were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
NCV	Revelation	21	15	The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod made of gold to measure the city , its gates , and its wall .
NCV	Revelation	21	16	The city was built in a square , and its length was equal to its width . The angel measured the city with the rod . The city was 1,500 miles long , 1,500 miles wide , and 1,500 miles high .
NCV	Revelation	21	17	The angel also measured the wall . It was
NCV	Revelation	21	216	feet high , by human measurements , which the angel was using .
NCV	Revelation	21	18	The wall was made of jasper , and the city was made of pure gold , as pure as glass .
NCV	Revelation	21	19	The foundation stones of the city walls were decorated with every kind of jewel . The first foundation was jasper , the second was sapphire , the third was chalcedony , the fourth was emerald ,
NCV	Revelation	21	20	the fifth was onyx , the sixth was carnelian , the seventh was chrysolite , the eighth was beryl , the ninth was topaz , the tenth was chrysoprase , the eleventh was jacinth , and the twelfth was amethyst .
NCV	Revelation	21	22	I did not see a temple in the city , because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the city ’ s temple .
NCV	Revelation	21	23	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it , because the glory of God is its light , and the Lamb is the city ’ s lamp .
NCV	Revelation	21	24	By its light the people of the world will walk , and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it .
NCV	Revelation	21	25	The city ’ s gates will never be shut on any day , because there is no night there .
NCV	Revelation	21	26	The glory and the honor of the nations will be brought into it .
NCV	Revelation	21	27	Nothing unclean and no one who does shameful things or tells lies will ever go into it . Only those whose names are written in the Lamb ’ s book of life will enter the city . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Revelation	22	22	Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life . It was shining like crystal and was flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
NCV	Revelation	22	2	down the middle of the street of the city . The tree of life was on each side of the river . It produces fruit twelve times a year , once each month . The leaves of the tree are for the healing of all the nations .
NCV	Revelation	22	3	Nothing that God judges guilty will be in that city . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there , and God ’ s servants will worship him .
NCV	Revelation	22	4	They will see his face , and his name will be written on their foreheads .
NCV	Revelation	22	5	There will never be night again . They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun , because the Lord God will give them light . And they will rule as kings forever and ever .
NCV	Revelation	22	6	The angel said to me , “ These words can be trusted and are true. ” The Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon .
NCV	Revelation	22	7	“ Listen ! I am coming soon ! Blessed is the one who obeys the words of prophecy in this book. ”
NCV	Revelation	22	8	I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . When I heard and saw them , I bowed down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed these things to me .

NCV	Revelation	22	10	Then the angel told me , “ Do not keep secret the words of prophecy in this book , because the time is near for all this to happen .
NCV	Revelation	22	11	Let whoever is doing evil continue to do evil . Let whoever is unclean continue to be unclean . Let whoever is doing right continue to do right . Let whoever is holy continue to be holy. ”
NCV	Revelation	22	12	“ Listen ! I am coming soon ! I will bring my reward with me , and I will repay each one of you for what you have done .

NCV	Revelation	22	14	“ Blessed are those who wash their robes [ b ] so that they will receive the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city .
NCV	Revelation	22	15	Outside the city are the evil people , those who do evil magic , who sin sexually , who murder , who worship idols , and who love lies and tell lies .
NCV	Revelation	22	16	“ I , Jesus , have sent my angel to tell you these things for the churches . I am the descendant from the family of David , and I am the bright morning star. ”
NCV	Revelation	22	17	The Spirit and the bride say , “ Come ! ” Let the one who hears this say , “ Come ! ” Let whoever is thirsty come ; whoever wishes may have the water of life as a free gift .
NCV	Revelation	22	18	I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book : If anyone adds anything to these words , God will add to that person the disasters written about in this book .
