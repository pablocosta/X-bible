CEV	Matthew	1	1	Jesus Christ came from the family of King David and also from the family of Abraham . And this is a list of his ancestors . Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , Judah and his brothers ( Judah 's sons were Perez and Zerah , and their mother was Tamar ) , Hezron ; Ram , Amminadab , Nahshon , Salmon , Boaz ( his mother was Rahab ) , Obed ( his mother was Ruth ) , Jesse , and King David . David , Solomon ( his mother had been Uriah 's wife ) , Rehoboam , Abijah , Asa , Jehoshaphat , Jehoram ; Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , Hezekiah , Manasseh , Amon , Josiah , and Jehoiachin and his brothers . 12-16 From the exile to the birth of Jesus , his ancestors were : Jehoiachin , Shealtiel , Zerubbabel , Abiud , Eliakim , Azor , Zadok , Achim ; Eliud , Eleazar , Matthan , Jacob , and Joseph , the husband of Mary , the mother of Jesus , who is called the Messiah .
CEV	Matthew	1	17	There were
CEV	Matthew	1	14	more to the birth of the Messiah . The Birth of Jesus ( Luke 2.1-7 )
CEV	Matthew	1	18	( B ) This is how Jesus Christ was born . A young woman named Mary was engaged to Joseph from King David 's family . But before they were married , she learned that she was going to have a baby by God 's Holy Spirit .
CEV	Matthew	1	19	Joseph was a good man [ a ] and did not want to embarrass Mary in front of everyone . So he decided to quietly call off the wedding .
CEV	Matthew	1	20	While Joseph was thinking about this , an angel from the Lord appeared to him in a dream . The angel said , “ Joseph , the baby that Mary will have is from the Holy Spirit . Go ahead and marry her .
CEV	Matthew	1	21	( C ) Then after her baby is born , name him Jesus , [ b ] because he will save his people from their sins. ”
CEV	Matthew	1	22	So the Lord 's promise came true , just as the prophet had said ,
CEV	Matthew	1	23	( D ) “ A virgin will have a baby boy , and he will be called Immanuel , ” which means “ God is with us. ”
CEV	Matthew	1	24	After Joseph woke up , he and Mary were soon married , just as the Lord 's angel had told him to do .
CEV	Matthew	1	25	( E ) But they did not sleep together before her baby was born . Then Joseph named him Jesus . Copyright ©

CEV	Matthew	2	2	and said , “ Where is the child born to be king of the Jews ? We saw his star in the east [ b ] and have come to worship him. ”
CEV	Matthew	2	3	When King Herod heard about this , he was worried , and so was everyone else in Jerusalem .
CEV	Matthew	2	4	Herod brought together the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses and asked them , “ Where will the Messiah be born ? ”
CEV	Matthew	2	5	They told him , “ He will be born in Bethlehem , just as the prophet wrote ,
CEV	Matthew	2	6	( A ) ‘ Bethlehem in the land of Judea , you are very important among the towns of Judea . From your town will come a leader , who will be like a shepherd for my people Israel. ’ ”
CEV	Matthew	2	7	Herod secretly called in the wise men and asked them when they had first seen the star .
CEV	Matthew	2	8	He told them , “ Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child . As soon as you find him , let me know . I also want to go and worship him. ”
CEV	Matthew	2	9	The wise men listened to what the king said and then left . And the star they had seen in the east went on ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was .
CEV	Matthew	2	10	They were thrilled and excited to see the star .
CEV	Matthew	2	11	When the men went into the house and saw the child with Mary , his mother , they knelt down and worshiped him . They took out their gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh [ c ] and gave them to him .
CEV	Matthew	2	12	Later they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod , and they went back home by another road . The Escape to Egypt
CEV	Matthew	2	13	After the wise men had gone , an angel from the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , “ Get up ! Hurry and take the child and his mother to Egypt ! Stay there until I tell you to return , because Herod is looking for the child and wants to kill him. ”
CEV	Matthew	2	14	That night , Joseph got up and took his wife and the child to Egypt ,
CEV	Matthew	2	15	( B ) where they stayed until Herod died . So the Lord 's promise came true , just as the prophet had said , “ I called my son out of Egypt. ” The Killing of the Children
CEV	Matthew	2	16	When Herod found out that the wise men from the east had tricked him , he was very angry . He gave orders for his men to kill all the boys who lived in or near Bethlehem and were two years old and younger . This was based on what he had learned from the wise men .
CEV	Matthew	2	17	So the Lord 's promise came true , just as the prophet Jeremiah had said ,
CEV	Matthew	2	18	( C ) “ In Ramah a voice was heard crying and weeping loudly . Rachel was mourning for her children , and she refused to be comforted , because they were dead. ” The Return from Egypt
CEV	Matthew	2	19	After King Herod died , an angel from the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph while he was still in Egypt .
CEV	Matthew	2	20	The angel said , “ Get up and take the child and his mother back to Israel . The people who wanted to kill him are now dead. ”
CEV	Matthew	2	21	Joseph got up and left with them for Israel .
CEV	Matthew	2	22	But when he heard that Herod 's son Archelaus was now ruler of Judea , he was afraid to go there . Then in a dream he was told to go to Galilee ,
CEV	Matthew	2	23	( D ) and they went to live there in the town of Nazareth . So the Lord 's promise came true , just as the prophet had said , “ He will be called a Nazarene. ” [ d ] Footnotes - 2.1 wise men : People famous for studying the stars . - 2.2 his star in the east : Or “ his star rise. ” - 2.11 frankincense , and myrrh : Frankincense was a valuable powder that was burned to make a sweet smell .

CEV	Matthew	3	15	Jesus answered , “ For now this is how it should be , because we must do all God wants us to do. ” Then John agreed .

CEV	Matthew	4	5	Next , the devil took Jesus into the holy city to the highest part of the temple .
CEV	Matthew	4	6	( C ) The devil said , “ If you are God 's Son , jump off . The Scriptures say : ‘ God will give his angels orders about you . They will catch you in their arms , and you wo n't hurt your feet on the stones. ’ ”

CEV	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil left Jesus , and angels came to help him . Jesus Begins His Work ( Mark 1.14,15 ; Luke 4.14,15 )

CEV	Matthew	4	13	( G ) But instead of staying in Nazareth , Jesus moved to Capernaum . This town was beside Lake Galilee in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali . [ b ]

CEV	Matthew	4	16	Although your people live in darkness , they will see a bright light . Although they live in the shadow of death , a light will shine on them. ”

CEV	Matthew	5	14	( I ) You are the light for the whole world . A city built on top of a hill can not be hidden ,
CEV	Matthew	5	15	( J ) and no one lights a lamp and puts it under a clay pot . Instead , it is placed on a lampstand , where it can give light to everyone in the house .
CEV	Matthew	5	16	( K ) Make your light shine , so others will see the good you do and will praise your Father in heaven . The Law of Moses
CEV	Matthew	5	17	Do n't suppose I came to do away with the Law and the Prophets . [ e ] I did not come to do away with them , but to give them their full meaning .

CEV	Matthew	5	21	( M ) You know our ancestors were told , “ Do not murder ” and “ A murderer must be brought to trial. ”
CEV	Matthew	5	22	But I promise you if you are angry with someone , [ f ] you will have to stand trial . If you call someone a fool , you will be taken to court . And if you say that someone is worthless , you will be in danger of the fires of hell .

CEV	Matthew	5	31	( Q ) You have been taught that a man who divorces his wife must write out divorce papers for her . [ g ]
CEV	Matthew	5	32	( R ) But I tell you not to divorce your wife unless she has committed some terrible sexual sin . [ h ] If you divorce her , you will cause her to be unfaithful , just as any man who marries her is guilty of taking another man 's wife . Promises
CEV	Matthew	5	33	( S ) You know our ancestors were told , “ Do n't use the Lord 's name to make a promise unless you are going to keep it. ”
CEV	Matthew	5	34	( T ) But I tell you not to swear by anything when you make a promise ! Heaven is God 's throne , so do n't swear by heaven .
CEV	Matthew	5	35	( U ) The earth is God 's footstool , so do n't swear by the earth . Jerusalem is the city of the great king , so do n't swear by it .
CEV	Matthew	5	36	Do n't swear by your own head . You can not make one hair white or black .
CEV	Matthew	5	37	When you make a promise , say only “ Yes ” or “ No. ” Anything else comes from the devil . Revenge ( Luke 6.29,30 )

CEV	Matthew	5	44	But I tell you to love your enemies and pray for anyone who mistreats you .
CEV	Matthew	5	45	( X ) Then you will be acting like your Father in heaven . He makes the sun rise on both good and bad people . And he sends rain for the ones who do right and for the ones who do wrong .
CEV	Matthew	5	46	If you love only those people who love you , will God reward you for this ? Even tax collectors [ k ] love their friends .
CEV	Matthew	5	47	If you greet only your friends , what 's so great about this ? Do n't even unbelievers do that ?

CEV	Matthew	6	30	God gives such beauty to everything that grows in the fields , even though it is here today and thrown into a fire tomorrow . God will surely do even more for you ! Why do you have such little faith ?
CEV	Matthew	6	31	Do n't worry and ask yourselves , “ Will we have anything to eat ? Will we have anything to drink ? Will we have any clothes to wear ? ”
CEV	Matthew	6	32	Only people who do n't know God are always worrying about such things . Your Father in heaven knows you need all of these .
CEV	Matthew	6	33	But more than anything else , put God 's work first and do what he wants . Then the other things will be yours as well .

CEV	Matthew	8	30	Not far from there a large herd of pigs was feeding .
CEV	Matthew	8	31	So the demons begged Jesus , “ If you force us out , please send us into those pigs ! ”
CEV	Matthew	8	32	Jesus told them to go , and they went out of the men and into the pigs . All at once the pigs rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned .

CEV	Matthew	12	12	People are worth much more than sheep , and so it is right to do good on the Sabbath. ”
CEV	Matthew	12	2	Some Pharisees noticed this and said to Jesus , “ Why are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath ? They are not supposed to do this ! ”
CEV	Matthew	12	3	( B ) Jesus answered : You surely must have read what David did when he and his followers were hungry .
CEV	Matthew	12	4	( C ) He went into the house of God , and then they ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are supposed to eat .
CEV	Matthew	12	5	( D ) Have n't you read in the Law of Moses that the priests are allowed to work in the temple on the Sabbath ? But no one says they are guilty of breaking the law of the Sabbath .
CEV	Matthew	12	6	I tell you there is something here greater than the temple .
CEV	Matthew	12	7	( E ) Do n't you know what the Scriptures mean when they say , “ Instead of offering sacrifices to me , I want you to be merciful to others ? ” If you knew what this means , you would not condemn these innocent disciples of mine .
CEV	Matthew	12	8	So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath . A Man with a Paralyzed Hand ( Mark 3.1-6 ; Luke 6.6-11 )
CEV	Matthew	12	9	Jesus left and went into one of their synagogues ,
CEV	Matthew	12	10	where there was a man whose hand was paralyzed . Some Pharisees wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong , so they asked him , “ Is it right to heal someone on the Sabbath ? ”
CEV	Matthew	12	11	( F ) Jesus answered , “ If one of your sheep fell into a ditch on the Sabbath , would n't you lift it out ?
CEV	Matthew	12	13	Then Jesus told the man , “ Hold out your hand. ” The man did , and it became as healthy as the other one .
CEV	Matthew	12	14	The Pharisees left and started making plans to kill Jesus . God 's Chosen Servant
CEV	Matthew	12	15	When Jesus found out what was happening , he left there and large crowds followed him . He healed all of their sick ,
CEV	Matthew	12	16	but warned them not to tell anyone about him .
CEV	Matthew	12	17	So God 's promise came true , just as Isaiah the prophet had said ,
CEV	Matthew	12	18	( G ) “ Here is my chosen servant ! I love him , and he pleases me . I will give him my Spirit , and he will bring justice to the nations .
CEV	Matthew	12	19	He wo n't shout or yell or call out in the streets .
CEV	Matthew	12	20	He wo n't break off a bent reed or put out a dying flame , but he will make sure that justice is done .
CEV	Matthew	12	21	All nations will place their hope in him. ” Jesus and the Ruler of the Demons ( Mark 3.20-30 ; Luke 11.14-23 ; 12.10 )
CEV	Matthew	12	22	Some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and could not talk because he had a demon in him . Jesus healed the man , and then he was able to talk and see .
CEV	Matthew	12	23	The crowds were so amazed they asked , “ Could Jesus be the Son of David ? ” [ b ]
CEV	Matthew	12	24	( H ) When the Pharisees heard this , they said , “ He forces out demons by the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of the demons ! ”
CEV	Matthew	12	25	Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he said to them : Any kingdom where people fight each other will end up ruined . And a town or family that fights will soon destroy itself .
CEV	Matthew	12	26	So if Satan fights against himself , how can his kingdom last ?
CEV	Matthew	12	27	If I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons , whose power do your own followers use to force them out ? Your followers are the ones who will judge you .
CEV	Matthew	12	28	But when I force out demons by the power of God 's Spirit , it proves that God 's kingdom has already come to you .
CEV	Matthew	12	29	( I ) How can anyone break into a strong man 's house and steal his things , unless he first ties up the strong man ? Then he can take everything .
CEV	Matthew	12	30	( J ) If you are not on my side , you are against me . If you do n't gather in the harvest with me , you scatter it . 31-32 ( K ) I tell you any sinful thing you do or say can be forgiven . Even if you speak against the Son of Man , you can be forgiven . But if you speak against the Holy Spirit , you can never be forgiven , either in this life or in the life to come . A Tree and Its Fruit ( Luke 6.43-45 )
CEV	Matthew	12	33	( L ) A good tree produces good fruit , and a bad tree produces bad fruit . You can tell what a tree is like by the fruit it produces .
CEV	Matthew	12	34	( M ) You are a bunch of evil snakes , so how can you say anything good ? Your words show what is in your hearts .
CEV	Matthew	12	35	Good people bring good things out of their hearts , but evil people bring evil things out of their hearts .
CEV	Matthew	12	36	I promise you on the day of judgment , everyone will have to account for every careless word they have spoken .
CEV	Matthew	12	37	On that day they will be told they are either innocent or guilty because of the things they have said . A Sign from Heaven ( Mark 8.11,12 ; Luke 11.29-32 )
CEV	Matthew	12	38	( N ) Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses said , “ Teacher , we want you to show us a sign from heaven. ”
CEV	Matthew	12	39	( O ) But Jesus replied : You want a sign because you are evil and wo n't believe ! But the only sign you will get is the sign of the prophet Jonah .
CEV	Matthew	12	40	( P ) He was in the stomach of a big fish for three days and nights , just as the Son of Man will be deep in the earth for three days and nights .
CEV	Matthew	12	41	( Q ) On the day of judgment the people of Nineveh [ c ] will stand there with you and condemn you . They turned to God when Jonah preached , and yet here is something far greater than Jonah .
CEV	Matthew	12	42	( R ) The Queen of the South [ d ] will also stand there with you and condemn you . She traveled a long way to hear Solomon 's wisdom , and yet here is something much greater than Solomon . Return of an Evil Spirit ( Luke 11.24-26 )
CEV	Matthew	12	43	When an evil spirit leaves a person , it travels through the desert , looking for a place to rest . But when the demon does n't find a place ,
CEV	Matthew	12	44	it says , “ I will go back to the home I left. ” When it gets there and finds the place empty , clean , and neat ,
CEV	Matthew	12	45	it goes off and finds seven other evil spirits even worse than itself . They all come and make their home there , and the person ends up in worse shape than before . That 's how it will be with you evil people of today . Jesus ' Mother and Brothers ( Mark 3.31-35 ; Luke 8.19-21 )
CEV	Matthew	12	46	While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds , his mother and brothers came and stood outside because they wanted to talk with him .
CEV	Matthew	12	47	. Copyright ©
CEV	Matthew	12	48	Jesus answered , “ Who is my mother and who are my brothers ? ”
CEV	Matthew	12	49	Then he pointed to his disciples and said , “ These are my mother and my brothers !
CEV	Matthew	12	50	Anyone who obeys my Father in heaven is my brother or sister or mother. ” Footnotes - 12.1 walking through some wheat fields : It was the custom to let hungry travelers pick grains of wheat . - 12.23 Could Jesus be the Son of David : Or “ Does Jesus think he is the Son of David ? ” See the note at 9.27 . - 12.41 Nineveh : During the time of Jonah this city was the capital of the Assyrian Empire , which was Israel 's worst enemy .

CEV	Matthew	13	13	I use stories when I speak to them because when they look , they can not see , and when they listen , they can not hear or understand .
CEV	Matthew	13	2	( A ) Such large crowds gathered around him that he had to sit in a boat , while the people stood on the shore .
CEV	Matthew	13	3	Then he taught them many things by using stories . He said : A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field .
CEV	Matthew	13	4	While the farmer was scattering the seed , some of it fell along the road and was eaten by birds .
CEV	Matthew	13	5	Other seeds fell on thin , rocky ground and quickly started growing because the soil was n't very deep .
CEV	Matthew	13	6	But when the sun came up , the plants were scorched and dried up , because they did not have deep roots .
CEV	Matthew	13	7	Some other seeds fell where thornbushes grew up and choked the plants .
CEV	Matthew	13	8	But a few seeds did fall on good ground where the plants produced
CEV	Matthew	13	100	or
CEV	Matthew	13	60	or
CEV	Matthew	13	30	Leave the weeds alone until harvest time . Then I 'll tell my workers to gather the weeds and tie them up and burn them . But I 'll order them to store the wheat in my barn. ” Stories about a Mustard Seed and Yeast ( Mark 4.30-32 ; Luke 13.18-21 )
CEV	Matthew	13	9	If you have ears , pay attention ! Why Jesus Used Stories ( Mark 4.10-12 ; Luke 8.9,10 )
CEV	Matthew	13	10	Jesus ' disciples came to him and asked , “ Why do you use stories to speak to the people ? ”
CEV	Matthew	13	11	Jesus answered : I have explained the secrets about the kingdom of heaven to you , but not to others .
CEV	Matthew	13	12	( B ) Everyone who has something will be given more . But people who do n't have anything will lose even what little they have .
CEV	Matthew	13	14	( C ) So God 's promise came true , just as the prophet Isaiah had said , “ These people will listen and listen , but never understand . They will look and look , but never see .
CEV	Matthew	13	15	All of them have stubborn minds ! They refuse to listen ; they cover their eyes . They can not see or hear or understand . If they could , they would turn to me , and I would heal them. ”
CEV	Matthew	13	16	( D ) But God has blessed you , because your eyes can see and your ears can hear !
CEV	Matthew	13	17	Many prophets and good people were eager to see what you see and to hear what you hear . But I tell you they did not see or hear . Jesus Explains the Story about the Farmer ( Mark 4.13-20 ; Luke 8.11-15 )
CEV	Matthew	13	18	Now listen to the meaning of the story about the farmer :
CEV	Matthew	13	19	The seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message about the kingdom , but do n't understand it . Then the evil one comes and snatches the message from their hearts .
CEV	Matthew	13	20	The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it at once .
CEV	Matthew	13	21	But they do n't have deep roots , and they do n't last very long . As soon as life gets hard or the message gets them in trouble , they give up .
CEV	Matthew	13	22	The seeds that fell among the thornbushes are also people who hear the message . But they start worrying about the needs of this life and are fooled by the desire to get rich . So the message gets choked out , and they never produce anything .
CEV	Matthew	13	23	The seeds that fell on good ground are the people who hear and understand the message . They produce as much as
CEV	Matthew	13	24	Jesus then told them this story : The kingdom of heaven is like what happened when a farmer scattered good seed in a field .
CEV	Matthew	13	25	But while everyone was sleeping , an enemy came and scattered weed seeds in the field and then left .
CEV	Matthew	13	26	When the plants came up and began to mature , the farmer 's servants could see the weeds .
CEV	Matthew	13	27	The servants came and asked , “ Sir , did n't you scatter good seed in your field ? Where did these weeds come from ? ”
CEV	Matthew	13	28	“ An enemy did this , ” he replied . His servants then asked , “ Do you want us to go out and pull up the weeds ? ”
CEV	Matthew	13	29	“ No ! ” he answered . “ You might also pull up the wheat .
CEV	Matthew	13	31	Jesus told them another story : The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a farmer plants a mustard seed in a field .
CEV	Matthew	13	32	Although it is the smallest of all seeds , it grows larger than any garden plant and becomes a tree . Birds even come and nest on its branches .
CEV	Matthew	13	33	Jesus also said : The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a woman mixes a little yeast into three big batches of flour . Finally , all the dough rises . The Reason for Teaching with Stories ( Mark 4.33,34 )
CEV	Matthew	13	34	Jesus used stories when he spoke to the people . In fact , he did not tell them anything without using stories .
CEV	Matthew	13	35	( E ) So God 's promise came true , just as the prophet [ b ] had said , “ I will use stories to speak my message and to explain things hidden since the creation of the world. ” Jesus Explains the Story about the Weeds
CEV	Matthew	13	36	After Jesus left the crowd and went inside , [ c ] his disciples came to him and said , “ Explain to us the story about the weeds in the wheat field. ”
CEV	Matthew	13	37	Jesus answered : The one who scattered the good seed is the Son of Man .
CEV	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world , and the good seeds are the people who belong to the kingdom . The weeds are those who belong to the evil one ,
CEV	Matthew	13	39	and the one who scattered them is the devil . The harvest is the end of time , and angels are the ones who bring in the harvest .
CEV	Matthew	13	40	Weeds are gathered and burned . That 's how it will be at the end of time .
CEV	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send out his angels , and they will gather from his kingdom everyone who does wrong or causes others to sin .
CEV	Matthew	13	42	Then he will throw them into a flaming furnace , where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain .
CEV	Matthew	13	43	( F ) But everyone who has done right will shine like the sun in their Father 's kingdom . If you have ears , pay attention ! A Hidden Treasure
CEV	Matthew	13	44	The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when someone finds a treasure hidden in a field and buries it again . Such a person is happy and goes and sells everything in order to buy that field . A Valuable Pearl
CEV	Matthew	13	45	The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a shop owner is looking for fine pearls .
CEV	Matthew	13	46	After finding a very valuable one , the owner goes and sells everything in order to buy that pearl . A Fish Net
CEV	Matthew	13	47	The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a net is thrown into a lake and catches all kinds of fish .
CEV	Matthew	13	48	When the net is full , it is dragged to the shore , and the fishermen sit down to separate the fish . They keep the good ones , but throw the bad ones away .
CEV	Matthew	13	49	That 's how it will be at the end of time . Angels will come and separate the evil people from the ones who have done right .
CEV	Matthew	13	50	Then those evil people will be thrown into a flaming furnace , where they will cry and grit their teeth in pain . New and Old Treasures
CEV	Matthew	13	51	Jesus asked his disciples if they understood all these things . They said , “ Yes , we do. ”
CEV	Matthew	13	52	So he told them , “ Every student of the Scriptures who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like someone who brings out new and old treasures from the storeroom. ” The People of Nazareth Turn against Jesus ( Mark 6.1-6 ; Luke 4.16-30 )
CEV	Matthew	13	53	When Jesus had finished telling these stories , he left
CEV	Matthew	13	54	and went to his hometown . He taught in their synagogue , and the people were so amazed that they asked , “ Where does he get all this wisdom and the power to work these miracles ?
CEV	Matthew	13	55	Is n't he the son of the carpenter ? Is n't Mary his mother , and are n't James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas his brothers ?
CEV	Matthew	13	56	Do n't his sisters still live here in our town ? How can he do all this ? ”
CEV	Matthew	13	57	( G ) So the people were upset because of what he was doing . But Jesus said , “ Prophets are honored by everyone , except the people of their hometown and their own family. ”
CEV	Matthew	13	58	And because the people did not have any faith , Jesus did not work many miracles there . Copyright ©

CEV	Matthew	14	14	When Jesus got out of the boat , he saw the large crowd . He felt sorry for them and healed everyone who was sick .
CEV	Matthew	14	2	and told his officials , “ This is John the Baptist ! He has come back from death , and that 's why he has the power to work these miracles. ” 3-4 ( A ) Herod had earlier arrested John and had him chained and put in prison . He did this because John had told him , “ It is n't right for you to take Herodias , the wife of your brother Philip. ”
CEV	Matthew	14	5	Herod wanted to kill John . But the people thought John was a prophet , and Herod was afraid of what they might do .
CEV	Matthew	14	6	When Herod 's birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests . She pleased Herod
CEV	Matthew	14	7	so much he swore to give her whatever she wanted .
CEV	Matthew	14	8	But the girl 's mother told her to say , “ Here on a serving plate I want the head of John the Baptist ! ”
CEV	Matthew	14	9	Herod was sorry for what he had said . But he did not want to break the promise he had made in front of his guests . So he ordered a guard
CEV	Matthew	14	10	to go to the prison and cut off John 's head .
CEV	Matthew	14	11	It was taken on a serving plate to the girl , and she gave it to her mother .
CEV	Matthew	14	12	John 's followers took his body and buried it . Then they told Jesus what had happened . Jesus Feeds Five Thousand ( Mark 6.30-44 ; Luke 9.10-17 ; John 6.1-14 )
CEV	Matthew	14	13	After Jesus heard about John , he crossed Lake Galilee [ b ] to go to some place where he could be alone . But the crowds found out and followed him on foot from the towns .
CEV	Matthew	14	15	That evening the disciples came to Jesus and said , “ This place is like a desert , and it 's already late . Let the crowds leave , so they can go to the villages and buy some food. ”
CEV	Matthew	14	16	Jesus replied , “ They do n't have to leave . Why do n't you give them something to eat ? ”
CEV	Matthew	14	17	But they said , “ We have only five small loaves of bread [ c ] and two fish. ”
CEV	Matthew	14	18	Jesus asked his disciples to bring the food to him ,
CEV	Matthew	14	19	and he told the crowd to sit down on the grass . Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up toward heaven and blessed the food . Then he broke the bread and handed it to his disciples , and they gave it to the people .
CEV	Matthew	14	20	After everyone had eaten all they wanted , Jesus ' disciples picked up twelve large baskets of leftovers .
CEV	Matthew	14	21	There were about 5,000 men who ate , not counting the women and children . Jesus Walks on the Water ( Mark 6.45-52 ; John 6.15-21 )
CEV	Matthew	14	22	At once , Jesus made his disciples get into a boat and start back across the lake . [ d ] But he stayed until he had sent the crowds away .
CEV	Matthew	14	23	Then he went up on a mountain where he could be alone and pray . Later in the evening , he was still there .
CEV	Matthew	14	24	By this time the boat was a long way from the shore . It was going against the wind and was being tossed around by the waves .
CEV	Matthew	14	25	A little while before morning , Jesus came walking on the water toward his disciples .
CEV	Matthew	14	26	When they saw him , they thought he was a ghost . They were terrified and started screaming .
CEV	Matthew	14	27	At once , Jesus said to them , “ Do n't worry ! I am Jesus . Do n't be afraid. ”
CEV	Matthew	14	28	Peter replied , “ Lord , if it really is you , tell me to come to you on the water. ”
CEV	Matthew	14	29	“ Come on ! ” Jesus said . Peter then got out of the boat and started walking on the water toward him .
CEV	Matthew	14	30	But when Peter saw how strong the wind was , he was afraid and started sinking . “ Save me , Lord ! ” he shouted .
CEV	Matthew	14	31	At once , Jesus reached out his hand . He helped Peter up and said , “ You surely do n't have much faith . Why do you doubt ? ”
CEV	Matthew	14	32	When Jesus and Peter got into the boat , the wind died down .
CEV	Matthew	14	33	The men in the boat worshiped Jesus and said , “ You really are the Son of God ! ” Jesus Heals Sick People in Gennesaret ( Mark 6.53-56 )
CEV	Matthew	14	34	Jesus and his disciples crossed the lake and came to shore near the town of Gennesaret .
CEV	Matthew	14	35	The people found out he was there , and they sent word to everyone who lived in this part of the country . So they brought all the sick people to Jesus .
CEV	Matthew	14	36	They begged him just to let them touch his clothes , and everyone who did was healed . Copyright ©

CEV	Matthew	15	15	Peter replied , “ What did you mean when you talked about the things that make people unclean ? ”
CEV	Matthew	15	2	“ Why do n't your disciples obey what our ancestors taught us to do ? They do n't even wash their hands [ a ] before they eat. ”
CEV	Matthew	15	3	Jesus answered : Why do you disobey God and follow your own teaching ?
CEV	Matthew	15	4	( A ) Did n't God command you to respect your father and mother ? Did n't he tell you to put to death all who curse their parents ?
CEV	Matthew	15	5	But you let people get by without helping their parents when they should . You let them say that what they have has been offered to God . [ b ]
CEV	Matthew	15	6	Is this any way to show respect to your parents ? You ignore God 's commands in order to follow your own teaching .
CEV	Matthew	15	7	And you are nothing but show-offs ! Isaiah the prophet was right when he wrote that God had said ,
CEV	Matthew	15	8	( B ) “ All of you praise me with your words , but you never really think about me .
CEV	Matthew	15	9	It is useless for you to worship me , when you teach rules made up by humans. ” What Really Makes People Unclean ( Mark 7.14-23 )
CEV	Matthew	15	10	Jesus called the crowd together and said , “ Pay attention and try to understand what I mean .
CEV	Matthew	15	11	The food you put into your mouth does n't make you unclean and unfit to worship God . The bad words that come out of your mouth are what make you unclean. ”
CEV	Matthew	15	12	Then his disciples came over to him and asked , “ Do you know you insulted the Pharisees by what you said ? ”
CEV	Matthew	15	13	Jesus answered , “ Every plant that my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled up by the roots .
CEV	Matthew	15	14	( C ) Stay away from those Pharisees ! They are like blind people leading other blind people , and all of them will fall into a ditch. ”
CEV	Matthew	15	16	Jesus then said : Do n't any of you know by now what I am talking about ?
CEV	Matthew	15	17	Do n't you know that the food you put into your mouth goes into your stomach and then out of your body ?
CEV	Matthew	15	18	( D ) But the words that come out of your mouth come from your heart . And they are what make you unfit to worship God .
CEV	Matthew	15	19	Out of your heart come evil thoughts , murder , unfaithfulness in marriage , vulgar deeds , stealing , telling lies , and insulting others .
CEV	Matthew	15	20	These are what make you unclean . Eating without washing your hands will not make you unfit to worship God . A Woman 's Faith ( Mark 7.24-30 )
CEV	Matthew	15	21	Jesus left and went to the territory near the towns of Tyre and Sidon .
CEV	Matthew	15	22	Suddenly a Canaanite woman [ c ] from there came out shouting , “ Lord and Son of David , [ d ] have pity on me ! My daughter is full of demons. ”
CEV	Matthew	15	23	Jesus did not say a word . But the woman kept following along and shouting , so his disciples came up and asked him to send her away .
CEV	Matthew	15	24	Jesus said , “ I was sent only to the people of Israel ! They are like a flock of lost sheep. ”
CEV	Matthew	15	25	The woman came closer . Then she knelt down and begged , “ Please help me , Lord ! ”
CEV	Matthew	15	26	Jesus replied , “ It is n't right to take food away from children and feed it to dogs. ” [ e ]
CEV	Matthew	15	27	“ Lord , this is true , ” the woman said , “ but even puppies get the crumbs that fall from their owner 's table. ”
CEV	Matthew	15	28	Jesus answered , “ Dear woman , you really do have a lot of faith , and you will be given what you want. ” At that moment her daughter was healed . Jesus Heals Many People
CEV	Matthew	15	29	From there , Jesus went along Lake Galilee . Then he climbed a hill and sat down .
CEV	Matthew	15	30	Large crowds came and brought many people who were paralyzed or blind or lame or unable to talk . They placed them , and many others , in front of Jesus , and he healed them all .
CEV	Matthew	15	31	Everyone was amazed at what they saw and heard . People who had never spoken could now speak . The lame were healed , the paralyzed could walk , and the blind were able to see . Everyone was praising the God of Israel . Jesus Feeds Four Thousand ( Mark 8.1-10 )
CEV	Matthew	15	32	Jesus called his disciples together and told them , “ I feel sorry for these people . They have been with me for three days , and they do n't have anything to eat . I do n't want to send them away hungry . They might faint on their way home. ”
CEV	Matthew	15	33	His disciples said , “ This place is like a desert . Where can we find enough food to feed such a crowd ? ”
CEV	Matthew	15	34	Jesus asked them how much food they had . They replied , “ Seven small loaves of bread [ f ] and a few little fish. ”
CEV	Matthew	15	35	After Jesus had told the people to sit down ,
CEV	Matthew	15	36	he took the seven loaves of bread and the fish and gave thanks . He then broke them and handed them to his disciples , who passed them around to the crowds .
CEV	Matthew	15	37	Everyone ate all they wanted , and the leftovers filled seven large baskets .
CEV	Matthew	15	38	There were 4,000 men who ate , not counting the women and children .
CEV	Matthew	15	39	After Jesus had sent the crowds away , he got into a boat and sailed across the lake . He came to shore near the town of Magadan .

CEV	Matthew	16	5	The disciples had forgotten to bring any bread when they crossed the lake . [ c ]
CEV	Matthew	16	6	( C ) Jesus then warned them , “ Watch out ! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ”
CEV	Matthew	16	7	The disciples talked this over and said to each other , “ He must be saying this because we did n't bring along any bread. ”
CEV	Matthew	16	8	Jesus knew what they were thinking and said : You surely do n't have much faith ! Why are you talking about not having any bread ?
CEV	Matthew	16	9	( D ) Do n't you understand ? Have you forgotten about the 5,000 people and all those baskets of leftovers from just five loaves of bread ?
CEV	Matthew	16	10	( E ) And what about the 4,000 people and all those baskets of leftovers from only seven loaves of bread ?
CEV	Matthew	16	11	Do n't you know by now that I am not talking to you about bread ? Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees !
CEV	Matthew	16	12	Finally , the disciples understood that Jesus was n't talking about the yeast used to make bread , but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . Who Is Jesus ? ( Mark 8.27-30 ; Luke 9.18-21 )

CEV	Matthew	16	15	Then Jesus asked , “ But who do you say I am ? ”
CEV	Matthew	16	17	Jesus told him : Simon , son of Jonah , you are blessed ! You did n't discover this on your own . It was shown to you by my Father in heaven .
CEV	Matthew	16	18	So I will call you Peter , which means “ a rock. ” On this rock I will build my church , and death itself will not have any power over it .
CEV	Matthew	16	19	( H ) I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven , and God in heaven will allow whatever you allow on earth . But he will not allow anything you do n't allow .

There the nation 's leaders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make me suffer terribly . I will be killed , but three days later I will rise to life. ”
CEV	Matthew	16	22	Peter took Jesus aside and told him to stop talking like that . He said , “ God would never let this happen to you , Lord ! ”
CEV	Matthew	16	23	Jesus turned to Peter and said , “ Satan , get away from me ! You 're in my way because you think like everyone else and not like God. ”
CEV	Matthew	16	24	( I ) Then Jesus said to his disciples : If any of you want to be my followers , you must forget about yourself . You must take up your cross and follow me .

CEV	Matthew	17	2	There in front of the disciples , Jesus was completely changed . His face was shining like the sun , and his clothes became white as light .

CEV	Matthew	17	11	( D ) Jesus told them , “ Elijah certainly will come and get everything ready .
CEV	Matthew	17	12	( E ) In fact , he has already come . But the people did not recognize him and treated him just as they wanted to . They will soon make the Son of Man suffer in the same way. ”
CEV	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist . Jesus Heals a Boy ( Mark 9.14-29 ; Luke 9.37-43a )

CEV	Matthew	17	16	I brought him to your disciples , but none of them could heal him. ”
CEV	Matthew	17	18	Then Jesus spoke sternly to the demon . It went out of the boy , and right then he was healed .
CEV	Matthew	17	19	Later the disciples went to Jesus in private and asked him , “ Why could n't we force out the demon ? ” 20-21 ( F ) Jesus replied : It is because you do n't have enough faith ! But I can promise you this . If you had faith no larger than a mustard seed , you could tell this mountain to move from here to there . And it would . Everything would be possible for you .

CEV	Matthew	17	26	Peter answered , “ From foreigners. ” Jesus replied , “ Then their own people [ c ] do n't have to pay .

CEV	Matthew	18	25	But he did n't have any money to pay what he owed . The king ordered him to be sold , along with his wife and children and all he owned , in order to pay the debt .
CEV	Matthew	18	26	The official got down on his knees and began begging , “ Have pity on me , and I will pay you every cent I owe ! ”
CEV	Matthew	18	27	The king felt sorry for him and let him go free . He even told the official that he did not have to pay back the money .
CEV	Matthew	18	28	But as this official was leaving , he happened to meet another official , who owed him
CEV	Matthew	18	29	The man got down on his knees and began begging , “ Have pity on me , and I will pay you back. ”
CEV	Matthew	18	30	But the first official refused to have pity . Instead , he went and had the other official put in jail until he could pay what he owed .
CEV	Matthew	18	31	When some other officials found out what had happened , they felt sorry for the man who had been put in jail . Then they told the king what had happened .
CEV	Matthew	18	32	The king called the first official back in and said , “ You 're an evil man ! When you begged for mercy , I said you did not have to pay back a cent .

CEV	Matthew	19	3	Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus . They came up to him and asked , “ Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason ? ”
CEV	Matthew	19	4	( A ) Jesus answered , “ Do n't you know in the beginning the Creator made a man and a woman ?
CEV	Matthew	19	5	( B ) That 's why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married . He becomes like one person with his wife .
CEV	Matthew	19	6	Then they are no longer two people , but one . And no one should separate a couple God has joined together. ”
CEV	Matthew	19	7	( C ) The Pharisees asked Jesus , “ Why did Moses say a man could write out divorce papers and send his wife away ? ”
CEV	Matthew	19	8	Jesus replied , “ You are so heartless ! That 's why Moses allowed you to divorce your wife . But from the beginning God did not intend it to be that way .
CEV	Matthew	19	9	( D ) I say if your wife has not committed some terrible sexual sin , [ a ] you must not divorce her to marry someone else . If you do , you are unfaithful. ”
CEV	Matthew	19	10	The disciples said , “ If that 's how it is between a man and a woman , it 's better not to get married. ”
CEV	Matthew	19	11	Jesus told them , “ Only those people who have been given the gift of staying single can accept this teaching .

CEV	Matthew	19	17	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you ask me about what is good ? Only God is good . If you want to have eternal life , you must obey his commandments. ”
CEV	Matthew	19	18	( E ) “ Which ones ? ” the man asked . Jesus answered , “ Do not murder . Be faithful in marriage . Do not steal . Do not tell lies about others .
CEV	Matthew	19	20	The young man said , “ I have obeyed all of these . What else must I do ? ”
CEV	Matthew	19	21	Jesus replied , “ If you want to be perfect , go sell everything you own ! Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . Then come and be my follower. ”
CEV	Matthew	19	22	When the young man heard this , he went away sad , because he was very rich .
CEV	Matthew	19	23	Jesus said to his disciples , “ I tell you , it 's terribly hard for rich people to get into the kingdom of heaven !
CEV	Matthew	19	24	In fact , it 's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God 's kingdom. ”
CEV	Matthew	19	25	When the disciples heard this , they were greatly surprised and asked , “ How can anyone ever be saved ? ”
CEV	Matthew	19	26	Jesus looked straight at them and said , “ There are some things people can not do , but God can do anything. ”
CEV	Matthew	19	27	Peter replied , “ Remember , we have left everything to be your followers ! What will we get ? ”
CEV	Matthew	19	28	( G ) Jesus answered : Yes , all of you have become my followers . And so in the future world , when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne , I promise you will sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel .

CEV	Matthew	20	8	( A ) That evening the owner of the vineyard told the man in charge of the workers to call them in and give them their money . He also told the man to begin with the ones who were hired last .
CEV	Matthew	20	9	When the workers arrived , the ones who had been hired at five in the afternoon were given a full day 's pay .
CEV	Matthew	20	10	The workers who had been hired first thought they would be given more than the others . But when they were given the same ,
CEV	Matthew	20	11	they began complaining to the owner of the vineyard .
CEV	Matthew	20	12	They said , “ The ones who were hired last worked for only one hour . But you paid them the same that you did us . And we worked in the hot sun all day long ! ”
CEV	Matthew	20	13	The owner answered one of them , “ Friend , I did n't cheat you . I paid you exactly what we agreed on .
CEV	Matthew	20	14	Take your money now and go ! What business is it of yours if I want to pay them the same that I paid you ?
CEV	Matthew	20	15	Do n't I have the right to do what I want with my own money ? Why should you be jealous , if I want to be generous ? ”

CEV	Matthew	20	23	Jesus replied , “ You certainly will drink from my cup ! But it is n't for me to say who will sit at my right side and at my left . This is for my Father to say. ”
CEV	Matthew	20	24	When the ten other disciples heard this , they were angry with the two brothers .
CEV	Matthew	20	25	( C ) But Jesus called the disciples together and said : You know foreign rulers like to order their people around . And their great leaders have full power over everyone they rule .
CEV	Matthew	20	26	( D ) But do n't act like them . If you want to be great , you must be the servant of all the others .

CEV	Matthew	21	23	Jesus had gone into the temple and was teaching when the chief priests and the leaders of the people came up to him . They asked , “ What right do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
CEV	Matthew	21	24	Jesus answered , “ I have just one question to ask you . If you answer it , I will tell you where I got the right to do these things .
CEV	Matthew	21	25	Who gave John the right to baptize ? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being ? ” They thought it over and said to each other , “ We ca n't say God gave John this right . Jesus will ask us why we did n't believe John .
CEV	Matthew	21	26	On the other hand , these people think John was a prophet , and we are afraid of what they might do to us . That 's why we ca n't say it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize. ”
CEV	Matthew	21	27	So they told Jesus , “ We do n't know. ” Jesus said , “ Then I wo n't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do. ” A Story about Two Sons
CEV	Matthew	21	28	Jesus said : I will tell you a story about a man who had two sons . Then you can tell me what you think . The father went to the older son and said , “ Go work in the vineyard today ! ”
CEV	Matthew	21	29	His son told him he would not do it , but later he changed his mind and went .
CEV	Matthew	21	30	The man then told his younger son to go work in the vineyard . The boy said he would , but he did n't go .
CEV	Matthew	21	31	Which one of the sons obeyed his father ? “ The older one , ” the chief priests and leaders answered . Then Jesus told them : You can be sure tax collectors [ f ] and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you ever will !
CEV	Matthew	21	32	( F ) When John the Baptist showed you how to do right , you would not believe him . But these evil people did believe . And even when you saw what they did , you still would not change your minds and believe . Renters of a Vineyard ( Mark 12.1-12 ; Luke 20.9-19 )
CEV	Matthew	21	33	( G ) Jesus told the chief priests and leaders to listen to this story : A land owner once planted a vineyard . He built a wall around it and dug a pit to crush the grapes in . He also built a lookout tower . Then he rented out his vineyard and left the country .
CEV	Matthew	21	34	When it was harvest time , the owner sent some servants to get his share of the grapes .
CEV	Matthew	21	35	But the renters grabbed those servants . They beat up one , killed one , and stoned one of them to death .
CEV	Matthew	21	36	He then sent more servants than he did the first time . But the renters treated them in the same way .
CEV	Matthew	21	37	Finally , the owner sent his own son to the renters , because he thought they would respect him .
CEV	Matthew	21	38	But when they saw the man 's son , they said , “ Someday he will own the vineyard . Let 's kill him ! Then we can have it all for ourselves. ”
CEV	Matthew	21	39	So they grabbed him , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
CEV	Matthew	21	40	Jesus asked , “ When the owner of that vineyard comes , what do you suppose he will do to those renters ? ”
CEV	Matthew	21	41	The chief priests and leaders answered , “ He will kill them in some horrible way . Then he will rent out his vineyard to people who will give him his share of grapes at harvest time. ”
CEV	Matthew	21	42	( H ) Jesus replied , “ You surely know that the Scriptures say , ‘ The stone the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all . This is something the Lord has done , and it is amazing to us. ’
CEV	Matthew	21	43	I tell you God 's kingdom will be taken from you and given to people who will do what he demands .

CEV	Matthew	22	22	His answer surprised them so much that they walked away . Life in the Future World ( Mark 12.18-27 ; Luke 20.27-40 )
CEV	Matthew	22	2	The kingdom of heaven is like what happened when a king gave a wedding banquet for his son .
CEV	Matthew	22	3	The king sent some servants to tell the invited guests to come to the banquet , but the guests refused .
CEV	Matthew	22	4	He sent other servants to say to the guests , “ The banquet is ready ! My cattle and prize calves have all been prepared . Everything is ready . Come to the banquet ! ”
CEV	Matthew	22	5	But the guests did not pay any attention . Some of them left for their farms , and some went to their places of business .
CEV	Matthew	22	6	Others grabbed the servants , then beat them up and killed them .
CEV	Matthew	22	7	This made the king so furious that he sent an army to kill those murderers and burn down their city .
CEV	Matthew	22	8	Then he said to the servants , “ It is time for the wedding banquet , and the invited guests do n't deserve to come .
CEV	Matthew	22	9	Go out to the street corners and tell everyone you meet to come to the banquet. ”
CEV	Matthew	22	10	They went out on the streets and brought in everyone they could find , good and bad alike . And the banquet room was filled with guests .
CEV	Matthew	22	11	When the king went in to meet the guests , he found that one of them was n't wearing the right kind of clothes for the wedding .
CEV	Matthew	22	12	The king asked , “ Friend , why did n't you wear proper clothes for the wedding ? ” But the guest had no excuse .
CEV	Matthew	22	13	( A ) So the king gave orders for this person to be tied hand and foot and to be thrown outside into the dark . That 's where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain .
CEV	Matthew	22	14	( B ) Many are invited , but only a few are chosen . Paying Taxes ( Mark 12.13-17 ; Luke 20.20-26 )
CEV	Matthew	22	15	The Pharisees got together and planned how they could trick Jesus into saying something wrong .
CEV	Matthew	22	16	They sent some of their followers and some of Herod 's followers [ a ] to say to him , “ Teacher , we know that you are honest . You teach the truth about what God wants people to do . And you treat everyone with the same respect , no matter who they are .
CEV	Matthew	22	17	Tell us what you think ! Should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not ? ”
CEV	Matthew	22	18	Jesus knew their evil thoughts and said , “ Why are you trying to test me ? You show-offs !
CEV	Matthew	22	19	Let me see one of the coins used for paying taxes. ” They brought him a silver coin ,
CEV	Matthew	22	20	and he asked , “ Whose picture and name are on it ? ”
CEV	Matthew	22	21	“ The Emperor 's , ” they answered . Then Jesus told them , “ Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God. ”
CEV	Matthew	22	23	( C ) The Sadducees did not believe people would rise to life after death . So that same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus and said :
CEV	Matthew	22	24	( D ) Teacher , Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children , his brother should marry the widow . Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother .
CEV	Matthew	22	25	Once there were seven brothers who lived here . The first one married , but died without having any children . So his wife was left to his brother .
CEV	Matthew	22	26	The same thing happened to the second and third brothers and finally to all seven of them .
CEV	Matthew	22	27	At last the woman died .
CEV	Matthew	22	28	When God raises people from death , whose wife will this woman be ? She had been married to all seven brothers .
CEV	Matthew	22	29	Jesus answered : You are completely wrong ! You do n't know what the Scriptures teach . And you do n't know anything about the power of God .
CEV	Matthew	22	30	( E ) When God raises people to life , they wo n't marry . They will be like the angels in heaven .
CEV	Matthew	22	31	And as for people being raised to life , God was speaking to you when he said ,
CEV	Matthew	22	32	( F ) “ I am the God worshiped by Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob. ” [ b ] He is n't the God of the dead , but of the living .
CEV	Matthew	22	33	The crowds were surprised to hear what Jesus was teaching . The Most Important Commandment ( Mark 12.28-34 ; Luke 10.25-28 )
CEV	Matthew	22	34	After Jesus had made the Sadducees look foolish , the Pharisees heard about it and got together .
CEV	Matthew	22	35	( G ) One of them was an expert in the Jewish Law . So he tried to test Jesus by asking ,
CEV	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , what is the most important commandment in the Law ? ”
CEV	Matthew	22	37	( H ) Jesus answered : Love the Lord your God with all your heart , soul , and mind .
CEV	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and most important commandment .
CEV	Matthew	22	39	( I ) The second most important commandment is like this one . And it is , “ Love others as much as you love yourself. ”
CEV	Matthew	22	40	All the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets [ c ] are based on these two commandments . About David 's Son ( Mark 12.35-37 ; Luke 20.41-44 )
CEV	Matthew	22	41	While the Pharisees were still there , Jesus asked them ,
CEV	Matthew	22	42	“ What do you think about the Messiah ? Whose family will he come from ? ” They answered , “ He will be a son of King David. ” [ d ]
CEV	Matthew	22	43	Jesus replied , “ How then could the Spirit lead David to call the Messiah his Lord ? David said ,
CEV	Matthew	22	44	( J ) ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit at my right side [ e ] until I make your enemies into a footstool for you. ’
CEV	Matthew	22	45	If David called the Messiah his Lord , how can the Messiah be a son of King David ? ”
CEV	Matthew	22	46	No one was able to give Jesus an answer , and from that day on , no one dared ask him any more questions . Footnotes - 22.16 Herod 's followers : People who were political followers of the family of Herod the Great ( see 2.1 ) and his son Herod Antipas ( see 14.1 ) , and who wanted Herod to be king in Jerusalem . - 22.32 I am the God worshiped by Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : Jesus argues that if God is worshiped by these three , they must still be alive , because he is the God of the living . - 22.40 the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets : The Jewish Scriptures , that is , the Old Testament . - 22.42 son of King David : See the note at 9.27 . - 22.44 right side : The place of power and honor .

CEV	Matthew	23	23	( E ) You Pharisees and teachers are show-offs , and you 're in for trouble ! You give God a tenth of the spices from your garden , such as mint , dill , and cumin . Yet you neglect the more important matters of the Law , such as justice , mercy , and faithfulness . These are the important things you should have done , though you should not have left the others undone either .
CEV	Matthew	23	2	The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law are experts in the Law of Moses .
CEV	Matthew	23	3	So obey everything they teach you , but do n't do as they do . After all , they say one thing and do something else .
CEV	Matthew	23	4	They pile heavy burdens on people 's shoulders and wo n't lift a finger to help .
CEV	Matthew	23	5	( A ) Everything they do is just to show off in front of others . They even make a big show of wearing Scripture verses on their foreheads and arms , and they wear big tassels [ a ] for everyone to see .
CEV	Matthew	23	6	They love the best seats at banquets and the front seats in the synagogues .
CEV	Matthew	23	7	And when they are in the market , they like to have people greet them as their teachers .
CEV	Matthew	23	8	But none of you should be called a teacher . You have only one teacher , and all of you are like brothers and sisters .
CEV	Matthew	23	9	Do n't call anyone on earth your father . All of you have the same Father in heaven .
CEV	Matthew	23	10	None of you should be called the leader . The Messiah is your only leader .
CEV	Matthew	23	11	( B ) Whoever is the greatest should be the servant of the others .
CEV	Matthew	23	12	( C ) If you put yourself above others , you will be put down . But if you humble yourself , you will be honored . 13-14 You Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses are in for trouble ! You 're nothing but show-offs . You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven . You wo n't go in yourselves , and you keep others from going in . [ b ]
CEV	Matthew	23	15	You Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses are in for trouble ! You 're nothing but show-offs . You travel over land and sea to win one follower . And when you have done so , you make that person twice as fit for hell as you are .
CEV	Matthew	23	16	You are in for trouble ! You are supposed to lead others , but you are blind . You teach that it does n't matter if a person swears by the temple . But you say it does matter if someone swears by the gold in the temple .
CEV	Matthew	23	17	You blind fools ! Which is greater , the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred ?
CEV	Matthew	23	18	You also teach that it does n't matter if a person swears by the altar . But you say it does matter if someone swears by the gift on the altar .
CEV	Matthew	23	19	Are you blind ? Which is more important , the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred ?
CEV	Matthew	23	20	Anyone who swears by the altar also swears by everything on it .
CEV	Matthew	23	21	And anyone who swears by the temple also swears by God , who lives there .
CEV	Matthew	23	22	( D ) To swear by heaven is the same as swearing by God 's throne and by the one who sits on that throne .
CEV	Matthew	23	24	You blind leaders ! You strain out a small fly but swallow a camel .
CEV	Matthew	23	25	You Pharisees and teachers are show-offs , and you 're in for trouble ! You wash the outside of your cups and dishes , while inside there is nothing but greed and selfishness .
CEV	Matthew	23	26	You blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of a cup , and then the outside will also be clean .
CEV	Matthew	23	27	( F ) You Pharisees and teachers are in for trouble ! You 're nothing but show-offs . You 're like tombs that have been whitewashed . [ c ] On the outside they are beautiful , but inside they are full of bones and filth .
CEV	Matthew	23	28	That 's what you are like . Outside you look good , but inside you are evil and only pretend to be good .
CEV	Matthew	23	29	You Pharisees and teachers are nothing but show-offs , and you 're in for trouble ! You build monuments for the prophets and decorate the tombs of good people .
CEV	Matthew	23	30	And you claim you would not have taken part with your ancestors in killing the prophets .
CEV	Matthew	23	31	But you prove you really are the relatives of the ones who killed the prophets .
CEV	Matthew	23	32	So keep on doing everything they did .
CEV	Matthew	23	33	( G ) You are nothing but snakes and the children of snakes ! How can you escape going to hell ?
CEV	Matthew	23	34	I will send to you prophets and wise people and experts in the Law of Moses . You will kill them or nail them to a cross or beat them in your synagogues or chase them from town to town .
CEV	Matthew	23	35	( H ) That 's why you will be held guilty for the murder of every good person , beginning with the good man Abel . This also includes Barachiah 's son Zechariah , [ d ] the man you murdered between the temple and the altar .
CEV	Matthew	23	36	I can promise that you people living today will be punished for all these things ! Jesus Loves Jerusalem ( Luke 13.34,35 )
CEV	Matthew	23	37	Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! Your people have killed the prophets and have stoned the messengers who were sent to you . I have often wanted to gather your people , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings . But you would n't let me .
CEV	Matthew	23	38	( I ) And now your temple will be deserted .
CEV	Matthew	23	39	( J ) You wo n't see me again until you say , “ Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord. ” Footnotes - 23.5 wearing Scripture verses on their foreheads and arms … tassels : As a sign of their love for God and his teachings , the Jewish people often wore Scripture verses in small leather boxes . But the Pharisees tried to show off by making the boxes bigger than necessary . The Jewish people were also taught to wear tassels on the four corners of their robes to show their love for God . - 23.13,14 from going in : Some manuscripts add , “ You Pharisees and teachers are in for trouble ! And you 're nothing but show-offs ! You cheat widows out of their homes and then pray long prayers just to show off . So you will be punished most of all. ” - 23.27 whitewashed : Tombs were whitewashed to keep anyone from accidentally touching them . A person who touched a dead body or a tomb was considered unclean and could not worship with the rest of the Jewish people . - 23.35 Zechariah : Genesis is the first book in the Jewish Scriptures , and it tells that Abel was the first person to be murdered . Second Chronicles is the last book in the Jewish Scriptures , and the last murder that it tells about is that of Zechariah . Copyright ©

CEV	Matthew	24	24	False messiahs and false prophets will come and work great miracles and signs . They will even try to fool God 's chosen ones .
CEV	Matthew	24	2	Jesus replied , “ Do you see these buildings ? They will certainly be torn down ! Not one stone will be left in place. ” Warning about Trouble ( Mark 13.3-13 ; Luke 21.7-19 )
CEV	Matthew	24	3	( A ) Later , as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , his disciples came to him in private and asked , “ When will this happen ? What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world ? ”
CEV	Matthew	24	4	Jesus answered : Do n't let anyone fool you .
CEV	Matthew	24	5	Many will come and claim to be me . They will say they are the Messiah , and they will fool many people .
CEV	Matthew	24	6	You will soon hear about wars and threats of wars , but do n't be afraid . These things will have to happen first , but that is n't the end .
CEV	Matthew	24	7	( B ) Nations and kingdoms will go to war against each other . People will starve to death , and in some places there will be earthquakes .
CEV	Matthew	24	8	But this is just the beginning of troubles .
CEV	Matthew	24	9	( C ) You will be arrested , punished , and even killed . Because of me , you will be hated by people of all nations .
CEV	Matthew	24	10	Many will give up and will betray and hate each other .
CEV	Matthew	24	11	Many false prophets will come and fool a lot of people .
CEV	Matthew	24	12	Evil will spread and cause many people to stop loving others .
CEV	Matthew	24	13	( D ) But if you keep on being faithful right to the end , you will be saved .
CEV	Matthew	24	14	When the good news about the kingdom has been preached all over the world and told to all nations , the end will come . The Horrible Thing ( Mark 13.14-23 ; Luke 21.20-24 )
CEV	Matthew	24	15	( E ) Someday you will see that “ Horrible Thing ” in the holy place , just as the prophet Daniel said . Everyone who reads this must try to understand !
CEV	Matthew	24	16	If you are living in Judea at that time , run to the mountains .
CEV	Matthew	24	17	( F ) If you are on the roof [ a ] of your house , do n't go inside to get anything .
CEV	Matthew	24	18	If you are out in the field , do n't go back for your coat .
CEV	Matthew	24	19	It will be a terrible time for women who are expecting babies or nursing young children .
CEV	Matthew	24	20	And pray that you wo n't have to escape in winter or on a Sabbath . [ b ]
CEV	Matthew	24	21	( G ) This will be the worst time of suffering since the beginning of the world , and nothing this terrible will ever happen again .
CEV	Matthew	24	22	If God does n't make the time shorter , no one will be left alive . But because of God 's chosen ones , he will make the time shorter .
CEV	Matthew	24	23	Someone may say , “ Here is the Messiah ! ” or “ There he is ! ” But do n't believe it .
CEV	Matthew	24	25	But I have warned you ahead of time .
CEV	Matthew	24	26	( H ) If you are told the Messiah is out in the desert , do n't go there ! And if you are told he is in some secret place , do n't believe it !
CEV	Matthew	24	27	The coming of the Son of Man will be like lightning that can be seen from east to west .
CEV	Matthew	24	28	( I ) Where there is a corpse , there will always be vultures . [ c ] When the Son of Man Appears ( Mark 13.24-27 ; Luke 21.25-28 )
CEV	Matthew	24	29	( J ) Right after those days of suffering , “ The sun will become dark , and the moon will no longer shine . The stars will fall , and the powers in the sky [ d ] will be shaken. ”
CEV	Matthew	24	30	( K ) Then a sign will appear in the sky . And there will be the Son of Man . [ e ] All nations on earth will weep when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
CEV	Matthew	24	31	At the sound of a loud trumpet , he will send his angels to bring his chosen ones together from all over the earth . A Lesson from a Fig Tree ( Mark 13.28-31 ; Luke 21.29-33 )
CEV	Matthew	24	32	Learn a lesson from a fig tree . When its branches sprout and start putting out leaves , you know summer is near .
CEV	Matthew	24	33	So when you see all these things happening , you will know the time has almost come . [ f ]
CEV	Matthew	24	34	I can promise you that some of the people of this generation will still be alive when all this happens .
CEV	Matthew	24	35	The sky and the earth wo n't last forever , but my words will . No One Knows the Day or Time ( Mark 13.32-37 ; Luke 17.26-30,34-36 )
CEV	Matthew	24	36	No one knows the day or hour . The angels in heaven do n't know , and the Son himself does n't know . [ g ] Only the Father knows .
CEV	Matthew	24	37	( L ) When the Son of Man appears , things will be just as they were when Noah lived .
CEV	Matthew	24	38	People were eating , drinking , and getting married right up to the day the flood came and Noah went into the big boat .
CEV	Matthew	24	39	( M ) They did n't know anything was happening until the flood came and swept them all away . This is how it will be when the Son of Man appears .
CEV	Matthew	24	40	Two men will be in the same field , but only one will be taken . The other will be left .
CEV	Matthew	24	41	Two women will be together grinding grain , but only one will be taken . The other will be left .
CEV	Matthew	24	42	So be on your guard ! You do n't know when your Lord will come .
CEV	Matthew	24	43	( N ) Homeowners never know when a thief is coming , and they are always on guard to keep one from breaking in .
CEV	Matthew	24	44	Always be ready ! You do n't know when the Son of Man will come . Faithful and Unfaithful Servants ( Luke 12.35-48 )
CEV	Matthew	24	45	Who are faithful and wise servants ? Who are the ones the master will put in charge of giving the other servants their food supplies at the proper time ?
CEV	Matthew	24	46	Servants are fortunate if their master comes and finds them doing their job .
CEV	Matthew	24	47	You may be sure a servant who is always faithful will be put in charge of everything the master owns .
CEV	Matthew	24	48	But suppose one of the servants thinks the master wo n't return until late .
CEV	Matthew	24	49	Suppose this evil servant starts beating the other servants and eats and drinks with people who are drunk .
CEV	Matthew	24	50	If that happens , the master will surely come on a day and at a time when the servant least expects him .
CEV	Matthew	24	51	This servant will then be punished and thrown out with the ones who only pretended to serve their master . There they will cry and grit their teeth in pain . Footnotes - 24.17 roof : In Palestine the houses usually had a flat roof . Stairs on the outside led up to the roof , which was made of beams and boards covered with packed earth . - 24.20 in winter or on a Sabbath : In Palestine the winters are cold and rainy and make travel difficult . The Jewish people were not allowed to travel much more than a kilometer on the Sabbath . For these reasons it was hard for them to escape from their enemies in the winter or on a Sabbath . - 24.28 Where there is a corpse , there will always be vultures : This saying may mean that when anything important happens , people soon know about it . Or the saying may mean that whenever something bad happens , curious people gather around and stare . But the word translated “ vulture ” also means “ eagle ” and may refer to the Roman army , which had an eagle as its symbol . - 24.29 the powers in the sky : In ancient times people thought that the stars were spiritual powers . - 24.30 And there will be the Son of Man : Or “ And it will be the Son of Man. ” - 24.33 the time has almost come : Or “ he ( that is , the Son of Man ) will soon be here. ” - 24.36 and the Son himself does n't know : These words are not in some manuscripts .

CEV	Matthew	25	2	Five of them were foolish and five were wise .
CEV	Matthew	25	3	The foolish ones took their lamps , but no extra oil .
CEV	Matthew	25	4	The ones who were wise took along extra oil for their lamps .
CEV	Matthew	25	5	The groom was late arriving , and the young women became drowsy and fell asleep .
CEV	Matthew	25	6	Then in the middle of the night someone shouted , “ Here 's the groom ! Come to meet him ! ”

CEV	Matthew	25	8	the foolish ones said to the others , “ Let us have some of your oil ! Our lamps are going out. ”
CEV	Matthew	25	9	Those who were wise answered , “ There 's not enough oil for all of us ! Go and buy some for yourselves. ”
CEV	Matthew	25	10	While the foolish ones were on their way to get some oil , the groom arrived . The five who were ready went into the wedding , and the doors were closed .
CEV	Matthew	25	11	( B ) Later the others returned and shouted , “ Sir , sir ! Open the door for us ! ”
CEV	Matthew	25	12	But the groom replied , “ I do n't even know you ! ”
CEV	Matthew	25	13	So , my disciples , always be ready ! You do n't know the day or the time when all this will happen . A Story about Three Servants ( Luke 19.11-27 )
CEV	Matthew	25	14	( C ) The kingdom is also like what happened when a man went away and put his three servants in charge of all he owned .

CEV	Matthew	25	16	As soon as the man had gone , the servant with the 5,000 coins used them to earn 5,000 more .
CEV	Matthew	25	17	The servant who had 2,000 coins did the same with his money and earned 2,000 more .
CEV	Matthew	25	18	But the servant with 1,000 coins dug a hole and hid his master 's money in the ground .
CEV	Matthew	25	19	Some time later the master of those servants returned . He called them in and asked what they had done with his money .
CEV	Matthew	25	20	The servant who had been given 5,000 coins brought them in with the 5,000 that he had earned . He said , “ Sir , you gave me 5,000 coins , and I have earned 5,000 more. ”
CEV	Matthew	25	21	“ Wonderful ! ” his master replied . “ You are a good and faithful servant . I left you in charge of only a little , but now I will put you in charge of much more . Come and share in my happiness ! ”
CEV	Matthew	25	22	Next , the servant who had been given 2,000 coins came in and said , “ Sir , you gave me 2,000 coins , and I have earned 2,000 more. ”
CEV	Matthew	25	23	“ Wonderful ! ” his master replied . “ You are a good and faithful servant . I left you in charge of only a little , but now I will put you in charge of much more . Come and share in my happiness ! ”
CEV	Matthew	25	24	The servant who had been given 1,000 coins then came in and said , “ Sir , I know that you are hard to work for . You harvest what you do n't plant and gather crops where you have n't scattered seed .
CEV	Matthew	25	26	The master of the servant told him , “ You are lazy and good-for-nothing ! You know I harvest what I do n't plant and gather crops where I have n't scattered seed .
CEV	Matthew	25	27	You could have at least put my money in the bank , so I could have earned interest on it. ”
CEV	Matthew	25	28	Then the master said , “ Now your money will be taken away and given to the servant with 10,000 coins !
CEV	Matthew	25	29	( D ) Everyone who has something will be given more , and they will have more than enough . But everything will be taken from those who do n't have anything .

CEV	Matthew	25	33	He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left .
CEV	Matthew	25	34	Then the king will say to those on his right , “ My father has blessed you ! Come and receive the kingdom that was prepared for you before the world was created .
CEV	Matthew	25	35	( G ) When I was hungry , you gave me something to eat , and when I was thirsty , you gave me something to drink . When I was a stranger , you welcomed me ,
CEV	Matthew	25	36	and when I was naked , you gave me clothes to wear . When I was sick , you took care of me , and when I was in jail , you visited me. ”
CEV	Matthew	25	37	Then the ones who pleased the Lord will ask , “ When did we give you something to eat or drink ?
CEV	Matthew	25	38	When did we welcome you as a stranger or give you clothes to wear
CEV	Matthew	25	39	or visit you while you were sick or in jail ? ”
CEV	Matthew	25	40	The king will answer , “ Whenever you did it for any of my people , no matter how unimportant they seemed , you did it for me. ”
CEV	Matthew	25	41	Then the king will say to those on his left , “ Get away from me ! You are under God 's curse . Go into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels !
CEV	Matthew	25	42	I was hungry , but you did not give me anything to eat , and I was thirsty , but you did not give me anything to drink .
CEV	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger , but you did not welcome me , and I was naked , but you did not give me any clothes to wear . I was sick and in jail , but you did not take care of me. ”
CEV	Matthew	25	44	Then the people will ask , “ Lord , when did we fail to help you when you were hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in jail ? ”
CEV	Matthew	25	45	The king will say to them , “ Whenever you failed to help any of my people , no matter how unimportant they seemed , you failed to do it for me. ”

CEV	Matthew	28	11	While the women were on their way , some soldiers who had been guarding the tomb went into the city . They told the chief priests everything that had happened .
CEV	Matthew	28	12	So the chief priests met with the leaders and decided to bribe the soldiers with a lot of money .
CEV	Matthew	28	13	They said to the soldiers , “ Tell everyone that Jesus ' disciples came during the night and stole his body while you were asleep .

CEV	Mark	1	3	( B ) In the desert someone is shouting , ‘ Get the road ready for the Lord ! Make a straight path for him. ’ ”

CEV	Mark	1	5	From all Judea and Jerusalem crowds of people went to John . They told how sorry they were for their sins , and he baptized them in the Jordan River .
CEV	Mark	1	6	( C ) John wore clothes made of camel 's hair . He had a leather strap around his waist and ate grasshoppers and wild honey .
CEV	Mark	1	7	John also told the people , “ Someone more powerful is going to come . And I am not good enough even to stoop down and untie his sandals . [ b ]

CEV	Mark	1	17	Jesus said to them , “ Follow me ! I will teach you how to bring in people instead of fish. ”
CEV	Mark	1	18	Right then the two brothers dropped their nets and went with him .
CEV	Mark	1	19	Jesus walked on and soon saw James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in a boat , mending their nets .

CEV	Mark	1	22	( F ) Everyone was amazed at his teaching . He taught with authority , and not like the teachers of the Law of Moses .
CEV	Mark	1	23	Suddenly a man with an evil spirit [ e ] in him entered the synagogue and yelled ,
CEV	Mark	1	24	“ Jesus from Nazareth , what do you want with us ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are ! You are God 's Holy One. ”
CEV	Mark	1	25	Jesus told the evil spirit , “ Be quiet and come out of the man ! ”
CEV	Mark	1	26	The spirit shook him . Then it gave a loud shout and left .
CEV	Mark	1	27	Everyone was completely surprised and kept saying to each other , “ What is this ? It must be some new kind of powerful teaching ! Even the evil spirits obey him. ”
CEV	Mark	1	28	News about Jesus quickly spread all over Galilee . Jesus Heals Many People ( Matthew 8.14-17 ; Luke 4.38-41 )
CEV	Mark	1	29	As soon as Jesus left the synagogue with James and John , they went home with Simon and Andrew .
CEV	Mark	1	30	When they got there , Jesus was told that Simon 's mother-in-law was sick in bed with fever .
CEV	Mark	1	31	Jesus went to her . He took hold of her hand and helped her up . The fever left her , and she served them a meal .
CEV	Mark	1	32	That evening after sunset , [ f ] all who were sick or had demons in them were brought to Jesus .
CEV	Mark	1	33	In fact , the whole town gathered around the door of the house .
CEV	Mark	1	34	Jesus healed all kinds of terrible diseases and forced out a lot of demons . But the demons knew who he was , and he did not let them speak .
CEV	Mark	1	35	Very early the next morning before daylight , Jesus got up and went to a place where he could be alone and pray .
CEV	Mark	1	36	Simon and the others started looking for him .
CEV	Mark	1	37	And when they found him , they said , “ Everyone is looking for you ! ”
CEV	Mark	1	38	Jesus replied , “ We must go to the nearby towns , so that I can tell the good news to those people . This is why I have come. ”
CEV	Mark	1	39	( G ) Then Jesus went to their synagogues everywhere in Galilee , where he preached and forced out demons . Jesus Heals a Man ( Matthew 8.1-4 ; Luke 5.12-16 )
CEV	Mark	1	41	Jesus felt sorry for [ i ] the man . So he put his hand on him and said , “ I want to ! Now you are well. ”
CEV	Mark	1	42	At once the man 's leprosy disappeared , and he was well .
CEV	Mark	1	43	After Jesus strictly warned the man , he sent him on his way .
CEV	Mark	1	44	( H ) He said , “ Do n't tell anyone about this . Just go and show the priest that you are well . Then take a gift to the temple as Moses commanded , and everyone will know that you have been healed. ” [ j ]

CEV	Mark	2	2	Then so many of them came to the house that there was n't even standing room left in front of the door . Jesus was still teaching
CEV	Mark	2	3	when four people came up , carrying a man on a mat because he could not walk .
CEV	Mark	2	4	But because of the crowd , they could not get him to Jesus . So they made a hole in the roof [ b ] above him and let the man down in front of everyone .
CEV	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the man , “ My friend , your sins are forgiven. ”
CEV	Mark	2	6	Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were sitting there . They started wondering ,
CEV	Mark	2	7	“ Why would he say such a thing ? He must think he is God ! Only God can forgive sins. ”
CEV	Mark	2	8	At once , Jesus knew what they were thinking , and he said , “ Why are you thinking such things ?
CEV	Mark	2	9	Is it easier for me to tell this man his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and pick up his mat and go on home ?
CEV	Mark	2	10	I will show you that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth. ” So Jesus said to the man ,
CEV	Mark	2	11	“ Get up ! Pick up your mat and go on home. ”
CEV	Mark	2	12	The man got right up . He picked up his mat and went out while everyone watched in amazement . They praised God and said , “ We have never seen anything like this ! ” Jesus Chooses Levi ( Matthew 9.9-13 ; Luke 5.27-32 )
CEV	Mark	2	13	Once again , Jesus went to the shore of Lake Galilee . A large crowd gathered around him , and he taught them .
CEV	Mark	2	14	As he walked along , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus . Levi was sitting at the place for paying taxes , and Jesus said to him , “ Follow me ! ” So he got up and went with Jesus .
CEV	Mark	2	15	Later , Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Levi 's house . [ c ] Many tax collectors [ d ] and other sinners had become followers of Jesus , and they were also guests at the dinner .
CEV	Mark	2	16	Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were Pharisees , and they saw Jesus eating with sinners and tax collectors . So they asked his disciples , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
CEV	Mark	2	17	Jesus heard them and answered , “ Healthy people do n't need a doctor , but sick people do . I did n't come to invite good people to be my followers . I came to invite sinners. ” People Ask about Going without Eating ( Matthew 9.14-17 ; Luke 5.33-39 )
CEV	Mark	2	18	The followers of John the Baptist and the Pharisees often went without eating . [ e ] Some people came and asked Jesus , “ Why do the followers of John and those of the Pharisees often go without eating , while your disciples never do ? ”
CEV	Mark	2	19	Jesus answered : The friends of a bridegroom do n't go without eating while he is still with them .
CEV	Mark	2	20	But the time will come when he will be taken from them . Then they will go without eating .
CEV	Mark	2	21	No one patches old clothes by sewing on a piece of new cloth . The new piece would shrink and tear a bigger hole .
CEV	Mark	2	22	No one pours new wine into old wineskins . The wine would swell and burst the old skins . [ f ] Then the wine would be lost , and the skins would be ruined . New wine must be put into new wineskins . A Question about the Sabbath ( Matthew 12.1-8 ; Luke 6.1-5 )
CEV	Mark	2	23	( A ) One Sabbath Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields . His disciples were picking grains of wheat as they went along . [ g ]
CEV	Mark	2	24	Some Pharisees asked Jesus , “ Why are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath ? They are not supposed to do that ! ”
CEV	Mark	2	25	( B ) Jesus answered , “ Have n't you read what David did when he and his followers were hungry and in need ?
CEV	Mark	2	26	( C ) It was during the time of Abiathar the high priest . David went into the house of God and ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are allowed to eat . He also gave some to his followers. ”
CEV	Mark	2	27	Jesus finished by saying , “ People were not made for the good of the Sabbath . The Sabbath was made for the good of people .

CEV	Mark	3	3	Jesus told the man to stand up where everyone could see him .
CEV	Mark	3	2	The Pharisees [ a ] wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong , and they kept watching to see if Jesus would heal him on the Sabbath .
CEV	Mark	3	4	Then he asked , “ On the Sabbath should we do good deeds or evil deeds ? Should we save someone 's life or destroy it ? ” But no one said a word .
CEV	Mark	3	5	Jesus was angry as he looked around at the people . Yet he felt sorry for them because they were so stubborn . Then he told the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” He did , and his bad hand was healed .

CEV	Mark	3	7	Jesus led his disciples down to the shore of the lake . Large crowds followed him from Galilee , Judea ,
CEV	Mark	3	8	and Jerusalem . People came from Idumea , as well as other places east of the Jordan River . They also came from the region around the towns of Tyre and Sidon . All of these crowds came because they had heard what Jesus was doing .
CEV	Mark	3	9	( A ) He even had to tell his disciples to get a boat ready to keep him from being crushed by the crowds .
CEV	Mark	3	10	After Jesus had healed many people , the other sick people begged him to let them touch him .
CEV	Mark	3	11	And whenever any evil spirits saw Jesus , they would fall to the ground and shout , “ You are the Son of God ! ”
CEV	Mark	3	12	But Jesus warned the spirits not to tell who he was . Jesus Chooses His Twelve Apostles ( Matthew 10.1-4 ; Luke 6.12-16 )
CEV	Mark	3	13	Jesus decided to ask some of his disciples to go up on a mountain with him , and they went .
CEV	Mark	3	14	Then he chose twelve of them to be his apostles , [ c ] so they could be with him . He also wanted to send them out to preach
CEV	Mark	3	15	and to force out demons .
CEV	Mark	3	16	Simon was one of the twelve , and Jesus named him Peter .
CEV	Mark	3	17	There were also James and John , the two sons of Zebedee . Jesus called them Boanerges , which means “ Thunderbolts. ”
CEV	Mark	3	18	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus were also apostles . The others were Simon , known as the Eager One , [ d ]
CEV	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot , [ e ] who later betrayed Jesus . Jesus and the Ruler of Demons ( Matthew 12.22-32 ; Luke 11.14-23 ; 12.10 )
CEV	Mark	3	20	Jesus went back home , [ f ] and once again such a large crowd gathered that there was no chance even to eat .
CEV	Mark	3	21	When Jesus ' family heard what he was doing , they thought he was crazy and went to get him under control .
CEV	Mark	3	22	( B ) Some teachers of the Law of Moses came from Jerusalem and said , “ This man is under the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of demons ! He is even forcing out demons with the help of Beelzebul. ”
CEV	Mark	3	23	Jesus told the people to gather around him . Then he spoke to them in riddles and said : How can Satan force himself out ?
CEV	Mark	3	24	A nation whose people fight each other wo n't last very long .
CEV	Mark	3	25	And a family that fights wo n't last long either .
CEV	Mark	3	26	So if Satan fights against himself , that will be the end of him .
CEV	Mark	3	27	How can anyone break into the house of a strong man and steal his things , unless he first ties up the strong man ? Then he can take everything .
CEV	Mark	3	28	I promise you that any of the sinful things you say or do can be forgiven , no matter how terrible those things are .
CEV	Mark	3	29	( C ) But if you speak against the Holy Spirit , you can never be forgiven . That sin will be held against you forever .
CEV	Mark	3	30	Jesus said this because the people were saying that he had an evil spirit in him . Jesus ' Mother and Brothers ( Matthew 12.46-50 ; Luke 8.19-21 )
CEV	Mark	3	31	Jesus ' mother and brothers came and stood outside . Then they sent someone with a message for him to come out to them .
CEV	Mark	3	32	The crowd sitting around Jesus told him , “ Your mother and your brothers and sisters [ g ] are outside and want to see you. ”
CEV	Mark	3	33	Jesus asked , “ Who is my mother and who are my brothers ? ”
CEV	Mark	3	34	Then he looked at the people sitting around him and said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers .

CEV	Mark	4	4	While the farmer was scattering the seed , some of it fell along the road and was eaten by birds .
CEV	Mark	4	2	He used stories to teach them many things , and this is part of what he taught :
CEV	Mark	4	3	Now listen ! A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field .
CEV	Mark	4	5	Other seeds fell on thin , rocky ground and quickly started growing because the soil was n't very deep .
CEV	Mark	4	6	But when the sun came up , the plants were scorched and dried up , because they did not have deep roots .
CEV	Mark	4	7	Some other seeds fell where thornbushes grew up and choked out the plants . So they did not produce any grain .
CEV	Mark	4	8	But a few seeds did fall on good ground where the plants grew and produced
CEV	Mark	4	30	Finally , Jesus said : What is God 's kingdom like ? What story can I use to explain it ?
CEV	Mark	4	60	or even
CEV	Mark	4	100	times as much as was planted . Light ( Luke 8.16-18 )
CEV	Mark	4	9	Then Jesus said , “ If you have ears , pay attention. ” Why Jesus Used Stories ( Matthew 13.10-17 ; Luke 8.9,10 )
CEV	Mark	4	10	When Jesus was alone with the twelve apostles and some others , they asked him about these stories .
CEV	Mark	4	11	He answered : I have explained the secret about God 's kingdom to you , but for others I can use only stories .
CEV	Mark	4	12	( B ) The reason is , “ These people will look and look , but never see . They will listen and listen , but never understand . If they did , they would turn to God and be forgiven. ” Jesus Explains the Story about the Farmer ( Matthew 13.18-23 ; Luke 8.11-15 )
CEV	Mark	4	13	Jesus then told them : If you do n't understand this story , you wo n't understand any others .
CEV	Mark	4	14	What the farmer is spreading is really the message about the kingdom .
CEV	Mark	4	15	The seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message . But Satan soon comes and snatches it away from them .
CEV	Mark	4	16	The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it at once .
CEV	Mark	4	17	But they do n't have roots , and they do n't last very long . As soon as life gets hard or the message gets them in trouble , they give up .
CEV	Mark	4	18	The seeds that fell among the thornbushes are also people who hear the message .
CEV	Mark	4	19	But they start worrying about the needs of this life . They are fooled by the desire to get rich and to have all kinds of other things . So the message gets choked out , and they never produce anything .
CEV	Mark	4	20	The seeds that fell on good ground are the people who hear and welcome the message . They produce
CEV	Mark	4	21	( C ) Jesus also said : You do n't light a lamp and put it under a clay pot or under a bed . Do n't you put a lamp on a lampstand ?
CEV	Mark	4	22	( D ) There is nothing hidden that will not be made public . There is no secret that will not be well known .
CEV	Mark	4	23	If you have ears , pay attention !
CEV	Mark	4	24	( E ) Listen carefully to what you hear ! The way you treat others will be the way you will be treated—and even worse .
CEV	Mark	4	25	( F ) Everyone who has something will be given more . But people who do n't have anything will lose what little they have . Another Story about Seeds
CEV	Mark	4	26	Again Jesus said : God 's kingdom is like what happens when a farmer scatters seed in a field .
CEV	Mark	4	27	The farmer sleeps at night and is up and around during the day . Yet the seeds keep sprouting and growing , and he does n't understand how .
CEV	Mark	4	28	It is the ground that makes the seeds sprout and grow into plants that produce grain .
CEV	Mark	4	29	( G ) Then when harvest season comes and the grain is ripe , the farmer cuts it with a sickle . [ a ] A Mustard Seed ( Matthew 13.31,32 ; Luke 13.18,19 )
CEV	Mark	4	31	It is like what happens when a mustard seed is planted in the ground . It is the smallest seed in all the world .
CEV	Mark	4	32	But once it is planted , it grows larger than any garden plant . It even puts out branches that are big enough for birds to nest in its shade . The Reason for Teaching with Stories ( Matthew 13.34,35 )
CEV	Mark	4	33	Jesus used many other stories when he spoke to the people , and he taught them as much as they could understand .
CEV	Mark	4	34	He did not tell them anything without using stories . But when he was alone with his disciples , he explained everything to them . A Storm ( Matthew 8.23-27 ; Luke 8.22-25 )
CEV	Mark	4	35	That evening , Jesus said to his disciples , “ Let 's cross to the east side. ”
CEV	Mark	4	36	So they left the crowd , and his disciples started across the lake with him in the boat . Some other boats followed along .
CEV	Mark	4	37	Suddenly a storm struck the lake . Waves started splashing into the boat , and it was about to sink .
CEV	Mark	4	38	Jesus was in the back of the boat with his head on a pillow , and he was asleep . His disciples woke him and said , “ Teacher , do n't you care that we 're about to drown ? ”
CEV	Mark	4	39	Jesus got up and ordered the wind and the waves to be quiet . The wind stopped , and everything was calm .
CEV	Mark	4	40	Jesus asked his disciples , “ Why were you afraid ? Do n't you have any faith ? ”
CEV	Mark	4	41	Now they were more afraid than ever and said to each other , “ Who is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! ” Footnotes - 4.29 sickle : A knife with a long curved blade , used to cut grain and other crops . Copyright ©

CEV	Mark	5	5	Night and day he was in the graveyard or on the hills , yelling and cutting himself with stones .
CEV	Mark	5	2	When he was getting out of the boat , a man with an evil spirit quickly ran to him
CEV	Mark	5	3	from the graveyard [ b ] where he had been living . No one was able to tie the man up anymore , not even with a chain .

CEV	Mark	5	7	He shouted , “ Jesus , Son of God in heaven , what do you want with me ? Promise me in God 's name that you wo n't torture me ! ”
CEV	Mark	5	8	The man said this because Jesus had already told the evil spirit to come out of him .
CEV	Mark	5	9	Jesus asked , “ What is your name ? ” The man answered , “ My name is Lots , because I have ‘ lots ’ of evil spirits. ”
CEV	Mark	5	10	He then begged Jesus not to send them away .
CEV	Mark	5	11	Over on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding .
CEV	Mark	5	12	So the evil spirits begged Jesus , “ Send us into those pigs ! Let us go into them. ”
CEV	Mark	5	13	Jesus let them go , and they went out of the man and into the pigs . The whole herd of about 2,000 pigs rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned .
CEV	Mark	5	14	The men taking care of the pigs ran to the town and the farms to spread the news . Then the people came out to see what had happened .
CEV	Mark	5	15	When they came to Jesus , they saw the man who had once been full of demons . He was sitting there with his clothes on and in his right mind , and they were terrified .

CEV	Mark	5	18	When Jesus was getting into the boat , the man begged to go with him .

CEV	Mark	5	28	She had said to herself , “ If I can just touch his clothes , I will be healed. ”
CEV	Mark	5	29	As soon as she touched them , her bleeding stopped , and she knew she was healed .
CEV	Mark	5	30	At that moment Jesus felt power go out from him . He turned to the crowd and asked , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
CEV	Mark	5	31	His disciples said to him , “ Look at all these people crowding around you ! How can you ask who touched you ? ”
CEV	Mark	5	32	But Jesus turned to see who had touched him .
CEV	Mark	5	33	The woman knew what had happened to her . So she came trembling with fear and knelt down in front of Jesus . Then she told him the whole story .

CEV	Mark	5	38	They went home with Jairus and saw the people crying and making a lot of noise . [ f ]
CEV	Mark	5	39	Then Jesus went inside and said to them , “ Why are you crying and carrying on like this ? The child is n't dead . She is just asleep. ”
CEV	Mark	5	40	But the people laughed at him . After Jesus had sent them all out of the house , he took the girl 's father and mother and his three disciples and went to where she was . 41-42 He took the twelve-year-old girl by the hand and said , “ Talitha , koum ! ” [ g ] which means , “ Little girl , get up ! ” The girl got right up and started walking around .

CEV	Mark	9	16	Jesus asked , “ What are you arguing about ? ”
CEV	Mark	9	17	Someone from the crowd answered , “ Teacher , I brought my son to you . A demon keeps him from talking .
CEV	Mark	9	18	Whenever the demon attacks my son , it throws him to the ground and makes him foam at the mouth and grit his teeth in pain . Then he becomes stiff . I asked your disciples to force out the demon , but they could n't do it. ”
CEV	Mark	9	19	Jesus said , “ You people do n't have any faith ! How much longer must I be with you ? Why do I have to put up with you ? Bring the boy to me. ”
CEV	Mark	9	20	They brought the boy , and as soon as the demon saw Jesus , it made the boy shake all over . He fell down and began rolling on the ground and foaming at the mouth .
CEV	Mark	9	21	Jesus asked the boy 's father , “ How long has he been like this ? ” The man answered , “ Ever since he was a child .
CEV	Mark	9	22	The demon has often tried to kill him by throwing him into a fire or into water . Please have pity and help us if you can ! ”
CEV	Mark	9	23	Jesus replied , “ Why do you say ‘ if you can ’ ? Anything is possible for someone who has faith ! ”
CEV	Mark	9	24	At once the boy 's father shouted , “ I do have faith ! Please help me to have even more. ”
CEV	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was gathering fast , he spoke sternly to the evil spirit that had kept the boy from speaking or hearing . He said , “ I order you to come out of the boy ! Do n't ever bother him again. ”
CEV	Mark	9	26	The spirit screamed and made the boy shake all over . Then it went out of him . The boy looked dead , and almost everyone said he was .
CEV	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up .
CEV	Mark	9	28	After Jesus and the disciples had gone back home and were alone , they asked him , “ Why could n't we force out that demon ? ”
CEV	Mark	9	29	Jesus answered , “ Only prayer can force out this kind of demon. ” Jesus Again Speaks about His Death ( Matthew 17.22,23 ; Luke 9.43b-45 )
CEV	Mark	9	30	Jesus left with his disciples and started through Galilee . He did not want anyone to know about it ,
CEV	Mark	9	31	because he was teaching the disciples that the Son of Man would be handed over to people who would kill him . But three days later he would rise to life .
CEV	Mark	9	32	The disciples did not understand what Jesus meant , and they were afraid to ask . Who Is the Greatest ? ( Matthew 18.1-5 ; Luke 9.46-48 )
CEV	Mark	9	33	Jesus and his disciples went to his home in Capernaum . After they were inside the house , Jesus asked them , “ What were you arguing about along the way ? ”
CEV	Mark	9	34	( E ) They had been arguing about which one of them was the greatest , and so they did not answer .
CEV	Mark	9	35	( F ) After Jesus sat down and told the twelve disciples to gather around him , he said , “ If you want the place of honor , you must become a slave and serve others ! ”
CEV	Mark	9	36	Then Jesus asked a child to stand near him . He put his arm around the child and said ,
CEV	Mark	9	37	( G ) “ When you welcome even a child because of me , you welcome me . And when you welcome me , you welcome the one who sent me. ” For or against Jesus ( Luke 9.49,50 )
CEV	Mark	9	38	John said , “ Teacher , we saw a man using your name to force demons out of people . But he was n't one of us , and we told him to stop. ”
CEV	Mark	9	39	Jesus said to his disciples : Do n't stop him ! No one who works miracles in my name will soon turn and say something bad about me .
CEV	Mark	9	40	( H ) Anyone who is n't against us is for us .
CEV	Mark	9	41	( I ) And anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name , just because you belong to me , will surely be rewarded . Temptations To Sin ( Matthew 18.6-9 ; Luke 17.1,2 )
CEV	Mark	9	42	It will be terrible for people who cause even one of my little followers to sin . Those people would be better off thrown into the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their necks . 43-44 ( J ) So if your hand causes you to sin , cut it off ! You would be better off to go into life paralyzed than to have two hands and be thrown into the fires of hell that never go out . [ b ] 45-46 If your foot causes you to sin , chop it off . You would be better off to go into life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell . [ c ]
CEV	Mark	9	47	( K ) If your eye causes you to sin , get rid of it . You would be better off to go into God 's kingdom with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell .
CEV	Mark	9	48	( L ) The worms there never die , and the fire never stops burning .
CEV	Mark	9	49	Everyone must be salted with fire . [ d ]
CEV	Mark	9	50	( M ) Salt is good . But if it no longer tastes like salt , how can it be made salty again ? Have salt among you and live at peace with each other . [ e ] Footnotes - 9.12 Elijah certainly will come : See the note at 6.15 . - 9.43,44 never go out : Some manuscripts add , “ The worms there never die , and the fire never stops burning. ” - 9.45,46 thrown into hell : Some manuscripts add , “ The worms there never die , and the fire never stops burning. ” - 9.49 salted with fire : Some manuscripts add “ and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt. ” The verse may mean that Christ 's followers must suffer because of their faith . - 9.50 Have salt among you and live at peace with each other : This may mean that when Christ 's followers have to suffer because of their faith , they must still try to live at peace with each other .

CEV	Mark	10	10	When Jesus and his disciples were back in the house , they asked him about what he had said .
CEV	Mark	10	2	Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus . So they came up to him and asked if it was right for a man to divorce his wife .
CEV	Mark	10	3	Jesus asked them , “ What does the Law of Moses say about this ? ”
CEV	Mark	10	4	( A ) They answered , “ Moses allows a man to write out divorce papers and send his wife away. ”
CEV	Mark	10	5	Jesus replied , “ Moses gave you this law because you are so heartless .
CEV	Mark	10	6	( B ) But in the beginning God made a man and a woman .
CEV	Mark	10	7	( C ) That 's why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married .
CEV	Mark	10	8	He becomes like one person with his wife . Then they are no longer two people , but one .
CEV	Mark	10	9	And no one should separate a couple that God has joined together. ”
CEV	Mark	10	11	( D ) He told them , “ A man who divorces his wife and marries someone else is unfaithful to his wife .
CEV	Mark	10	12	A woman who divorces her husband [ a ] and marries again is also unfaithful. ” Jesus Blesses Little Children ( Matthew 19.13-15 ; Luke 18.15-17 )
CEV	Mark	10	13	Some people brought their children to Jesus so he could bless them by placing his hands on them . But his disciples told the people to stop bothering him .
CEV	Mark	10	14	When Jesus saw this , he became angry and said , “ Let the children come to me ! Do n't try to stop them . People who are like these little children belong to the kingdom of God . [ b ]
CEV	Mark	10	15	( E ) I promise you that you can not get into God 's kingdom , unless you accept it the way a child does. ”
CEV	Mark	10	16	Then Jesus took the children in his arms and blessed them by placing his hands on them . A Rich Man ( Matthew 19.16-30 ; Luke 18.18-30 )
CEV	Mark	10	17	As Jesus was walking down a road , a man ran up to him . He knelt down , and asked , “ Good teacher , what can I do to have eternal life ? ”
CEV	Mark	10	18	Jesus replied , “ Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
CEV	Mark	10	19	( F ) You know the commandments . ‘ Do not murder . Be faithful in marriage . Do not steal . Do not tell lies about others . Do not cheat . Respect your father and mother. ’ ”
CEV	Mark	10	20	The man answered , “ Teacher , I have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man. ”
CEV	Mark	10	21	Jesus looked closely at the man . He liked him and said , “ There 's one thing you still need to do . Go sell everything you own . Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . Then come with me. ”
CEV	Mark	10	22	When the man heard Jesus say this , he went away gloomy and sad because he was very rich .
CEV	Mark	10	23	Jesus looked around and said to his disciples , “ It 's hard for rich people to get into God 's kingdom ! ”
CEV	Mark	10	24	The disciples were shocked to hear this . So Jesus told them again , “ It 's terribly hard [ c ] to get into God 's kingdom !
CEV	Mark	10	25	In fact , it 's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God 's kingdom. ”
CEV	Mark	10	26	Jesus ' disciples were even more amazed . They asked each other , “ How can anyone ever be saved ? ”
CEV	Mark	10	27	Jesus looked at them and said , “ There are some things that people can not do , but God can do anything. ”
CEV	Mark	10	28	Peter replied , “ Remember , we left everything to be your followers ! ”
CEV	Mark	10	29	Jesus told him : You can be sure that anyone who gives up home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or land for me and for the good news
CEV	Mark	10	30	will be rewarded . In this world they will be given
CEV	Mark	10	100	times as many houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and pieces of land , though they will also be mistreated . And in the world to come , they will have eternal life .
CEV	Mark	10	31	( G ) But many who are now first will be last , and many who are now last will be first . Jesus Again Tells about His Death ( Matthew 20.17-19 ; Luke 18.31-34 )
CEV	Mark	10	32	The disciples were confused as Jesus led them toward Jerusalem , and his other followers were afraid . Once again , Jesus took the twelve disciples aside and told them what was going to happen to him . He said :
CEV	Mark	10	33	We are now on our way to Jerusalem where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses . They will sentence him to death and hand him over to foreigners , [ d ]
CEV	Mark	10	34	who will make fun of him and spit on him . They will beat him and kill him . But three days later he will rise to life . The Request of James and John ( Matthew 20.20-28 )
CEV	Mark	10	35	James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came up to Jesus and asked , “ Teacher , will you do us a favor ? ”
CEV	Mark	10	36	Jesus asked them what they wanted ,
CEV	Mark	10	37	and they answered , “ When you come into your glory , please let one of us sit at your right side and the other at your left. ” [ e ]
CEV	Mark	10	38	( H ) Jesus told them , “ You do n't really know what you 're asking ! Are you able to drink from the cup [ f ] that I must soon drink from or be baptized as I must be baptized ? ” [ g ]
CEV	Mark	10	39	“ Yes , we are ! ” James and John answered . Then Jesus replied , “ You certainly will drink from the cup from which I must drink . And you will be baptized just as I must !
CEV	Mark	10	40	But it is n't for me to say who will sit at my right side and at my left . This is for God to decide. ”
CEV	Mark	10	41	When the ten other disciples heard this , they were angry with James and John .
CEV	Mark	10	42	( I ) But Jesus called the disciples together and said : You know that those foreigners who call themselves kings like to order their people around . And their great leaders have full power over the people they rule .
CEV	Mark	10	43	( J ) But do n't act like them . If you want to be great , you must be the servant of all the others .
CEV	Mark	10	44	And if you want to be first , you must be everyone 's slave .
CEV	Mark	10	45	( K ) The Son of Man did not come to be a slave master , but a slave who will give his life to rescue [ h ] many people . Jesus Heals Blind Bartimaeus ( Matthew 20.29-34 ; Luke 18.35-43 )
CEV	Mark	10	46	Jesus and his disciples went to Jericho . And as they were leaving , they were followed by a large crowd . A blind beggar by the name of Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting beside the road .
CEV	Mark	10	47	When he heard that it was Jesus from Nazareth , he shouted , “ Jesus , Son of David , [ i ] have pity on me ! ”
CEV	Mark	10	48	Many people told the man to stop , but he shouted even louder , “ Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
CEV	Mark	10	49	Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him over ! ” They called out to the blind man and said , “ Do n't be afraid ! Come on ! He is calling for you. ”
CEV	Mark	10	50	The man threw off his coat as he jumped up and ran to Jesus .
CEV	Mark	10	51	Jesus asked , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man answered , “ Master , [ j ] I want to see ! ”
CEV	Mark	10	52	Jesus told him , “ You may go . Your eyes are healed because of your faith. ” At once the man could see , and he went down the road with Jesus .

CEV	Mark	11	13	From a distance Jesus saw a fig tree covered with leaves , and he went to see if there were any figs on the tree . But there were none , because it was n't the season for figs .

CEV	Mark	11	29	Jesus answered , “ I have just one question to ask you . If you answer it , I will tell you where I got the right to do these things .
CEV	Mark	11	30	Who gave John the right to baptize ? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being ? ”
CEV	Mark	11	31	They thought it over and said to each other , “ We ca n't say that God gave John this right . Jesus will ask us why we did n't believe John .
CEV	Mark	11	32	On the other hand , these people think that John was a prophet . So we ca n't say it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize. ” They were afraid of the crowd

CEV	Mark	12	7	But they said to themselves , “ Someday he will own this vineyard . Let 's kill him ! That way we can have it all for ourselves. ”
CEV	Mark	12	8	So they grabbed the owner 's son , killed him , and threw his body out of the vineyard .
CEV	Mark	12	9	Jesus asked , “ What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do ? He will come and kill those renters and let someone else have his vineyard .

CEV	Mark	12	19	( D ) Teacher , Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children , his brother should marry the widow . Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother .
CEV	Mark	12	20	There were once seven brothers . The first one married , but died without having any children .
CEV	Mark	12	21	The second brother married his brother 's widow , and he also died without having children . The same thing happened to the third brother ,

CEV	Mark	12	25	When God raises people to life , they wo n't marry . They will be like the angels in heaven .
CEV	Mark	12	26	( E ) You surely know about people being raised to life . You know that in the story about Moses and the burning bush , God said , “ I am the God worshiped by Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob. ” [ b ]

CEV	Mark	12	28	( F ) One of the teachers of the Law of Moses came up while Jesus and the Sadducees were arguing . When he heard Jesus give a good answer , he asked him , “ What is the most important commandment ? ”

CEV	Mark	12	30	You must love him with all your heart , soul , mind , and strength. ’
CEV	Mark	12	31	( H ) The second most important commandment says : ‘ Love others as much as you love yourself. ’ No other commandment is more important than these. ”
CEV	Mark	12	32	( I ) The man replied , “ Teacher , you are certainly right to say there is only one God .
CEV	Mark	12	33	( J ) It is also true that we must love God with all our heart , mind , and strength , and that we must love others as much as we love ourselves . These commandments are more important than all the sacrifices and offerings that we could possibly make. ”
CEV	Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that the man had given a sensible answer , he told him , “ You are not far from God 's kingdom. ” After this , no one dared ask Jesus any more questions . About David 's Son ( Matthew 22.41-46 ; Luke 20.41-44 )
CEV	Mark	12	35	As Jesus was teaching in the temple , he said , “ How can the teachers of the Law of Moses say the Messiah will come from the family of King David ?
CEV	Mark	12	36	( K ) The Holy Spirit led David to say , ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit at my right side [ c ] until I make your enemies into a footstool for you. ’

CEV	Mark	12	39	They like the front seats in the synagogues and the best seats at banquets .

CEV	Mark	13	4	( A ) They asked , “ When will these things happen ? What will be the sign that they are about to take place ? ”
CEV	Mark	13	5	Jesus answered : Watch out and do n't let anyone fool you !
CEV	Mark	13	6	Many will come and claim to be me . They will use my name and fool many people .
CEV	Mark	13	7	When you hear about wars and threats of wars , do n't be afraid . These things will have to happen first , but that is n't the end .
CEV	Mark	13	8	Nations and kingdoms will go to war against each other . There will be earthquakes in many places , and people will starve to death . But this is just the beginning of troubles .
CEV	Mark	13	9	( B ) Be on your guard ! You will be taken to courts and beaten with whips in their synagogues . And because of me , you will have to stand before rulers and kings to tell about your faith .
CEV	Mark	13	10	But before the end comes , the good news must be preached to all nations .
CEV	Mark	13	11	When you are arrested , do n't worry about what you will say . You will be given the right words when the time comes . But you will not really be the ones speaking . Your words will come from the Holy Spirit .
CEV	Mark	13	12	Brothers and sisters will betray each other and have each other put to death . Parents will betray their own children , and children will turn against their parents and have them killed .
CEV	Mark	13	14	( D ) Someday you will see that “ Horrible Thing ” where it should not be . [ a ] Everyone who reads this must try to understand ! If you are living in Judea at that time , run to the mountains .
CEV	Mark	13	15	( E ) If you are on the roof [ b ] of your house , do n't go inside to get anything .
CEV	Mark	13	16	If you are out in the field , do n't go back for your coat .
CEV	Mark	13	17	It will be an awful time for women who are expecting babies or nursing young children .
CEV	Mark	13	18	Pray that it wo n't happen in winter . [ c ]
CEV	Mark	13	19	( F ) This will be the worst time of suffering since God created the world , and nothing this terrible will ever happen again .
CEV	Mark	13	20	If the Lord does n't make the time shorter , no one will be left alive . But because of his chosen and special ones , he will make the time shorter .
CEV	Mark	13	21	If someone should say , “ Here is the Messiah ! ” or “ There he is ! ” do n't believe it .
CEV	Mark	13	22	False messiahs and false prophets will come and work miracles and signs . They will even try to fool God 's chosen ones .
CEV	Mark	13	23	But be on your guard ! That 's why I am telling you these things now . When the Son of Man Appears ( Matthew 24.29-31 ; Luke 21.25-28 )
CEV	Mark	13	24	( G ) In those days , right after this time of suffering , “ The sun will become dark , and the moon will no longer shine .
CEV	Mark	13	25	( H ) The stars will fall , and the powers in the sky [ d ] will be shaken. ”
CEV	Mark	13	26	( I ) Then the Son of Man will be seen coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
CEV	Mark	13	27	He will send his angels to gather his chosen ones from all over the earth . A Lesson from a Fig Tree ( Matthew 24.32-35 ; Luke 21.29-33 )
CEV	Mark	13	28	Learn a lesson from a fig tree . When its branches sprout and start putting out leaves , you know summer is near .
CEV	Mark	13	29	So when you see all these things happening , you will know that the time has almost come . [ e ]
CEV	Mark	13	30	You can be sure that some of the people of this generation will still be alive when all this happens .
CEV	Mark	13	31	The sky and the earth will not last forever , but my words will . No One Knows the Day or Time ( Matthew 24.36-44 )
CEV	Mark	13	32	( J ) No one knows the day or the time . The angels in heaven do n't know , and the Son himself does n't know . Only the Father knows .
CEV	Mark	13	33	So watch out and be ready ! You do n't know when the time will come .
CEV	Mark	13	34	( K ) It is like what happens when a man goes away for a while and places his servants in charge of everything . He tells each of them what to do , and he orders the guard to keep alert .
CEV	Mark	13	35	So be alert ! You do n't know when the master of the house will come back . It could be in the evening or at midnight or before dawn or in the morning .
CEV	Mark	13	36	But if he comes suddenly , do n't let him find you asleep .
CEV	Mark	13	37	I tell everyone just what I have told you . Be alert !

CEV	Mark	14	3	( B ) Jesus was eating in Bethany at the home of Simon , who once had leprosy , [ a ] when a woman came in with a very expensive bottle of sweet-smelling perfume . [ b ] After breaking it open , she poured the perfume on Jesus ' head .
CEV	Mark	14	4	This made some of the guests angry , and they complained , “ Why such a waste ?
CEV	Mark	14	5	We could have sold this perfume for more than
CEV	Mark	14	300	silver coins and given the money to the poor ! ” So they started saying cruel things to the woman .
CEV	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said : Leave her alone ! Why are you bothering her ? She has done a beautiful thing for me .
CEV	Mark	14	7	( C ) You will always have the poor with you . And whenever you want to , you can give to them . But you wo n't always have me here with you .
CEV	Mark	14	8	She has done all she could by pouring perfume on my body to prepare it for burial .
CEV	Mark	14	9	You may be sure that wherever the good news is told all over the world , people will remember what she has done . And they will tell others . Judas and the Chief Priests ( Matthew 26.14-16 ; Luke 22.3-6 )

CEV	Mark	14	13	Jesus said to two of the disciples , “ Go into the city , where you will meet a man carrying a jar of water . [ d ] Follow him ,
CEV	Mark	14	15	The owner will take you upstairs and show you a large room furnished and ready for you to use . Prepare the meal there. ”
CEV	Mark	14	16	The two disciples went into the city and found everything just as Jesus had told them . So they prepared the Passover meal . 17-18 ( D ) While Jesus and the twelve disciples were eating together that evening , he said , “ The one who will betray me is now eating with me. ”
CEV	Mark	14	19	This made the disciples sad , and one after another they said to Jesus , “ You surely do n't mean me ! ”
CEV	Mark	14	20	He answered , “ It is one of you twelve men who is eating from this dish with me .
CEV	Mark	14	21	The Son of Man will die , just as the Scriptures say . But it is going to be terrible for the one who betrays me . That man would be better off if he had never been born. ” The Lord 's Supper ( Matthew 26.26-30 ; Luke 22.14-23 ;

CEV	Mark	14	23	Jesus picked up a cup of wine and gave thanks to God . He gave it to his disciples , and they all drank some .
CEV	Mark	14	24	( E ) Then he said , “ This is my blood , which is poured out for many people , and with it God makes his agreement .
CEV	Mark	14	25	From now on I will not drink any wine , until I drink new wine in God 's kingdom. ”
CEV	Mark	14	26	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives . Peter 's Promise ( Matthew 26.31-35 ; Luke 22.31-34 ; John 13.36-38 )
CEV	Mark	14	27	( F ) Jesus said to his disciples , “ All of you will reject me , as the Scriptures say , ‘ I will strike down the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered. ’
CEV	Mark	14	28	( G ) But after I am raised to life , I will go ahead of you to Galilee. ”
CEV	Mark	14	29	Peter spoke up , “ Even if all the others reject you , I never will ! ”
CEV	Mark	14	30	Jesus replied , “ This very night before a rooster crows twice , you will say three times that you do n't know me. ”
CEV	Mark	14	31	But Peter was so sure of himself that he said , “ Even if I have to die with you , I will never say I do n't know you ! ” All the others said the same thing . Jesus Prays ( Matthew 26.36-46 ; Luke 22.39-46 )
CEV	Mark	14	32	Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane , and he told them , “ Sit here while I pray. ”
CEV	Mark	14	33	Jesus took along Peter , James , and John . He was sad and troubled and
CEV	Mark	14	34	told them , “ I am so sad that I feel as if I am dying . Stay here and keep awake with me. ” 35-36 Jesus walked on a little way . Then he knelt down on the ground and prayed , “ Father , [ e ] if it is possible , do n't let this happen to me ! Father , you can do anything . Do n't make me suffer by drinking from this cup . [ f ] But do what you want , and not what I want. ”
CEV	Mark	14	37	When Jesus came back and found the disciples sleeping , he said to Simon Peter , “ Are you asleep ? Ca n't you stay awake for just one hour ?
CEV	Mark	14	38	Stay awake and pray that you wo n't be tested . You want to do what is right , but you are weak. ”
CEV	Mark	14	39	Jesus went back and prayed the same prayer .
CEV	Mark	14	40	But when he returned to the disciples , he found them sleeping again . They simply could not keep their eyes open , and they did not know what to say .
CEV	Mark	14	41	When Jesus returned to the disciples the third time , he said , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? [ g ] Enough of this ! The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners .
CEV	Mark	14	42	Get up ! Let 's go . The one who will betray me is already here. ” Jesus Is Arrested ( Matthew 26.47-56 ; Luke 22.47-53 ; John 18.3-12 )
CEV	Mark	14	43	Jesus was still speaking , when Judas the betrayer came up . He was one of the twelve disciples , and a mob of men armed with swords and clubs were with him . They had been sent by the chief priests , the nation 's leaders , and the teachers of the Law of Moses .
CEV	Mark	14	44	Judas had told them ahead of time , “ Arrest the man I greet with a kiss . [ h ] Tie him up tight and lead him away. ”
CEV	Mark	14	45	Judas walked right up to Jesus and said , “ Teacher ! ” Then Judas kissed him ,
CEV	Mark	14	46	and the men grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
CEV	Mark	14	47	Someone standing there pulled out a sword . He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
CEV	Mark	14	48	Jesus said to the mob , “ Why do you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like a criminal ?
CEV	Mark	14	49	( H ) Day after day I was with you and taught in the temple , and you did n't arrest me . But what the Scriptures say must come true. ”
CEV	Mark	14	50	All of Jesus ' disciples ran off and left him .
CEV	Mark	14	51	One of them was a young man who was wearing only a linen cloth . And when the men grabbed him ,
CEV	Mark	14	52	he left the cloth behind and ran away naked . Jesus Is Questioned by the Council ( Matthew 26.57-68 ; Luke 22.54,55,63-71 ; John 18.13,14,19-24 )
CEV	Mark	14	53	Jesus was led off to the high priest . Then the chief priests , the nation 's leaders , and the teachers of the Law of Moses all met together .
CEV	Mark	14	54	Peter had followed at a distance , and when he reached the courtyard of the high priest 's house , he sat down with the guards to warm himself beside a fire .
CEV	Mark	14	55	The chief priests and the whole council tried to find someone to accuse Jesus of a crime , so they could put him to death . But they could not find anyone to accuse him .
CEV	Mark	14	56	Many people did tell lies against Jesus , but they did not agree on what they said .
CEV	Mark	14	57	Finally , some men stood up and lied about him . They said ,
CEV	Mark	14	58	( I ) “ We heard him say he would tear down this temple that we built . He also claimed that in three days he would build another one without any help. ”
CEV	Mark	14	59	But even then they did not agree on what they said .
CEV	Mark	14	60	The high priest stood up in the council and asked Jesus , “ Why do n't you say something in your own defense ? Do n't you hear the charges they are making against you ? ”
CEV	Mark	14	61	But Jesus kept quiet and did not say a word . The high priest asked him another question , “ Are you the Messiah , the Son of the glorious God ? ” [ i ]
CEV	Mark	14	62	( J ) “ Yes , I am ! ” Jesus answered . “ Soon you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side [ j ] of God All-Powerful , and coming with the clouds of heaven. ”
CEV	Mark	14	63	At once the high priest ripped his robe apart and shouted , “ Why do we need more witnesses ?
CEV	Mark	14	64	( K ) You heard him claim to be God ! What is your decision ? ” They all agreed he should be put to death .
CEV	Mark	14	65	Some of the people started spitting on Jesus . They blindfolded him , hit him with their fists , and said , “ Tell us who hit you ! ” Then the guards took charge of Jesus and beat him . Peter Says He Does n't Know Jesus ( Matthew 26.69-75 ; Luke 22.56-62 ; John 18.15-18,25-27 )
CEV	Mark	14	66	While Peter was still in the courtyard , a servant girl of the high priest came up
CEV	Mark	14	67	and saw Peter warming himself by the fire . She stared at him and said , “ You were with Jesus from Nazareth ! ”
CEV	Mark	14	68	Peter replied , “ That is n't true ! I do n't know what you 're talking about . I do n't have any idea what you mean. ” He went out to the gate , and a rooster crowed . [ k ]
CEV	Mark	14	69	The servant girl saw Peter again and said to the people standing there , “ This man is one of them ! ”
CEV	Mark	14	70	“ No , I 'm not ! ” Peter replied . A little while later some of the people said to Peter , “ You certainly are one of them . You 're a Galilean ! ”
CEV	Mark	14	71	This time Peter began to curse and swear , “ I do n't even know the man you 're talking about ! ”
CEV	Mark	14	72	At once the rooster crowed a second time . Then Peter remembered that Jesus had told him , “ Before a rooster crows twice , you will say three times that you do n't know me. ” So Peter started crying .

CEV	Luke	4	34	“ Hey , Jesus of Nazareth , what do you want with us ? Are you here to get rid of us ? I know who you are ! You are God 's Holy One. ”
CEV	Luke	4	35	Jesus ordered the evil spirit to be quiet and come out . The demon threw the man to the ground in front of everyone and left without harming him .

CEV	Luke	5	2	Near the shore he saw two boats left there by some fishermen who had gone to wash their nets .
CEV	Luke	5	3	Jesus got into the boat that belonged to Simon and asked him to row it out a little way from the shore . Then Jesus sat down [ b ] in the boat to teach the crowd .
CEV	Luke	5	4	When Jesus had finished speaking , he told Simon , “ Row the boat out into the deep water and let your nets down to catch some fish. ”
CEV	Luke	5	6	( C ) They did this and caught so many fish that their nets began ripping apart .
CEV	Luke	5	7	Then they signaled for their partners in the other boat to come and help them . The men came , and together they filled the two boats so full that they both began to sink .
CEV	Luke	5	8	When Simon Peter saw this happen , he knelt down in front of Jesus and said , “ Lord , do n't come near me ! I am a sinner. ”
CEV	Luke	5	9	Peter and everyone with him were completely surprised at all the fish they had caught .
CEV	Luke	5	10	His partners James and John , the sons of Zebedee , were surprised too . Jesus told Simon , “ Do n't be afraid ! From now on you will bring in people instead of fish. ”

CEV	Luke	5	14	( D ) Jesus told him , “ Do n't tell anyone about this , but go and show yourself to the priest . Offer a gift to the priest , just as Moses commanded , and everyone will know that you have been healed. ” [ d ]

CEV	Luke	5	19	But because of the crowd , they could not get him to Jesus . So they went up on the roof , [ e ] where they removed some tiles and let the mat down in the middle of the room .
CEV	Luke	5	20	When Jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the man , “ My friend , your sins are forgiven. ”
CEV	Luke	5	21	The Pharisees and the experts began arguing , “ Jesus must think he is God ! Only God can forgive sins. ”
CEV	Luke	5	22	Jesus knew what they were thinking , and he said , “ Why are you thinking this ?
CEV	Luke	5	23	Is it easier for me to tell this man that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and walk ?
CEV	Luke	5	24	But now you will see that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth. ” Jesus then said to the man , “ Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk home. ”
CEV	Luke	5	25	At once the man stood up in front of everyone . He picked up his mat and went home , giving thanks to God .
CEV	Luke	5	26	Everyone was amazed and praised God . What they saw surprised them , and they said , “ We have seen a great miracle today ! ” Jesus Chooses Levi ( Matthew 9.9-13 ; Mark 2.13-17 )
CEV	Luke	5	27	Later , Jesus went out and saw a tax collector [ f ] named Levi sitting at the place for paying taxes . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me. ”
CEV	Luke	5	28	Levi left everything and went with Jesus .
CEV	Luke	5	29	In his home Levi gave a big dinner for Jesus . Many tax collectors and other guests were also there .
CEV	Luke	5	30	( E ) The Pharisees and some of their teachers of the Law of Moses grumbled to Jesus ' disciples , “ Why do you eat and drink with these tax collectors and other sinners ? ”

CEV	Luke	5	32	I did n't come to invite good people to turn to God . I came to invite sinners. ” People Ask about Going without Eating ( Matthew 9.14-17 ; Mark 2.18-22 )
CEV	Luke	5	33	Some people said to Jesus , “ John 's followers often pray and go without eating , [ g ] and so do the followers of the Pharisees . But your disciples never go without eating or drinking. ”
CEV	Luke	5	34	Jesus told them , “ The friends of a bridegroom do n't go without eating while he is still with them .
CEV	Luke	5	35	But the time will come when he will be taken from them . Then they will go without eating. ”
CEV	Luke	5	36	Jesus then told them these sayings : No one uses a new piece of cloth to patch old clothes . The patch would shrink and make the hole even bigger .
CEV	Luke	5	37	No one pours new wine into old wineskins . The new wine would swell and burst the old skins . [ h ] Then the wine would be lost , and the skins would be ruined .

CEV	Luke	6	7	Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses kept watching Jesus to see if he would heal the man . They did this because they wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong .
CEV	Luke	6	8	Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he told the man to stand up where everyone could see him . And the man stood up .
CEV	Luke	6	9	Then Jesus asked , “ On the Sabbath should we do good deeds or evil deeds ? Should we save someone 's life or destroy it ? ”
CEV	Luke	6	10	After he had looked around at everyone , he told the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” He did , and his bad hand became completely well .

CEV	Luke	6	23	( E ) Long ago your own people did these same things to the prophets . So when this happens to you , be happy and jump for joy ! You will have a great reward in heaven .
CEV	Luke	6	24	But you rich people are in for trouble . You have already had an easy life !
CEV	Luke	6	25	You well-fed people are in for trouble . You will go hungry ! You people who are laughing now are in for trouble . You are going to cry and weep !

First , get the log out of your own eye ; then you can see how to take the speck out of your friend 's eye . A Tree and Its Fruit ( Matthew 7.17-20 ; 12.34b,35 )

CEV	Luke	7	7	And I am certainly not worthy to come to you . Just say the word , and my servant will get well .
CEV	Luke	7	2	In this town an army officer 's servant was sick and about to die . The officer liked his servant very much .
CEV	Luke	7	3	And when he heard about Jesus , he sent some Jewish leaders to ask him to come and heal the servant .
CEV	Luke	7	4	The leaders went to Jesus and begged him to do something . They said , “ This man deserves your help !
CEV	Luke	7	5	He loves our nation and even built us a synagogue. ”
CEV	Luke	7	6	So Jesus went with them . When Jesus was n't far from the house , the officer sent some friends to tell him , “ Lord , do n't go to any trouble for me ! I am not good enough for you to come into my house .
CEV	Luke	7	8	I have officers who give orders to me , and I have soldiers who take orders from me . I can say to one of them , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes . I can say to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes . I can say to my servant , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he will do it. ”
CEV	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard this , he was so surprised that he turned and said to the crowd following him , “ In all of Israel I 've never found anyone with this much faith ! ”
CEV	Luke	7	10	The officer 's friends returned and found the servant well . A Widow 's Son
CEV	Luke	7	11	Soon Jesus and his disciples were on their way to the town of Nain , and a big crowd was going along with them .
CEV	Luke	7	12	As they came near the gate of the town , they saw people carrying out the body of a widow 's only son . Many people from the town were walking along with her .
CEV	Luke	7	13	When the Lord saw the woman , he felt sorry for her and said , “ Do n't cry ! ”
CEV	Luke	7	14	Jesus went over and touched the stretcher on which the people were carrying the dead boy . They stopped , and Jesus said , “ Young man , get up ! ”
CEV	Luke	7	15	The boy sat up and began to speak . Jesus then gave him back to his mother .
CEV	Luke	7	16	Everyone was frightened and praised God . They said , “ A great prophet is here with us ! God has come to his people. ”
CEV	Luke	7	17	News about Jesus spread all over Judea and everywhere else in that part of the country . John the Baptist ( Matthew 11.1-19 ) 18-19 John 's followers told John everything that was being said about Jesus . So he sent two of them to ask the Lord , “ Are you the one we should be looking for ? Or must we wait for someone else ? ”
CEV	Luke	7	20	When these messengers came to Jesus , they said , “ John the Baptist sent us to ask , ‘ Are you the one we should be looking for ? Or are we supposed to wait for someone else ? ’ ”
CEV	Luke	7	21	At that time Jesus was healing many people who were sick or in pain or were troubled by evil spirits , and he was giving sight to a lot of blind people .
CEV	Luke	7	22	( A ) Jesus said to the messengers sent by John , “ Go and tell John what you have seen and heard . Blind people are now able to see , and the lame can walk . People who have leprosy [ a ] are being healed , and the deaf can now hear . The dead are raised to life , and the poor are hearing the good news .
CEV	Luke	7	23	God will bless everyone who does n't reject me because of what I do. ”
CEV	Luke	7	24	After John 's messengers had gone , Jesus began speaking to the crowds about John : What kind of person did you go out to the desert to see ? Was he like tall grass blown about by the wind ?
CEV	Luke	7	25	What kind of man did you really go out to see ? Was he someone dressed in fine clothes ? People who wear expensive clothes and live in luxury are in the king 's palace .
CEV	Luke	7	26	What then did you go out to see ? Was he a prophet ? He certainly was ! I tell you that he was more than a prophet .
CEV	Luke	7	27	( B ) In the Scriptures , God calls John his messenger and says , “ I am sending my messenger ahead of you to get things ready for you. ”
CEV	Luke	7	28	No one ever born on this earth is greater than John . But whoever is least important in God 's kingdom is greater than John .
CEV	Luke	7	29	( C ) Everyone had been listening to John . Even the tax collectors [ b ] had obeyed God and had done what was right by letting John baptize them .
CEV	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the experts in the Law of Moses refused to obey God and be baptized by John .
CEV	Luke	7	31	Jesus went on to say : What are you people like ? What kind of people are you ?
CEV	Luke	7	32	You are like children sitting in the market and shouting to each other , “ We played the flute , but you would not dance ! We sang a funeral song , but you would not cry ! ”
CEV	Luke	7	33	John the Baptist did not go around eating and drinking , and you said , “ John has a demon in him ! ”
CEV	Luke	7	34	But because the Son of Man goes around eating and drinking , you say , “ Jesus eats and drinks too much ! He is even a friend of tax collectors and sinners. ”
CEV	Luke	7	35	Yet Wisdom is shown to be right by what its followers do . Simon the Pharisee
CEV	Luke	7	36	A Pharisee invited Jesus to have dinner with him . So Jesus went to the Pharisee 's home and got ready to eat . [ c ]

Guests were also greeted with a kiss on the cheek , and special ones often had sweet-smelling olive oil poured on their head . - 7.50 saved : Or “ healed. ” The Greek word may have either meaning . Copyright ©
CEV	Luke	7	39	The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and said to himself , “ If this man really were a prophet , he would know what kind of woman is touching him ! He would know that she is a sinner. ”
CEV	Luke	7	40	Jesus said to the Pharisee , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” “ Teacher , what is it ? ” Simon replied .
CEV	Luke	7	41	Jesus told him , “ Two people were in debt to a moneylender . One of them owed him
CEV	Luke	7	500	silver coins , and the other owed him
CEV	Luke	7	50	But Jesus told the woman , “ Because of your faith , you are now saved . [ e ] May God give you peace ! ” Footnotes - 7.22 leprosy : See the note at 4.27 . - 7.29 tax collectors : See the note at 3.12 . - 7.36 got ready to eat : On special occasions the Jewish people often followed the Greek and Roman custom of lying down on their left side and leaning on their left elbow , while eating with their right hand . This is how the woman could come up behind Jesus and wash his feet ( see verse
CEV	Luke	7	42	Since neither of them could pay him back , the moneylender said that they did n't have to pay him anything . Which one of them will like him more ? ”
CEV	Luke	7	43	Simon answered , “ I suppose it would be the one who had owed more and did n't have to pay it back. ” “ You are right , ” Jesus said .
CEV	Luke	7	44	He turned toward the woman and said to Simon , “ Have you noticed this woman ? When I came into your home , you did n't give me any water so I could wash my feet . But she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair .
CEV	Luke	7	45	You did n't greet me with a kiss , but from the time I came in , she has not stopped kissing my feet .
CEV	Luke	7	46	You did n't even pour olive oil on my head , [ d ] but she has poured expensive perfume on my feet .
CEV	Luke	7	47	So I tell you that all her sins are forgiven , and that is why she has shown great love . But anyone who has been forgiven for only a little will show only a little love. ”
CEV	Luke	7	48	Then Jesus said to the woman , “ Your sins are forgiven. ”
CEV	Luke	7	49	Some other guests started saying to one another , “ Who is this who dares to forgive sins ? ”

CEV	Luke	8	8	The rest of the seeds fell on good ground where they grew and produced a hundred times as many seeds . When Jesus had finished speaking , he said , “ If you have ears , pay attention ! ” Why Jesus Used Stories ( Matthew 13.10-17 ; Mark 4.10-12 )
CEV	Luke	8	2	( A ) and so were some women who had been healed of evil spirits and all sorts of diseases . One of the women was Mary Magdalene , [ a ] who once had seven demons in her .
CEV	Luke	8	3	Joanna , Susanna , and many others had also used what they owned to help Jesus [ b ] and his disciples . Joanna 's husband Chuza was one of Herod 's officials . [ c ] A Story about a Farmer ( Matthew 13.1-9 ; Mark 4.1-9 )
CEV	Luke	8	4	When a large crowd from several towns had gathered around Jesus , he told them this story :
CEV	Luke	8	5	A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field . While the farmer was doing this , some of the seeds fell along the road and were stepped on or eaten by birds .
CEV	Luke	8	6	Other seeds fell on rocky ground and started growing . But the plants did not have enough water and soon dried up .
CEV	Luke	8	7	Some other seeds fell where thornbushes grew up and choked the plants .
CEV	Luke	8	9	Jesus ' disciples asked him what the story meant .
CEV	Luke	8	10	( B ) So he answered : I have explained the secrets about God 's kingdom to you . But for others I use stories , so they will look , but not see , and they will hear , but not understand . Jesus Explains the Story about a Farmer ( Matthew 13.18-23 ; Mark 4.13-20 )
CEV	Luke	8	11	This is what the story means : The seed is God 's message ,
CEV	Luke	8	12	and the seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message . But the devil comes and snatches the message out of their hearts , so they will not believe and be saved .
CEV	Luke	8	13	The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it . But they do n't have deep roots , and they believe only for a little while . As soon as life gets hard , they give up .
CEV	Luke	8	14	The seeds that fell among the thornbushes are also people who hear the message . But they are so eager for riches and pleasures that they never produce anything .
CEV	Luke	8	15	Those seeds that fell on good ground are the people who listen to the message and keep it in good and honest hearts . They last and produce a harvest . Light ( Mark 4.21-25 )
CEV	Luke	8	16	( C ) No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl or under a bed . A lamp is always put on a lampstand , so people who come into a house will see the light .

CEV	Luke	8	50	When Jesus heard this , he told Jairus , “ Do n't worry ! Have faith , and your daughter will get well. ”
CEV	Luke	8	51	Jesus went into the house , but he did not let anyone else go with him , except Peter , John , James , and the girl 's father and mother .
CEV	Luke	8	52	Everyone was crying and weeping for the girl . But Jesus said , “ The child is n't dead . She is just asleep. ”

CEV	Luke	11	25	When it gets there and finds the place clean and fixed up ,
CEV	Luke	11	26	it goes off and finds seven other evil spirits even worse than itself . They all come and make their home there , and that person ends up in worse shape than before . Being Really Blessed
CEV	Luke	11	27	While Jesus was still talking , a woman in the crowd spoke up , “ The woman who gave birth to you and nursed you is blessed ! ”
CEV	Luke	11	28	Jesus replied , “ That 's true , but the people who are really blessed are the ones who hear and obey God 's message ! ” [ b ] A Sign from God ( Matthew 12.38-42 ; Mark 8.12 )
CEV	Luke	11	29	( D ) As crowds were gathering around Jesus , he said : You people of today are evil ! You keep looking for a sign from God . But what happened to Jonah [ c ] is the only sign you will be given .
CEV	Luke	11	30	( E ) Just as Jonah was a sign to the people of Nineveh , the Son of Man will be a sign to the people of today .
CEV	Luke	11	31	( F ) When the judgment comes , the Queen of the South [ d ] will stand there with you and condemn you . She traveled a long way to hear Solomon 's wisdom , and yet here is something far greater than Solomon .
CEV	Luke	11	32	( G ) The people of Nineveh will also stand there with you and condemn you . They turned to God when Jonah preached , and yet here is something far greater than Jonah . Light ( Matthew 5.15 ; 6.22,23 )
CEV	Luke	11	33	( H ) No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a clay pot . A lamp is put on a lampstand , so everyone who comes into the house can see the light .
CEV	Luke	11	34	Your eyes are the lamp for your body . When your eyes are good , you have all the light you need . But when your eyes are bad , everything is dark .
CEV	Luke	11	35	So be sure your light is n't darkness .
CEV	Luke	11	36	If you have light , and nothing is dark , then light will be everywhere , as when a lamp shines brightly on you . Jesus Condemns the Pharisees and Teachers of the Law of Moses ( Matthew 23.1-36 ; Mark 12.38-40 ; Luke 20.45-47 )
CEV	Luke	11	37	When Jesus finished speaking , a Pharisee invited him home for a meal . Jesus went and sat down to eat . [ e ]
CEV	Luke	11	38	The Pharisee was surprised that he did not wash his hands [ f ] before eating .
CEV	Luke	11	39	So the Lord said to him : You Pharisees clean the outside of cups and dishes , but on the inside you are greedy and evil .
CEV	Luke	11	40	You fools ! Did n't God make both the outside and the inside ? [ g ]
CEV	Luke	11	41	If you would only give what you have to the poor , everything you do would please God .
CEV	Luke	11	42	( I ) You Pharisees are in for trouble ! You give God a tenth of the spices from your gardens , such as mint and rue . But you cheat people , and you do n't love God . You should be fair and kind to others and still give a tenth to God .
CEV	Luke	11	43	You Pharisees are in for trouble ! You love the front seats in the synagogues , and you like to be greeted with honor in the market .
CEV	Luke	11	44	But you are in for trouble ! You are like unmarked graves [ h ] that people walk on without even knowing it .
CEV	Luke	11	45	A teacher of the Law of Moses spoke up , “ Teacher , you said cruel things about us. ”
CEV	Luke	11	46	Jesus replied : You teachers are also in for trouble ! You load people down with heavy burdens , but you wo n't lift a finger to help them carry the loads .
CEV	Luke	11	47	Yes , you are really in for trouble . You build monuments to honor the prophets your own people murdered long ago .
CEV	Luke	11	48	You must think that was the right thing for your people to do , or else you would not have built monuments for the prophets they murdered .
CEV	Luke	11	49	Because of your evil deeds , the Wisdom of God said , “ I will send prophets and apostles to you . But you will murder some and mistreat others. ”
CEV	Luke	11	50	You people living today will be punished for all the prophets who have been murdered since the beginning of the world .
CEV	Luke	11	51	( J ) This includes every prophet from the time of Abel to the time of Zechariah , [ i ] who was murdered between the altar and the temple . You people will certainly be punished for all of this .
CEV	Luke	11	52	You teachers of the Law of Moses are really in for trouble ! You carry the keys to the door of knowledge about God . But you never go in , and you keep others from going in .
CEV	Luke	11	53	Jesus was about to leave , but the teachers and the Pharisees wanted to get even with him . They tried to make him say what he thought about other things ,
CEV	Luke	11	54	so they could catch him saying something wrong . Footnotes - 11.3 the food we need : Or “ food for today ” or “ food for the coming day. ” - 11.28 That 's true , but the people who are really blessed … message : Or “ That 's not true , the people who are blessed … message. ” - 11.29 what happened to Jonah : Jonah was in the stomach of a big fish for three days and nights ( see Matthew 12.40 ) . - 11.31 South : Sheba , probably a country in southern Arabia . - 11.37 sat down to eat : See the note at 7.36 . - 11.38 did not wash his hands : The Jewish people had strict laws about washing their hands before eating , especially if they had been out in public . - 11.40 Did n't God make both the outside and the inside : Or “ Does n't the person who washes the outside always wash the inside too ? ” - 11.44 unmarked graves : Tombs were whitewashed to keep anyone from accidentally touching them . A person who touched a dead body or a tomb was considered unclean and could not worship with other Jewish people . - 11.51 from the time of Abel … Zechariah : Genesis is the first book in the Jewish Scriptures , and it tells that Abel was the first person to be murdered . Second Chronicles is the last book in the Jewish Scriptures , and the last murder that it tells about is that of Zechariah . Copyright ©

CEV	Luke	12	12	At that time the Holy Spirit will tell you what to say . A Rich Fool
CEV	Luke	12	2	( B ) Everything that is hidden will be found out , and every secret will be known .
CEV	Luke	12	3	Whatever you say in the dark will be heard when it is day . Whatever you whisper in a closed room will be shouted from the housetops . The One To Fear ( Matthew 10.28-31 )
CEV	Luke	12	4	( C ) My friends , do n't be afraid of people . They can kill you , but after that , there is nothing else they can do .
CEV	Luke	12	5	God is the one you must fear . Not only can he take your life , but he can throw you into hell . God is certainly the one you should fear !
CEV	Luke	12	6	Five sparrows are sold for only a few cents , but God does n't forget a single one of them .
CEV	Luke	12	7	Even the hairs on your head are counted . So do n't be afraid ! You are worth much more than many sparrows . Telling Others about Christ ( Matthew 10.32,33 ; 12.32 ; 10.19,20 )
CEV	Luke	12	8	If you tell others that you belong to me , the Son of Man will tell God 's angels that you are my followers .
CEV	Luke	12	9	But if you reject me , you will be rejected in front of them .
CEV	Luke	12	10	( D ) If you speak against the Son of Man , you can be forgiven , but if you speak against the Holy Spirit , you can not be forgiven .
CEV	Luke	12	11	( E ) When you are brought to trial in the synagogues or before rulers or officials , do n't worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say .
CEV	Luke	12	13	A man in a crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , tell my brother to give me my share of what our father left us when he died. ”
CEV	Luke	12	14	Jesus answered , “ Who gave me the right to settle arguments between you and your brother ? ”
CEV	Luke	12	15	Then he said to the crowd , “ Do n't be greedy ! Owning a lot of things wo n't make your life safe. ”
CEV	Luke	12	16	So Jesus told them this story : A rich man 's farm produced a big crop ,
CEV	Luke	12	17	and he said to himself , “ What can I do ? I do n't have a place large enough to store everything. ”
CEV	Luke	12	18	Later , he said , “ Now I know what I 'll do . I 'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones , where I can store all my grain and other goods .
CEV	Luke	12	19	( F ) Then I 'll say to myself , ‘ You have stored up enough good things to last for years to come . Live it up ! Eat , drink , and enjoy yourself. ’ ”
CEV	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , “ You fool ! Tonight you will die . Then who will get what you have stored up ? ”
CEV	Luke	12	21	“ This is what happens to people who store up everything for themselves , but are poor in the sight of God. ” Worry ( Matthew 6.25-34 )
CEV	Luke	12	22	Jesus said to his disciples : I tell you not to worry about your life ! Do n't worry about having something to eat or wear .
CEV	Luke	12	23	Life is more than food or clothing .
CEV	Luke	12	24	Look at the crows ! They do n't plant or harvest , and they do n't have storehouses or barns . But God takes care of them . You are much more important than any birds .
CEV	Luke	12	25	Can worry make you live longer ? [ b ]
CEV	Luke	12	26	If you do n't have power over small things , why worry about everything else ?
CEV	Luke	12	27	( G ) Look how the wild flowers grow ! They do n't work hard to make their clothes . But I tell you Solomon with all his wealth [ c ] was n't as well clothed as one of these flowers .
CEV	Luke	12	28	God gives such beauty to everything that grows in the fields , even though it is here today and thrown into a fire tomorrow . Wo n't he do even more for you ? You have such little faith !
CEV	Luke	12	29	Do n't keep worrying about having something to eat or drink .
CEV	Luke	12	30	Only people who do n't know God are always worrying about such things . Your Father knows what you need .
CEV	Luke	12	31	But put God 's work first , and these things will be yours as well . Treasures in Heaven ( Matthew 6.19-21 )
CEV	Luke	12	32	My little group of disciples , do n't be afraid ! Your Father wants to give you the kingdom .
CEV	Luke	12	33	Sell what you have and give the money to the poor . Make yourselves moneybags that never wear out . Make sure your treasure is safe in heaven , where thieves can not steal it and moths can not destroy it .
CEV	Luke	12	34	Your heart will always be where your treasure is . Faithful and Unfaithful Servants ( Matthew 24.45-51 )
CEV	Luke	12	35	( H ) Be ready and keep your lamps burning
CEV	Luke	12	36	( I ) just like those servants who wait up for their master to return from a wedding feast . As soon as he comes and knocks , they open the door for him .
CEV	Luke	12	37	Servants are fortunate if their master finds them awake and ready when he comes ! I promise you he will get ready and let his servants sit down so he can serve them .
CEV	Luke	12	38	Those servants are really fortunate if their master finds them ready , even though he comes late at night or early in the morning .
CEV	Luke	12	39	( J ) You would surely not let a thief break into your home , if you knew when the thief was coming .
CEV	Luke	12	40	So always be ready ! You do n't know when the Son of Man will come .
CEV	Luke	12	41	Peter asked Jesus , “ Did you say this just for us or for everyone ? ”
CEV	Luke	12	42	The Lord answered : Who are faithful and wise servants ? Who are the ones the master will put in charge of giving the other servants their food supplies at the proper time ?
CEV	Luke	12	43	Servants are fortunate if their master comes and finds them doing their job .
CEV	Luke	12	44	A servant who is always faithful will surely be put in charge of everything the master owns .
CEV	Luke	12	45	But suppose one of the servants thinks that the master wo n't return until late . Suppose that servant starts beating all the other servants and eats and drinks and gets drunk .
CEV	Luke	12	46	If that happens , the master will come on a day and at a time when the servant least expects him . That servant will then be punished and thrown out with the servants who can not be trusted .
CEV	Luke	12	47	If servants are not ready or willing to do what their master wants them to do , they will be beaten hard .
CEV	Luke	12	48	But servants who do n't know what their master wants them to do will not be beaten so hard for doing wrong . If God has been generous with you , he will expect you to serve him well . But if he has been more than generous , he will expect you to serve him even better . Not Peace , but Trouble ( Matthew 10.34-36 )
CEV	Luke	12	49	I came to set fire to the earth , and I wish it were already on fire !
CEV	Luke	12	50	( K ) I am going to be put to a hard test . And I will have to suffer a lot of pain until it is over .
CEV	Luke	12	51	Do you think that I came to bring peace to earth ? No indeed ! I came to make people choose sides .
CEV	Luke	12	52	A family of five will be divided , with two of them against the other three .
CEV	Luke	12	53	( L ) Fathers and sons will turn against one another , and mothers and daughters will do the same . Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law will also turn against each other . Knowing What To Do ( Matthew 16.2,3 ; 5.25,26 )
CEV	Luke	12	54	Jesus said to all the people : As soon as you see a cloud coming up in the west , you say , “ It 's going to rain , ” and it does .
CEV	Luke	12	55	When the south wind blows , you say , “ It 's going to get hot , ” and it does .
CEV	Luke	12	56	Are you trying to fool someone ? You can predict the weather by looking at the earth and sky , but you do n't really know what 's going on right now .
CEV	Luke	12	57	Why do n't you understand the right thing to do ?
CEV	Luke	12	58	When someone accuses you of something , try to settle things before you are taken to court . If you do n't , you will be dragged before the judge . Then the judge will hand you over to the jailer , and you will be locked up .

CEV	Luke	13	13	He placed his hands on her , and at once she stood up straight and praised God .
CEV	Luke	13	2	Jesus replied : Do you think that these people were worse sinners than everyone else in Galilee just because of what happened to them ?
CEV	Luke	13	3	Not at all ! But you can be sure that if you do n't turn back to God , every one of you will also be killed .
CEV	Luke	13	4	What about those
CEV	Luke	13	18	Jesus said , “ What is God 's kingdom like ? What can I compare it with ?
CEV	Luke	13	5	Not at all ! But you can be sure that if you do n't turn back to God , every one of you will also die . A Story about a Fig Tree
CEV	Luke	13	6	Jesus then told them this story : A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard . One day he went out to pick some figs , but he did n't find any .
CEV	Luke	13	7	So he said to the gardener , “ For three years I have come looking for figs on this tree , and I have n't found any yet . Chop it down ! Why should it take up space ? ”
CEV	Luke	13	8	The gardener answered , “ Master , leave it for another year . I 'll dig around it and put some manure on it to make it grow .
CEV	Luke	13	9	Maybe it will have figs on it next year . If it does n't , you can have it cut down. ” Healing a Woman on the Sabbath
CEV	Luke	13	10	One Sabbath , Jesus was teaching in a synagogue ,
CEV	Luke	13	11	and a woman was there who had been crippled by an evil spirit for
CEV	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw the woman , he called her over and said , “ You are now well. ”
CEV	Luke	13	14	( A ) The man in charge of the synagogue was angry because Jesus had healed someone on the Sabbath . So he said to the people , “ Each week has six days when we can work . Come and be healed on one of those days , but not on the Sabbath. ”
CEV	Luke	13	15	The Lord replied , “ Are you trying to fool someone ? Wo n't any one of you untie your ox or donkey and lead it out to drink on a Sabbath ?
CEV	Luke	13	16	This woman belongs to the family of Abraham , but Satan has kept her bound for
CEV	Luke	13	17	Jesus ' words made his enemies ashamed . But everyone else in the crowd was happy about the wonderful things he was doing . A Mustard Seed and Yeast ( Matthew 13.31-33 ; Mark 4.30-32 )
CEV	Luke	13	19	It is like what happens when someone plants a mustard seed in a garden . The seed grows as big as a tree , and birds nest in its branches. ”
CEV	Luke	13	20	Then Jesus said , “ What can I compare God 's kingdom with ?
CEV	Luke	13	21	It is like what happens when a woman mixes yeast into three batches of flour . Finally , all the dough rises. ” The Narrow Door ( Matthew 7.13,14,21-23 )
CEV	Luke	13	22	As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem , he taught the people in the towns and villages .
CEV	Luke	13	23	Someone asked him , “ Lord , are only a few people going to be saved ? ” Jesus answered :
CEV	Luke	13	24	Do all you can to go in by the narrow door ! A lot of people will try to get in , but will not be able to .
CEV	Luke	13	25	Once the owner of the house gets up and locks the door , you will be left standing outside . You will knock on the door and say , “ Sir , open the door for us ! ” But the owner will answer , “ I do n't know a thing about you ! ”
CEV	Luke	13	26	Then you will start saying , “ We dined with you , and you taught in our streets. ”
CEV	Luke	13	27	( B ) But he will say , “ I really do n't know who you are ! Get away from me , you evil people ! ”
CEV	Luke	13	28	( C ) ( D ) Then when you have been thrown outside , you will weep and grit your teeth because you will see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in God 's kingdom .
CEV	Luke	13	29	People will come from all directions and sit down to feast in God 's kingdom .
CEV	Luke	13	30	( E ) There the ones who are now least important will be the most important , and those who are now most important will be least important . Jesus and Herod
CEV	Luke	13	31	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said , “ You had better get away from here , because Herod [ a ] wants to kill you ! ”
CEV	Luke	13	32	Jesus said to them : Go tell that fox , “ I am going to force out demons and heal people today and tomorrow , and three days later I 'll be through. ”
CEV	Luke	13	33	But I am going on my way today and tomorrow and the next day . After all , Jerusalem is the place where prophets are killed . Jesus Loves Jerusalem ( Matthew 23.37-39 )
CEV	Luke	13	34	( F ) Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! Your people have killed the prophets and have stoned the messengers who were sent to you . I have often wanted to gather your people , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings . But you would n't let me .

CEV	Luke	14	14	They can not pay you back . But God will bless you and reward you when his people rise from death . The Great Banquet ( Matthew 22.1-10 )
CEV	Luke	14	2	All of a sudden a man with swollen legs stood up in front of him .
CEV	Luke	14	3	Jesus turned and asked the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses , “ Is it right to heal on the Sabbath ? ”
CEV	Luke	14	4	But they did not say a word . Jesus took hold of the man . Then he healed him and sent him away .
CEV	Luke	14	5	( A ) Afterwards , Jesus asked the people , “ If your son or ox falls into a well , would n't you pull him out at once , even on the Sabbath ? ”
CEV	Luke	14	6	There was nothing they could say . How To Be a Guest
CEV	Luke	14	7	Jesus saw how the guests had tried to take the best seats . So he told them :
CEV	Luke	14	8	( B ) When you are invited to a wedding feast , do n't sit in the best place . Someone more important may have been invited .
CEV	Luke	14	9	Then the one who invited you will come and say , “ Give your place to this other guest ! ” You will be embarrassed and will have to sit in the worst place .
CEV	Luke	14	10	When you are invited to be a guest , go and sit in the worst place . Then the one who invited you may come and say , “ My friend , take a better seat ! ” You will then be honored in front of all the other guests .
CEV	Luke	14	11	( C ) If you put yourself above others , you will be put down . But if you humble yourself , you will be honored .
CEV	Luke	14	12	Then Jesus said to the man who had invited him : When you give a dinner or a banquet , do n't invite your friends and family and relatives and rich neighbors . If you do , they will invite you in return , and you will be paid back .
CEV	Luke	14	13	When you give a feast , invite the poor , the paralyzed , the lame , and the blind .
CEV	Luke	14	15	After Jesus had finished speaking , one of the guests said , “ The greatest blessing of all is to be at the banquet in God 's kingdom ! ”
CEV	Luke	14	16	Jesus told him : A man once gave a great banquet and invited a lot of guests .
CEV	Luke	14	17	When the banquet was ready , he sent a servant to tell the guests , “ Everything is ready ! Please come. ”
CEV	Luke	14	18	One guest after another started making excuses . The first one said , “ I bought some land , and I 've got to look it over . Please excuse me. ”
CEV	Luke	14	19	Another guest said , “ I bought five teams of oxen , and I need to try them out . Please excuse me. ”
CEV	Luke	14	20	Still another guest said , “ I 've just now married , and I ca n't be there. ”
CEV	Luke	14	21	The servant told his master what happened , and the master became so angry he said , “ Go as fast as you can to every street and alley in town ! Bring in everyone who is poor or paralyzed or blind or lame. ”
CEV	Luke	14	22	When the servant returned , he said , “ Master , I 've done what you told me , and there is still plenty of room for more people. ”
CEV	Luke	14	23	His master then told him , “ Go out along the back roads and make people come in , so my house will be full .
CEV	Luke	14	24	Not one of the guests I first invited will get even a bite of my food ! ” Being a Disciple ( Matthew 10.37,38 )
CEV	Luke	14	25	Large crowds were walking along with Jesus , when he turned and said :
CEV	Luke	14	26	( D ) You can not be my disciple , unless you love me more than you love your father and mother , your wife and children , and your brothers and sisters . You can not follow me unless you love me more than you love your own life .
CEV	Luke	14	27	( E ) You can not be my disciple unless you carry your own cross and follow me .
CEV	Luke	14	28	Suppose one of you wants to build a tower . What is the first thing you will do ? Wo n't you sit down and figure out how much it will cost and if you have enough money to pay for it ?
CEV	Luke	14	29	Otherwise , you will start building the tower , but not be able to finish . Then everyone who sees what is happening will laugh at you .
CEV	Luke	14	30	They will say , “ You started building , but could not finish the job. ”
CEV	Luke	14	31	What will a king do if he has only 10,000 soldiers to defend himself against a king who is about to attack him with 20,000 soldiers ? Before he goes out to battle , wo n't he first sit down and decide if he can win ?
CEV	Luke	14	32	If he thinks he wo n't be able to defend himself , he will send messengers and ask for peace while the other king is still a long way off .
CEV	Luke	14	33	So then , you can not be my disciple unless you give away everything you own . Salt and Light ( Matthew 5.13 ; Mark 9.50 )
CEV	Luke	14	34	Salt is good , but if it no longer tastes like salt , how can it be made to taste salty again ?
CEV	Luke	14	35	It is no longer good for the soil or even for the manure pile . People simply throw it out . If you have ears , pay attention ! Copyright ©

CEV	Luke	15	15	He went to work for a man in that country , and the man sent him out to take care of his pigs . [ b ]
CEV	Luke	15	2	So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses started grumbling , “ This man is friendly with sinners . He even eats with them. ”
CEV	Luke	15	3	Then Jesus told them this story :
CEV	Luke	15	4	If any of you has
CEV	Luke	15	100	sheep , and one of them gets lost , what will you do ? Wo n't you leave the
CEV	Luke	15	99	good people who do n't need to. ” One Coin
CEV	Luke	15	5	And when you find it , you will be so glad that you will put it on your shoulder
CEV	Luke	15	6	and carry it home . Then you will call in your friends and neighbors and say , “ Let 's celebrate ! I 've found my lost sheep. ”
CEV	Luke	15	7	Jesus said , “ In the same way there is more happiness in heaven because of one sinner who turns to God than over
CEV	Luke	15	8	Jesus told the people another story : What will a woman do if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them ? Wo n't she light a lamp , sweep the floor , and look carefully until she finds it ?
CEV	Luke	15	9	Then she will call in her friends and neighbors and say , “ Let 's celebrate ! I 've found the coin I lost. ”
CEV	Luke	15	10	Jesus said , “ In the same way God 's angels are happy when even one person turns to him. ” Two Sons
CEV	Luke	15	11	Jesus told them yet another story : Once a man had two sons .
CEV	Luke	15	12	The younger son said to his father , “ Give me my share of the property. ” So the father divided his property between his two sons .
CEV	Luke	15	13	Not long after that , the younger son packed up everything he owned and left for a foreign country , where he wasted all his money in wild living .
CEV	Luke	15	14	He had spent everything , when a bad famine spread through that whole land . Soon he had nothing to eat .
CEV	Luke	15	16	He would have been glad to eat what the pigs were eating , [ c ] but no one gave him a thing .
CEV	Luke	15	17	Finally , he came to his senses and said , “ My father 's workers have plenty to eat , and here I am , starving to death !
CEV	Luke	15	18	I will go to my father and say to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against God in heaven and against you .
CEV	Luke	15	19	I am no longer good enough to be called your son . Treat me like one of your workers. ’ ”
CEV	Luke	15	20	The younger son got up and started back to his father . But when he was still a long way off , his father saw him and felt sorry for him . He ran to his son and hugged and kissed him .
CEV	Luke	15	21	The son said , “ Father , I have sinned against God in heaven and against you . I am no longer good enough to be called your son. ”
CEV	Luke	15	22	But his father said to the servants , “ Hurry and bring the best clothes and put them on him . Give him a ring for his finger and sandals [ d ] for his feet .
CEV	Luke	15	23	Get the best calf and prepare it , so we can eat and celebrate .
CEV	Luke	15	24	This son of mine was dead , but has now come back to life . He was lost and has now been found. ” And they began to celebrate .
CEV	Luke	15	25	The older son had been out in the field . But when he came near the house , he heard the music and dancing .
CEV	Luke	15	26	So he called one of the servants over and asked , “ What 's going on here ? ”
CEV	Luke	15	27	The servant answered , “ Your brother has come home safe and sound , and your father ordered us to kill the best calf. ”
CEV	Luke	15	28	The older brother got so angry that he would not even go into the house . His father came out and begged him to go in .
CEV	Luke	15	29	But he said to his father , “ For years I have worked for you like a slave and have always obeyed you . But you have never even given me a little goat , so that I could give a dinner for my friends .
CEV	Luke	15	30	This other son of yours wasted your money on prostitutes . And now that he has come home , you ordered the best calf to be killed for a feast. ”
CEV	Luke	15	31	His father replied , “ My son , you are always with me , and everything I have is yours .
CEV	Luke	15	32	But we should be glad and celebrate ! Your brother was dead , but he is now alive . He was lost and has now been found. ” Footnotes - 15.1 Tax collectors : See the note at 3.12 . - 15.15 pigs : The Jewish religion taught that pigs were not fit to eat or even to touch . A Jewish man would have felt terribly insulted if he had to feed pigs , much less eat with them . - 15.16 what the pigs were eating : The Greek text has “ ( bean ) pods , ” which came from a tree in Palestine . These were used to feed animals . Poor people sometimes ate them too . - 15.22 ring … sandals : These show that the young man 's father fully accepted him as his son . A ring was a sign of high position in the family . Sandals showed that he was a son instead of a slave , since slaves did not usually wear sandals . Copyright ©

CEV	Luke	16	16	( C ) Until the time of John the Baptist , people had to obey the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets . [ b ] But since God 's kingdom has been preached , everyone is trying hard to get in .
CEV	Luke	16	2	So the rich man called him in and said , “ What is this I hear about you ? Tell me what you have done ! You are no longer going to work for me. ”
CEV	Luke	16	3	The manager said to himself , “ What shall I do now that my master is going to fire me ? I ca n't dig ditches , and I 'm ashamed to beg .
CEV	Luke	16	4	I know what I 'll do , so that people will welcome me into their homes after I 've lost my job. ”
CEV	Luke	16	5	Then one by one he called in the people who were in debt to his master . He asked the first one , “ How much do you owe my master ? ”
CEV	Luke	16	6	“ A hundred barrels of olive oil , ” the man answered . So the manager said , “ Take your bill and sit down and quickly write ‘ 50. ’ ”
CEV	Luke	16	7	The manager asked someone else who was in debt to his master , “ How much do you owe ? ” “ A thousand sacks [ a ] of wheat , ” the man replied . The manager said , “ Take your bill and write ‘ 800. ’ ”
CEV	Luke	16	8	The master praised his dishonest manager for looking out for himself so well . That 's how it is ! The people of this world look out for themselves better than the people who belong to the light .
CEV	Luke	16	9	( A ) My disciples , I tell you to use wicked wealth to make friends for yourselves . Then when it is gone , you will be welcomed into an eternal home .

CEV	Luke	16	13	( B ) You can not be the slave of two masters . You will like one more than the other or be more loyal to one than to the other . You can not serve God and money . Some Sayings of Jesus ( Matthew 11.12,13 ; 5.31,32 ; Mark 10.11,12 )
CEV	Luke	16	14	The Pharisees really loved money . So when they heard what Jesus said , they made fun of him .
CEV	Luke	16	15	But Jesus told them : You are always making yourselves look good , but God sees what is in your heart . The things that most people think are important are worthless as far as God is concerned .
CEV	Luke	16	17	( D ) Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the Law does .
CEV	Luke	16	18	( E ) It is a terrible sin [ c ] for a man to divorce his wife and marry another woman . It is also a terrible sin for a man to marry a divorced woman . Lazarus and the Rich Man
CEV	Luke	16	19	There was once a rich man who wore expensive clothes and every day ate the best food .
CEV	Luke	16	20	But a poor beggar named Lazarus was brought to the gate of the rich man 's house .
CEV	Luke	16	21	He was happy just to eat the scraps that fell from the rich man 's table . His body was covered with sores , and dogs kept coming up to lick them .
CEV	Luke	16	22	( F ) The poor man died , and angels took him to the place of honor next to Abraham . [ d ] The rich man also died and was buried .
CEV	Luke	16	23	( G ) He went to hell [ e ] and was suffering terribly . When he looked up and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side ,
CEV	Luke	16	24	he said to Abraham , “ Have pity on me ! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and touch my tongue . I 'm suffering terribly in this fire. ”
CEV	Luke	16	25	Abraham answered , “ My friend , remember that while you lived , you had everything good , and Lazarus had everything bad . Now he is happy , and you are in pain .
CEV	Luke	16	26	And besides , there is a deep ditch between us , and no one from either side can cross over. ”
CEV	Luke	16	27	But the rich man said , “ Abraham , then please send Lazarus to my father 's home .
CEV	Luke	16	28	Let him warn my five brothers , so they wo n't come to this horrible place. ”
CEV	Luke	16	29	Abraham answered , “ Your brothers can read what Moses and the prophets [ f ] wrote . They should pay attention to that. ”
CEV	Luke	16	30	Then the rich man said , “ No , that 's not enough ! If only someone from the dead would go to them , they would listen and turn to God. ”
CEV	Luke	16	31	So Abraham said , “ If they wo n't pay attention to Moses and the prophets , they wo n't listen even to someone who comes back from the dead. ” Footnotes - 16.7 A thousand sacks : The Greek text has “

CEV	Luke	17	17	Jesus asked , “ Were n't ten men healed ? Where are the other nine ?
CEV	Luke	17	2	would be better off thrown into the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their neck .
CEV	Luke	17	3	( A ) So be careful what you do . Correct any followers [ a ] of mine who sin , and forgive the ones who say they are sorry .
CEV	Luke	17	4	Even if one of them mistreats you seven times in one day and says , “ I am sorry , ” you should still forgive that person .
CEV	Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Make our faith stronger ! ”
CEV	Luke	17	6	Jesus replied : If you had faith no bigger than a tiny mustard seed , you could tell this mulberry tree to pull itself up , roots and all , and to plant itself in the ocean . And it would !
CEV	Luke	17	7	If your servant comes in from plowing or from taking care of the sheep , would you say , “ Welcome ! Come on in and have something to eat ” ?
CEV	Luke	17	8	No , you would n't say that . You would say , “ Prepare me something to eat . Get ready to serve me , so I can have my meal . Then later on you can eat and drink. ”
CEV	Luke	17	9	Servants do n't deserve special thanks for doing what they are supposed to do .
CEV	Luke	17	10	And that 's how it should be with you . When you 've done all you should , then say , “ We are merely servants , and we have simply done our duty. ” Ten Men with Leprosy
CEV	Luke	17	11	On his way to Jerusalem , Jesus went along the border between Samaria and Galilee .
CEV	Luke	17	12	As he was going into a village , ten men with leprosy [ b ] came toward him . They stood at a distance
CEV	Luke	17	13	and shouted , “ Jesus , Master , have pity on us ! ”
CEV	Luke	17	14	( B ) Jesus looked at them and said , “ Go show yourselves to the priests. ” [ c ] On their way they were healed .
CEV	Luke	17	15	When one of them discovered that he was healed , he came back , shouting praises to God .
CEV	Luke	17	16	He bowed down at the feet of Jesus and thanked him . The man was from the country of Samaria .
CEV	Luke	17	18	Why was this foreigner the only one who came back to thank God ? ”
CEV	Luke	17	19	Then Jesus told the man , “ You may get up and go . Your faith has made you well. ” God 's Kingdom ( Matthew 24.23-28,37-41 )
CEV	Luke	17	20	Some Pharisees asked Jesus when God 's kingdom would come . He answered , “ God 's kingdom is n't something you can see .
CEV	Luke	17	21	There is no use saying , ‘ Look ! Here it is ’ or ‘ Look ! There it is. ’ God 's kingdom is here with you. ” [ d ]
CEV	Luke	17	22	Jesus said to his disciples : The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man , but you will not .
CEV	Luke	17	23	When people say to you , “ Look there , ” or “ Look here , ” do n't go looking for him .
CEV	Luke	17	24	The day of the Son of Man will be like lightning flashing across the sky .
CEV	Luke	17	25	But first he must suffer terribly and be rejected by the people of today .
CEV	Luke	17	26	( C ) When the Son of Man comes , things will be just as they were when Noah lived .
CEV	Luke	17	27	( D ) People were eating , drinking , and getting married right up to the day when Noah went into the big boat . Then the flood came and drowned everyone on earth .
CEV	Luke	17	28	( E ) When Lot [ e ] lived , people were also eating and drinking . They were buying , selling , planting , and building .
CEV	Luke	17	29	But on the very day Lot left Sodom , fiery flames poured down from the sky and killed everyone .
CEV	Luke	17	30	The same will happen on the day when the Son of Man appears .
CEV	Luke	17	31	( F ) At that time no one on a rooftop [ f ] should go down into the house to get anything . No one in a field should go back to the house for anything .
CEV	Luke	17	32	( G ) Remember what happened to Lot 's wife . [ g ]
CEV	Luke	17	33	( H ) People who try to save their lives will lose them , and those who lose their lives will save them .
CEV	Luke	17	34	On that night two people will be sleeping in the same bed , but only one will be taken . The other will be left . 35-36 Two women will be together grinding wheat , but only one will be taken . The other will be left . [ h ]
CEV	Luke	17	37	Then Jesus ' disciples spoke up , “ But where will this happen , Lord ? ” Jesus said , “ Where there is a corpse , there will always be vultures. ” [ i ] Footnotes - 17.3 followers : The Greek text has “ brothers , ” which is often used in the New Testament for followers of Jesus . - 17.12 leprosy : See the note at 4.27 . - 17.14 show yourselves to the priests : See the note at 5.14 . - 17.21 here with you : Or “ in your hearts. ” - 17.27,28 Noah … Lot : When God destroyed the earth by a flood , he saved Noah and his family .

The other will be left. ” - 17.37 Where there is a corpse , there will always be vultures : This saying may mean that when anything important happens , people soon know about it . Or the saying may mean that whenever something bad happens , curious people gather around and stare .

CEV	Luke	18	18	An important man asked Jesus , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to have eternal life ? ”
CEV	Luke	18	2	In a town there was once a judge who did n't fear God or care about people .
CEV	Luke	18	3	In that same town there was a widow who kept going to the judge and saying , “ Make sure that I get fair treatment in court. ”
CEV	Luke	18	4	For a while the judge refused to do anything . Finally , he said to himself , “ Even though I do n't fear God or care about people ,
CEV	Luke	18	5	I will help this widow because she keeps on bothering me . If I do n't help her , she will wear me out. ”
CEV	Luke	18	6	The Lord said : Think about what that crooked judge said .
CEV	Luke	18	7	( A ) Wo n't God protect his chosen ones who pray to him day and night ? Wo n't he be concerned for them ?
CEV	Luke	18	8	He will surely hurry and help them . But when the Son of Man comes , will he find on this earth anyone with faith ? A Pharisee and a Tax Collector
CEV	Luke	18	9	Jesus told a story to some people who thought they were better than others and who looked down on everyone else :
CEV	Luke	18	10	Two men went into the temple to pray . [ a ] One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector . [ b ]
CEV	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood over by himself and prayed , [ c ] “ God , I thank you that I am not greedy , dishonest , and unfaithful in marriage like other people . And I am really glad that I am not like that tax collector over there .
CEV	Luke	18	12	I go without eating [ d ] for two days a week , and I give you one tenth of all I earn. ”
CEV	Luke	18	13	( B ) The tax collector stood off at a distance and did not think he was good enough even to look up toward heaven . He was so sorry for what he had done that he pounded his chest and prayed , “ God , have pity on me ! I am such a sinner. ”
CEV	Luke	18	14	( C ) Then Jesus said , “ When the two men went home , it was the tax collector and not the Pharisee who was pleasing to God . If you put yourself above others , you will be put down . But if you humble yourself , you will be honored. ” Jesus Blesses Little Children ( Matthew 19.13-15 ; Mark 10.13-16 )
CEV	Luke	18	15	Some people brought their little children for Jesus to bless . But when his disciples saw them doing this , they told the people to stop bothering him .
CEV	Luke	18	16	So Jesus called the children over to him and said , “ Let the children come to me ! Do n't try to stop them . People who are like these children belong to God 's kingdom . [ e ]
CEV	Luke	18	17	You will never get into God 's kingdom unless you enter it like a child ! ” A Rich and Important Man ( Matthew 19.16-30 ; Mark 10.17-31 )
CEV	Luke	18	19	Jesus said , “ Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
CEV	Luke	18	20	( D ) You know the commandments : ‘ Be faithful in marriage . Do not murder . Do not steal . Do not tell lies about others . Respect your father and mother. ’ ”
CEV	Luke	18	21	He told Jesus , “ I have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man. ”
CEV	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ There is one thing you still need to do . Go and sell everything you own ! Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . Then come and be my follower. ”
CEV	Luke	18	23	When the man heard this , he was sad , because he was very rich .
CEV	Luke	18	24	Jesus saw how sad the man was . So he said , “ It 's terribly hard for rich people to get into God 's kingdom !
CEV	Luke	18	25	In fact , it 's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God 's kingdom. ”
CEV	Luke	18	26	When the crowd heard this , they asked , “ How can anyone ever be saved ? ”
CEV	Luke	18	27	Jesus replied , “ There are some things that people can not do , but God can do anything. ”
CEV	Luke	18	28	Peter said , “ Remember , we left everything to be your followers ! ”
CEV	Luke	18	29	Jesus answered , “ You can be sure that anyone who gives up home or wife or brothers or family or children because of God 's kingdom
CEV	Luke	18	30	will be given much more in this life . And in the future world they will have eternal life. ” Jesus Again Tells about His Death ( Matthew 20.17-19 ; Mark 10.32-34 )
CEV	Luke	18	31	Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said : We are now on our way to Jerusalem . Everything that the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will happen there .
CEV	Luke	18	32	He will be handed over to foreigners , [ f ] who will make fun of him , mistreat him , and spit on him .
CEV	Luke	18	33	They will beat him and kill him , but three days later he will rise to life .
CEV	Luke	18	34	The apostles did not understand what Jesus was talking about . They could not understand , because the meaning of what he said was hidden from them . Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar ( Matthew 20.29-34 ; Mark 10.46-52 )
CEV	Luke	18	35	When Jesus was coming close to Jericho , a blind man sat begging beside the road .
CEV	Luke	18	36	The man heard the crowd walking by and asked what was happening .
CEV	Luke	18	37	Some people told him that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by .
CEV	Luke	18	38	So the blind man shouted , “ Jesus , Son of David , [ g ] have pity on me ! ”
CEV	Luke	18	39	The people who were going along with Jesus told the man to be quiet . But he shouted even louder , “ Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
CEV	Luke	18	40	Jesus stopped and told some people to bring the blind man over to him . When the blind man was getting near , Jesus asked ,
CEV	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” “ Lord , I want to see ! ” he answered .
CEV	Luke	18	42	Jesus replied , “ Look and you will see ! Your eyes are healed because of your faith. ”
CEV	Luke	18	43	At once the man could see , and he went with Jesus and started thanking God . When the crowds saw what happened , they praised God .

CEV	Luke	19	19	The king said , “ You will be given five cities. ”
CEV	Luke	19	2	where a man named Zacchaeus lived . He was in charge of collecting taxes [ a ] and was very rich . 3-4 Jesus was heading his way , and Zacchaeus wanted to see what he was like . But Zacchaeus was a short man and could not see over the crowd . So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree .
CEV	Luke	19	5	When Jesus got there , he looked up and said , “ Zacchaeus , hurry down ! I want to stay with you today. ”
CEV	Luke	19	6	Zacchaeus hurried down and gladly welcomed Jesus .
CEV	Luke	19	7	Everyone who saw this started grumbling , “ This man Zacchaeus is a sinner ! And Jesus is going home to eat with him. ”
CEV	Luke	19	8	Later that day Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord , “ I will give half of my property to the poor . And I will now pay back four times as much [ b ] to everyone I have ever cheated. ”
CEV	Luke	19	9	Jesus said to Zacchaeus , “ Today you and your family have been saved , [ c ] because you are a true son of Abraham . [ d ]

CEV	Luke	19	11	( B ) The crowd was still listening to Jesus as he was getting close to Jerusalem . Many of them thought that God 's kingdom would soon appear ,
CEV	Luke	19	12	and Jesus told them this story : A prince once went to a foreign country to be crowned king and then to return .
CEV	Luke	19	13	But before leaving , he called in ten servants and gave each of them some money . He told them , “ Use this to earn more money until I get back. ”
CEV	Luke	19	14	But the people of his country hated him , and they sent messengers to the foreign country to say , “ We do n't want this man to be our king. ”
CEV	Luke	19	15	After the prince had been made king , he returned and called in his servants . He asked them how much they had earned with the money they had been given .
CEV	Luke	19	16	The first servant came and said , “ Sir , with the money you gave me I have earned ten times as much. ”
CEV	Luke	19	17	“ That 's fine , my good servant ! ” the king said . “ Since you have shown that you can be trusted with a small amount , you will be given ten cities to rule. ”
CEV	Luke	19	18	The second one came and said , “ Sir , with the money you gave me , I have earned five times as much. ”
CEV	Luke	19	20	Another servant came and said , “ Sir , here is your money . I kept it safe in a handkerchief .
CEV	Luke	19	21	You are a hard man , and I was afraid of you . You take what is n't yours , and you harvest crops you did n't plant. ”
CEV	Luke	19	22	“ You worthless servant ! ” the king told him . “ You have condemned yourself by what you have just said . You knew I am a hard man , taking what is n't mine and harvesting what I 've not planted .
CEV	Luke	19	23	Why did n't you put my money in the bank ? On my return , I could have had the money together with interest. ”
CEV	Luke	19	24	Then he said to some other servants standing there , “ Take the money away from him and give it to the servant who earned ten times as much. ”
CEV	Luke	19	25	But they said , “ Sir , he already has ten times as much ! ”
CEV	Luke	19	26	( C ) The king replied , “ Those who have something will be given more . But everything will be taken away from those who do n't have anything .
CEV	Luke	19	27	Now bring me the enemies who did n't want me to be their king . Kill them while I watch ! ” Jesus Enters Jerusalem ( Matthew 21.1-11 ; Mark 11.1-11 ; John 12.12-19 )
CEV	Luke	19	28	When Jesus had finished saying all this , he went on toward Jerusalem .
CEV	Luke	19	29	As he was getting near Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples on ahead .
CEV	Luke	19	30	He told them , “ Go into the next village , where you will find a young donkey that has never been ridden . Untie the donkey and bring it here .
CEV	Luke	19	31	If anyone asks why you are doing this , just say , ‘ The Lord [ e ] needs it. ’ ”
CEV	Luke	19	32	They went off and found everything just as Jesus had said .
CEV	Luke	19	33	While they were untying the donkey , its owners asked , “ Why are you doing that ? ”
CEV	Luke	19	34	They answered , “ The Lord [ f ] needs it. ”
CEV	Luke	19	35	Then they led the donkey to Jesus . They put some of their clothes on its back and helped Jesus get on .
CEV	Luke	19	36	And as he rode along , the people spread clothes on the road [ g ] in front of him .
CEV	Luke	19	37	When Jesus started down the Mount of Olives , his large crowd of disciples were happy and praised God because of all the miracles they had seen .
CEV	Luke	19	38	( D ) They shouted , “ Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and glory to God. ”
CEV	Luke	19	39	Some Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , make your disciples stop shouting ! ”
CEV	Luke	19	40	But Jesus answered , “ If they keep quiet , these stones will start shouting. ”
CEV	Luke	19	41	When Jesus came closer and could see Jerusalem , he cried
CEV	Luke	19	42	and said : It is too bad that today your people do n't know what will bring them peace ! Now it is hidden from them .
CEV	Luke	19	43	Jerusalem , the time will come when your enemies will build walls around you to attack you . Armies will surround you and close in on you from every side .
CEV	Luke	19	44	They will level you to the ground and kill your people . Not one stone in your buildings will be left on top of another . This will happen because you did not see that God had come to save you . [ h ] Jesus in the Temple ( Matthew 21.12-17 ; Mark 11.15-19 ; John 2.13-22 )
CEV	Luke	19	45	When Jesus entered the temple , he started chasing out the people who were selling things .
CEV	Luke	19	46	( E ) He told them , “ The Scriptures say , ‘ My house should be a place of worship. ’ But you have made it a place where robbers hide ! ”
CEV	Luke	19	47	( F ) Each day , Jesus kept on teaching in the temple . So the chief priests , the teachers of the Law of Moses , and some other important people tried to have him killed .
CEV	Luke	19	48	But they could not find a way to do it , because everyone else was eager to listen to him . Footnotes - 19.2 in charge of collecting taxes : See the note at 3.12 . - 19.8 pay back four times as much : Both Jewish and Roman law said that a person must pay back four times the amount that was taken . - 19.9 saved : Zacchaeus was Jewish , but it is only now that he is rescued from sin and placed under God 's care . - 19.9 son of Abraham : As used in this verse , the words mean that Zacchaeus is truly one of God 's special people . - 19.31 The Lord : Or “ The master of the donkey. ” - 19.34 The Lord : Or “ The master of the donkey. ” - 19.36 spread clothes on the road : This was one way that the Jewish people welcomed a famous person . - 19.44 that God had come to save you : The Jewish people looked for the time when God would come and rescue them from their enemies .

CEV	Luke	20	20	Jesus ' enemies kept watching him closely , because they wanted to hand him over to the Roman governor . So they sent some men who pretended to be good . But they were really spies trying to catch Jesus saying something wrong .
CEV	Luke	20	2	asked him , “ What right do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
CEV	Luke	20	3	Jesus replied , “ I want to ask you a question .
CEV	Luke	20	4	Who gave John the right to baptize ? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being ? ”
CEV	Luke	20	5	They talked this over and said to each other , “ We ca n't say God gave John this right . Jesus will ask us why we did n't believe John .
CEV	Luke	20	6	And we ca n't say it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize . The crowd will stone us to death , because they think John was a prophet. ”
CEV	Luke	20	7	So they told Jesus , “ We do n't know who gave John the right to baptize. ”
CEV	Luke	20	8	Jesus replied , “ Then I wo n't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do. ” Renters of a Vineyard ( Matthew 21.33-46 ; Mark 12.1-12 )
CEV	Luke	20	9	( A ) Jesus told the people this story : A man once planted a vineyard and rented it out . Then he left the country for a long time .
CEV	Luke	20	10	When it was time to harvest the crop , he sent a servant to ask the renters for his share of the grapes . But they beat up the servant and sent him away without anything .
CEV	Luke	20	11	So the owner sent another servant . The renters also beat him up . They insulted him terribly and sent him away without a thing .
CEV	Luke	20	12	The owner sent a third servant . He was also beaten terribly and thrown out of the vineyard .
CEV	Luke	20	13	The owner then said to himself , “ What am I going to do ? I know what . I 'll send my son , the one I love so much . They will surely respect him ! ”
CEV	Luke	20	14	When the renters saw the owner 's son , they said to one another , “ Someday he will own the vineyard . Let 's kill him ! Then we can have it all for ourselves. ”
CEV	Luke	20	15	So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . Jesus asked , “ What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do ?
CEV	Luke	20	16	I 'll tell you what . He will come and kill those renters and let someone else have his vineyard. ” When the people heard this , they said , “ This must never happen ! ”
CEV	Luke	20	17	( B ) But Jesus looked straight at them and said , “ Then what do the Scriptures mean when they say , ‘ The stone the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all ’ ?
CEV	Luke	20	18	Anyone who stumbles over this stone will get hurt , and anyone it falls on will be smashed to pieces. ”
CEV	Luke	20	19	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses knew that Jesus was talking about them when he was telling this story . They wanted to arrest him right then , but they were afraid of the people . Paying Taxes ( Matthew 22.15-22 ; Mark 12.13-17 )
CEV	Luke	20	21	The spies said to him , “ Teacher , we know you teach the truth about what God wants people to do . And you treat everyone with the same respect , no matter who they are .
CEV	Luke	20	22	Tell us , should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not ? ”
CEV	Luke	20	23	Jesus knew they were trying to trick him . So he told them ,
CEV	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a coin. ” Then he asked , “ Whose picture and name are on it ? ” “ The Emperor 's , ” they answered .
CEV	Luke	20	25	Then he told them , “ Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God. ”
CEV	Luke	20	26	Jesus ' enemies could not catch him saying anything wrong there in front of the people . They were amazed at his answer and kept quiet . Life in the Future World ( Matthew 22.23-33 ; Mark 12.18-27 )
CEV	Luke	20	27	( C ) The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death . So some of them came to Jesus
CEV	Luke	20	28	( D ) and said : Teacher , Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children , his brother should marry the widow . Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother .
CEV	Luke	20	29	There were once seven brothers . The first one married , but died without having any children .
CEV	Luke	20	30	The second one married his brother 's widow , and he also died without having any children .
CEV	Luke	20	31	The same thing happened to the third one . Finally , all seven brothers married this woman and died without having any children .
CEV	Luke	20	32	At last the woman died .
CEV	Luke	20	33	When God raises people from death , whose wife will this woman be ? All seven brothers had married her .
CEV	Luke	20	34	Jesus answered : The people in this world get married .
CEV	Luke	20	35	But in the future world no one who is worthy to rise from death will either marry
CEV	Luke	20	36	or die . They will be like the angels and will be God 's children , because they have been raised to life .
CEV	Luke	20	37	( E ) In the story about the burning bush , Moses clearly shows that people will live again . He said , “ The Lord is the God worshiped by Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob. ” [ a ]
CEV	Luke	20	38	So the Lord is n't the God of the dead , but of the living . This means that everyone is alive as far as God is concerned .
CEV	Luke	20	39	Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses said , “ Teacher , you have given a good answer ! ”
CEV	Luke	20	40	From then on , no one dared to ask Jesus any questions . About David 's Son ( Matthew 22.41-46 ; Mark 12.35-37 )
CEV	Luke	20	41	Jesus asked , “ Why do people say that the Messiah will be the son of King David ? [ b ]
CEV	Luke	20	42	( F ) In the book of Psalms , David himself says , ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right side [ c ]
CEV	Luke	20	43	until I make your enemies into a footstool for you. ’
CEV	Luke	20	44	David spoke of the Messiah as his Lord , so how can the Messiah be his son ? ” Jesus and the Teachers of the Law of Moses ( Matthew 23.1-36 ; Mark 12.38-40 ; Luke 11.37-54 )
CEV	Luke	20	45	While everyone was listening to Jesus , he said to his disciples :
CEV	Luke	20	46	Guard against the teachers of the Law of Moses ! They love to walk around in long robes , and they like to be greeted in the market . They want the front seats in the synagogues and the best seats at banquets .
CEV	Luke	20	47	But they cheat widows out of their homes and then pray long prayers just to show off . These teachers will be punished most of all . Copyright ©

CEV	Luke	21	21	If you are living in Judea at this time , run to the mountains . If you are in the city , leave it . And if you are out in the country , do n't go back into the city .
CEV	Luke	21	2	He also saw a poor widow putting in a few cents .
CEV	Luke	21	3	And he said , “ I tell you that this poor woman has put in more than all the others .
CEV	Luke	21	4	Everyone else gave what they did n't need . But she is very poor and gave everything she had. ” The Temple Will Be Destroyed ( Matthew 24.1,2 ; Mark 13.1,2 )
CEV	Luke	21	5	Some people were talking about the beautiful stones used to build the temple and about the gifts that had been placed in it . Jesus said ,
CEV	Luke	21	6	“ Do you see these stones ? The time is coming when not one of them will be left in place . They will all be knocked down. ” Warning about Trouble ( Matthew 24.3-14 ; Mark 13.3-13 )
CEV	Luke	21	7	( A ) Some people asked , “ Teacher , when will all this happen ? How can we know when these things are about to take place ? ”
CEV	Luke	21	8	Jesus replied : Do n't be fooled by those who will come and claim to be me . They will say , “ I am Christ ! ” and “ Now is the time ! ” But do n't follow them .
CEV	Luke	21	9	When you hear about wars and riots , do n't be afraid . These things will have to happen first , but this is n't the end .
CEV	Luke	21	10	Nations will go to war against one another , and kingdoms will attack each other .
CEV	Luke	21	11	There will be great earthquakes , and in many places people will starve to death and suffer terrible diseases . All sorts of frightening things will be seen in the sky .
CEV	Luke	21	12	Before all this happens , you will be arrested and punished . You will be tried in your synagogues and put in jail . Because of me you will be placed on trial before kings and governors .
CEV	Luke	21	13	But this will be your chance to tell about your faith .
CEV	Luke	21	14	( B ) Do n't worry about what you will say to defend yourselves .
CEV	Luke	21	15	I will give you the wisdom to know what to say . None of your enemies will be able to oppose you or to say that you are wrong .
CEV	Luke	21	16	You will be betrayed by your own parents , brothers , family , and friends . Some of you will even be killed .
CEV	Luke	21	17	Because of me , you will be hated by everyone .
CEV	Luke	21	18	But do n't worry ! [ a ]
CEV	Luke	21	19	You will be saved by being faithful to me . Jerusalem Will Be Destroyed ( Matthew 24.15-21 ; Mark 13.14-19 )
CEV	Luke	21	20	When you see Jerusalem surrounded by soldiers , you will know that it will soon be destroyed .
CEV	Luke	21	22	( C ) This time of punishment is what is written about in the Scriptures .
CEV	Luke	21	23	It will be an awful time for women who are expecting babies or nursing young children ! Everywhere in the land people will suffer horribly and be punished .
CEV	Luke	21	24	Some of them will be killed by swords . Others will be carried off to foreign countries . Jerusalem will be overrun by foreign nations until their time comes to an end . When the Son of Man Appears ( Matthew 24.29-31 ; Mark 13.24-27 )
CEV	Luke	21	25	( D ) Strange things will happen to the sun , moon , and stars . The nations on earth will be afraid of the roaring sea and tides , and they wo n't know what to do .
CEV	Luke	21	26	People will be so frightened that they will faint because of what is happening to the world . Every power in the sky will be shaken . [ b ]
CEV	Luke	21	27	( E ) Then the Son of Man will be seen , coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
CEV	Luke	21	28	When all of this starts happening , stand up straight and be brave . You will soon be set free . A Lesson from a Fig Tree ( Matthew 24.32-35 ; Mark 13.28-31 )
CEV	Luke	21	29	Then Jesus told them a story : When you see a fig tree or any other tree
CEV	Luke	21	30	putting out leaves , you know that summer will soon come .
CEV	Luke	21	31	So , when you see these things happening , you know that God 's kingdom will soon be here .
CEV	Luke	21	32	You can be sure that some of the people of this generation will still be alive when all of this takes place .
CEV	Luke	21	33	The sky and the earth wo n't last forever , but my words will . A Warning
CEV	Luke	21	34	Do n't spend all of your time thinking about eating or drinking or worrying about life . If you do , the final day will suddenly catch you

CEV	Luke	22	22	The Son of Man will die in the way that has been decided for him , but it will be terrible for the one who betrays him ! ”
CEV	Luke	22	2	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were looking for a way to get rid of Jesus , because they were afraid of what the people might do .
CEV	Luke	22	3	Then Satan entered the heart of Judas Iscariot , [ a ] who was one of the twelve apostles .
CEV	Luke	22	4	Judas went to talk with the chief priests and the officers of the temple police about how he could help them arrest Jesus .
CEV	Luke	22	5	They were very pleased and offered to pay Judas some money .
CEV	Luke	22	6	He agreed and started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus when the crowds were not around . Jesus Eats with His Disciples ( Matthew 26.17-25 ; Mark 14.12-21 ; John 13.21-30 )
CEV	Luke	22	7	The day had come for the Festival of Thin Bread , and it was time to kill the Passover lambs .
CEV	Luke	22	8	So Jesus said to Peter and John , “ Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat. ”
CEV	Luke	22	9	But they asked , “ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ”
CEV	Luke	22	10	Jesus told them , “ As you go into the city , you will meet a man carrying a jar of water . [ b ] Follow him into the house
CEV	Luke	22	11	and say to the owner , ‘ Our teacher wants to know where he can eat the Passover meal with his disciples. ’
CEV	Luke	22	12	The owner will take you upstairs and show you a large room ready for you to use . Prepare the meal there. ”
CEV	Luke	22	13	Peter and John left . They found everything just as Jesus had told them , and they prepared the Passover meal . The Lord 's Supper ( Matthew 26.26-30 ; Mark 14.22-26 ;
CEV	Luke	22	1	Corinthians 11.23-25 )
CEV	Luke	22	14	When the time came for Jesus and the apostles to eat ,
CEV	Luke	22	15	he said to them , “ I have very much wanted to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer .
CEV	Luke	22	16	I tell you I will not eat another Passover meal until it is finally eaten in God 's kingdom. ”
CEV	Luke	22	17	Jesus took a cup of wine in his hands and gave thanks to God . Then he told the apostles , “ Take this wine and share it with each other .
CEV	Luke	22	18	I tell you that I will not drink any more wine until God 's kingdom comes. ”
CEV	Luke	22	19	Jesus took some bread in his hands and gave thanks for it . He broke the bread and handed it to his apostles . Then he said , “ This is my body , which is given for you . Eat this as a way of remembering me ! ”
CEV	Luke	22	20	( B ) After the meal he took another cup of wine in his hands . Then he said , “ This is my blood . It is poured out for you , and with it God makes his new agreement .
CEV	Luke	22	21	( C ) The one who will betray me is here at the table with me !
CEV	Luke	22	23	Then the apostles started arguing about who would ever do such a thing . An Argument about Greatness
CEV	Luke	22	24	( D ) The apostles got into an argument about which one of them was the greatest .
CEV	Luke	22	25	( E ) So Jesus told them : Foreign kings order their people around , and powerful rulers call themselves everyone 's friends . [ c ]
CEV	Luke	22	26	( F ) But do n't be like them . The most important one of you should be like the least important , and your leader should be like a servant .
CEV	Luke	22	27	( G ) Who do people think is the greatest , a person who is served or one who serves ? Is n't it the one who is served ? But I have been with you as a servant .
CEV	Luke	22	28	You have stayed with me in all my troubles .
CEV	Luke	22	29	So I will give you the right to rule as kings , just as my Father has given me the right to rule as a king .
CEV	Luke	22	30	( H ) You will eat and drink with me in my kingdom , and you will each sit on a throne to judge the twelve tribes of Israel . Jesus ' Disciples Will Be Tested ( Matthew 26.31-35 ; Mark 14.27-31 ; John 13.36-38 )
CEV	Luke	22	31	Jesus said , “ Simon , listen to me ! Satan has demanded the right to test each one of you , as a farmer does when he separates wheat from the husks . [ d ]
CEV	Luke	22	32	But Simon , I have prayed that your faith will be strong . And when you have come back to me , help the others. ”
CEV	Luke	22	33	Peter said , “ Lord , I am ready to go with you to jail and even to die with you. ”
CEV	Luke	22	34	Jesus replied , “ Peter , I tell you that before a rooster crows tomorrow morning , you will say three times that you do n't know me. ” Moneybags , Traveling Bags , and Swords
CEV	Luke	22	35	( I ) Jesus asked his disciples , “ When I sent you out without a moneybag or a traveling bag or sandals , did you need anything ? ” “ No ! ” they answered .
CEV	Luke	22	36	Jesus told them , “ But now , if you have a moneybag , take it with you . Also take a traveling bag , and if you do n't have a sword , [ e ] sell some of your clothes and buy one .
CEV	Luke	22	37	( J ) Do this because the Scriptures say , ‘ He was considered a criminal. ’ This was written about me , and it will soon come true. ”
CEV	Luke	22	38	The disciples said , “ Lord , here are two swords ! ” “ Enough of that ! ” Jesus replied . Jesus Prays ( Matthew 26.36-46 ; Mark 14.32-42 )
CEV	Luke	22	39	Jesus went out to the Mount of Olives , as he often did , and his disciples went with him .
CEV	Luke	22	40	When they got there , he told them , “ Pray that you wo n't be tested. ”
CEV	Luke	22	41	Jesus walked on a little way before he knelt down and prayed ,
CEV	Luke	22	42	“ Father , if you will , please do n't make me suffer by drinking from this cup . [ f ] But do what you want , and not what I want. ”
CEV	Luke	22	43	Then an angel from heaven came to help him .
CEV	Luke	22	44	Jesus was in great pain and prayed so sincerely that his sweat fell to the ground like drops of blood . [ g ]
CEV	Luke	22	45	Jesus got up from praying and went over to his disciples . They were asleep and worn out from being so sad .
CEV	Luke	22	46	He said to them , “ Why are you asleep ? Wake up and pray that you wo n't be tested. ” Jesus Is Arrested ( Matthew 26.47-56 ; Mark 14.43-50 ; John 18.3-11 )
CEV	Luke	22	47	While Jesus was still speaking , a crowd came up . It was led by Judas , one of the twelve apostles . He went over to Jesus and greeted him with a kiss . [ h ]
CEV	Luke	22	48	Jesus asked Judas , “ Are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
CEV	Luke	22	49	When Jesus ' disciples saw what was about to happen , they asked , “ Lord , should we attack them with a sword ? ”
CEV	Luke	22	50	One of the disciples even struck at the high priest 's servant with his sword and cut off the servant 's right ear .
CEV	Luke	22	51	“ Enough of that ! ” Jesus said . Then he touched the servant 's ear and healed it .
CEV	Luke	22	52	Jesus spoke to the chief priests , the temple police , and the leaders who had come to arrest him . He said , “ Why do you come out with swords and clubs and treat me like a criminal ?
CEV	Luke	22	53	( K ) I was with you every day in the temple , and you did n't arrest me . But this is your time , and darkness [ i ] is in control. ” Peter Says He Does n't Know Jesus ( Matthew 26.57,58,67-75 ; Mark 14.53,54,66-72 ; John 18.12-18,25-27 )
CEV	Luke	22	54	Jesus was arrested and led away to the house of the high priest , while Peter followed at a distance .
CEV	Luke	22	55	Some people built a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were sitting around it . Peter sat there with them ,
CEV	Luke	22	56	and a servant girl saw him . Then after she had looked at him carefully , she said , “ This man was with Jesus ! ”
CEV	Luke	22	57	Peter said , “ Woman , I do n't even know that man ! ”
CEV	Luke	22	58	A little later someone else saw Peter and said , “ You are one of them ! ” “ No , I 'm not ! ” Peter replied .
CEV	Luke	22	59	About an hour later another man insisted , “ This man must have been with Jesus . They both come from Galilee. ”
CEV	Luke	22	60	Peter replied , “ I do n't know what you are talking about ! ” Right then , while Peter was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
CEV	Luke	22	61	The Lord turned and looked at Peter . And Peter remembered that the Lord had said , “ Before a rooster crows tomorrow morning , you will say three times that you do n't know me. ”
CEV	Luke	22	62	Then Peter went out and cried bitterly .
CEV	Luke	22	63	The men who were guarding Jesus made fun of him and beat him .
CEV	Luke	22	64	They put a blindfold on him and said , “ Tell us who struck you ! ”
CEV	Luke	22	65	They kept on insulting Jesus in many other ways . Jesus Is Questioned by the Council ( Matthew 26.59-66 ; Mark 14.55-64 ; John 18.19-24 )
CEV	Luke	22	66	At daybreak the nation 's leaders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law of Moses got together and brought Jesus before their council .
CEV	Luke	22	67	They said , “ Tell us ! Are you the Messiah ? ” Jesus replied , “ If I said so , you would n't believe me .
CEV	Luke	22	68	And if I asked you a question , you would n't answer .
CEV	Luke	22	69	But from now on , the Son of Man will be seated at the right side of God All-Powerful. ”
CEV	Luke	22	70	Then they asked , “ Are you the Son of God ? ” [ j ] Jesus answered , “ You say I am ! ” [ k ]
CEV	Luke	22	71	They replied , “ Why do we need more witnesses ? He said it himself ! ” Footnotes - 22.3 Iscariot : See the note at 6.16 . - 22.10 a man carrying a jar of water : A male slave carrying water would probably mean that the family was rich . - 22.25 everyone 's friends : This translates a Greek word that rulers sometimes used as a title for themselves or for special friends . - 22.31 separates wheat from the husks : See the note at 3.17 . - 22.36 moneybag … traveling bag … sword : These were things that someone would take on a dangerous journey . Jesus was telling his disciples to be ready for anything that might happen . They seem to have understood what he meant ( see 22.49-51 ) . - 22.42 drinking from this cup : In the Scriptures “ to drink from a cup ” sometimes means to suffer . - 22.43,44 Then an angel … like drops of blood : Verses 43,44 are not in some manuscripts . - 22.47 greeted him with a kiss : It was the custom for people to greet each other with a kiss on the cheek . - 22.53 darkness : Darkness stands for the power of the devil . - 22.70 Son of God : This was one of the titles used for the kings of Israel . - 22.70 You say I am : Or “ That 's what you say. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Luke	23	23	The people kept on shouting as loud as they could for Jesus to be put to death .
CEV	Luke	23	2	They started accusing him and said , “ We caught this man trying to get our people to riot and to stop paying taxes to the Emperor . He also claims that he is the Messiah , our king. ”
CEV	Luke	23	3	Pilate asked Jesus , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” “ Those are your words , ” Jesus answered .
CEV	Luke	23	4	Pilate told the chief priests and the crowd , “ I do n't find him guilty of anything. ”
CEV	Luke	23	5	But they all kept on saying , “ He has been teaching and causing trouble all over Judea . He started in Galilee and has now come all the way here. ” Jesus Is Brought before Herod
CEV	Luke	23	6	When Pilate heard this , he asked , “ Is this man from Galilee ? ”
CEV	Luke	23	7	After Pilate learned that Jesus came from the region ruled by Herod , [ a ] he sent him to Herod , who was in Jerusalem at that time .
CEV	Luke	23	8	For a long time Herod had wanted to see Jesus and was very happy because he finally had this chance . He had heard many things about Jesus and hoped to see him work a miracle .
CEV	Luke	23	9	Herod asked him a lot of questions , but Jesus did not answer .
CEV	Luke	23	10	Then the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses stood up and accused him of all kinds of bad things .
CEV	Luke	23	11	Herod and his soldiers made fun of Jesus and insulted him . They put a fine robe on him and sent him back to Pilate .
CEV	Luke	23	12	That same day Herod and Pilate became friends , even though they had been enemies before this . The Death Sentence ( Matthew 27.15-26 ; Mark 15.6-15 ; John 18.39—19.16 )
CEV	Luke	23	13	Pilate called together the chief priests , the leaders , and the people .
CEV	Luke	23	14	He told them , “ You brought Jesus to me and said he was a troublemaker . But I have questioned him here in front of you , and I have not found him guilty of anything that you say he has done .
CEV	Luke	23	15	Herod did n't find him guilty either and sent him back . This man does n't deserve to be put to death ! 16-17 I will just have him beaten with a whip and set free. ” [ b ]
CEV	Luke	23	18	But the whole crowd shouted , “ Kill Jesus ! Give us Barabbas ! ”
CEV	Luke	23	19	Now Barabbas was in jail because he had started a riot in the city and had murdered someone .
CEV	Luke	23	20	Pilate wanted to set Jesus free , so he spoke again to the crowds .
CEV	Luke	23	21	But they kept shouting , “ Nail him to a cross ! Nail him to a cross ! ”
CEV	Luke	23	22	Pilate spoke to them a third time , “ But what crime has he done ? I have not found him guilty of anything for which he should be put to death . I will have him beaten with a whip and set free. ”
CEV	Luke	23	24	Finally , Pilate gave in .
CEV	Luke	23	25	He freed the man who was in jail for rioting and murder , because he was the one the crowd wanted to be set free . Then Pilate handed Jesus over for them to do what they wanted with him . Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross ( Matthew 27.31-44 ; Mark 15.21-32 ; John 19.17-27 )
CEV	Luke	23	26	As Jesus was being led away , some soldiers grabbed hold of a man named Simon who was from Cyrene . He was coming in from the fields , but they put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus .
CEV	Luke	23	27	A large crowd was following Jesus , and in the crowd a lot of women were crying and weeping for him .
CEV	Luke	23	28	Jesus turned to the women and said : Women of Jerusalem , do n't cry for me ! Cry for yourselves and for your children .
CEV	Luke	23	29	Someday people will say , “ Women who never had children are really fortunate ! ”
CEV	Luke	23	30	( A ) At that time everyone will say to the mountains , “ Fall on us ! ” They will say to the hills , “ Hide us ! ”
CEV	Luke	23	31	If this can happen when the wood is green , what do you think will happen when it is dry ? [ c ]
CEV	Luke	23	32	Two criminals were led out to be put to death with Jesus .
CEV	Luke	23	33	When the soldiers came to the place called “ The Skull , ” [ d ] they nailed Jesus to a cross . They also nailed the two criminals to crosses , one on each side of Jesus . 34-35 ( B ) Jesus said , “ Father , forgive these people ! They do n't know what they 're doing. ” [ e ] While the crowd stood there watching Jesus , the soldiers gambled for his clothes . The leaders insulted him by saying , “ He saved others . Now he should save himself , if he really is God 's chosen Messiah ! ”
CEV	Luke	23	36	( C ) The soldiers made fun of Jesus and brought him some wine .
CEV	Luke	23	37	They said , “ If you are the king of the Jews , save yourself ! ”
CEV	Luke	23	38	Above him was a sign that said , “ This is the King of the Jews. ”
CEV	Luke	23	39	One of the criminals hanging there also insulted Jesus by saying , “ Are n't you the Messiah ? Save yourself and save us ! ”
CEV	Luke	23	40	But the other criminal told the first one off , “ Do n't you fear God ? Are n't you getting the same punishment as this man ?
CEV	Luke	23	41	We got what was coming to us , but he did n't do anything wrong. ”
CEV	Luke	23	42	Then he said to Jesus , “ Remember me when you come into power ! ”
CEV	Luke	23	43	Jesus replied , “ I promise that today you will be with me in paradise. ” [ f ] The Death of Jesus ( Matthew 27.45-56 ; Mark 15.33-41 ; John 19.28-30 )
CEV	Luke	23	44	Around noon the sky turned dark and stayed that way until the middle of the afternoon .
CEV	Luke	23	45	( D ) The sun stopped shining , and the curtain in the temple [ g ] split down the middle .
CEV	Luke	23	46	( E ) Jesus shouted , “ Father , I put myself in your hands ! ” Then he died .
CEV	Luke	23	47	When the Roman officer saw what had happened , he praised God and said , “ Jesus must really have been a good man ! ”
CEV	Luke	23	48	A crowd had gathered to see the terrible sight . Then after they had seen it , they felt brokenhearted and went home .
CEV	Luke	23	49	( F ) All of Jesus ' close friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood at a distance and watched . Jesus Is Buried ( Matthew 27.57-61 ; Mark 15.42-47 ; John 19.38-42 ) 50-51 There was a man named Joseph , who was from Arimathea in Judea . Joseph was a good and honest man , and he was eager for God 's kingdom to come . He was also a member of the council , but he did not agree with what they had decided .
CEV	Luke	23	52	Joseph went to Pilate and asked for Jesus ' body .
CEV	Luke	23	53	He took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in fine cloth . Then he put it in a tomb that had been cut out of solid rock and had never been used .
CEV	Luke	23	54	It was Friday , and the Sabbath was about to begin . [ h ]
CEV	Luke	23	55	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and watched how Jesus ' body was placed in the tomb .
CEV	Luke	23	56	( G ) Then they went to prepare some sweet-smelling spices for his burial . But on the Sabbath they rested , as the Law of Moses commands . Footnotes - 23.7 Herod : Herod Antipas , the son of Herod the Great . - 23.16,17 set free : Some manuscripts add , “ Pilate said this , because at every Passover he was supposed to set one prisoner free for the Jewish people. ” - 23.31 If this can happen when the wood is green , what do you think will happen when it is dry : This saying probably means , “ If this can happen to an innocent person , what do you think will happen to one who is guilty ? ” - 23.33 “ The Skull ” : The place was probably given this name because it was near a large rock in the shape of a human skull . - 23.34,35 Jesus said , “ Father , forgive these people ! They do n't know what they 're doing ” : These words are not in some manuscripts . - 23.43 paradise : In the Greek translation of the Old Testament , this word is used for the Garden of Eden . In New Testament times it was sometimes used for the place where God 's people are happy and at rest , as they wait for the final judgment . - 23.45 curtain in the temple : There were two curtains in the temple . One was at the entrance , and the other separated the holy place from the most holy place that the Jewish people thought of as God 's home on earth . The second curtain is probably the one which is meant . - 23.54 the Sabbath was about to begin : The Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday . Copyright ©

CEV	Luke	24	4	and they did not know what to think . Suddenly two men in shining white clothes stood beside them .
CEV	Luke	24	5	The women were afraid and bowed to the ground . But the men said , “ Why are you looking in the place of the dead for someone who is alive ?
CEV	Luke	24	6	( A ) Jesus is n't here ! He has been raised from death . Remember that while he was still in Galilee , he told you ,
CEV	Luke	24	7	‘ The Son of Man will be handed over to sinners who will nail him to a cross . But three days later he will rise to life. ’ ”
CEV	Luke	24	8	Then they remembered what Jesus had said . 9-10 Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and some other women were the ones who had gone to the tomb . When they returned , they told the eleven apostles and the others what had happened .

CEV	Luke	24	13	That same day two of Jesus ' disciples were going to the village of Emmaus , which was about eleven kilometers from Jerusalem .
CEV	Luke	24	14	As they were talking and thinking about what had happened ,
CEV	Luke	24	15	Jesus came near and started walking along beside them .
CEV	Luke	24	16	But they did not know who he was .
CEV	Luke	24	17	Jesus asked them , “ What were you talking about as you walked along ? ” The two of them stood there looking sad and gloomy .
CEV	Luke	24	18	Then the one named Cleopas asked Jesus , “ Are you the only person from Jerusalem who did n't know what was happening there these last few days ? ”
CEV	Luke	24	19	“ What do you mean ? ” Jesus asked . They answered : Those things that happened to Jesus from Nazareth . By what he did and said he showed that he was a powerful prophet , who pleased God and all the people .
CEV	Luke	24	20	Then the chief priests and our leaders had him arrested and sentenced to die on a cross .
CEV	Luke	24	21	We had hoped that he would be the one to set Israel free ! But it has already been three days since all this happened .
CEV	Luke	24	22	Some women in our group surprised us . They had gone to the tomb early in the morning ,
CEV	Luke	24	23	but did not find the body of Jesus . They came back , saying they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he is alive .
CEV	Luke	24	25	Then Jesus asked the two disciples , “ Why ca n't you understand ? How can you be so slow to believe all that the prophets said ?
CEV	Luke	24	26	Did n't you know that the Messiah would have to suffer before he was given his glory ? ”
CEV	Luke	24	27	Jesus then explained everything written about himself in the Scriptures , beginning with the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets . [ c ]
CEV	Luke	24	28	When the two of them came near the village where they were going , Jesus seemed to be going farther .
CEV	Luke	24	29	They begged him , “ Stay with us ! It 's already late , and the sun is going down. ” So Jesus went into the house to stay with them .
CEV	Luke	24	30	After Jesus sat down to eat , he took some bread . He blessed it and broke it . Then he gave it to them .
CEV	Luke	24	31	At once they knew who he was , but he disappeared .
CEV	Luke	24	32	They said to each other , “ When he talked with us along the road and explained the Scriptures to us , did n't it warm our hearts ? ”
CEV	Luke	24	33	So they got up and returned to Jerusalem . The two disciples found the eleven apostles and the others gathered together .
CEV	Luke	24	34	And they learned from the group that the Lord was really alive and had appeared to Peter .
CEV	Luke	24	35	Then the disciples from Emmaus told what happened on the road and how they knew he was the Lord when he broke the bread . What Jesus ' Followers Must Do ( Matthew 28.16-20 ; Mark 16.14-18 ; John 20.19-23 ; Acts 1.6-8 )
CEV	Luke	24	36	While Jesus ' disciples were talking about what had happened , Jesus appeared and greeted them .
CEV	Luke	24	37	They were frightened and terrified because they thought they were seeing a ghost .
CEV	Luke	24	38	But Jesus said , “ Why are you so frightened ? Why do you doubt ?
CEV	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet and see who I am ! Touch me and find out for yourselves . Ghosts do n't have flesh and bones as you see I have. ”
CEV	Luke	24	40	After Jesus said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
CEV	Luke	24	41	The disciples were so glad and amazed that they could not believe it . Jesus then asked them , “ Do you have something to eat ? ”
CEV	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of broiled fish .
CEV	Luke	24	43	He took it and ate it as they watched .
CEV	Luke	24	44	Jesus said to them , “ While I was still with you , I told you that everything written about me in the Law of Moses , the Books of the Prophets , and in the Psalms [ d ] had to happen. ”
CEV	Luke	24	45	Then he helped them understand the Scriptures .
CEV	Luke	24	46	He told them : The Scriptures say that the Messiah must suffer , then three days later he will rise from death .
CEV	Luke	24	47	They also say that all people of every nation must be told in my name to turn to God , in order to be forgiven . So beginning in Jerusalem ,
CEV	Luke	24	48	you must tell everything that has happened .
CEV	Luke	24	49	( B ) I will send you the one my Father has promised , [ e ] but you must stay in the city until you are given power from heaven . Jesus Returns to Heaven ( Mark 16.19,20 ; Acts 1.9-11 )
CEV	Luke	24	50	( C ) Jesus led his disciples out to Bethany , where he raised his hands and blessed them .
CEV	Luke	24	51	As he was doing this , he left and was taken up to heaven . [ f ]

CEV	John	1	1	In the beginning was the one who is called the Word . The Word was with God and was truly God .
CEV	John	1	2	From the very beginning the Word was with God .
CEV	John	1	3	And with this Word , God created all things . Nothing was made without the Word . Everything that was created
CEV	John	1	4	received its life from him , and his life gave light to everyone .
CEV	John	1	5	The light keeps shining in the dark , and darkness has never put it out . [ a ]
CEV	John	1	6	( A ) God sent a man named John ,
CEV	John	1	7	who came to tell about the light and to lead all people to have faith .
CEV	John	1	8	John was n't this light . He came only to tell about the light .
CEV	John	1	9	The true light that shines on everyone was coming into the world .
CEV	John	1	10	The Word was in the world , but no one knew him , though God had made the world with his Word .
CEV	John	1	11	He came into his own world , but his own nation did not welcome him .
CEV	John	1	12	Yet some people accepted him and put their faith in him . So he gave them the right to be the children of God .
CEV	John	1	13	They were not God 's children by nature or because of any human desires . God himself was the one who made them his children .
CEV	John	1	14	The Word became a human being and lived here with us . We saw his true glory , the glory of the only Son of the Father . From him the complete gifts of undeserved grace and truth have come down to us .
CEV	John	1	15	John spoke about him and shouted , “ This is the one I told you would come ! He is greater than I am , because he was alive before I was born. ”
CEV	John	1	16	Because of all that the Son is , we have been given one blessing after another . [ b ]
CEV	John	1	17	The Law was given by Moses , but Jesus Christ brought us undeserved kindness and truth .
CEV	John	1	18	No one has ever seen God . The only Son , who is truly God and is closest to the Father , has shown us what God is like . John the Baptist Tells about Jesus ( Matthew 3.1-12 ; Mark 1.1-8 ; Luke 3.15-17 ) 19-20 The religious authorities in Jerusalem sent priests and temple helpers to ask John who he was . He told them plainly , “ I am not the Messiah. ”
CEV	John	1	21	( B ) Then when they asked him if he were Elijah , he said , “ No , I am not ! ” And when they asked if he were the Prophet , [ c ] he also said “ No ! ”
CEV	John	1	22	Finally , they said , “ Who are you then ? We have to give an answer to the ones who sent us . Tell us who you are ! ”
CEV	John	1	23	( C ) John answered in the words of the prophet Isaiah , “ I am only someone shouting in the desert , ‘ Get the road ready for the Lord ! ’ ”
CEV	John	1	24	Some Pharisees had also been sent to John .
CEV	John	1	25	They asked him , “ Why are you baptizing people , if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet ? ”
CEV	John	1	26	John told them , “ I use water to baptize people . But here with you is someone you do n't know .
CEV	John	1	27	Even though I came first , I am not good enough to untie his sandals. ”
CEV	John	1	28	John said this as he was baptizing east of the Jordan River in Bethany . [ d ] The Lamb of God
CEV	John	1	29	The next day , John saw Jesus coming toward him and said : Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world !
CEV	John	1	30	He is the one I told you about when I said , “ Someone else will come , who is greater than I am , because he was alive before I was born. ”
CEV	John	1	31	I did n't know who he was . But I came to baptize you with water , so that everyone in Israel would see him .
CEV	John	1	32	I was there and saw the Spirit come down on him like a dove from heaven . And the Spirit stayed on him .
CEV	John	1	33	Before this I did n't know who he was . But the one who sent me to baptize with water had told me , “ You will see the Spirit come down and stay on someone . Then you will know that he is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. ”
CEV	John	1	34	I saw this happen , and I tell you that he is the Son of God . The First Disciples of Jesus
CEV	John	1	35	The next day , John was there again , and two of his followers were with him .
CEV	John	1	36	When he saw Jesus walking by , he said , “ Here is the Lamb of God ! ”
CEV	John	1	37	John 's two followers heard him , and they went with Jesus .
CEV	John	1	38	When Jesus turned and saw them , he asked , “ What do you want ? ” They answered , “ Rabbi , where do you live ? ” The Hebrew word “ Rabbi ” means “ Teacher. ”
CEV	John	1	39	Jesus replied , “ Come and see ! ” It was already about four o'clock in the afternoon when they went with him and saw where he lived . So they stayed on for the rest of the day .
CEV	John	1	40	One of the two men who had heard John and had gone with Jesus was Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter .
CEV	John	1	41	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother and tell him , “ We have found the Messiah ! ” The Hebrew word “ Messiah ” means the same as the Greek word “ Christ. ”
CEV	John	1	42	Andrew brought his brother to Jesus . And when Jesus saw him , he said , “ Simon son of John , you will be called Cephas. ” This name can be translated as “ Peter. ” [ e ] Jesus Chooses Philip and Nathanael 43-44 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee . There he met Philip , who was from Bethsaida , the hometown of Andrew and Peter . Jesus said to Philip , “ Follow me. ”
CEV	John	1	45	Philip then found Nathanael and said , “ We have found the one that Moses and the Prophets [ f ] wrote about . He is Jesus , the son of Joseph from Nazareth. ”
CEV	John	1	46	Nathanael asked , “ Can anything good come from Nazareth ? ” Philip answered , “ Come and see. ”
CEV	John	1	47	When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , he said , “ Here is a true descendant of our ancestor Israel . And he is n't deceitful. ” [ g ]
CEV	John	1	48	“ How do you know me ? ” Nathanael asked . Jesus answered , “ Before Philip called you , I saw you under the fig tree. ”
CEV	John	1	49	Nathanael said , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God and the King of Israel ! ”
CEV	John	1	50	Jesus answered , “ Did you believe me just because I said that I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see something even greater .
CEV	John	1	51	( D ) I tell you for certain you will see heaven open and God 's angels going up and coming down on the Son of Man. ” [ h ] Footnotes - 1.5 put it out : Or “ understood it. ” - 1.16 one blessing after another : Or “ one blessing in place of another. ” - 1.21 the Prophet : Many of the Jewish people expected God to send them a prophet who would be like Moses , but with even greater power ( see Deuteronomy 18.15,18 ) . - 1.28 Bethany : An unknown village east of the Jordan with the same name as the village near Jerusalem . - 1.42 Peter : The Aramaic name “ Cephas ” and the Greek name “ Peter ” each mean “ rock. ” - 1.45 Moses and the Prophets : The Jewish Scriptures , that is , the Old Testament . - 1.47 Israel … is n't deceitful : Israel ( meaning “ a man who wrestled with God ” or “ a prince of God ” ) was the name that the Lord gave to Jacob ( meaning “ cheater ” or “ deceiver ” ) , the famous ancestor of the Jewish people . - 1.51 going up and coming down on the Son of Man : When Jacob ( see the note at 1.47 ) was running from his brother Esau , he had a dream in which he saw angels going up and down on a ladder from earth to heaven ( see Genesis 28.10-22 ) .

CEV	John	2	2	Jesus and his disciples had also been invited and were there .
CEV	John	2	3	When the wine was all gone , Mary said to Jesus , “ They do n't have any more wine. ”
CEV	John	2	4	Jesus replied , “ Mother , my time has n't yet come ! [ a ] You must not tell me what to do. ”
CEV	John	2	5	Mary then said to the servants , “ Do whatever Jesus tells you to do. ”
CEV	John	2	6	At the feast there were six stone water jars that were used by the people for washing themselves in the way that their religion said they must . Each jar held about
CEV	John	2	100	liters .
CEV	John	2	7	Jesus told the servants to fill them to the top with water . Then after the jars had been filled ,
CEV	John	2	8	he said , “ Now take some water and give it to the man in charge of the feast. ” The servants did as Jesus told them ,
CEV	John	2	9	and the man in charge drank some of the water that had now turned into wine . He did not know where the wine had come from , but the servants did . He called the bridegroom over
CEV	John	2	10	and said , “ The best wine is always served first . Then after the guests have had plenty , the other wine is served . But you have kept the best until last ! ”
CEV	John	2	11	This was Jesus ' first miracle , [ b ] and he did it in the village of Cana in Galilee . There Jesus showed his glory , and his disciples put their faith in him .
CEV	John	2	12	( A ) After this , he went with his mother , his brothers , and his disciples to the town of Capernaum , where they stayed for a few days . Jesus in the Temple ( Matthew 21.12,13 ; Mark 11.15-17 ; Luke 19.45,46 )
CEV	John	2	13	( B ) Not long before the Jewish festival of Passover , Jesus went to Jerusalem .
CEV	John	2	14	There he found people selling cattle , sheep , and doves in the temple . He also saw moneychangers sitting at their tables .
CEV	John	2	15	So he took some rope and made a whip . Then he chased everyone out of the temple , together with their sheep and cattle . He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and scattered their coins .
CEV	John	2	16	Jesus said to the people who had been selling doves , “ Get those doves out of here ! Do n't make my Father 's house a marketplace. ”
CEV	John	2	17	( C ) The disciples then remembered that the Scriptures say , “ My love for your house burns in me like a fire. ”
CEV	John	2	18	The Jewish leaders asked Jesus , “ What miracle [ c ] will you work to show us why you have done this ? ”
CEV	John	2	19	( D ) “ Destroy this temple , ” Jesus answered , “ and in three days I will build it again ! ”
CEV	John	2	20	The leaders replied , “ It took
CEV	John	2	46	years to build this temple . What makes you think you can rebuild it in three days ? ”
CEV	John	2	21	But Jesus was talking about his body as a temple .
CEV	John	2	22	And when he was raised from death , his disciples remembered what he had told them . Then they believed the Scriptures and the words of Jesus . Jesus Knows What People Are Like
CEV	John	2	23	In Jerusalem during Passover many people put their faith in Jesus , because they saw him work miracles . [ d ]

CEV	John	3	3	Jesus replied , “ I tell you for certain that you must be born from above [ a ] before you can see God 's kingdom ! ”
CEV	John	3	2	One night he went to Jesus and said , “ Rabbi , we know that God has sent you to teach us . You could not work these miracles , unless God were with you. ”
CEV	John	3	4	Nicodemus asked , “ How can a grown man ever be born a second time ? ”
CEV	John	3	5	Jesus answered : I tell you for certain that before you can get into God 's kingdom , you must be born not only by water , but by the Spirit .
CEV	John	3	6	Humans give life to their children . Yet only God 's Spirit can change you into a child of God .
CEV	John	3	7	Do n't be surprised when I say that you must be born from above .
CEV	John	3	8	Only God 's Spirit gives new life . The Spirit is like the wind that blows wherever it wants to . You can hear the wind , but you do n't know where it comes from or where it is going .
CEV	John	3	9	“ How can this be ? ” Nicodemus asked .
CEV	John	3	10	Jesus replied : How can you be a teacher of Israel and not know these things ?
CEV	John	3	11	I tell you for certain we know what we are talking about because we have seen it ourselves . But none of you will accept what we say .
CEV	John	3	12	( A ) If you do n't believe when I talk to you about things on earth , how can you possibly believe if I talk to you about things in heaven ?
CEV	John	3	13	( B ) No one has gone up to heaven except the Son of Man , who came down from there .
CEV	John	3	14	( C ) And the Son of Man must be lifted up , just as the metal snake was lifted up by Moses in the desert . [ b ]
CEV	John	3	15	Then everyone who has faith in the Son of Man will have eternal life .
CEV	John	3	16	God loved the people of this world so much that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who has faith in him will have eternal life and never really die .
CEV	John	3	17	God did not send his Son into the world to condemn its people . He sent him to save them !
CEV	John	3	18	No one who has faith in God 's Son will be condemned . But everyone who does n't have faith in him has already been condemned for not having faith in God 's only Son .
CEV	John	3	19	The light has come into the world , and people who do evil things are judged guilty because they love the dark more than the light .
CEV	John	3	20	People who do evil hate the light and wo n't come to the light , because it clearly shows what they have done .
CEV	John	3	21	But everyone who lives by the truth will come to the light , because they want others to know that God is really the one doing what they do . Jesus and John the Baptist
CEV	John	3	22	Later , Jesus and his disciples went to Judea , where he stayed with them for a while and was baptizing people . 23-24 ( D ) John had not yet been put in jail . He was at Aenon near Salim , where there was a lot of water , and people were coming there for John to baptize them .
CEV	John	3	25	John 's followers got into an argument with a Jewish man [ c ] about a ceremony of washing . [ d ]
CEV	John	3	26	They went to John and said , “ Rabbi , you spoke about a man when you were with him east of the Jordan . He is now baptizing people , and everyone is going to him. ”
CEV	John	3	27	John replied : No one can do anything unless God in heaven allows it .
CEV	John	3	28	( E ) You surely remember how I told you that I am not the Messiah . I am only the one sent ahead of him .
CEV	John	3	29	At a wedding the groom is the one who gets married . The best man is glad just to be there and to hear the groom 's voice . That 's why I am so glad .
CEV	John	3	30	Jesus must become more important , while I become less important . The One Who Comes from Heaven
CEV	John	3	31	God 's Son comes from heaven and is above all others . Everyone who comes from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things . The one who comes from heaven is above all others .
CEV	John	3	32	He speaks about what he has seen and heard , and yet no one believes him .
CEV	John	3	33	But everyone who does believe him has shown that God is truthful .
CEV	John	3	34	The Son was sent to speak God 's message , and he has been given the full power of God 's Spirit .
CEV	John	3	35	( F ) The Father loves the Son and has given him everything .
CEV	John	3	36	Everyone who has faith in the Son has eternal life . But no one who rejects him will ever share in that life , and God will be angry with them forever .

CEV	John	4	4	This time he had to go through Samaria ,
CEV	John	4	2	But Jesus ' disciples were really the ones doing the baptizing , and not Jesus himself . Jesus and the Samaritan Woman
CEV	John	4	3	Jesus left Judea and started for Galilee again .
CEV	John	4	5	( A ) and on his way he came to the town of Sychar . It was near the field that Jacob had long ago given to his son Joseph . 6-8 The well that Jacob had dug was still there , and Jesus sat down beside it because he was tired from traveling . It was noon , and after Jesus ' disciples had gone into town to buy some food , a Samaritan woman came to draw water from the well . Jesus asked her , “ Would you please give me a drink of water ? ”
CEV	John	4	9	( B ) “ You are a Jew , ” she replied , “ and I am a Samaritan woman . How can you ask me for a drink of water when Jews and Samaritans wo n't have anything to do with each other ? ” [ a ]
CEV	John	4	10	Jesus answered , “ You do n't know what God wants to give you , and you do n't know who is asking you for a drink . If you did , you would ask me for the water that gives life. ”
CEV	John	4	11	“ Sir , ” the woman said , “ you do n't even have a bucket , and the well is deep . Where are you going to get this life-giving water ?
CEV	John	4	12	Our ancestor Jacob dug this well for us , and his family and animals got water from it . Are you greater than Jacob ? ”
CEV	John	4	13	Jesus answered , “ Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again .
CEV	John	4	14	But no one who drinks the water I give will ever be thirsty again . The water I give will become in that person a flowing fountain that gives eternal life. ”
CEV	John	4	15	The woman replied , “ Sir , please give me a drink of that water ! Then I wo n't get thirsty and have to come to this well again. ”
CEV	John	4	16	Jesus told her , “ Go and bring your husband. ” 17-18 The woman answered , “ I do n't have a husband. ” “ That 's right , ” Jesus replied , “ you 're telling the truth . You do n't have a husband . You have already been married five times , and the man you are now living with is n't your husband. ”
CEV	John	4	19	The woman said , “ Sir , I can see that you are a prophet .
CEV	John	4	20	My ancestors worshiped on this mountain , [ b ] but you Jews say Jerusalem is the only place to worship. ”
CEV	John	4	21	Jesus said to her : Believe me , the time is coming when you wo n't worship the Father either on this mountain or in Jerusalem .
CEV	John	4	22	You Samaritans do n't really know the one you worship . But we Jews do know the God we worship , and by using us , God will save the world .
CEV	John	4	23	But a time is coming , and it is already here ! Even now the true worshipers are being led by the Spirit to worship the Father according to the truth . These are the ones the Father is seeking to worship him .
CEV	John	4	24	God is Spirit , and those who worship God must be led by the Spirit to worship him according to the truth .
CEV	John	4	25	The woman said , “ I know that the Messiah will come . He is the one we call Christ . When he comes , he will explain everything to us. ”
CEV	John	4	26	“ I am that one , ” Jesus told her , “ and I am speaking to you now. ”
CEV	John	4	27	The disciples returned about this time and were surprised to find Jesus talking with a woman . But none of them asked him what he wanted or why he was talking with her .
CEV	John	4	28	The woman left her water jar and ran back into town , where she said to the people ,
CEV	John	4	29	“ Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done ! Could he be the Messiah ? ”
CEV	John	4	30	Everyone in town went out to see Jesus .
CEV	John	4	31	While this was happening , Jesus ' disciples were saying to him , “ Teacher , please eat something. ”
CEV	John	4	32	But Jesus told them , “ I have food you do n't know anything about. ”
CEV	John	4	33	His disciples started asking each other , “ Has someone brought him something to eat ? ”
CEV	John	4	34	Jesus said : My food is to do what God wants ! He is the one who sent me , and I must finish the work that he gave me to do .
CEV	John	4	35	You may say there are still four months until harvest time . But I tell you to look , and you will see that the fields are ripe and ready to harvest .
CEV	John	4	36	Even now the harvest workers are receiving their reward by gathering a harvest that brings eternal life . Then everyone who planted the seed and everyone who harvests the crop will celebrate together .
CEV	John	4	37	So the saying proves true , “ Some plant the seed , and others harvest the crop. ”
CEV	John	4	38	I am sending you to harvest crops in fields where others have done all the hard work .
CEV	John	4	39	A lot of Samaritans in that town put their faith in Jesus because the woman had said , “ This man told me everything I have ever done. ”
CEV	John	4	40	They came and asked him to stay in their town , and he stayed on for two days .
CEV	John	4	41	Many more Samaritans put their faith in Jesus because of what they heard him say .
CEV	John	4	42	They told the woman , “ We no longer have faith in Jesus just because of what you told us . We have heard him ourselves , and we are certain that he is the Savior of the world ! ” Jesus Heals an Official 's Son ( Matthew 8.5-13 ; Luke 7.1-10 ) 43-44 ( C ) Jesus had said , “ Prophets are honored everywhere , except in their own country. ” Then two days later he left
CEV	John	4	45	( D ) and went to Galilee . The people there welcomed him , because they had gone to the festival in Jerusalem and had seen everything he had done .
CEV	John	4	46	( E ) While Jesus was in Galilee , he returned to the village of Cana , where he had turned the water into wine . There was an official in Capernaum whose son was sick .
CEV	John	4	47	And when the man heard that Jesus had come from Judea , he went and begged him to keep his son from dying .
CEV	John	4	48	Jesus told the official , “ You wo n't have faith unless you see miracles and wonders ! ”
CEV	John	4	49	The man replied , “ Lord , please come before my son dies ! ”
CEV	John	4	50	Jesus then said , “ Your son will live . Go on home to him. ” The man believed Jesus and started back home .
CEV	John	4	51	Some of the official 's servants met him along the road and told him , “ Your son is better ! ”
CEV	John	4	52	He asked them when the boy got better , and they answered , “ The fever left him yesterday at one o'clock. ”
CEV	John	4	53	The boy 's father realized that at one o'clock the day before , Jesus had told him , “ Your son will live ! ” So the man and everyone in his family put their faith in Jesus .
CEV	John	4	54	This was the second miracle [ c ] that Jesus worked after he left Judea and went to Galilee . Footnotes - 4.9 wo n't have anything to do with each other : Or “ wo n't use the same cups. ” The Samaritans lived in the land between Judea and Galilee .

CEV	John	5	5	Beside the pool was a man who had been sick for
CEV	John	5	2	In the city near the sheep gate was a pool with five porches , and its name in Hebrew was Bethzatha . [ b ] 3-4 Many sick , blind , lame , and paralyzed people were lying close to the pool . [ c ]
CEV	John	5	38	You have not believed his message , because you refused to have faith in the one he sent .
CEV	John	5	6	When Jesus saw the man and realized that he had been crippled for a long time , he asked him , “ Do you want to be healed ? ”
CEV	John	5	7	The man answered , “ Sir , I do n't have anyone to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up . I try to get in , but someone else always gets there first. ”
CEV	John	5	8	Jesus told him , “ Pick up your mat and walk ! ”
CEV	John	5	9	Right then the man was healed . He picked up his mat and started walking around . The day on which this happened was a Sabbath .
CEV	John	5	10	( A ) When the Jewish leaders saw the man carrying his mat , they said to him , “ This is the Sabbath ! No one is allowed to carry a mat on the Sabbath. ”
CEV	John	5	11	But he replied , “ The man who healed me told me to pick up my mat and walk. ”
CEV	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is this man that told you to pick up your mat and walk ? ”
CEV	John	5	13	But he did not know who Jesus was , and Jesus had left because of the crowd .
CEV	John	5	14	Later , Jesus met the man in the temple and told him , “ You are now well . But do n't sin anymore or something worse might happen to you. ”
CEV	John	5	15	The man left and told the leaders that Jesus was the one who had healed him .
CEV	John	5	16	They started making a lot of trouble for Jesus because he did things like this on the Sabbath .
CEV	John	5	17	But Jesus said , “ My Father has never stopped working , and this is why I keep on working. ”
CEV	John	5	18	( B ) Now the leaders wanted to kill Jesus for two reasons . First , he had broken the law of the Sabbath . But even worse , he had said God was his Father , which made him equal with God . The Son 's Authority
CEV	John	5	19	Jesus told the people : I tell you for certain the Son can not do anything on his own . He can do only what he sees the Father doing , and he does exactly what he sees the Father do .
CEV	John	5	20	The Father loves the Son and has shown him everything he does . The Father will show him even greater things , and you will be amazed .
CEV	John	5	21	Just as the Father raises the dead and gives life , so the Son gives life to anyone he wants to .
CEV	John	5	22	The Father does n't judge anyone , but he has made his Son the judge of everyone .
CEV	John	5	23	The Father wants all people to honor the Son as much as they honor him . When anyone refuses to honor the Son , this is the same as refusing to honor the Father who sent him .
CEV	John	5	24	I tell you for certain that everyone who hears my message and has faith in the one who sent me has eternal life and will never be condemned . They have already gone from death to life .
CEV	John	5	25	I tell you for certain the time will come , and it is already here , when all of the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God . And those who listen to it will live !
CEV	John	5	26	The Father has the power to give life , and he has given that same power to the Son .
CEV	John	5	27	And he has given his Son the right to judge everyone , because he is the Son of Man .
CEV	John	5	28	Do n't be surprised ! The time will come when all of the dead will hear the voice of the Son of Man ,
CEV	John	5	29	( C ) and they will come out of their graves . Everyone who has done good things will rise to life , but everyone who has done evil things will rise and be condemned .
CEV	John	5	30	I can not do anything on my own . The Father sent me , and he is the one who told me how to judge . I judge with fairness , because I obey him , and I do n't just try to please myself . Witnesses to Jesus
CEV	John	5	31	If I speak for myself , there is no way to prove I am telling the truth .
CEV	John	5	32	But there is someone else who speaks for me , and I know what he says is true .
CEV	John	5	33	( D ) You sent messengers to John , and he told them the truth .
CEV	John	5	34	I do n't depend on what people say about me , but I tell you these things so that you may be saved .
CEV	John	5	35	( E ) John was a lamp that gave a lot of light , and you were glad to enjoy his light for a while .
CEV	John	5	36	But something more important than John speaks for me . I mean the things that the Father has given me to do ! All of these speak for me and prove that the Father sent me .
CEV	John	5	37	( F ) The Father who sent me also speaks for me , but you have never heard his voice or seen him face to face .
CEV	John	5	39	( G ) You search the Scriptures , because you think you will find eternal life in them . The Scriptures tell about me ,
CEV	John	5	40	but you refuse to come to me for eternal life .
CEV	John	5	41	I do n't care about human praise ,
CEV	John	5	42	but I do know that none of you love God .
CEV	John	5	43	I have come with my Father 's authority , and you have not welcomed me . But you will welcome people who come on their own .
CEV	John	5	44	How could you possibly believe ? You like to have your friends praise you , and you do n't care about praise that the only God can give !
CEV	John	5	45	Do n't think that I will be the one to accuse you to the Father . You have put your hope in Moses , yet he is the very one who will accuse you .
CEV	John	5	46	Moses wrote about me , and if you had believed Moses , you would have believed me .
CEV	John	5	47	But if you do n't believe what Moses wrote , how can you believe what I say ?

CEV	John	6	6	He said this to test Philip , since he already knew what he was going to do .
CEV	John	6	2	A large crowd had seen him work miracles to heal the sick , and those people went with him . 3-4 It was almost time for the Jewish festival of Passover , and Jesus went up on a mountain with his disciples and sat down . [ a ]
CEV	John	6	5	When Jesus saw the large crowd coming toward him , he asked Philip , “ Where will we get enough food to feed all these people ? ”
CEV	John	6	7	Philip answered , “ Do n't you know that it would take almost a year 's wages [ b ] just to buy only a little bread for each of these people ? ”
CEV	John	6	8	Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the disciples . He spoke up and said ,
CEV	John	6	9	“ There is a boy here who has five small loaves [ c ] of barley bread and two fish . But what good is that with all these people ? ”
CEV	John	6	10	The ground was covered with grass , and Jesus told his disciples to tell everyone to sit down . About 5,000 men were in the crowd .
CEV	John	6	11	Jesus took the bread in his hands and gave thanks to God . Then he passed the bread to the people , and he did the same with the fish , until everyone had plenty to eat .
CEV	John	6	12	The people ate all they wanted , and Jesus told his disciples to gather up the leftovers , so that nothing would be wasted .
CEV	John	6	13	The disciples gathered them up and filled twelve large baskets with what was left over from the five barley loaves .
CEV	John	6	14	After the people had seen Jesus work this miracle , [ d ] they began saying , “ This must be the Prophet [ e ] who is to come into the world ! ”
CEV	John	6	15	Jesus realized that they would try to force him to be their king . So he went up on a mountain , where he could be alone . Jesus Walks on the Water ( Matthew 14.22-27 ; Mark 6.45-52 )
CEV	John	6	16	That evening , Jesus ' disciples went down to the lake .
CEV	John	6	17	They got into a boat and started across for Capernaum . Later that evening Jesus had still not come to them ,
CEV	John	6	18	and a strong wind was making the water rough .
CEV	John	6	19	When the disciples had rowed for five or six kilometers , they saw Jesus walking on the water . He kept coming closer to the boat , and they were terrified .
CEV	John	6	20	But he said , “ I am Jesus ! [ f ] Do n't be afraid ! ”
CEV	John	6	21	The disciples wanted to take him into the boat , but suddenly the boat reached the shore where they were headed . The Bread That Gives Life
CEV	John	6	22	The people who had stayed on the east side of the lake knew that only one boat had been there . They also knew that Jesus had not left in it with his disciples . But the next day
CEV	John	6	23	some boats from Tiberias sailed near the place where the crowd had eaten the bread for which the Lord had given thanks .
CEV	John	6	24	They saw that Jesus and his disciples had left . Then they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus .
CEV	John	6	25	They found him on the west side of the lake and asked , “ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ”
CEV	John	6	26	Jesus answered , “ I tell you for certain that you are not looking for me because you saw the miracles , [ g ] but because you ate all the food you wanted .
CEV	John	6	27	( A ) Do n't work for food that spoils . Work for food that gives eternal life . The Son of Man will give you this food , because God the Father has given him the right to do so. ”
CEV	John	6	28	“ What exactly does God want us to do ? ” the people asked .
CEV	John	6	29	Jesus answered , “ God wants you to have faith in the one he sent. ”
CEV	John	6	30	( see the note at 2.11 ) . - 6.31 manna : When the people of Israel were wandering through the desert , the Lord gave them a special kind of food to eat . It tasted like a wafer and was called “ manna , ” which in Hebrew means , “ What is this ? ” - 6.39 the last day : When God will judge all people . - 6.49 manna : See the note at 6.31 . - 6.71 Iscariot : This may mean “ a man from Kerioth ” ( a place in Judea ) . But more probably it means “ a man who was a liar ” or “ a man who was a betrayer. ” Copyright ©
CEV	John	6	31	( B ) For example , when our ancestors were in the desert , they were given manna [ h ] to eat . It happened just as the Scriptures say , ‘ God gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ ”
CEV	John	6	32	Jesus then told them , “ I tell you for certain that Moses was n't the one who gave you bread from heaven . My Father is the one who gives you the true bread from heaven .
CEV	John	6	33	And the bread that God gives is the one who came down from heaven to give life to the world. ”
CEV	John	6	34	The people said , “ Sir , give us this bread and do n't ever stop ! ”
CEV	John	6	35	Jesus replied : I am the bread that gives life ! No one who comes to me will ever be hungry . No one who has faith in me will ever be thirsty .
CEV	John	6	36	I have told you already that you have seen me and still do not have faith in me .
CEV	John	6	37	Everything and everyone that the Father has given me will come to me , and I wo n't turn any of them away .
CEV	John	6	38	I did n't come from heaven to do what I want ! I came to do what the Father wants me to do . He sent me ,
CEV	John	6	39	and he wants to make certain that none of the ones he has given me will be lost . Instead , he wants me to raise them to life on the last day . [ i ]
CEV	John	6	40	My Father wants everyone who sees the Son to have faith in him and to have eternal life . Then I will raise them to life on the last day .
CEV	John	6	41	The people started grumbling because Jesus had said he was the bread that had come down from heaven .
CEV	John	6	42	They were asking each other , “ Is n't he Jesus , the son of Joseph ? Do n't we know his father and mother ? How can he say that he has come down from heaven ? ”
CEV	John	6	43	Jesus told them : Stop grumbling !
CEV	John	6	44	No one can come to me , unless the Father who sent me makes them want to come . But if they do come , I will raise them to life on the last day .
CEV	John	6	45	( C ) One of the prophets wrote , “ God will teach all of them. ” And so everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him will come to me .
CEV	John	6	46	The only one who has seen the Father is the one who has come from him . No one else has ever seen the Father .
CEV	John	6	47	I tell you for certain that everyone who has faith in me has eternal life .
CEV	John	6	48	I am the bread that gives life !
CEV	John	6	49	Your ancestors ate manna [ j ] in the desert , and later they died .
CEV	John	6	50	But the bread from heaven has come down , so that no one who eats it will ever die .
CEV	John	6	51	I am that bread from heaven ! Everyone who eats it will live forever . My flesh is the life-giving bread I give to the people of this world .
CEV	John	6	52	They started arguing with each other and asked , “ How can he give us his flesh to eat ? ”
CEV	John	6	53	Jesus answered : I tell you for certain that you wo n't live unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man .
CEV	John	6	54	But if you do eat my flesh and drink my blood , you will have eternal life , and I will raise you to life on the last day .
CEV	John	6	55	My flesh is the true food , and my blood is the true drink .
CEV	John	6	56	If you eat my flesh and drink my blood , you are one with me , and I am one with you .
CEV	John	6	57	The living Father sent me , and I have life because of him . Now everyone who eats my flesh will live because of me .
CEV	John	6	58	The bread that comes down from heaven is n't like what your ancestors ate . They died , but whoever eats this bread will live forever .
CEV	John	6	59	Jesus was teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum when he said these things . The Words of Eternal Life
CEV	John	6	60	Many of Jesus ' disciples heard him and said , “ This is too hard for anyone to understand. ”
CEV	John	6	61	Jesus knew that his disciples were grumbling . So he asked , “ Does this bother you ?
CEV	John	6	62	What if you should see the Son of Man go up to heaven where he came from ?
CEV	John	6	63	( D ) The Spirit is the one who gives life ! Human strength can do nothing . The words that I have spoken to you are from that life-giving Spirit .
CEV	John	6	64	But some of you refuse to have faith in me. ” Jesus said this , because from the beginning he knew who would have faith in him . He also knew which one would betray him .
CEV	John	6	65	Then Jesus said , “ You can not come to me , unless the Father makes you want to come . That is why I have told these things to all of you. ”
CEV	John	6	66	Because of what Jesus said , many of his disciples turned their backs on him and stopped following him .
CEV	John	6	67	Jesus then asked his twelve disciples if they also were going to leave him .
CEV	John	6	68	( E ) Simon Peter answered , “ Lord , there is no one else that we can go to ! Your words give eternal life .
CEV	John	6	69	We have faith in you , and we are sure that you are God 's Holy One. ”
CEV	John	6	70	Jesus told his disciples , “ I chose all twelve of you , but one of you is a demon ! ”

CEV	John	7	2	( A ) It was almost time for the Festival of Shelters ,
CEV	John	7	3	and Jesus ' brothers said to him , “ Why do n't you go to Judea ? Then your disciples can see what you are doing .
CEV	John	7	4	No one does anything in secret , if they want others to know about them . So let the world know what you are doing ! ”

CEV	John	7	10	After Jesus ' brothers had gone to the festival , he went secretly , without telling anyone .
CEV	John	7	11	During the festival the leaders of the people looked for Jesus and asked , “ Where is he ? ”
CEV	John	7	12	The crowds even got into an argument about him . Some were saying , “ Jesus is a good man , ” while others were saying , “ He is lying to everyone. ”
CEV	John	7	13	But the people were afraid of their leaders , and none of them talked in public about him .
CEV	John	7	14	When the festival was about half over , Jesus went into the temple and started teaching .
CEV	John	7	15	The leaders were surprised and said , “ How does this man know so much ? He has never been taught ! ”
CEV	John	7	16	Jesus replied : I am not teaching something I thought up . What I teach comes from the one who sent me .
CEV	John	7	17	If you really want to obey God , you will know if what I teach comes from God or from me .
CEV	John	7	18	If I wanted to bring honor to myself , I would speak for myself . But I want to honor the one who sent me . This is why I tell the truth and not a lie .
CEV	John	7	19	Did n't Moses give you the Law ? Yet none of you obey it ! So why do you want to kill me ?
CEV	John	7	20	The crowd replied , “ You 're crazy ! What makes you think someone wants to kill you ? ”
CEV	John	7	21	Jesus answered : I worked one miracle , [ b ] and it amazed you .
CEV	John	7	22	( B ) Moses commanded you to circumcise your sons . But it was n't really Moses who gave you this command . It was your ancestors , and even on the Sabbath you circumcise your sons
CEV	John	7	23	( C ) in order to obey the Law of Moses . Why are you angry with me for making someone completely well on the Sabbath ?
CEV	John	7	24	Do n't judge by appearances . Judge by what is right .
CEV	John	7	25	Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying , “ Is n't this the man they want to kill ?
CEV	John	7	26	Yet here he is , speaking for everyone to hear . And no one is arguing with him . Do you suppose the authorities know he is the Messiah ?
CEV	John	7	27	But how could that be ? No one knows where the Messiah will come from , but we know where this man comes from. ”
CEV	John	7	28	As Jesus was teaching in the temple , he shouted , “ Do you really think you know me and where I came from ? I did n't come on my own ! The one who sent me is truthful , and you do n't know him .
CEV	John	7	29	But I know the one who sent me , because I came from him. ”
CEV	John	7	30	Some of the people wanted to arrest Jesus right then . But no one even laid a hand on him , because his time had not yet come . [ c ]
CEV	John	7	31	A lot of people in the crowd put their faith in him and said , “ When the Messiah comes , he surely wo n't perform more miracles [ d ] than this man has done ! ” Officers Sent To Arrest Jesus
CEV	John	7	32	When the Pharisees heard the crowd arguing about Jesus , they got together with the chief priests and sent some temple police to arrest him .
CEV	John	7	33	But Jesus told them , “ I will be with you a little while longer , and then I will return to the one who sent me .
CEV	John	7	34	You will look for me , but you wo n't find me . You can not go where I am going. ”
CEV	John	7	35	The people asked each other , “ Where can he go to keep us from finding him ? Is he going to some foreign country where our people live ? Is he going there to teach the Greeks ? [ e ]
CEV	John	7	36	What did he mean by saying that we will look for him , but wo n't find him ? Why ca n't we go where he is going ? ” Streams of Life-Giving Water
CEV	John	7	37	( D ) On the last and most important day of the festival , Jesus stood up and shouted , “ If you are thirsty , come to me and drink !
CEV	John	7	38	( E ) Have faith in me , and you will have life-giving water flowing from deep inside you , just as the Scriptures say. ”
CEV	John	7	39	Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit , who would be given to everyone that had faith in him . The Spirit had not yet been given to anyone , since Jesus had not yet been given his full glory . [ f ] The People Take Sides
CEV	John	7	40	When the crowd heard Jesus say this , some of them said , “ He must be the Prophet ! ” [ g ]
CEV	John	7	41	Others said , “ He is the Messiah ! ” Others even said , “ Can the Messiah come from Galilee ?
CEV	John	7	42	( F ) The Scriptures say that the Messiah will come from the family of King David . Does n't this mean that he will be born in David 's hometown of Bethlehem ? ”
CEV	John	7	43	The people started taking sides against each other because of Jesus .
CEV	John	7	44	Some of them wanted to arrest him , but no one laid a hand on him . The Leaders Refuse To Have Faith in Jesus
CEV	John	7	45	When the temple police returned to the chief priests and Pharisees , they were asked , “ Why did n't you bring Jesus here ? ”
CEV	John	7	46	They answered , “ No one has ever spoken like this man ! ”
CEV	John	7	47	The Pharisees said to them , “ Have you also been fooled ?
CEV	John	7	48	Not one of the chief priests or the Pharisees has faith in him .
CEV	John	7	49	And these people who do n't know the Law are under God 's curse anyway. ”
CEV	John	7	50	( G ) Nicodemus was there at the time . He was a member of the council , and was the same one who had earlier come to see Jesus . [ h ] He said ,
CEV	John	7	51	“ Our Law does n't let us condemn people before we hear what they have to say . We can not judge them before we know what they have done. ”
CEV	John	7	52	Then they said , “ Nicodemus , you must be from Galilee ! Read the Scriptures , and you will find that no prophet is to come from Galilee. ” A Woman Caught in Sin

CEV	John	8	8	Once again he bent over and began writing on the ground .
CEV	John	8	1	but Jesus walked out to the Mount of Olives .
CEV	John	8	2	Then early the next morning he went to the temple . The people came to him , and he sat down [ a ] and started teaching them .
CEV	John	8	3	The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses brought in a woman who had been caught in bed with a man who was n't her husband . They made her stand in the middle of the crowd .
CEV	John	8	4	Then they said , “ Teacher , this woman was caught sleeping with a man who is n't her husband .
CEV	John	8	5	( A ) The Law of Moses teaches that a woman like this should be stoned to death ! What do you say ? ”
CEV	John	8	6	They asked Jesus this question , because they wanted to test him and bring some charge against him . But Jesus simply bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger .
CEV	John	8	7	( B ) They kept on asking Jesus about the woman . Finally , he stood up and said , “ If any of you have never sinned , then go ahead and throw the first stone at her ! ”
CEV	John	8	9	The people left one by one , beginning with the oldest . Finally , Jesus and the woman were there alone .
CEV	John	8	10	Jesus stood up and asked her , “ Where is everyone ? Is n't there anyone left to accuse you ? ”
CEV	John	8	11	“ No sir , ” the woman answered . Then Jesus told her , “ I am not going to accuse you either . You may go now , but do n't sin anymore. ” [ b ] Jesus Is the Light for the World
CEV	John	8	12	( C ) Once again Jesus spoke to the people . This time he said , “ I am the light for the world ! Follow me , and you wo n't be walking in the dark . You will have the light that gives life. ”
CEV	John	8	13	( D ) The Pharisees objected , “ You are the only one speaking for yourself , and what you say is n't true ! ”
CEV	John	8	14	Jesus replied : Even if I do speak for myself , what I say is true ! I know where I came from and where I am going . But you do n't know where I am from or where I am going .
CEV	John	8	15	You judge in the same way that everyone else does , but I do n't judge anyone .
CEV	John	8	16	If I did judge , I would judge fairly , because I would not be doing it alone . The Father who sent me is here with me .
CEV	John	8	17	( E ) Your Law requires two witnesses to prove that something is true .
CEV	John	8	18	I am one of my witnesses , and the Father who sent me is the other one .
CEV	John	8	19	“ Where is your Father ? ” they asked . “ You do n't know me or my Father ! ” Jesus answered . “ If you knew me , you would know my Father. ”
CEV	John	8	20	Jesus said this while he was still teaching in the place where the temple treasures were stored . But no one arrested him , because his time had not yet come . [ c ] You Can not Go Where I Am Going
CEV	John	8	21	Jesus also told them , “ I am going away , and you will look for me . But you can not go where I am going , and you will die with your sins unforgiven. ”
CEV	John	8	22	The people asked , “ Does he intend to kill himself ? Is that what he means by saying we can not go where he is going ? ”
CEV	John	8	23	Jesus answered , “ You are from below , but I am from above . You belong to this world , but I do n't .
CEV	John	8	24	This is why I said you will die with your sins unforgiven . If you do n't have faith in me for who I am , [ d ] you will die , and your sins will not be forgiven. ”
CEV	John	8	25	“ Who are you ? ” they asked Jesus . Jesus answered , “ I am exactly who I told you at the beginning .
CEV	John	8	26	There is a lot more I could say to condemn you . But the one who sent me is truthful , and I tell the people of this world only what I have heard from him. ”
CEV	John	8	27	No one understood that Jesus was talking to them about the Father .
CEV	John	8	28	Jesus went on to say , “ When you have lifted up the Son of Man , [ e ] you will know who I am . You will also know that I do n't do anything on my own . I say only what my Father taught me .
CEV	John	8	29	The one who sent me is with me . I always do what pleases him , and he will never leave me. ”
CEV	John	8	30	After Jesus said this , many of the people put their faith in him . The Truth Will Set You Free
CEV	John	8	31	Jesus told the people who had faith in him , “ If you keep on obeying what I have said , you truly are my disciples .
CEV	John	8	32	( F ) You will know the truth , and the truth will set you free. ”
CEV	John	8	33	( G ) They answered , “ We are Abraham 's children ! We have never been anyone 's slaves . How can you say we will be set free ? ”
CEV	John	8	34	Jesus replied : I tell you for certain that anyone who sins is a slave of sin !
CEV	John	8	35	And slaves do n't stay in the family forever , though the Son will always remain in the family .
CEV	John	8	36	If the Son gives you freedom , you are free !
CEV	John	8	37	I know that you are from Abraham 's family . Yet you want to kill me , because my message is n't really in your hearts .
CEV	John	8	38	I am telling you what my Father has shown me , just as you are doing what your father has taught you . Your Father Is the Devil
CEV	John	8	39	The people said to Jesus , “ Abraham is our father ! ” Jesus replied , “ If you were Abraham 's children , you would do what Abraham did .
CEV	John	8	40	Instead , you want to kill me for telling you the truth that God gave me . Abraham never did anything like that .
CEV	John	8	41	But you are doing exactly what your father does. ” “ Do n't accuse us of having someone else as our father ! ” they said . “ We just have one father , and he is God. ”
CEV	John	8	42	Jesus answered : If God were your Father , you would love me , because I came from God and now I am here . He sent me . I did not come on my own .
CEV	John	8	43	Why ca n't you understand what I am talking about ? Ca n't you stand to hear what I am saying ?
CEV	John	8	44	( H ) Your father is the devil , and you do exactly what he wants . He has always been a murderer and a liar . There is nothing truthful about him . He speaks on his own , and everything he says is a lie . Not only is he a liar himself , but he is also the father of all lies .
CEV	John	8	45	Everything I have told you is true , and you still refuse to have faith in me .
CEV	John	8	46	Can any of you accuse me of sin ? If you can not , why wo n't you have faith in me ? After all , I am telling you the truth .
CEV	John	8	47	Anyone who belongs to God will listen to his message . But you refuse to listen , because you do n't belong to God . Jesus and Abraham
CEV	John	8	48	The people told Jesus , “ We were right to say that you are a Samaritan [ f ] and that you have a demon in you ! ”
CEV	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I do n't have a demon in me . I honor my Father , and you refuse to honor me .
CEV	John	8	50	years old ! ” they said . “ How could you have seen Abraham ? ”
CEV	John	8	51	I tell you for certain that if you obey my words , you will never die. ”
CEV	John	8	52	Then the people said , “ Now we are sure that you have a demon . Abraham is dead , and so are the prophets . How can you say that no one who obeys your words will ever die ?
CEV	John	8	53	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died , and so did the prophets . Who do you think you are ? ”
CEV	John	8	54	Jesus replied , “ If I honored myself , it would mean nothing . My Father is the one who honors me . You claim that he is your God ,
CEV	John	8	55	even though you do n't really know him . If I said I did n't know him , I would be a liar , just like all of you . But I know him , and I do what he says .
CEV	John	8	56	Your father Abraham was really glad to see me. ”
CEV	John	8	57	“ You are not even
CEV	John	8	58	Jesus answered , “ I tell you for certain that even before Abraham was , I was , and I am. ” [ g ]

CEV	John	9	9	Some of them said he was the same beggar , while others said he only looked like him . But he told them , “ I am that man. ”
CEV	John	9	2	Jesus ' disciples asked , “ Teacher , why was this man born blind ? Was it because he or his parents sinned ? ”
CEV	John	9	3	“ No , it was n't ! ” Jesus answered . “ But because of his blindness , you will see God work a miracle for him .
CEV	John	9	4	As long as it is day , we must do what the one who sent me wants me to do . When night comes , no one can work .
CEV	John	9	5	( A ) While I am in the world , I am the light for the world. ”
CEV	John	9	6	After Jesus said this , he spit on the ground . He made some mud and smeared it on the man 's eyes .
CEV	John	9	7	Then he said , “ Go wash off the mud in Siloam Pool. ” The man went and washed in Siloam , which means “ One Who Is Sent. ” When he had washed off the mud , he could see .
CEV	John	9	8	The man 's neighbors and the people who had seen him begging wondered if he really could be the same man .
CEV	John	9	10	“ Then how can you see ? ” they asked .
CEV	John	9	11	He answered , “ Someone named Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes . He told me to go and wash it off in Siloam Pool . When I did , I could see. ”
CEV	John	9	12	“ Where is he now ? ” they asked . “ I do n't know , ” he answered . The Pharisees Try To Find Out What Happened 13-14 The day when Jesus made the mud and healed the man was a Sabbath . So the people took the man to the Pharisees .
CEV	John	9	15	They asked him how he was able to see , and he answered , “ Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes . Then after I washed it off , I could see. ”
CEV	John	9	16	Some of the Pharisees said , “ This man Jesus does n't come from God . If he did , he would not break the law of the Sabbath. ” Others asked , “ How could someone who is a sinner work such a miracle ? ” [ a ] Since the Pharisees could not agree among themselves ,
CEV	John	9	17	they asked the man , “ What do you say about this one who healed your eyes ? ” “ He is a prophet ! ” the man told them .
CEV	John	9	18	But the Jewish leaders would not believe that the man had once been blind . They sent for his parents
CEV	John	9	19	and asked them , “ Is this the son that you said was born blind ? How can he now see ? ”
CEV	John	9	20	The man 's parents answered , “ We are certain that he is our son , and we know that he was born blind .
CEV	John	9	21	But we do n't know how he got his sight or who gave it to him . Ask him ! He is old enough to speak for himself. ” 22-23 The man 's parents said this because they were afraid of their leaders . The leaders had already agreed that no one was to have anything to do with anyone who said Jesus was the Messiah .
CEV	John	9	24	The leaders called the man back and said , “ Swear by God to tell the truth ! We know that Jesus is a sinner. ”
CEV	John	9	25	The man replied , “ I do n't know if he is a sinner or not . All I know is that I used to be blind , but now I can see ! ”
CEV	John	9	26	“ What did he do to you ? ” they asked . “ How did he heal your eyes ? ”
CEV	John	9	27	The man answered , “ I have already told you once , and you refused to listen . Why do you want me to tell you again ? Do you also want to become his disciples ? ”
CEV	John	9	28	The leaders insulted the man and said , “ You are his follower ! We are followers of Moses .
CEV	John	9	29	We are sure God spoke to Moses , but we do n't even know where Jesus comes from. ”
CEV	John	9	30	“ How strange ! ” the man replied . “ He healed my eyes , and yet you do n't know where he comes from .
CEV	John	9	31	We know that God listens only to people who love and obey him . God does n't listen to sinners .
CEV	John	9	32	And this is the first time in history anyone has ever given sight to someone born blind .
CEV	John	9	33	Jesus could not do anything unless he came from God. ”
CEV	John	9	34	The leaders told the man , “ You have been a sinner since the day you were born ! Do you think you can teach us anything ? ” Then they said , “ You can never come back into any of our synagogues ! ”
CEV	John	9	35	When Jesus heard what had happened , he went and found the man . Then Jesus asked , “ Do you have faith in the Son of Man ? ”
CEV	John	9	36	He replied , “ Sir , if you will tell me who he is , I will put my faith in him. ”
CEV	John	9	37	“ You have already seen him , ” Jesus answered , “ and right now he is talking with you. ”
CEV	John	9	38	The man said , “ Lord , I put my faith in you ! ” Then he worshiped Jesus .
CEV	John	9	39	Jesus told him , “ I came to judge the people of this world . I am here to give sight to the blind and to make blind everyone who can see. ”
CEV	John	9	40	When the Pharisees heard Jesus say this , they asked , “ Are we blind ? ”
CEV	John	9	41	Jesus answered , “ If you were blind , you would not be guilty . But now that you claim to see , you will keep on being guilty. ” Footnotes - 9.16 miracle : See the note at 2.11 . Copyright ©

CEV	John	10	10	A thief comes only to rob , kill , and destroy . I came so everyone would have life , and have it fully .
CEV	John	10	4	When he has led out all of his sheep , he walks in front of them , and they follow , because they know his voice .
CEV	John	10	5	The sheep will not follow strangers . They do n't recognize a stranger 's voice , and they run away .
CEV	John	10	6	Jesus told the people this story . But they did not understand what he was talking about . Jesus Is the Good Shepherd
CEV	John	10	7	Jesus said : I tell you for certain that I am the gate for the sheep .
CEV	John	10	8	Everyone who came before me was a thief or a robber , and the sheep did not listen to any of them .
CEV	John	10	9	I am the gate . All who come in through me will be saved . Through me they will come and go and find pasture .
CEV	John	10	11	( A ) I am the good shepherd , and the good shepherd gives up his life for his sheep .
CEV	John	10	12	Hired workers are not like the shepherd . They do n't own the sheep , and when they see a wolf coming , they run off and leave the sheep . Then the wolf attacks and scatters the flock .
CEV	John	10	13	Hired workers run away because they do n't care about the sheep .
CEV	John	10	14	( B ) I am the good shepherd . I know my sheep , and they know me .
CEV	John	10	15	( C ) Just as the Father knows me , I know the Father , and I give up my life for my sheep .
CEV	John	10	16	I have other sheep that are not in this sheep pen . I must also bring them together , when they hear my voice . Then there will be one flock of sheep and one shepherd .
CEV	John	10	17	The Father loves me , because I give up my life , so I may receive it back again .
CEV	John	10	18	No one takes my life from me . I give it up willingly ! I have the power to give it up and the power to receive it back again , just as my Father commanded me to do .
CEV	John	10	19	The people took sides because of what Jesus had told them .
CEV	John	10	20	Many of them said , “ He has a demon in him ! He is crazy ! Why listen to him ? ”
CEV	John	10	21	But others said , “ How could anyone with a demon in him say these things ? No one like this could give sight to a blind person ! ” Jesus Is Rejected
CEV	John	10	22	( D ) That winter , Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Temple Festival .
CEV	John	10	23	One day he was walking in the part of the temple known as Solomon 's Porch , [ a ]
CEV	John	10	24	and the people gathered all around him . They said , “ How long are you going to keep us guessing ? If you are the Messiah , tell us plainly ! ”
CEV	John	10	25	Jesus answered : I have told you , and you refused to believe me . The things I do by my Father 's authority show who I am .
CEV	John	10	26	But since you are not my sheep , you do n't believe me .
CEV	John	10	27	My sheep know my voice , and I know them . They follow me ,
CEV	John	10	28	and I give them eternal life , so that they will never be lost . No one can snatch them out of my hand .
CEV	John	10	29	( E ) My Father gave them to me , and he is greater than all others . [ b ] No one can snatch them from his hands ,
CEV	John	10	30	and I am one with the Father .
CEV	John	10	31	Once again the people picked up stones in order to kill Jesus .
CEV	John	10	32	But he said , “ I have shown you many good things my Father sent me to do . Which one are you going to stone me for ? ”
CEV	John	10	33	They answered , “ We are not stoning you because of any good thing you did . We are stoning you because you did a terrible thing . You are just a man , and here you are claiming to be God ! ”
CEV	John	10	34	( F ) Jesus replied : In your Scriptures does n't God say , “ You are gods ” ?
CEV	John	10	35	You ca n't argue with the Scriptures , and God spoke to those people and called them gods .
CEV	John	10	36	So why do you accuse me of a terrible sin for saying that I am the Son of God ? After all , it is the Father who prepared me for this work . He is also the one who sent me into the world .
CEV	John	10	37	If I do n't do as my Father does , you should not believe me .
CEV	John	10	38	But if I do what my Father does , you should believe because of that , even if you do n't have faith in me . Then you will know for certain that the Father is one with me , and I am one with the Father .
CEV	John	10	39	Again they wanted to arrest Jesus . But he escaped
CEV	John	10	40	( G ) and crossed the Jordan to the place where John had earlier been baptizing . While Jesus was there ,
CEV	John	10	41	many people came to him . They were saying , “ John did n't work any miracles , but everything he said about Jesus is true. ”
CEV	John	10	42	A lot of those people also put their faith in Jesus . Copyright ©

CEV	John	11	11	Then he told them , “ Our friend Lazarus is asleep , and I am going there to wake him up. ”
CEV	John	11	3	The sisters sent a message to the Lord and told him that his good friend Lazarus was sick .
CEV	John	11	4	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ His sickness wo n't end in death . It will bring glory to God and his Son. ”
CEV	John	11	5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and brother .
CEV	John	11	6	But he stayed where he was for two more days .
CEV	John	11	7	Then he said to his disciples , “ Now we will go back to Judea. ”
CEV	John	11	8	“ Teacher , ” they said , “ the people there want to stone you to death ! Why do you want to go back ? ”
CEV	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Are n't there twelve hours in each day ? If you walk during the day , you will have light from the sun , and you wo n't stumble .
CEV	John	11	10	But if you walk during the night , you will stumble , because you do n't have any light. ”
CEV	John	11	12	They replied , “ Lord , if he is asleep , he will get better. ”
CEV	John	11	13	Jesus really meant that Lazarus was dead , but they thought he was talking only about sleep .
CEV	John	11	14	Then Jesus told them plainly , “ Lazarus is dead !
CEV	John	11	15	I am glad I was n't there , because now you will have a chance to put your faith in me . Let 's go to him. ”
CEV	John	11	16	Thomas , whose nickname was “ Twin , ” said to the other disciples , “ Come on . Let 's go , so we can die with him. ” Jesus Brings Lazarus to Life
CEV	John	11	17	When Jesus got to Bethany , he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days .
CEV	John	11	18	Bethany was less than three kilometers from Jerusalem ,
CEV	John	11	19	and many people had come from the city to comfort Martha and Mary because their brother had died .
CEV	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus had arrived , she went out to meet him , but Mary stayed in the house .
CEV	John	11	21	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
CEV	John	11	22	Yet even now I know that God will do anything you ask. ”
CEV	John	11	23	Jesus told her , “ Your brother will live again ! ”
CEV	John	11	24	( B ) Martha answered , “ I know he will be raised to life on the last day , [ a ] when all the dead are raised. ”
CEV	John	11	25	Jesus then said , “ I am the one who raises the dead to life ! Everyone who has faith in me will live , even if they die .
CEV	John	11	26	And everyone who lives because of faith in me will never really die . Do you believe this ? ”
CEV	John	11	27	“ Yes , Lord ! ” she replied . “ I believe you are the Christ , the Son of God . You are the one we hoped would come into the world. ”
CEV	John	11	28	After Martha said this , she went and privately said to her sister Mary , “ The Teacher is here , and he wants to see you. ”
CEV	John	11	29	As soon as Mary heard this , she got up and went out to Jesus .
CEV	John	11	30	He was still outside the village where Martha had gone to meet him .
CEV	John	11	31	Many people had come to comfort Mary , and when they saw her quickly leave the house , they thought she was going out to the tomb to cry . So they followed her .
CEV	John	11	32	Mary went to where Jesus was . Then as soon as she saw him , she knelt at his feet and said , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
CEV	John	11	33	When Jesus saw that Mary and the people with her were crying , he was terribly upset
CEV	John	11	34	and asked , “ Where have you put his body ? ” They replied , “ Lord , come and you will see. ”
CEV	John	11	35	Jesus started crying ,
CEV	John	11	36	and the people said , “ See how much he loved Lazarus. ”
CEV	John	11	37	Some of them said , “ He gives sight to the blind . Why could n't he have kept Lazarus from dying ? ”
CEV	John	11	38	Jesus was still terribly upset . So he went to the tomb , which was a cave with a stone rolled against the entrance .
CEV	John	11	39	Then he told the people to roll the stone away . But Martha said , “ Lord , you know that Lazarus has been dead four days , and there will be a bad smell. ”
CEV	John	11	40	Jesus replied , “ Did n't I tell you that if you had faith , you would see the glory of God ? ”
CEV	John	11	41	After the stone had been rolled aside , Jesus looked up toward heaven and prayed , “ Father , I thank you for answering my prayer .
CEV	John	11	42	I know that you always answer my prayers . But I said this , so the people here would believe you sent me. ”
CEV	John	11	43	When Jesus had finished praying , he shouted , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
CEV	John	11	44	The man who had been dead came out . His hands and feet were wrapped with strips of burial cloth , and a cloth covered his face . Jesus then told the people , “ Untie him and let him go. ” The Plot To Kill Jesus ( Matthew 26.1-5 ; Mark 14.1,2 ; Luke 22.1,2 )
CEV	John	11	45	Many of the people who had come to visit Mary saw the things Jesus did , and they put their faith in him .
CEV	John	11	46	Others went to the Pharisees and told what Jesus had done .
CEV	John	11	47	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together and said , “ What should we do ? This man is working a lot of miracles . [ b ]
CEV	John	11	48	If we do n't stop him now , everyone will put their faith in him . Then the Romans will come and destroy our temple and our nation. ” [ c ]
CEV	John	11	49	One of the council members was Caiaphas , who was also high priest that year . He spoke up and said , “ You people do n't have any sense at all !
CEV	John	11	50	Do n't you know it is better for one person to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed ? ”
CEV	John	11	51	Caiaphas did not say this on his own . As high priest that year , he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation .
CEV	John	11	52	Yet Jesus would not die just for the Jewish nation . He would die to bring together all of God 's scattered people .
CEV	John	11	53	From that day on , the council started making plans to put Jesus to death .
CEV	John	11	54	Because of this plot against him , Jesus stopped going around in public . He went to the town of Ephraim , which was near the desert , and he stayed there with his disciples .
CEV	John	11	55	It was almost time for Passover . Many of the Jewish people who lived out in the country had come to Jerusalem to get themselves ready [ d ] for the festival .
CEV	John	11	56	They looked around for Jesus . Then when they were in the temple , they asked each other , “ You do n't think he will come here for Passover , do you ? ”
CEV	John	11	57	The chief priests and the Pharisees told the people to let them know if any of them saw Jesus . This is how they hoped to arrest him .

CEV	John	12	12	The next day a large crowd was in Jerusalem for Passover . When they heard that Jesus was coming for the festival ,
CEV	John	12	2	A meal had been prepared for Jesus . Martha was doing the serving , and Lazarus himself was there .
CEV	John	12	3	( A ) Mary took a very expensive bottle of perfume [ a ] and poured it on Jesus ' feet . She wiped them with her hair , and the sweet smell of the perfume filled the house .
CEV	John	12	4	A disciple named Judas Iscariot [ b ] was there . He was the one who was going to betray Jesus , and he asked ,
CEV	John	12	5	“ Why was n't this perfume sold for
CEV	John	12	300	silver coins and the money given to the poor ? ”
CEV	John	12	6	Judas did not really care about the poor . He asked this because he carried the moneybag and sometimes would steal from it .
CEV	John	12	7	Jesus replied , “ Leave her alone ! She has kept this perfume for the day of my burial .
CEV	John	12	8	( B ) You will always have the poor with you , but you wo n't always have me. ” A Plot To Kill Lazarus
CEV	John	12	9	A lot of people came when they heard that Jesus was there . They also wanted to see Lazarus , because Jesus had raised him from death .
CEV	John	12	10	So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus .
CEV	John	12	11	He was the reason that many of the people were turning from them and putting their faith in Jesus . Jesus Enters Jerusalem ( Matthew 21.1-11 ; Mark 11.1-11 ; Luke 19.28-40 )
CEV	John	12	13	( C ) they took palm branches and went out to greet him . [ c ] They shouted , “ Hooray ! [ d ] God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! God bless the King of Israel ! ”
CEV	John	12	14	Jesus found a donkey and rode on it , just as the Scriptures say ,
CEV	John	12	15	( D ) “ People of Jerusalem , do n't be afraid ! Your King is now coming , and he is riding on a donkey. ”
CEV	John	12	16	At first , Jesus ' disciples did not understand . But after he had been given his glory , [ e ] they remembered all this . Everything had happened exactly as the Scriptures said it would . 17-18 A crowd had come to meet Jesus because they had seen him call Lazarus out of the tomb . They kept talking about him and this miracle . [ f ]
CEV	John	12	19	But the Pharisees said to each other , “ There is nothing we can do ! Everyone in the world is following Jesus. ” Some Greeks Want To Meet Jesus
CEV	John	12	20	Some Greeks [ g ] had gone to Jerusalem to worship during Passover .
CEV	John	12	21	Philip from Bethsaida in Galilee was there too . So they went to him and said , “ Sir , we would like to meet Jesus. ”
CEV	John	12	22	Philip told Andrew . Then the two of them went to Jesus and told him . The Son of Man Must Be Lifted Up
CEV	John	12	23	Jesus said : The time has come for the Son of Man to be given his glory . [ h ]
CEV	John	12	24	I tell you for certain that a grain of wheat that falls on the ground will never be more than one grain unless it dies . But if it dies , it will produce lots of wheat .
CEV	John	12	25	( E ) If you love your life , you will lose it . If you give it up in this world , you will be given eternal life .
CEV	John	12	26	If you serve me , you must go with me . My servants will be with me wherever I am . If you serve me , my Father will honor you .
CEV	John	12	27	Now I am deeply troubled , and I do n't know what to say . But I must not ask my Father to keep me from this time of suffering . In fact , I came into the world to suffer .
CEV	John	12	28	So Father , bring glory to yourself . A voice from heaven then said , “ I have already brought glory to myself , and I will do it again ! ”
CEV	John	12	29	When the crowd heard the voice , some of them thought it was thunder . Others thought an angel had spoken to Jesus .
CEV	John	12	30	Then Jesus told the crowd , “ That voice spoke to help you , not me .
CEV	John	12	31	This world 's people are now being judged , and the ruler of this world [ i ] is already being thrown out !
CEV	John	12	32	If I am lifted up above the earth , I will make everyone want to come to me. ”
CEV	John	12	33	Jesus was talking about the way he would be put to death .
CEV	John	12	34	( F ) The crowd said to Jesus , “ The Scriptures teach that the Messiah will live forever . How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
CEV	John	12	35	Jesus answered , “ The light will be with you for only a little longer . Walk in the light while you can . Then you wo n't be caught walking blindly in the dark .
CEV	John	12	36	Have faith in the light while it is with you , and you will be children of the light. ” The People Refuse To Have Faith in Jesus After Jesus had said these things , he left and went into hiding .
CEV	John	12	37	He had worked a lot of miracles [ j ] among the people , but they were still not willing to have faith in him .
CEV	John	12	38	( G ) This happened so that what the prophet Isaiah had said would come true , “ Lord , who has believed our message ? And who has seen your mighty strength ? ”
CEV	John	12	39	The people could not have faith in Jesus , because Isaiah had also said ,
CEV	John	12	40	( H ) “ The Lord has blinded the eyes of the people , and he has made the people stubborn . He did this so that they could not see or understand , and so that they would not turn to the Lord and be healed. ”
CEV	John	12	41	Isaiah said this , because he saw the glory of Jesus and spoke about him . [ k ]
CEV	John	12	42	Even then , many of the leaders put their faith in Jesus , but they did not tell anyone about it . The Pharisees had already given orders for the people not to have anything to do with anyone who had faith in Jesus .
CEV	John	12	43	And besides , the leaders liked praise from others more than they liked praise from God . Jesus Came To Save the World
CEV	John	12	44	In a loud voice Jesus said : Everyone who has faith in me also has faith in the one who sent me .
CEV	John	12	45	And everyone who has seen me has seen the one who sent me .
CEV	John	12	46	I am the light that has come into the world . No one who has faith in me will stay in the dark .
CEV	John	12	47	I am not the one who will judge those who refuse to obey my teachings . I came to save the people of this world , not to be their judge .
CEV	John	12	48	But everyone who rejects me and my teachings will be judged on the last day [ l ] by what I have said .
CEV	John	12	49	I do n't speak on my own . I say only what the Father who sent me has told me to say .
CEV	John	12	50	I know that his commands will bring eternal life . This is why I tell you exactly what the Father has told me .

CEV	John	13	13	You call me your teacher and Lord , and you should , because that is who I am .
CEV	John	13	2	Even before the evening meal started , the devil had made Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , [ a ] decide to betray Jesus .
CEV	John	13	3	Jesus knew he had come from God and would go back to God . He also knew that the Father had given him complete power .
CEV	John	13	4	So during the meal Jesus got up , removed his outer garment , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
CEV	John	13	5	He put some water into a large bowl . Then he began washing his disciples ' feet and drying them with the towel he was wearing .
CEV	John	13	6	But when he came to Simon Peter , this disciple asked , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
CEV	John	13	7	Jesus answered , “ You do n't really know what I am doing , but later you will understand. ”
CEV	John	13	8	“ You will never wash my feet ! ” Peter replied . “ If I do n't wash you , ” Jesus told him , “ you do n't really belong to me. ”
CEV	John	13	9	Peter said , “ Lord , do n't wash just my feet . Wash my hands and my head. ”
CEV	John	13	10	Jesus answered , “ People who have bathed and are clean all over need to wash just their feet . And you , my disciples , are clean , except for one of you. ”
CEV	John	13	11	Jesus knew who would betray him . That is why he said , “ except for one of you. ”
CEV	John	13	12	( A ) After Jesus had washed his disciples ' feet and had put his outer garment back on , he sat down again . [ b ] Then he said : Do you understand what I have done ?
CEV	John	13	14	And if your Lord and teacher has washed your feet , you should do the same for each other .
CEV	John	13	15	I have set the example , and you should do for each other exactly what I have done for you .
CEV	John	13	16	( B ) I tell you for certain that servants are not greater than their master , and messengers are not greater than the one who sent them .
CEV	John	13	17	You know these things , and God will bless you , if you do them .
CEV	John	13	18	( C ) I am not talking about all of you . I know the ones I have chosen . But what the Scriptures say must come true . And they say , “ The man who ate with me has turned against me ! ”
CEV	John	13	19	I am telling you this before it all happens . Then when it does happen , you will believe who I am . [ c ]
CEV	John	13	20	( D ) I tell you for certain that anyone who welcomes my messengers also welcomes me , and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me . Jesus Tells What Will Happen to Him ( Matthew 26.20-25 ; Mark 14.17-21 ; Luke 22.21-23 )
CEV	John	13	21	After Jesus had said these things , he was deeply troubled and told his disciples , “ I tell you for certain that one of you will betray me. ”
CEV	John	13	22	They were confused about what he meant . And they just stared at each other .
CEV	John	13	23	Jesus ' favorite disciple was sitting next to him at the meal ,
CEV	John	13	24	and Simon motioned for this disciple to find out which one Jesus meant .
CEV	John	13	25	So the disciple leaned toward Jesus and asked , “ Lord , which one of us are you talking about ? ”
CEV	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ I will dip this piece of bread in the sauce and give it to the one I was talking about. ” Then Jesus dipped the bread and gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . [ d ]
CEV	John	13	27	Right then Satan took control of Judas . Jesus said , “ Judas , go quickly and do what you have to do. ”
CEV	John	13	28	No one at the meal understood what Jesus meant .
CEV	John	13	29	But because Judas was in charge of the money , some of them thought that Jesus had told him to buy something they needed for the festival . Others thought that Jesus had told him to give some money to the poor .
CEV	John	13	30	Judas took the piece of bread and went out . It was already night . The New Command
CEV	John	13	31	After Judas had gone , Jesus said : Now the Son of Man will be given glory , and he will bring glory to God .
CEV	John	13	32	Then , after God is given glory because of him , God will bring glory to him , and God will do it very soon .
CEV	John	13	33	( E ) My children , I will be with you for only a little while longer . Then you will look for me , but you wo n't find me . I tell you just as I told the people , “ You can not go where I am going. ”
CEV	John	13	34	( F ) But I am giving you a new command . You must love each other , just as I have loved you .
CEV	John	13	35	If you love each other , everyone will know that you are my disciples . Peter 's Promise ( Matthew 26.31-35 ; Mark 14.27-31 ; Luke 22.31-34 )
CEV	John	13	36	Simon Peter asked , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus answered , “ You ca n't go with me now , but later on you will. ”
CEV	John	13	37	Peter asked , “ Lord , why ca n't I go with you now ? I would die for you ! ”
CEV	John	13	38	“ Would you really die for me ? ” Jesus asked . “ I tell you for certain before a rooster crows , you will say three times that you do n't even know me. ” Footnotes - 13.2 Iscariot : See the note at 6.71 . - 13.12 sat down again : On special occasions the Jewish people followed the Greek and Roman custom of lying down on their left side and leaning on their left elbow , while eating with their right hand . - 13.19 I am : See the note at 8.24 . - 13.26 Iscariot : See the note at 6.71 .

CEV	John	14	14	I will do whatever you ask me to do . The Holy Spirit Is Promised
CEV	John	14	2	There are many rooms in my Father 's house . I would n't tell you this , unless it was true . I am going there to prepare a place for each of you .
CEV	John	14	3	After I have done this , I will come back and take you with me . Then we will be together .
CEV	John	14	4	You know the way to where I am going. ”
CEV	John	14	5	Thomas said , “ Lord , we do n't even know where you are going ! How can we know the way ? ”
CEV	John	14	6	( A ) “ I am the way , the truth , and the life ! ” Jesus answered . “ Without me , no one can go to the Father .
CEV	John	14	7	If you had really known me , you would have known the Father . But from now on , you do know him , and you have seen him. ”
CEV	John	14	8	Philip said , “ Lord , show us the Father . That is all we need. ”
CEV	John	14	9	Jesus replied : Philip , I have been with you for a long time . Do n't you know who I am ? If you have seen me , you have seen the Father . How can you ask me to show you the Father ?
CEV	John	14	10	Do n't you believe that I am one with the Father and that the Father is one with me ? What I say is n't said on my own . The Father who lives in me does these things .
CEV	John	14	11	Have faith in me when I say that the Father is one with me and that I am one with the Father . Or else have faith in me simply because of the things I do .
CEV	John	14	12	I tell you for certain that if you have faith in me , you will do the same things I am doing . You will do even greater things , now that I am going back to the Father .
CEV	John	14	13	Ask me , and I will do whatever you ask . This way the Son will bring honor to the Father .
CEV	John	14	15	( B ) Jesus said to his disciples : If you love me , you will do as I command .
CEV	John	14	16	Then I will ask the Father to send you the Holy Spirit who will help [ b ] you and always be with you .
CEV	John	14	17	The Spirit will show you what is true . The people of this world can not accept the Spirit , because they do n't see or know him . But you know the Spirit , who is with you and will keep on living in you .
CEV	John	14	18	I wo n't leave you like orphans . I will come back to you .
CEV	John	14	19	In a little while the people of this world wo n't be able to see me , but you will see me . And because I live , you will live .
CEV	John	14	20	Then you will know I am one with the Father . You will know you are one with me , and I am one with you .
CEV	John	14	21	( C ) If you love me , you will do what I have said , and my Father will love you . I will also love you and show you what I am like .
CEV	John	14	22	The other Judas , not Judas Iscariot , [ c ] then spoke up and asked , “ Lord , what do you mean by saying that you will show us what you are like , but you will not show the people of this world ? ”
CEV	John	14	23	Jesus replied : If anyone loves me , they will obey me . Then my Father will love them , and we will come to them and live in them .
CEV	John	14	24	But anyone who does n't love me , wo n't obey me . What they have heard me say does n't really come from me , but from the Father who sent me .
CEV	John	14	25	I have told you these things while I am still with you .
CEV	John	14	26	But the Holy Spirit will come and help [ d ] you , because the Father will send the Spirit to take my place . The Spirit will teach you everything and will remind you of what I said while I was with you .
CEV	John	14	27	I give you peace , the kind of peace only I can give . It is n't like the peace this world can give . So do n't be worried or afraid .
CEV	John	14	28	You have already heard me say I am going and I will also come back to you . If you really love me , you should be glad I am going back to the Father , because he is greater than I am .
CEV	John	14	29	I am telling you this before I leave , so when it does happen , you will have faith in me .
CEV	John	14	30	I can not speak with you much longer , because the ruler of this world is coming . But he has no power over me .
CEV	John	14	31	I obey my Father , so everyone in the world might know that I love him . It is time for us to go now . Copyright ©

CEV	John	15	15	Servants do n't know what their master is doing , and so I do n't speak to you as my servants . I speak to you as my friends , and I have told you everything my Father has told me .
CEV	John	15	2	He cuts away every branch of mine that does n't produce fruit . But he trims clean every branch that does produce fruit , so that it will produce even more fruit .
CEV	John	15	3	You are already clean because of what I have said to you .
CEV	John	15	4	Stay joined to me , and I will stay joined to you . Just as a branch can not produce fruit unless it stays joined to the vine , you can not produce fruit unless you stay joined to me .
CEV	John	15	5	I am the vine , and you are the branches . If you stay joined to me , and I stay joined to you , then you will produce lots of fruit . But you can not do anything without me .
CEV	John	15	6	If you do n't stay joined to me , you will be thrown away . You will be like dry branches that are gathered up and burned in a fire .
CEV	John	15	7	Stay joined to me and let my teachings become part of you . Then you can pray for whatever you want , and your prayer will be answered .
CEV	John	15	8	When you become fruitful disciples of mine , my Father will be honored .
CEV	John	15	9	I have loved you , just as my Father has loved me . So remain faithful to my love for you .
CEV	John	15	10	If you obey me , I will keep loving you , just as my Father keeps loving me , because I have obeyed him .
CEV	John	15	11	I have told you this to make you as completely happy as I am .
CEV	John	15	12	( A ) Now I tell you to love each other , as I have loved you .
CEV	John	15	13	The greatest way to show love for friends is to die for them .
CEV	John	15	14	And you are my friends , if you obey me .
CEV	John	15	16	You did not choose me . I chose you and sent you out to produce fruit , the kind of fruit that will last . Then my Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name . [ a ]
CEV	John	15	17	So I command you to love each other . The World 's Hatred
CEV	John	15	18	If the people of this world [ b ] hate you , just remember that they hated me first .
CEV	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world , its people would love you . But you do n't belong to the world . I have chosen you to leave the world behind , and this is why its people hate you .
CEV	John	15	20	( B ) Remember how I told you that servants are not greater than their master . So if people mistreat me , they will mistreat you . If they do what I say , they will do what you say .
CEV	John	15	21	People will do to you exactly what they did to me . They will do it because you belong to me , and they do n't know the one who sent me .
CEV	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin . But now they have no excuse for their sin .
CEV	John	15	23	Everyone who hates me also hates my Father .
CEV	John	15	24	I have done things no one else has ever done . If they had not seen me do these things , they would not be guilty . But they did see me do these things , and they still hate me and my Father too .
CEV	John	15	25	( C ) This is why the Scriptures are true when they say , “ People hated me for no reason. ”
CEV	John	15	26	I will send you the Spirit who comes from the Father and shows what is true . The Spirit will help [ c ] you and will tell you about me .
CEV	John	15	27	Then you will also tell others about me , because you have been with me from the beginning . Copyright ©

CEV	John	16	3	They will do these things because they do n't know either the Father or me .
CEV	John	16	4	I am saying this to you now , so that when the time comes , you will remember what I have said . The Work of the Holy Spirit I was with you at the first , and so I did n't tell you these things .
CEV	John	16	5	But now I am going back to the Father who sent me , and none of you asks me where I am going .
CEV	John	16	6	You are very sad from hearing all of this .
CEV	John	16	7	But I tell you I am going to do what is best for you . This is why I am going away . The Holy Spirit can not come to help [ a ] you until I leave . But after I am gone , I will send the Spirit to you .
CEV	John	16	8	The Spirit will come and show the people of this world the truth about sin and God 's justice and the judgment .
CEV	John	16	9	The Spirit will show them that they are wrong about sin , because they did n't have faith in me .
CEV	John	16	10	They are wrong about God 's justice , because I am going to the Father , and you wo n't see me again .
CEV	John	16	11	And they are wrong about the judgment , because God has already judged the ruler of this world .
CEV	John	16	12	I have much more to say to you , but right now it would be more than you could understand .
CEV	John	16	13	( A ) The Spirit shows what is true and will come and guide you into the full truth . The Spirit does n't speak on his own . He will tell you only what he has heard from me , and he will let you know what is going to happen .
CEV	John	16	14	The Spirit will bring glory to me by taking my message and telling it to you .
CEV	John	16	15	Everything the Father has is mine . This is why I have said that the Spirit takes my message and tells it to you . Sorrow Will Turn into Joy
CEV	John	16	17	They said to each other , “ What does Jesus mean by saying that for a little while we wo n't see him , but after a while we will see him ? What does he mean by saying he is going to the Father ?
CEV	John	16	18	What is this ‘ little while ’ that he is talking about ? We do n't know what he means. ”
CEV	John	16	19	Jesus knew they had some questions , so he said : You are wondering what I meant when I said that for a little while you wo n't see me , but after a while you will see me .
CEV	John	16	20	I tell you for certain that you will cry and be sad , but the world will be happy . You will be sad , but later you will be happy .
CEV	John	16	21	When a woman is about to give birth , she is in great pain . But after it is all over , she forgets the pain and is happy , because she has brought a child into the world .
CEV	John	16	22	You are now very sad . But later I will see you , and you will be so happy that no one will be able to change the way you feel .
CEV	John	16	23	When that time comes , you wo n't have to ask me about anything . I tell you for certain the Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name .
CEV	John	16	24	You have not asked for anything in this way before , but now you must ask in my name . [ b ] Then it will be given to you , so you will be completely happy .
CEV	John	16	25	I have used examples to explain to you what I have been talking about . But the time will come when I will speak to you plainly about the Father and will no longer use examples like these .
CEV	John	16	26	You will ask the Father in my name , [ c ] and I wo n't have to ask him for you .
CEV	John	16	27	God the Father loves you because you love me , and you believe I have come from him .
CEV	John	16	28	I came from the Father into the world , but I am leaving the world and returning to the Father .
CEV	John	16	29	The disciples said , “ Now you are speaking plainly to us ! You are not using examples .
CEV	John	16	30	At last we know that you understand everything , and we do n't have any more questions . Now we believe you truly have come from God. ”
CEV	John	16	31	Jesus replied : Do you really believe me ?
CEV	John	16	32	The time will come and is already here when all of you will be scattered . Each of you will go back home and leave me by myself . But the Father will be with me , and I wo n't be alone .
CEV	John	16	33	I have told you this , so that you might have peace in your hearts because of me . While you are in the world , you will have to suffer . But cheer up ! I have defeated the world . [ d ] Copyright ©

CEV	John	17	17	Your word is the truth . So let this truth make them completely yours .
CEV	John	17	2	And you gave him power over all people , so he would give eternal life to everyone you give him .
CEV	John	17	3	( A ) Eternal life is to know you , the only true God , and to know Jesus Christ , the one you sent .
CEV	John	17	4	I have brought glory to you here on earth by doing everything you gave me to do .
CEV	John	17	5	Now , Father , give me back the glory I had with you before the world was created .
CEV	John	17	6	You have given me some followers from this world , and I have shown them what you are like . They were yours , but you gave them to me , and they have obeyed you .
CEV	John	17	7	They know that you gave me everything I have .
CEV	John	17	8	I told my followers what you told me , and they accepted it . They know I came from you , and they believe you are the one who sent me .
CEV	John	17	9	I am praying for them , but not for those who belong to this world . [ a ] My followers belong to you , and I am praying for them .
CEV	John	17	10	All I have is yours , and all you have is mine , and they will bring glory to me .
CEV	John	17	11	Holy Father , I am no longer in the world . I am coming to you , but my followers are still in the world . So keep them safe by the power of the name you have given me . Then they will be one with each other , just as you and I are one .
CEV	John	17	12	( B ) While I was with them , I kept them safe by the power you have given me . I guarded them , and not one of them was lost , except the one who had to be lost . This happened so that what the Scriptures say would come true .
CEV	John	17	13	I am on my way to you . But I say these things while I am still in the world , so my followers will have the same complete joy that I do .
CEV	John	17	14	I have told them your message . But the people of this world hate them , because they do n't belong to this world , just as I do n't .
CEV	John	17	15	Father , I do n't ask you to take my followers out of the world , but keep them safe from the evil one .
CEV	John	17	16	They do n't belong to this world , and neither do I .
CEV	John	17	18	I am sending them into the world , just as you sent me .
CEV	John	17	19	I have given myself completely for their sake , so they may belong completely to the truth .
CEV	John	17	20	I am not praying just for these followers . I am also praying for everyone else who will have faith because of what my followers will say about me .
CEV	John	17	21	I want all of them to be one with each other , just as I am one with you and you are one with me . I also want them to be one with us . Then the people of this world will believe that you sent me .
CEV	John	17	22	I have honored my followers in the same way you honored me , in order that they may be one with each other , just as we are one .
CEV	John	17	23	I am one with them , and you are one with me , so they may become completely one . Then this world 's people will know that you sent me . They will know that you love my followers as much as you love me .
CEV	John	17	24	Father , I want everyone you have given me to be with me , wherever I am . Then they will see the glory you have given me , because you loved me before the world was created .
CEV	John	17	25	Good Father , the people of this world do n't know you . But I know you , and my followers know that you sent me .
CEV	John	17	26	I told them what you are like , and I will tell them even more . Then the love you have for me will become part of them , and I will be one with them . Footnotes - 17.9 world : See the note at 12.31 . Copyright ©

CEV	John	18	18	It was cold , and the servants and temple police had made a charcoal fire . They were warming themselves around it , when Peter went over and stood near the fire to warm himself . Jesus Is Questioned by the High Priest ( Matthew 26.59-66 ; Mark 14.55-64 ; Luke 22.66-71 )
CEV	John	18	2	Jesus had often met there with his disciples , and Judas knew where the place was . 3-5 Judas had promised to betray Jesus . So he went to the garden with some Roman soldiers and temple police , who had been sent by the chief priests and the Pharisees . They carried torches , lanterns , and weapons . Jesus already knew everything that was going to happen , but he asked , “ Who are you looking for ? ” They answered , “ We are looking for Jesus from Nazareth ! ” Jesus told them , “ I am Jesus ! ” [ b ]
CEV	John	18	6	At once they all backed away and fell to the ground .
CEV	John	18	7	Jesus again asked , “ Who are you looking for ? ” “ We are looking for Jesus from Nazareth , ” they answered .
CEV	John	18	8	This time Jesus replied , “ I have already told you that I am Jesus . If I am the one you are looking for , let these others go .
CEV	John	18	9	Then everything will happen , just as I said , ‘ I did not lose anyone you gave me. ’ ”
CEV	John	18	10	Simon Peter had brought along a sword . He pulled it out and struck at Malchus , the servant of the high priest , cutting off his right ear .
CEV	John	18	11	( A ) Jesus told Peter , “ Put your sword away . I must drink from the cup [ c ] that the Father has given me. ” Jesus Is Brought to Annas ( Matthew 26.57,58 ; Mark 14.53,54 ; Luke 22.54 )
CEV	John	18	12	The Roman officer and his men , together with the temple police , arrested Jesus and tied him up .
CEV	John	18	13	They took him first to Annas , who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest that year .
CEV	John	18	14	( B ) This was the same Caiaphas who had told the Jewish leaders , “ It is better if one person dies for the people. ” Peter Says He Does n't Know Jesus ( Matthew 26.69,70 ; Mark 14.66-68 ; Luke 22.55-57 )
CEV	John	18	15	Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus . That disciple knew the high priest , and he followed Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest 's house .
CEV	John	18	16	Peter stayed outside near the gate . But the other disciple came back out and spoke to the girl at the gate . She let Peter go in ,
CEV	John	18	17	but asked him , “ Are n't you one of that man 's followers ? ” “ No , I am not ! ” Peter answered .
CEV	John	18	19	The high priest questioned Jesus about his followers and his teaching .
CEV	John	18	20	But Jesus told him , “ I have spoken freely in front of everyone . And I have always taught in our synagogues and in the temple , where all of our people come together . I have not said anything in secret .
CEV	John	18	21	Why are you questioning me ? Why do n't you ask the people who heard me ? They know what I have said. ”
CEV	John	18	22	As soon as Jesus said this , one of the temple police hit him and said , “ That 's no way to talk to the high priest ! ”
CEV	John	18	23	Jesus answered , “ If I have done something wrong , say so . But if not , why did you hit me ? ”
CEV	John	18	24	Jesus was still tied up , and Annas sent him to Caiaphas the high priest . Peter Again Denies that He Knows Jesus ( Matthew 26.71-75 ; Mark 14.69-72 ; Luke 22.58-62 )
CEV	John	18	25	While Simon Peter was standing there warming himself , someone asked him , “ Are n't you one of Jesus ' followers ? ” Again Peter denied it and said , “ No , I am not ! ”
CEV	John	18	26	One of the high priest 's servants was there . He was a relative of the servant whose ear Peter had cut off , and he asked , “ Did n't I see you in the garden with that man ? ”
CEV	John	18	27	Once more Peter denied it , and right then a rooster crowed . Jesus Is Tried by Pilate ( Matthew 27.1,2,11-14 ; Mark 15.1-5 ; Luke 23.1-5 )
CEV	John	18	28	It was early in the morning when Jesus was taken from Caiaphas to the building where the Roman governor stayed . But the crowd waited outside . Any of them who had gone inside would have become unclean and would not be allowed to eat the Passover meal . [ d ]
CEV	John	18	29	Pilate came out and asked , “ What charges are you bringing against this man ? ”
CEV	John	18	30	( C ) They answered , “ He is a criminal ! That 's why we brought him to you. ”
CEV	John	18	31	Pilate told them , “ Take him and judge him by your own laws. ” The crowd replied , “ We are not allowed to put anyone to death. ”
CEV	John	18	32	( D ) And so what Jesus said about his death [ e ] would soon come true .
CEV	John	18	33	Pilate then went back inside . He called Jesus over and asked , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
CEV	John	18	34	Jesus answered , “ Are you asking this on your own or did someone tell you about me ? ”
CEV	John	18	35	“ You know I 'm not a Jew ! ” Pilate said . “ Your own people and the chief priests brought you to me . What have you done ? ”
CEV	John	18	36	Jesus answered , “ My kingdom does n't belong to this world . If it did , my followers would have fought to keep me from being handed over to our leaders . No , my kingdom does n't belong to this world. ”
CEV	John	18	37	“ So you are a king , ” Pilate replied . “ You are saying that I am a king , ” Jesus told him . “ I was born into this world to tell about the truth . And everyone who belongs to the truth knows my voice. ”
CEV	John	18	38	Pilate asked Jesus , “ What is truth ? ” Jesus Is Sentenced to Death ( Matthew 27.15-31 ; Mark 15.6-20 ; Luke 23.13-25 ) Pilate went back out and said , “ I do n't find this man guilty of anything !
CEV	John	18	39	And since I usually set a prisoner free for you at Passover , would you like for me to set free the king of the Jews ? ”
CEV	John	18	40	They shouted , “ No , not him ! We want Barabbas. ” Now Barabbas was a terrorist . [ f ] Footnotes - 18.1 garden : The Greek word is usually translated “ garden , ” but probably referred to an olive orchard . - 18.3-5 I am Jesus : The Greek text has “ I am ” ( see the note at 8.24 ) . - 18.11 drink from the cup : In the Scriptures a cup is sometimes used as a symbol of suffering . To “ drink from the cup ” is to suffer . - 18.28 would have become unclean and would not be allowed to eat the Passover meal : Jewish people who came in close contact with foreigners right before Passover were not allowed to eat the Passover meal . - 18.32 about his death : Jesus had said that he would die by being “ lifted up , ” which meant that he would die on a cross . The Romans killed criminals by nailing them on a cross , but they did not let the Jews kill anyone in this way . - 18.40 terrorist : Someone who stirred up trouble against the Romans in the hope of gaining freedom for the Jewish people .

CEV	John	19	19	Pilate ordered the charge against Jesus to be written on a board and put above the cross . It read , “ Jesus of Nazareth , King of the Jews. ”
CEV	John	19	2	The soldiers made a crown out of thorn branches and put it on Jesus . Then they put a purple robe on him .
CEV	John	19	3	They came up to him and said , “ Hey , you king of the Jews ! ” They also hit him with their fists .
CEV	John	19	4	Once again Pilate went out . This time he said , “ I will have Jesus brought out to you again . Then you can see for yourselves that I have not found him guilty. ”
CEV	John	19	5	Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said , “ Here is the man ! ” [ a ]
CEV	John	19	6	When the chief priests and the temple police saw him , they yelled , “ Nail him to a cross ! Nail him to a cross ! ” Pilate told them , “ You take him and nail him to a cross ! I do n't find him guilty of anything. ”
CEV	John	19	7	The crowd replied , “ He claimed to be the Son of God ! Our law says that he must be put to death. ”
CEV	John	19	8	When Pilate heard this , he was terrified .
CEV	John	19	9	He went back inside and asked Jesus , “ Where are you from ? ” But Jesus did not answer .
CEV	John	19	10	“ Why wo n't you answer my question ? ” Pilate asked . “ Do n't you know I have the power to let you go free or to nail you to a cross ? ”
CEV	John	19	11	( A ) Jesus replied , “ If God had not given you the power , you could n't do anything at all to me . But the one who handed me over to you did something even worse. ”
CEV	John	19	12	Then Pilate wanted to set Jesus free . But the crowd again yelled , “ If you set this man free , you are no friend of the Emperor ! Anyone who claims to be a king is an enemy of the Emperor. ”
CEV	John	19	13	When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out . Then he sat down on the judge 's bench at the place known as “ The Stone Pavement. ” In Aramaic this pavement is called “ Gabbatha. ”
CEV	John	19	14	It was about noon on the day before Passover , and Pilate said to the crowd , “ Look at your king ! ”
CEV	John	19	15	“ Kill him ! Kill him ! ” they yelled . “ Nail him to a cross ! ” “ So you want me to nail your king to a cross ? ” Pilate asked . The chief priests replied , “ The Emperor is our king ! ”
CEV	John	19	16	Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be nailed to a cross . Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross ( Matthew 27.32-44 ; Mark 15.21-32 ; Luke 23.26-43 ) Jesus was taken away ,
CEV	John	19	17	and he carried his cross to a place known as “ The Skull. ” [ b ] In Aramaic this place is called “ Golgotha. ”
CEV	John	19	18	There Jesus was nailed to the cross , and on each side of him a man was also nailed to a cross .
CEV	John	19	20	The words were written in Hebrew , Latin , and Greek . The place where Jesus was taken was n't far from the city , and many of the people read the charge against him .
CEV	John	19	21	So the chief priests went to Pilate and said , “ Why did you write that he is King of the Jews ? You should have written , ‘ He claimed to be King of the Jews. ’ ”
CEV	John	19	22	But Pilate told them , “ What is written will not be changed ! ”
CEV	John	19	23	After the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross , they divided up his clothes into four parts , one for each of them . But his outer garment was made from a single piece of cloth , and it did not have any seams .
CEV	John	19	24	( B ) The soldiers said to each other , “ Let 's not rip it apart . We will gamble to see who gets it. ” This happened so the Scriptures would come true , which say , “ They divided up my clothes and gambled for my garments. ” The soldiers then did what they had decided .
CEV	John	19	25	Jesus ' mother stood beside his cross with her sister and Mary the wife of Clopas . Mary Magdalene was standing there too . [ c ]
CEV	John	19	26	When Jesus saw his mother and his favorite disciple with her , he said to his mother , “ This man is now your son. ”
CEV	John	19	27	Then he said to the disciple , “ She is now your mother. ” From then on , that disciple took her into his own home . The Death of Jesus ( Matthew 27.45-56 ; Mark 15.33-41 ; Luke 23.44-49 )
CEV	John	19	28	( C ) Jesus knew that he had now finished his work . And in order to make the Scriptures come true , he said , “ I am thirsty ! ”
CEV	John	19	29	A jar of cheap wine was there . Someone then soaked a sponge with the wine and held it up to Jesus ' mouth on the stem of a hyssop plant .
CEV	John	19	30	kilograms of spices made from myrrh and aloes . This was the same Nicodemus who had visited Jesus one night . [ f ]
CEV	John	19	31	The next day would be both a Sabbath and the Passover . It was a special day for the Jewish people , [ d ] and they did not want the bodies to stay on the crosses during this day . So they asked Pilate to break the men 's legs [ e ] and take their bodies down .
CEV	John	19	32	The soldiers first broke the legs of the other two men who were nailed there .
CEV	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus , they saw he was already dead , and they did not break his legs .
CEV	John	19	34	One of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus ' side , and blood and water came out .
CEV	John	19	35	We know this is true , because it was told by someone who saw it happen . Now you can have faith too .
CEV	John	19	36	( D ) All this happened so that the Scriptures would come true , which say , “ No bone of his body will be broken ”
CEV	John	19	37	( E ) and “ They will see the one in whose side they stuck a spear. ” Jesus Is Buried ( Matthew 27.57-61 ; Mark 15.42-47 ; Luke 23.50-56 )
CEV	John	19	38	Joseph from Arimathea was one of Jesus ' disciples . He had kept it secret though , because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders . But now he asked Pilate to let him have Jesus ' body . Pilate gave him permission , and Joseph took it down from the cross .
CEV	John	19	39	( F ) Nicodemus also came with about
CEV	John	19	40	The two men wrapped the body in a linen cloth , together with the spices , which was how the Jewish people buried their dead .
CEV	John	19	41	In the place where Jesus had been nailed to a cross , there was a garden with a tomb that had never been used .
CEV	John	19	42	The tomb was nearby , and since it was the time to prepare for the Sabbath , they were in a hurry to put Jesus ' body there . Footnotes - 19.5 “ Here is the man ! ” : Or “ Look at the man ! ” - 19.17 The Skull : The place was probably given this name because it was near a large rock in the shape of a human skull . - 19.25 Jesus ' mother stood beside his cross with her sister and Mary the wife of Clopas . Mary Magdalene was standing there too : The Greek text may also be understood to include only three women ( “ Jesus ' mother stood beside the cross with her sister , Mary the mother of Clopas . Mary Magdalene was standing there too. ” ) or merely two women ( “ Jesus ' mother was standing there with her sister Mary of Clopas , that is , Mary Magdalene. ” ) . “ Of Clopas ” may mean “ daughter of ” or “ mother of. ” - 19.31 a special day for the Jewish people : Passover could be any day of the week . But according to the Gospel of John , Passover was on a Sabbath in the year that Jesus was nailed to a cross . - 19.31 break the men 's legs : This was the way that the Romans sometimes speeded up the death of a person who had been nailed to a cross . - 19.39 Nicodemus who had visited Jesus one night : See 3.1-21 .

CEV	John	20	20	and showed them his hands and his side . When the disciples saw the Lord , they became very happy .
CEV	John	20	2	She ran to Simon Peter and to Jesus ' favorite disciple and said , “ They have taken the Lord from the tomb ! We do n't know where they have put him. ”
CEV	John	20	3	Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb .
CEV	John	20	4	They ran side by side , until the other disciple ran faster than Peter and got there first .
CEV	John	20	5	He bent over and saw the strips of linen cloth lying inside the tomb , but he did not go in .
CEV	John	20	6	When Simon Peter got there , he went into the tomb and saw the strips of cloth .
CEV	John	20	7	He also saw the piece of cloth that had been used to cover Jesus ' face . It was rolled up and in a place by itself .
CEV	John	20	8	The disciple who got there first then went into the tomb , and when he saw it , he believed .
CEV	John	20	9	At that time Peter and the other disciple did not know that the Scriptures said Jesus would rise to life .
CEV	John	20	10	So the two of them went back to the other disciples . Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene ( Mark 16.9-11 )
CEV	John	20	11	Mary Magdalene stood crying outside the tomb . She was still weeping , when she stooped down
CEV	John	20	12	and saw two angels inside . They were dressed in white and were sitting where Jesus ' body had been . One was at the head and the other was at the foot .
CEV	John	20	13	The angels asked Mary , “ Why are you crying ? ” She answered , “ They have taken away my Lord 's body ! I do n't know where they have put him. ”
CEV	John	20	14	As soon as Mary said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there . But she did not know who he was .
CEV	John	20	15	Jesus asked her , “ Why are you crying ? Who are you looking for ? ” She thought he was the gardener and said , “ Sir , if you have taken his body away , please tell me , so I can go and get him. ”
CEV	John	20	16	Then Jesus said to her , “ Mary ! ” She turned and said to him , “ Rabboni. ” The Aramaic word “ Rabboni ” means “ Teacher. ”
CEV	John	20	17	Jesus told her , “ Do n't hold on to me ! I have not yet gone to the Father . But tell my disciples I am going to the one who is my Father and my God , as well as your Father and your God. ”
CEV	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene then went and told the disciples she had seen the Lord . She also told them what he had said to her . Jesus Appears to His Disciples ( Matthew 28.16-20 ; Mark 16.14-18 ; Luke 24.36-49 )
CEV	John	20	19	The disciples were afraid of the Jewish leaders , and on the evening of that same Sunday they locked themselves in a room . Suddenly , Jesus appeared in the middle of the group . He greeted them
CEV	John	20	21	After Jesus had greeted them again , he said , “ I am sending you , just as the Father has sent me. ”
CEV	John	20	22	Then he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
CEV	John	20	23	( A ) If you forgive anyone 's sins , they will be forgiven . But if you do n't forgive their sins , they will not be forgiven. ” Jesus and Thomas
CEV	John	20	24	Although Thomas the Twin was one of the twelve disciples , he was n't with the others when Jesus appeared to them .
CEV	John	20	25	So they told him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But Thomas said , “ First , I must see the nail scars in his hands and touch them with my finger . I must put my hand where the spear went into his side . I wo n't believe unless I do this ! ”
CEV	John	20	26	A week later the disciples were together again . This time , Thomas was with them . Jesus came in while the doors were still locked and stood in the middle of the group . He greeted his disciples
CEV	John	20	27	and said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here and look at my hands ! Put your hand into my side . Stop doubting and have faith ! ”
CEV	John	20	28	Thomas replied , “ You are my Lord and my God ! ”
CEV	John	20	29	Jesus said , “ Thomas , do you have faith because you have seen me ? The people who have faith in me without seeing me are the ones who are really blessed ! ” Why John Wrote His Book
CEV	John	20	30	Jesus worked many other miracles [ a ] for his disciples , and not all of them are written in this book .
CEV	John	20	31	But these are written so that you will put your faith in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God . If you have faith in [ b ] him , you will have true life . Copyright ©

CEV	John	21	21	When Peter saw this disciple , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
CEV	John	21	2	Simon Peter , Thomas the Twin , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , and the brothers James and John , [ a ] were there , together with two other disciples .
CEV	John	21	3	( A ) Simon Peter said , “ I 'm going fishing ! ” The others said , “ We will go with you. ” They went out in their boat . But they did n't catch a thing that night .
CEV	John	21	4	Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore , but the disciples did not realize who he was .
CEV	John	21	5	Jesus shouted , “ Friends , have you caught anything ? ” “ No ! ” they answered .
CEV	John	21	6	( B ) So he told them , “ Let your net down on the right side of your boat , and you will catch some fish. ” They did , and the net was so full of fish that they could not drag it up into the boat .
CEV	John	21	7	Jesus ' favorite disciple told Peter , “ It 's the Lord ! ” When Simon heard it was the Lord , he put on the clothes he had taken off while he was working . Then he jumped into the water .
CEV	John	21	8	The boat was only about
CEV	John	21	100	meters from shore . So the other disciples stayed in the boat and dragged in the net full of fish .
CEV	John	21	9	When the disciples got out of the boat , they saw some bread and a charcoal fire with fish on it .
CEV	John	21	10	Jesus told his disciples , “ Bring some of the fish you just caught. ”
CEV	John	21	11	Simon Peter got back into the boat and dragged the net to shore . In it were
CEV	John	21	153	large fish , but still the net did not rip .
CEV	John	21	12	Jesus said , “ Come and eat ! ” But none of the disciples dared ask who he was . They knew he was the Lord .
CEV	John	21	13	Jesus took the bread in his hands and gave some of it to his disciples . He did the same with the fish .
CEV	John	21	14	This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from death . Jesus and Peter
CEV	John	21	15	When Jesus and his disciples had finished eating , he asked , “ Simon son of John , do you love me more than the others do ? ” [ b ] Simon Peter answered , “ Yes , Lord , you know I do ! ” “ Then feed my lambs , ” Jesus said .
CEV	John	21	16	Jesus asked a second time , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter answered , “ Yes , Lord , you know I love you ! ” “ Then take care of my sheep , ” Jesus told him .
CEV	John	21	17	Jesus asked a third time , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was hurt because Jesus had asked him three times if he loved him . So he told Jesus , “ Lord , you know everything . You know I love you. ” Jesus replied , “ Feed my sheep .
CEV	John	21	18	I tell you for certain that when you were a young man , you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go . But when you are old , you will hold out your hands . Then others will wrap your belt around you and lead you where you do n't want to go. ”
CEV	John	21	19	Jesus said this to tell how Peter would die and bring honor to God . Then he said to Peter , “ Follow me ! ” Jesus and His Favorite Disciple
CEV	John	21	20	( C ) Peter turned and saw Jesus ' favorite disciple following them . He was the same one who had sat next to Jesus at the meal and had asked , “ Lord , who is going to betray you ? ”
CEV	John	21	22	Jesus answered , “ What is it to you , if I want him to live until I return ? You must follow me. ”
CEV	John	21	23	So the rumor spread among the other disciples that this disciple would not die . But Jesus did not say he would not die . He simply said , “ What is it to you , if I want him to live until I return ? ”
CEV	John	21	24	This disciple is the one who told all of this . He wrote it , and we know he is telling the truth .
CEV	John	21	25	Jesus did many other things . If they were all written in books , I do n't suppose there would be room enough in the whole world for all the books . Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	1	1	From Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus . God chose me to be an apostle , and he appointed me to preach the good news
CEV	Romans	1	2	that he promised long ago by what his prophets said in the holy Scriptures . 3-4 This good news is about his Son , our Lord Jesus Christ ! As a human , he was from the family of David . But the Holy Spirit [ a ] proved that Jesus is the powerful Son of God , [ b ] because he was raised from death .
CEV	Romans	1	5	Jesus was kind to me and chose me to be an apostle , [ c ] so that people of all nations would obey and have faith .
CEV	Romans	1	6	You are some of those people chosen by Jesus Christ .
CEV	Romans	1	7	This letter is to all of you in Rome . God loves you and has chosen you to be his very own people . I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace ! A Prayer of Thanks
CEV	Romans	1	8	First , I thank God in the name of Jesus Christ for all of you . I do this because people everywhere in the world are talking about your faith .
CEV	Romans	1	9	God has seen how I never stop praying for you , while I serve him with all my heart and tell the good news about his Son .
CEV	Romans	1	10	In all my prayers , I ask God to make it possible for me to visit you .
CEV	Romans	1	11	I want to see you and share with you the same blessings that God 's Spirit has given me . Then you will grow stronger in your faith .
CEV	Romans	1	12	What I am saying is that we can encourage each other by the faith that is ours .
CEV	Romans	1	13	( A ) My friends , I want you to know that I have often planned to come for a visit . But something has always kept me from doing it . I want to win followers to Christ in Rome , as I have done in many other places . 14-15 It does n't matter if people are civilized and educated , or if they are uncivilized and uneducated . I must tell the good news to everyone . That 's why I am eager to visit all of you in Rome . The Power of the Good News
CEV	Romans	1	16	( B ) I am proud of the good news ! It is God 's powerful way of saving all people who have faith , whether they are Jews or Gentiles .
CEV	Romans	1	17	( C ) The good news tells how God accepts everyone who has faith , but only those who have faith . [ d ] It is just as the Scriptures say , “ The people God accepts because of their faith will live. ” [ e ] Everyone Is Guilty
CEV	Romans	1	18	From heaven God shows how angry he is with all the wicked and evil things that sinful people do to crush the truth .
CEV	Romans	1	19	They know everything that can be known about God , because God has shown it all to them .
CEV	Romans	1	20	( D ) God 's eternal power and character can not be seen . But from the beginning of creation , God has shown what these are like by all he has made . That 's why those people do n't have any excuse .
CEV	Romans	1	21	( E ) They know about God , but they do n't honor him or even thank him . Their thoughts are useless , and their stupid minds are in the dark .
CEV	Romans	1	22	They claim to be wise , but they are fools .
CEV	Romans	1	23	( F ) They do n't worship the glorious and eternal God . Instead , they worship idols that are made to look like humans who can not live forever , and like birds , animals , and reptiles .
CEV	Romans	1	24	So God let these people go their own way . They did what they wanted to do , and their filthy thoughts made them do shameful things with their bodies .
CEV	Romans	1	25	They gave up the truth about God for a lie , and they worshiped God 's creation instead of God , who will be praised forever . Amen .
CEV	Romans	1	26	God let them follow their own evil desires . Women no longer wanted to have sex in a natural way , and they did things with each other that were not natural .
CEV	Romans	1	27	Men behaved in the same way . They stopped wanting to have sex with women and had strong desires for sex with other men . They did shameful things with each other , and what has happened to them is punishment for their foolish deeds .
CEV	Romans	1	28	( G ) Since these people refused even to think about God , he let their useless minds rule over them . That 's why they do all sorts of indecent things .
CEV	Romans	1	29	They are evil , wicked , and greedy , as well as mean in every possible way . They want what others have , and they murder , argue , cheat , and are hard to get along with . They gossip ,
CEV	Romans	1	30	say cruel things about others , and hate God . They are proud , conceited , and boastful , always thinking up new ways to do evil . These people do n't respect their parents .
CEV	Romans	1	31	They are stupid , unreliable , and do n't have any love or pity for others .
CEV	Romans	1	32	They know God has said that anyone who acts this way deserves to die . But they keep on doing evil things , and they even encourage others to do them . Footnotes - 1.3-4 the Holy Spirit : Or “ his own spirit of holiness. ” - 1.3-4 proved that Jesus is the powerful Son of God : Or “ proved in a powerful way that Jesus is the Son of God. ” - 1.5 Jesus was kind to me and chose me to be an apostle : Or “ Jesus was kind to us and chose us to be his apostles. ” - 1.17 but only those who have faith : Or “ and faith is all that matters. ” - 1.17 The people God accepts because of their faith will live : Or “ The people God accepts will live because of their faith. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	2	2	We know that God is right to judge everyone who behaves in this way .
CEV	Romans	2	3	Do you really think God wo n't punish you , when you behave exactly like the people you accuse ?
CEV	Romans	2	4	( B ) You surely do n't think much of God 's wonderful goodness or of his patience and willingness to put up with you . Do n't you know that the reason God is good to you is because he wants you to turn to him ?
CEV	Romans	2	5	But you are stubborn and refuse to turn to God . So you are making things even worse for yourselves on that day when he will show how angry he is and will judge the world with fairness .
CEV	Romans	2	6	( C ) God will reward each of us for what we have done .
CEV	Romans	2	7	He will give eternal life to everyone who has patiently done what is good in the hope of receiving glory , honor , and life that lasts forever .
CEV	Romans	2	8	But he will show how angry and furious he can be with every selfish person who rejects the truth and wants to do evil .
CEV	Romans	2	9	All who are wicked will be punished with trouble and suffering . It does n't matter if they are Jews or Gentiles .
CEV	Romans	2	10	But all who do right will be rewarded with glory , honor , and peace , whether they are Jews or Gentiles .
CEV	Romans	2	11	( D ) God does n't have any favorites !
CEV	Romans	2	12	Those people who do n't know about God 's Law will still be punished for what they do wrong . And the Law will be used to judge everyone who knows what it says .
CEV	Romans	2	13	God accepts those who obey his Law , but not those who simply hear it .
CEV	Romans	2	14	Some people naturally obey the Law 's commands , even though they do n't have the Law .
CEV	Romans	2	15	This proves that the conscience is like a law written in the human heart . And it will show whether we are forgiven or condemned ,
CEV	Romans	2	16	when God appoints Jesus Christ to judge everyone 's secret thoughts , just as my message says . The Jews and the Law
CEV	Romans	2	17	Some of you call yourselves Jews . You trust in the Law and take pride in God .
CEV	Romans	2	18	By reading the Scriptures you learn how God wants you to behave , and you discover what is right .
CEV	Romans	2	19	You are sure that you are a guide for the blind and a light for all who are in the dark .
CEV	Romans	2	20	And since there is knowledge and truth in God 's Law , you think you can instruct fools and teach young people .
CEV	Romans	2	21	But how can you teach others when you refuse to learn ? You preach it is wrong to steal . But do you steal ?
CEV	Romans	2	22	You say people should be faithful in marriage . But are you faithful ? You hate idols , yet you rob their temples .
CEV	Romans	2	23	You take pride in the Law , but you disobey the Law and bring shame to God .
CEV	Romans	2	24	( E ) It is just as the Scriptures tell us , “ You have made foreigners say insulting things about God. ”
CEV	Romans	2	25	Being circumcised is worthwhile , if you obey the Law . But if you do n't obey the Law , you are no better off than people who are not circumcised .
CEV	Romans	2	26	In fact , if they obey the Law , they are as good as anyone who is circumcised .
CEV	Romans	2	27	So everyone who obeys the Law , but has never been circumcised , will condemn you . Even though you are circumcised and have the Law , you still do n't obey its teachings .
CEV	Romans	2	28	Just because you live like a Jew and are circumcised does n't make you a real Jew .
CEV	Romans	2	29	( F ) To be a real Jew you must obey the Law . True circumcision is something that happens deep in your heart , not something done to your body . And besides , you should want praise from God and not from humans . Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	3	3	It is true that some of them did not believe the message . But does this mean that God can not be trusted , just because they did not have faith ?
CEV	Romans	3	2	It is good in a lot of ways ! First of all , God 's messages were spoken to the Jews .
CEV	Romans	3	4	( A ) No , indeed ! God tells the truth , even if everyone else is a liar . The Scriptures say about God , “ Your words will be proven true , and in court you will win your case. ”
CEV	Romans	3	5	If our evil deeds show how right God is , then what can we say ? Is it wrong for God to become angry and punish us ? What a foolish thing to ask .
CEV	Romans	3	6	But the answer is , “ No. ” Otherwise , how could God judge the world ?
CEV	Romans	3	7	Since your lies bring great honor to God by showing how truthful he is , you may ask why God still says you are a sinner .
CEV	Romans	3	8	You might as well say , “ Let 's do something evil , so that something good will come of it ! ” Some people even claim that we are saying this . But God is fair and will judge them as well . No One Is Good
CEV	Romans	3	9	What does all this mean ? Does it mean that we Jews are better off [ a ] than the Gentiles ? No , it does n't ! Jews , as well as Gentiles , are ruled by sin , just as I have said .
CEV	Romans	3	10	( B ) The Scriptures tell us , “ No one is acceptable to God !
CEV	Romans	3	11	Not one of them understands or even searches for God .
CEV	Romans	3	12	They have all turned away and are worthless . There is n't one person who does right .
CEV	Romans	3	13	( C ) Their words are like an open pit , and their tongues are good only for telling lies . Each word is as deadly as the fangs of a snake ,
CEV	Romans	3	14	( D ) and they say nothing but bitter curses .
CEV	Romans	3	15	( E ) These people quickly become violent .
CEV	Romans	3	16	Wherever they go , they leave ruin and destruction .
CEV	Romans	3	17	They do n't know how to live in peace .
CEV	Romans	3	18	( F ) They do n't even fear God. ”
CEV	Romans	3	19	We know that everything in the Law was written for those who are under its power . The Law says these things to stop anyone from making excuses and to let God show that the whole world is guilty .
CEV	Romans	3	20	( G ) God does n't accept people simply because they obey the Law . No , indeed ! All the Law does is to point out our sin . God 's Way of Accepting People
CEV	Romans	3	21	Now we see how God does make us acceptable to him . The Law and the Prophets [ b ] tell how we become acceptable , and it is n't by obeying the Law of Moses .
CEV	Romans	3	22	( H ) God treats everyone alike . He accepts people only because they have faith in Jesus Christ .
CEV	Romans	3	23	All of us have sinned and fallen short of God 's glory .
CEV	Romans	3	24	But God treats us much better than we deserve , and because of Christ Jesus , he freely accepts us and sets us free from our sins . 25-26 ( I ) God sent Christ to be our sacrifice . Christ offered his life 's blood , so by faith in him we could come to God . And God did this to show that in the past he was right to be patient and forgive sinners . This also shows that God is right when he accepts people who have faith in Jesus .
CEV	Romans	3	27	What is left for us to brag about ? Not a thing ! Is it because we obeyed some law ? No ! It is because of faith .
CEV	Romans	3	28	We see that people are acceptable to God because they have faith , and not because they obey the Law .
CEV	Romans	3	29	Does God belong only to the Jews ? Is n't he also the God of the Gentiles ? Yes , he is !
CEV	Romans	3	30	( J ) There is only one God , and he accepts Gentiles as well as Jews , simply because of their faith .
CEV	Romans	3	31	Do we destroy the Law by our faith ? Not at all ! We make it even more powerful . Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	4	4	Money paid to workers is n't a gift . It is something they earn by working .
CEV	Romans	4	2	If he became acceptable to God because of what he did , then he would have something to brag about . But he would never be able to brag about it to God .
CEV	Romans	4	3	( A ) The Scriptures say , “ God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith in him. ”
CEV	Romans	4	5	But you can not make God accept you because of something you do . God accepts sinners only because they have faith in him .
CEV	Romans	4	6	In the Scriptures David talks about the blessings that come to people who are acceptable to God , even though they do n't do anything to deserve these blessings . David says , 7-8 ( B ) “ What a blessing when God forgives our sins and our evil deeds . What a blessing when the Lord erases our sins from his book. ”
CEV	Romans	4	9	Are these blessings meant for circumcised people or for those who are not circumcised ? Well , the Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith in him .
CEV	Romans	4	10	But when did this happen ? Was it before or after Abraham was circumcised ? Of course , it was before .
CEV	Romans	4	11	( C ) Abraham let himself be circumcised to show he had been accepted because of his faith even before he was circumcised . This makes Abraham the father of all who are acceptable to God because of their faith , even though they are not circumcised .
CEV	Romans	4	12	This also makes Abraham the father of everyone who is circumcised and has faith in God , as Abraham did before he was circumcised . The Promise Is for All Who Have Faith
CEV	Romans	4	13	( D ) God promised Abraham and his descendants that he would give them the world . This promise was n't made because Abraham had obeyed a law , but because his faith in God made him acceptable .
CEV	Romans	4	14	( E ) If Abraham and his descendants were given this promise because they had obeyed a law , then faith would mean nothing , and the promise would be worthless .
CEV	Romans	4	15	God becomes angry when his Law is broken . But where there is n't a law , it can not be broken .
CEV	Romans	4	16	( F ) Everything depends on having faith in God , so that God 's promise is assured by his gift of undeserved grace . This promise is n't only for Abraham 's descendants who have the Law . It is for all who are Abraham 's descendants because they have faith , just as he did . Abraham is the ancestor of us all .
CEV	Romans	4	17	( G ) The Scriptures say that Abraham would become the ancestor of many nations . This promise was made to Abraham because he had faith in God , who raises the dead to life and creates new things .
CEV	Romans	4	18	( H ) God promised Abraham a lot of descendants . And when it all seemed hopeless , Abraham still had faith in God and became the ancestor of many nations .
CEV	Romans	4	19	( I ) Abraham 's faith never became weak , not even when he was nearly
CEV	Romans	4	100	years old . He knew he was almost dead and that his wife Sarah could not have children .
CEV	Romans	4	20	But Abraham never doubted or questioned God 's promise . His faith made him strong , and he gave all the credit to God .
CEV	Romans	4	21	Abraham was certain that God could do what he had promised .
CEV	Romans	4	22	So God accepted him ,
CEV	Romans	4	23	just as we read in the Scriptures . But these words were not written only for Abraham .
CEV	Romans	4	24	They were written for us , since we will also be accepted because of our faith in God , who raised our Lord Jesus to life .
CEV	Romans	4	25	( J ) God gave Jesus to die for our sins , and he raised him to life , so that we would be made acceptable to God . Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	5	5	that will never disappoint us . All of this happens because God has given us the Holy Spirit , who fills our hearts with his love .
CEV	Romans	5	2	Christ has also introduced us [ b ] to God 's gift of undeserved grace on which we now take our stand . So we are happy , as we look forward to sharing in the glory of God .
CEV	Romans	5	3	But that 's not all ! We gladly suffer , [ c ] because we know that suffering helps us to endure .
CEV	Romans	5	4	And endurance builds character , which gives us a hope
CEV	Romans	5	6	Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful .
CEV	Romans	5	7	No one is really willing to die for an honest person , though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person .
CEV	Romans	5	8	But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us , even though we were sinful .
CEV	Romans	5	9	But there is more ! Now that God has accepted us because Christ sacrificed his life 's blood , we will also be kept safe from God 's anger .
CEV	Romans	5	10	Even when we were God 's enemies , he made peace with us , because his Son died for us . Yet something even greater than friendship is ours . Now that we are at peace with God , we will be saved by the life of his Son .
CEV	Romans	5	11	And in addition to everything else , we are happy because God sent our Lord Jesus Christ to make peace with us . Adam and Christ
CEV	Romans	5	12	( A ) Adam sinned , and that sin brought death into the world . Now everyone has sinned , and so everyone must die .
CEV	Romans	5	13	Sin was in the world before the Law came . But no record of sin was kept , because there was no Law .
CEV	Romans	5	14	Yet death still had power over all who lived from the time of Adam to the time of Moses . This happened , though not everyone disobeyed a direct command from God , as Adam did . In some ways Adam is like Christ who came later .
CEV	Romans	5	15	But the gift of God 's undeserved grace was very different from Adam 's sin . That one sin brought death to many others . Yet in an even greater way , Jesus Christ alone brought God 's gift of undeserved grace to many people .
CEV	Romans	5	16	There is a lot of difference between Adam 's sin and God 's gift . That one sin led to punishment . But God 's gift made it possible for us to be acceptable to him , even though we have sinned many times .
CEV	Romans	5	17	Death ruled like a king because Adam had sinned . But that can not compare with what Jesus Christ has done . God has treated us with undeserved grace , and he has accepted us because of Jesus . And so we will live and rule like kings .
CEV	Romans	5	18	( B ) Everyone was going to be punished because Adam sinned . But because of the good thing that Christ has done , God accepts us and gives us the gift of life .
CEV	Romans	5	19	Adam disobeyed God and caused many others to be sinners . But Jesus obeyed him and will make many people acceptable to God .
CEV	Romans	5	20	The Law came , so that the full power of sin could be seen . Yet where sin was powerful , God 's gift of undeserved grace was even more powerful .
CEV	Romans	5	21	Sin ruled by means of death . But God 's gift of grace now rules , and God has accepted us because of Jesus Christ our Lord . This means that we will have eternal life . Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	6	6	We know that the persons we used to be were nailed to the cross with Jesus . This was done , so our sinful bodies would no longer be the slaves of sin .
CEV	Romans	6	2	No , we should not ! If we are dead to sin , how can we go on sinning ?
CEV	Romans	6	3	Do n't you know that all who share in Christ Jesus by being baptized also share in his death ?
CEV	Romans	6	4	( A ) When we were baptized , we died and were buried with Christ . We were baptized , so we would live a new life , as Christ was raised to life by the glory of God the Father .
CEV	Romans	6	5	If we shared in Jesus ' death by being baptized , we will be raised to life with him .
CEV	Romans	6	7	We know sin does n't have power over dead people .
CEV	Romans	6	8	As surely as we died with Christ , we believe we will also live with him .
CEV	Romans	6	9	We know that death no longer has any power over Christ . He died and was raised to life , never again to die .
CEV	Romans	6	10	When Christ died , he died for sin once and for all . But now he is alive , and he lives only for God .
CEV	Romans	6	11	In the same way , you must think of yourselves as dead to the power of sin . But Christ Jesus has given life to you , and you live for God .
CEV	Romans	6	12	Do n't let sin rule your body . After all , your body is bound to die , so do n't obey its desires
CEV	Romans	6	13	or let any part of it become a slave of evil . Give yourselves to God , as people who have been raised from death to life . Make every part of your body a slave that pleases God .
CEV	Romans	6	14	Do n't let sin keep ruling your lives . You are ruled by God 's undeserved grace and not by the Law . Slaves Who Do What Pleases God
CEV	Romans	6	15	What does all this mean ? Does it mean we are free to sin , because we are ruled by God 's gift of undeserved grace and not by the Law ? Certainly not !
CEV	Romans	6	16	Do n't you know that you are slaves of anyone you obey ? You can be slaves of sin and die , or you can be obedient slaves of God and be acceptable to him .
CEV	Romans	6	17	You used to be slaves of sin . But I thank God that with all your heart you followed the example set forth in the teaching you received .
CEV	Romans	6	18	Now you are set free from sin and are slaves who please God .
CEV	Romans	6	19	I am using these everyday examples , because in some ways you are still weak . You used to let the different parts of your body be slaves of your evil thoughts . But now you must make every part of your body serve God , so that you will belong completely to him .
CEV	Romans	6	20	When you were slaves of sin , you did n't have to please God .
CEV	Romans	6	21	But what good did you receive from the things you did ? All you have to show for them is your shame , and they lead to death .
CEV	Romans	6	22	Now you have been set free from sin , and you are God 's slaves . This will make you holy and will lead you to eternal life .
CEV	Romans	6	23	Sin pays off with death . But God 's gift is eternal life given by Jesus Christ our Lord . Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	7	7	( A ) Does this mean that the Law is sinful ? Certainly not ! But if it had not been for the Law , I would not have known what sin is really like . For example , I would not have known what it means to want something that belongs to someone else , unless the Law had told me not to do this .
CEV	Romans	7	2	For example , the Law says that a man 's wife must remain his wife as long as he lives . But once her husband is dead , she is free
CEV	Romans	7	3	to marry someone else . However , if she goes off with another man while her husband is still alive , she is said to be unfaithful .
CEV	Romans	7	4	That is how it is with you , my friends . You are now part of the body of Christ and are dead to the power of the Law . You are free to belong to Christ , who was raised to life so we could serve God .
CEV	Romans	7	5	When we thought only of ourselves , the Law made us have sinful desires . It made every part of our bodies into slaves who are doomed to die .
CEV	Romans	7	6	But the Law no longer rules over us . We are like dead people , and it can not have any power over us . Now we can serve God in a new way by obeying his Spirit , and not in the old way by obeying the written Law . The Battle with Sin
CEV	Romans	7	8	It was sin that used this command as a way of making me have all kinds of desires . But without the Law , sin is dead .
CEV	Romans	7	9	Before I knew about the Law , I was alive . But as soon as I heard that command , sin came to life ,
CEV	Romans	7	10	and I died . The very command that was supposed to bring life to me , instead brought death .
CEV	Romans	7	11	( B ) Sin used this command to trick me , and because of it I died .
CEV	Romans	7	12	Still , the Law and its commands are holy and correct and good .
CEV	Romans	7	13	Am I saying something good caused my death ? Certainly not ! It was sin that killed me by using something good . Now we can see how terrible and evil sin really is .
CEV	Romans	7	14	We know that the Law is spiritual . But I am merely a human , and I have been sold as a slave to sin .
CEV	Romans	7	15	( C ) In fact , I do n't understand why I act the way I do . I do n't do what I know is right . I do the things I hate .
CEV	Romans	7	16	Although I do n't do what I know is right , I agree that the Law is good .
CEV	Romans	7	17	So I am not the one doing these evil things . The sin that lives in me is what does them .
CEV	Romans	7	18	I know that my selfish desires wo n't let me do anything that is good . Even when I want to do right , I can not .
CEV	Romans	7	19	Instead of doing what I know is right , I do wrong .
CEV	Romans	7	20	And so , if I do n't do what I know is right , I am no longer the one doing these evil things . The sin that lives in me is what does them .
CEV	Romans	7	21	The Law has shown me that something in me keeps me from doing what I know is right .
CEV	Romans	7	22	With my whole heart I agree with the Law of God .
CEV	Romans	7	23	But in every part of me I discover something fighting against my mind , and it makes me a prisoner of sin that controls everything I do .
CEV	Romans	7	24	What a miserable person I am . Who will rescue me from this body that is doomed to die ?
CEV	Romans	7	25	Thank God ! Jesus Christ will rescue me . So with my mind I serve the Law of God , although my selfish desires make me serve the law of sin . Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	8	8	If we follow our desires , we can not please God .
CEV	Romans	8	2	The Holy Spirit will give you life that comes from Christ Jesus and will set you [ a ] free from sin and death .
CEV	Romans	8	3	The Law of Moses can not do this , because our selfish desires make the Law weak . But God set you free when he sent his own Son to be like us sinners and to be a sacrifice for our sin . God used Christ 's body to condemn sin .
CEV	Romans	8	4	He did this , so that we would do what the Law commands by obeying the Spirit instead of our own desires .
CEV	Romans	8	5	People who are ruled by their desires think only of themselves . Everyone who is ruled by the Holy Spirit thinks about spiritual things .
CEV	Romans	8	6	If our minds are ruled by our desires , we will die . But if our minds are ruled by the Spirit , we will have life and peace .
CEV	Romans	8	7	Our desires fight against God , because they do not and can not obey God 's laws .
CEV	Romans	8	9	You are no longer ruled by your desires , but by God 's Spirit , who lives in you . People who do n't have the Spirit of Christ in them do n't belong to him .
CEV	Romans	8	10	But Christ lives in you . So you are alive because God has accepted you , even though your bodies must die because of your sins .
CEV	Romans	8	11	( A ) Yet God raised Jesus to life ! God 's Spirit now lives in you , and he will raise you to life by his Spirit .
CEV	Romans	8	12	My dear friends , we must not live to satisfy our desires .
CEV	Romans	8	13	If you do , you will die . But you will live , if by the help of God 's Spirit you say “ No ” to your desires .
CEV	Romans	8	14	Only those people who are led by God 's Spirit are his children .
CEV	Romans	8	15	( B ) ( C ) God 's Spirit does n't make us slaves who are afraid of him . Instead , we become his children and call him our Father . [ b ]
CEV	Romans	8	16	God 's Spirit makes us sure that we are his children .
CEV	Romans	8	17	His Spirit lets us know that together with Christ we will be given what God has promised . We will also share in the glory of Christ , because we have suffered with him . A Wonderful Future for God 's People
CEV	Romans	8	18	( D ) I am sure what we are suffering now can not compare with the glory that will be shown to us .
CEV	Romans	8	19	In fact , all creation is eagerly waiting for God to show who his children are .
CEV	Romans	8	20	( E ) Meanwhile , creation is confused , but not because it wants to be confused . God made it this way in the hope
CEV	Romans	8	21	that creation would be set free from decay and would share in the glorious freedom of his children .
CEV	Romans	8	22	We know that all creation is still groaning and is in pain , like a woman about to give birth .
CEV	Romans	8	23	( F ) The Spirit makes us sure about what we will be in the future . But now we groan silently , while we wait for God to show that we are his children . [ c ] This means that our bodies will also be set free .
CEV	Romans	8	24	And this hope is what saves us . But if we already have what we hope for , there is no need to keep on hoping .
CEV	Romans	8	25	However , we hope for something we have not yet seen , and we patiently wait for it .
CEV	Romans	8	26	In certain ways we are weak , but the Spirit is here to help us . For example , when we do n't know what to pray for , the Spirit prays for us in ways that can not be put into words .
CEV	Romans	8	27	( G ) All of our thoughts are known to God . He can understand what is in the mind of the Spirit , as the Spirit prays for God 's people .
CEV	Romans	8	28	We know that God is always at work for the good of everyone who loves him . [ d ] They are the ones God has chosen for his purpose ,
CEV	Romans	8	29	and he has always known who his chosen ones would be . He had decided to let them become like his own Son , so his Son would be the first of many children .
CEV	Romans	8	30	God then accepted the people he had already decided to choose , and he has shared his glory with them . God 's Love
CEV	Romans	8	31	What can we say about all this ? If God is on our side , can anyone be against us ?
CEV	Romans	8	32	God did not keep back his own Son , but he gave him for us . If God did this , wo n't he freely give us everything else ?
CEV	Romans	8	33	If God says his chosen ones are acceptable to him , can anyone bring charges against them ?
CEV	Romans	8	34	Or can anyone condemn them ? No indeed ! Christ died and was raised to life , and now he is at God 's right side , [ e ] speaking to him for us .
CEV	Romans	8	35	Can anything separate us from the love of Christ ? Can trouble , suffering , and hard times , or hunger and nakedness , or danger and death ?
CEV	Romans	8	36	( H ) It is exactly as the Scriptures say , “ For you we face death all day long . We are like sheep on their way to be butchered. ”
CEV	Romans	8	37	In everything we have won more than a victory because of Christ who loves us .
CEV	Romans	8	38	I am sure that nothing can separate us from God 's love—not life or death , not angels or spirits , not the present or the future ,
CEV	Romans	8	39	and not powers above or powers below . Nothing in all creation can separate us from God 's love for us in Christ Jesus our Lord ! Footnotes - 8.2 you : Some manuscripts have “ me. ” - 8.15 our Father : The Greek text uses the Aramaic word “ Abba ” ( meaning “ father ” ) , which shows the close relation between the children and their father . - 8.23 to show that we are his children : These words are not in some manuscripts . The translation of the remainder of the verse would then read , “ while we wait for God to set our bodies free. ” - 8.28 God is always at work for the good of everyone who loves him : Or “ All things work for the good of everyone who loves God ” or “ God 's Spirit always works for the good of everyone who loves God. ” - 8.34 right side : The place of power and honor .

CEV	Romans	9	9	( C ) Sarah , “ At this time next year I will return , and you will already have a son. ”
CEV	Romans	9	2	my heart is broken and I am in great sorrow .
CEV	Romans	9	3	I would gladly be placed under God 's curse and be separated from Christ for the good of my own people .
CEV	Romans	9	4	( A ) They are the descendants of Israel , and they are also God 's chosen people . God showed them his glory . He made agreements with them and gave them his Law . The temple is theirs and so are the promises that God made to them .
CEV	Romans	9	5	They have those famous ancestors , who were also the ancestors of the Christ . [ a ] I pray that God , who rules over all , will be praised forever ! [ b ] Amen .
CEV	Romans	9	6	It can not be said that God broke his promise . After all , not all of the people of Israel are the true people of God . 7-8 ( B ) In fact , when God made the promise to Abraham , he meant only Abraham 's descendants by his son Isaac . God was talking only about Isaac when he promised
CEV	Romans	9	10	Do n't forget what happened to the twin sons of Isaac and Rebekah . 11-12 ( D ) Even before they were born or had done anything good or bad , the Lord told Rebekah that her older son would serve the younger one . The Lord said this to show he makes his own choices and it was n't because of anything either of them had done .
CEV	Romans	9	13	( E ) That 's why the Scriptures say that the Lord liked Jacob more than Esau .
CEV	Romans	9	14	Are we saying God is unfair ? Certainly not !
CEV	Romans	9	15	( F ) The Lord told Moses that he has pity and mercy on anyone he wants to .
CEV	Romans	9	16	Everything then depends on God 's mercy and not on what people want or do .
CEV	Romans	9	17	( G ) In the Scriptures the Lord says to the king of Egypt , “ I let you become king , so that I could show you my power and be praised by all people on earth. ”
CEV	Romans	9	18	Everything depends on what God decides to do , and he can either have pity on people or make them stubborn . God 's Anger and Mercy
CEV	Romans	9	19	Someone may ask , “ How can God blame us , if he makes us behave in the way he wants us to ? ”
CEV	Romans	9	20	( H ) But , my friend , I ask , “ Who do you think you are to question God ? Does the clay have the right to ask the potter why he shaped it the way he did ?
CEV	Romans	9	21	( I ) Does n't a potter have the right to make a fancy bowl and a plain bowl out of the same lump of clay ? ”
CEV	Romans	9	22	( J ) God wanted to show his anger and reveal his power against everyone who deserved to be destroyed . But instead , he patiently put up with them .
CEV	Romans	9	23	He did this by showing how glorious he is when he has pity on the people he has chosen to share in his glory .
CEV	Romans	9	24	Whether Jews or Gentiles , we are those chosen ones ,
CEV	Romans	9	25	( K ) just as the Lord says in the book of Hosea , “ Although they are not my people , I will make them my people . I will treat with love those nations that have never been loved .
CEV	Romans	9	26	( L ) “ Once they were told , ‘ You are not my people. ’ But in that very place they will be called children of the living God. ”
CEV	Romans	9	27	( M ) And this is what the prophet Isaiah said about the people of Israel , “ The people of Israel are as many as the grains of sand along the beach . But only a few who are left will be saved .
CEV	Romans	9	28	The Lord will be quick and sure to do on earth what he has warned he will do. ”
CEV	Romans	9	29	( N ) Isaiah also said , “ If the Lord All-Powerful had not spared some of our descendants , we would have been destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. ” [ c ] Israel and the Good News
CEV	Romans	9	30	What does all of this mean ? It means that the Gentiles were not trying to be acceptable to God , but they found that he would accept them if they had faith . 31-32 It also means that the people of Israel were not acceptable to God . And why not ? It was because they were trying [ d ] to be acceptable by obeying the Law instead of by having faith in God . The people of Israel fell over the stone that makes people stumble ,
CEV	Romans	9	33	( O ) just as God says in the Scriptures , “ Look ! I am placing in Zion a stone to make people stumble and fall . But those who have faith in that one will never be disappointed. ” Footnotes - 9.5 Christ : Or “ Messiah. ” - 9.5 Christ . I pray that God , who rules over all , will be praised forever : Or “ Christ , who rules over all . I pray that God will be praised forever ” or “ Christ . And I pray that Christ , who is God and rules over all , will be praised forever. ” - 9.29 Sodom and Gomorrah : During the time of Abraham the Lord destroyed these two cities because their people were so sinful . - 9.31,32 because they were trying : Or “ while they were trying ” or “ even though they were trying. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	10	10	God will accept you and save you , if you truly believe this and tell it to others .
CEV	Romans	10	2	I know they love God , but they do n't understand
CEV	Romans	10	3	what makes people acceptable to him . So they refuse to trust God , and they try to be acceptable by obeying the Law .
CEV	Romans	10	4	But Christ makes the Law no longer necessary [ a ] for those who become acceptable to God by faith . Anyone Can Be Saved
CEV	Romans	10	5	( A ) Moses said a person could become acceptable to God by obeying the Law . He did this when he wrote , “ If you want to live , you must do all the Law commands. ”
CEV	Romans	10	6	( B ) But people whose faith makes them acceptable to God will never ask , “ Who will go up to heaven to bring Christ down ? ”
CEV	Romans	10	7	Neither will they ask , “ Who will go down into the world of the dead to raise him to life ? ”
CEV	Romans	10	8	All who are acceptable because of their faith simply say , “ The message is as near as your mouth or your heart. ” And this is the same message we preach about faith .
CEV	Romans	10	9	So you will be saved , if you honestly say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” and if you believe with all your heart that God raised him from death .
CEV	Romans	10	11	( C ) The Scriptures say no one who has faith will be disappointed ,
CEV	Romans	10	12	no matter if that person is a Jew or a Gentile . There is only one Lord , and he is generous to everyone who asks for his help .
CEV	Romans	10	13	( D ) All who call out to the Lord will be saved .
CEV	Romans	10	14	How can people have faith in the Lord and ask him to save them , if they have never heard about him ? And how can they hear , unless someone tells them ?
CEV	Romans	10	15	( E ) And how can anyone tell them without being sent by the Lord ? The Scriptures say it is a beautiful sight to see even the feet of someone coming to preach the good news .
CEV	Romans	10	16	( F ) Yet not everyone has believed the message . For example , the prophet Isaiah asked , “ Lord , has anyone believed what we said ? ”
CEV	Romans	10	17	No one can have faith without hearing the message about Christ .
CEV	Romans	10	18	( G ) But am I saying that the people of Israel did not hear ? No , I am not ! The Scriptures say , “ The message was told everywhere on earth . It was announced all over the world. ”
CEV	Romans	10	19	( H ) Did the people of Israel understand or not ? Moses answered this question when he told that the Lord had said , “ I will make Israel jealous of people who are a nation of nobodies . I will make them angry with people who do n't understand a thing. ”
CEV	Romans	10	20	( I ) Isaiah was fearless enough to tell that the Lord had said , “ I was found by people who were not looking for me . I appeared to the ones who were not asking about me. ”
CEV	Romans	10	21	( J ) And Isaiah said about the people of Israel , “ All day long the Lord has reached out to people who are stubborn and refuse to obey. ” Footnotes - 10.4 But Christ makes the Law no longer necessary : Or “ But Christ gives the full meaning to the Law. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	11	11	Do I mean that the people of Israel fell , never to get up again ? Certainly not ! Their failure made it possible for the Gentiles to be saved , and this will make the people of Israel jealous .
CEV	Romans	11	2	God did not turn his back on his chosen people . Do n't you remember reading in the Scriptures how Elijah complained to God about the people of Israel ?
CEV	Romans	11	3	( B ) He said , “ Lord , they killed your prophets and destroyed your altars . I am the only one left , and now they want to kill me. ”
CEV	Romans	11	4	( C ) But the Lord told Elijah , “ I still have 7,000 followers who have not worshiped Baal. ”
CEV	Romans	11	5	It is the same way now . God treated the people of Israel with undeserved grace , and so a few of them are still his followers .
CEV	Romans	11	6	This happened because of God 's undeserved kindness and not because of anything they have done . It could not have happened except for God 's gift of undeserved grace .
CEV	Romans	11	7	This means that only a chosen few of the people of Israel found what all of them were searching for . And the rest of them were stubborn ,
CEV	Romans	11	8	( D ) just as the Scriptures say , “ God made them so stupid that their eyes are blind , and their ears are still deaf. ”
CEV	Romans	11	9	( E ) Then David said , “ Turn their meals into bait for a trap , so that they will stumble and be given what they deserve .
CEV	Romans	11	10	Blindfold their eyes ! Do n't let them see . Bend their backs beneath a burden that will never be lifted. ” Gentiles Will Be Saved
CEV	Romans	11	12	But if the rest of the world 's people were helped so much by their sin and loss , they will be helped even more by their full return .
CEV	Romans	11	13	I am now speaking to you Gentiles , and as long as I am an apostle to you , I will take pride in my work .
CEV	Romans	11	14	I hope in this way to make some of my own people jealous enough to be saved .
CEV	Romans	11	15	When Israel rejected God , [ a ] the rest of the people in the world were able to turn to him . So when God makes friends with Israel , it will be like bringing the dead back to life .
CEV	Romans	11	16	If part of a batch of dough is made holy by being offered to God , then all of the dough is holy . If the roots of a tree are holy , the rest of the tree is holy too .
CEV	Romans	11	17	You Gentiles are like branches of a wild olive tree made to be part of a cultivated olive tree . You have taken the place of some branches that were cut away from it . And because of this , you enjoy the blessings that come from being part of that cultivated tree .
CEV	Romans	11	18	But do n't think you are better than the branches that were cut away . Just remember you are not supporting the roots of this tree . Its roots are supporting you .
CEV	Romans	11	19	Maybe you think those branches were cut away , so you could be put in their place .
CEV	Romans	11	20	That 's true enough . But they were cut away because they did not have faith , and you are where you are because you do have faith . So do n't be proud , but be afraid .
CEV	Romans	11	21	If God cut away those natural branches , could n't he do the same to you ?
CEV	Romans	11	22	Now you see both how kind and how hard God can be . He was hard on those who fell , but he was kind to you . And he will keep on being kind to you , if you keep on trusting in his kindness . Otherwise , you will be cut away too .
CEV	Romans	11	23	If those other branches will start having faith , they will be made a part of that tree again . God has the power to put them back .
CEV	Romans	11	24	After all , it was n't natural for branches to be cut from a wild olive tree and to be made part of a cultivated olive tree . So it is much more likely that God will join the natural branches back to the cultivated olive tree . The People of Israel Will Be Brought Back
CEV	Romans	11	25	My friends , I do n't want you Gentiles to be too proud of yourselves . So I will explain the mystery of what has happened to the people of Israel . Some of them have become stubborn , and they will stay like that until the complete number of you Gentiles has come in .
CEV	Romans	11	26	( F ) In this way all of Israel will be saved , as the Scriptures say , “ From Zion someone will come to rescue us . Then Jacob 's descendants will stop being evil .
CEV	Romans	11	27	( G ) This is what the Lord has promised to do when he forgives their sins. ”
CEV	Romans	11	28	The people of Israel are treated as God 's enemies , so the good news can come to you Gentiles . But they are still the chosen ones , and God loves them because of their famous ancestors .
CEV	Romans	11	29	God does n't take back the gifts he has given or disown the people he has chosen .
CEV	Romans	11	30	At one time you Gentiles rejected God . But now Israel has rejected God , and you have been shown mercy .
CEV	Romans	11	31	And because of the mercy shown to you , they will also be shown mercy .
CEV	Romans	11	32	All people have disobeyed God , and that 's why he treats them as prisoners . But he does this , so that he can have mercy on all of them .
CEV	Romans	11	33	( H ) Who can measure the wealth and wisdom and knowledge of God ? Who can understand his decisions or explain what he does ?
CEV	Romans	11	34	( I ) “ Has anyone known the thoughts of the Lord or given him advice ?
CEV	Romans	11	35	( J ) Has anyone loaned something to the Lord that must be repaid ? ”
CEV	Romans	11	36	( K ) Everything comes from the Lord . All things were made because of him and will return to him . Praise the Lord forever ! Amen . Footnotes - 11.15 When Israel rejected God : Or “ When Israel was rejected. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	12	12	Let your hope make you glad . Be patient in time of trouble and never stop praying .
CEV	Romans	12	2	Do n't be like the people of this world , but let God change the way you think . Then you will know how to do everything that is good and pleasing to him .
CEV	Romans	12	3	I realize God has treated me with undeserved grace , and so I tell each of you not to think you are better than you really are . Use good sense and measure yourself by the amount of faith that God has given you .
CEV	Romans	12	4	( A ) A body is made up of many parts , and each of them has its own use .
CEV	Romans	12	5	That 's how it is with us . There are many of us , but we each are part of the body of Christ , as well as part of one another .
CEV	Romans	12	6	( B ) God has also given each of us different gifts to use . If we can prophesy , we should do it according to the amount of faith we have .
CEV	Romans	12	7	If we can serve others , we should serve . If we can teach , we should teach .
CEV	Romans	12	8	If we can encourage others , we should encourage them . If we can give , we should be generous . If we are leaders , we should do our best . If we are good to others , we should do it cheerfully . Rules for Christian Living
CEV	Romans	12	9	Be sincere in your love for others . Hate everything that is evil and hold tight to everything that is good .
CEV	Romans	12	10	Love each other as brothers and sisters and honor others more than you do yourself .
CEV	Romans	12	11	Never give up . Eagerly follow the Holy Spirit and serve the Lord .
CEV	Romans	12	13	Take care of God 's needy people and welcome strangers into your home .
CEV	Romans	12	14	( C ) Ask God to bless everyone who mistreats you . Ask him to bless them and not to curse them .
CEV	Romans	12	15	( D ) When others are happy , be happy with them , and when they are sad , be sad .
CEV	Romans	12	16	( E ) Be friendly with everyone . Do n't be proud and feel that you know more than others . Make friends with ordinary people . [ a ]
CEV	Romans	12	17	Do n't mistreat someone who has mistreated you . But try to earn the respect of others ,
CEV	Romans	12	18	and do your best to live at peace with everyone .
CEV	Romans	12	19	( F ) Dear friends , do n't try to get even . Let God take revenge . In the Scriptures the Lord says , “ I am the one to take revenge and pay them back. ”
CEV	Romans	12	20	( G ) The Scriptures also say , “ If your enemies are hungry , give them something to eat . And if they are thirsty , give them something to drink . This will be the same as piling burning coals on their heads. ”

CEV	Romans	13	13	So behave properly , as people do in the day . Do n't go to wild parties or get drunk or be vulgar or indecent . Do n't quarrel or be jealous .
CEV	Romans	13	2	People who oppose the authorities are opposing what God has done , and they will be punished .
CEV	Romans	13	3	Rulers are a threat to evil people , not to good people . There is no need to be afraid of the authorities . Just do right , and they will praise you for it .
CEV	Romans	13	4	After all , they are God 's servants , and it is their duty to help you . If you do something wrong , you ought to be afraid , because these rulers have the right to punish you . They are God 's servants who punish criminals to show how angry God is .
CEV	Romans	13	5	But you should obey the rulers because you know it is the right thing to do , and not just because of God 's anger .
CEV	Romans	13	6	( B ) You must also pay your taxes . The authorities are God 's servants , and it is their duty to take care of these matters .
CEV	Romans	13	7	Pay all that you owe , whether it is taxes and fees or respect and honor . Love
CEV	Romans	13	8	Let love be your only debt ! If you love others , you have done all that the Law demands .
CEV	Romans	13	9	( C ) In the Law there are many commands , such as , “ Be faithful in marriage . Do not murder . Do not steal . Do not want what belongs to others. ” But all of these are summed up in the command that says , “ Love others as much as you love yourself. ”
CEV	Romans	13	10	No one who loves others will harm them . So love is all that the Law demands . The Day When Christ Returns
CEV	Romans	13	11	You know what sort of times we live in , and so you should live properly . It is time to wake up . You know that the day when we will be saved is nearer now than when we first put our faith in the Lord .
CEV	Romans	13	12	Night is almost over , and day will soon appear . We must stop behaving as people do in the dark and be ready to live in the light .

CEV	Romans	14	14	The Lord Jesus has made it clear to me that God considers all foods fit to eat . But if you think some foods are unfit to eat , then for you they are not fit .
CEV	Romans	14	2	Some think it is all right to eat anything , while those whose faith is weak will eat only vegetables .
CEV	Romans	14	3	But you should not criticize others for eating or for not eating . After all , God welcomes everyone .
CEV	Romans	14	4	What right do you have to criticize someone else 's servants ? Only their Lord can decide if they are doing right , and the Lord will make sure that they do right .
CEV	Romans	14	5	Some of the Lord 's followers think one day is more important than another . Others think all days are the same . But each of you should make up your own mind .
CEV	Romans	14	6	Any followers who count one day more important than another day do it to honor their Lord . And any followers who eat meat give thanks to God , just like the ones who do n't eat meat .
CEV	Romans	14	7	Whether we live or die , it must be for God , rather than for ourselves .
CEV	Romans	14	8	Whether we live or die , it must be for the Lord . Alive or dead , we still belong to the Lord .
CEV	Romans	14	9	This is because Christ died and rose to life , so that he would be the Lord of the dead and of the living .
CEV	Romans	14	10	( B ) Why do you criticize other followers of the Lord ? Why do you look down on them ? The day is coming when God will judge all of us .
CEV	Romans	14	11	( C ) In the Scriptures God says , “ I swear by my very life that everyone will kneel down and praise my name ! ”
CEV	Romans	14	12	And so , each of us must give an account to God for what we do . Do n't Cause Problems for Others
CEV	Romans	14	13	We must stop judging others . We must also make up our minds not to upset anyone 's faith .
CEV	Romans	14	15	If you are hurting others by the foods you eat , you are not guided by love . Do n't let your appetite destroy someone Christ died for .
CEV	Romans	14	16	Do n't let your right to eat bring shame to Christ .
CEV	Romans	14	17	God 's kingdom is n't about eating and drinking . It is about pleasing God , about living in peace , and about true happiness . All this comes from the Holy Spirit .
CEV	Romans	14	18	If you serve Christ in this way , you will please God and be respected by people .
CEV	Romans	14	19	We should try [ a ] to live at peace and help each other have a strong faith .
CEV	Romans	14	20	Do n't let your appetite destroy what God has done . All foods are fit to eat , but it is wrong to cause problems for others by what you eat .
CEV	Romans	14	21	It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that causes problems for other followers of the Lord .
CEV	Romans	14	22	What you believe about these things should be kept between you and God . You are fortunate , if your actions do n't make you have doubts .
CEV	Romans	14	23	But if you do have doubts about what you eat , you are going against your beliefs . And you know that is wrong , because anything you do against your beliefs is sin . Footnotes - 14.19 We should try : Some manuscripts have “ We try. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	15	15	But I have spoken to you plainly and have tried to remind you of some things . God treated me with undeserved grace !
CEV	Romans	15	2	We should think of their good and try to help them by doing what pleases them .
CEV	Romans	15	3	( A ) Even Christ did not try to please himself . But as the Scriptures say , “ The people who insulted you also insulted me. ”
CEV	Romans	15	4	( B ) And the Scriptures were written to teach and encourage us by giving us hope .
CEV	Romans	15	5	God is the one who makes us patient and cheerful . I pray that he will help you live at peace with each other , as you follow Christ .
CEV	Romans	15	6	Then all of you together will praise God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . The Good News Is for Jews and Gentiles
CEV	Romans	15	7	Honor God by accepting each other , as Christ has accepted you .
CEV	Romans	15	8	I tell you that Christ came as a servant of the Jews to show that God has kept the promises he made to their famous ancestors . Christ also came ,
CEV	Romans	15	9	( C ) so that the Gentiles would praise God for being kind to them . It is just as the Scriptures say , “ I will tell the nations about you , and I will sing praises to your name. ”
CEV	Romans	15	10	( D ) The Scriptures also say to the Gentiles , “ Come and celebrate with God 's people. ”
CEV	Romans	15	11	( E ) Again the Scriptures say , “ Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles . All you nations , come and worship him. ”
CEV	Romans	15	12	( F ) Isaiah says , “ Someone from David 's family will come to power . He will rule the nations , and they will put their hope in him. ”
CEV	Romans	15	13	I pray that God , who gives hope , will bless you with complete happiness and peace because of your faith . And may the power of the Holy Spirit fill you with hope . Paul 's Work as a Missionary
CEV	Romans	15	14	My friends , I am sure that you are very good and that you have all the knowledge you need to teach each other .
CEV	Romans	15	16	He chose me to be a servant of Christ Jesus for the Gentiles and to do the work of a priest in the service of his good news . God did this so that the Holy Spirit could make the Gentiles into a holy offering , pleasing to him .
CEV	Romans	15	17	Because of Christ Jesus , I can take pride in my service for God .
CEV	Romans	15	18	In fact , all I will talk about is how Christ let me speak and work , so that the Gentiles would obey him .
CEV	Romans	15	19	Indeed , I will tell how Christ worked miracles and wonders by the power of the Holy Spirit . I have preached the good news about him all the way from Jerusalem to Illyricum .
CEV	Romans	15	20	But I have always tried to preach where people have never heard about Christ . I am like a builder who does n't build on someone else 's foundation .
CEV	Romans	15	21	( G ) It is just as the Scriptures say , “ All who have n't been told about him will see him , and those who have n't heard about him will understand. ” Paul 's Plan To Visit Rome
CEV	Romans	15	22	( H ) My work has always kept me from coming to see you .
CEV	Romans	15	23	Now there is nothing left for me to do in this part of the world , and for years I have wanted to visit you .
CEV	Romans	15	24	So I plan to stop off on my way to Spain . Then after a short , but refreshing , visit with you , I hope you will quickly send me on . 25-26 ( I ) I am now on my way to Jerusalem to deliver the money that the Lord 's followers in Macedonia and Achaia collected for God 's needy people .
CEV	Romans	15	27	( J ) This is something they really wanted to do . But sharing their money with the Jews was also like paying back a debt , because the Jews had already shared their spiritual blessings with the Gentiles .
CEV	Romans	15	28	After I have safely delivered this money , I will visit you and then go on to Spain .
CEV	Romans	15	29	And when I do arrive in Rome , I know it will be with the full blessings of Christ .
CEV	Romans	15	30	My friends , by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the love that comes from the Holy Spirit , I beg you to pray sincerely with me and for me .
CEV	Romans	15	31	Pray that God will protect me from the unbelievers in Judea , and that his people in Jerusalem will be pleased with what I am doing .
CEV	Romans	15	32	Ask God to let me come to you and have a pleasant and refreshing visit .
CEV	Romans	15	33	I pray that God , who gives peace , will be with all of you . Amen . Copyright ©

CEV	Romans	16	16	Be sure to give each other a warm greeting . All of Christ 's churches greet you .
CEV	Romans	16	2	Welcome her in a way that is proper for someone who has faith in the Lord and is one of God 's own people . Help her in any way you can . After all , she has proved to be a respected leader for many others , including me .
CEV	Romans	16	3	( A ) Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila . They have not only served Christ Jesus together with me ,
CEV	Romans	16	4	but they have even risked their lives for me . I am grateful for them and so are all the Gentile churches .
CEV	Romans	16	5	Greet the church that meets in their home . Greet my dear friend Epaenetus , who was the first person in Asia to have faith in Christ .
CEV	Romans	16	6	Greet Mary , who has worked so hard for you .
CEV	Romans	16	7	Greet my relatives [ a ] Andronicus and Junia , who were in jail with me . They are highly respected by the apostles and were followers of Christ before I was .
CEV	Romans	16	8	Greet Ampliatus , my dear friend whose faith is in the Lord .
CEV	Romans	16	9	Greet Urbanus , who serves Christ along with us . Greet my dear friend Stachys .

CEV	Romans	16	12	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who work hard for the Lord . Greet my dear friend Persis . She also works hard for the Lord .

CEV	Romans	16	14	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , and Hermas , as well as our friends who are with them .
CEV	Romans	16	15	Greet Philologus , Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all of God 's people who are with them .
CEV	Romans	16	17	My friends , I beg you to watch out for anyone who causes trouble and divides the church by refusing to do what all of you were taught . Stay away from them !
CEV	Romans	16	18	They want to serve themselves and not Christ the Lord . Their flattery and fancy talk fool people who do n't know any better .
CEV	Romans	16	19	I am glad that everyone knows how well you obey the Lord . But still , I want you to understand what is good and not have anything to do with evil .
CEV	Romans	16	20	Then God , who gives peace , will soon crush Satan under your feet . I pray that our Lord Jesus will be kind to you .
CEV	Romans	16	21	( C ) Timothy , who works with me , sends his greetings , and so do my relatives , [ c ] Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater .
CEV	Romans	16	22	I , Tertius , also send my greetings . I am a follower of the Lord , and I wrote this letter . [ d ] 23-24 ( D ) Gaius welcomes me and the whole church into his home , and he sends his greetings . Erastus , the city treasurer , and our dear friend Quartus send their greetings too . [ e ] Paul 's Closing Prayer
CEV	Romans	16	25	Praise God ! He can make you strong by means of my good news , which is the message about [ f ] Jesus Christ . For ages and ages this message was kept secret ,
CEV	Romans	16	26	but now at last it has been told . The eternal God commanded his prophets to write about the good news , so that all nations would obey and have faith .
CEV	Romans	16	27	( E ) And now , because of Jesus Christ , we can praise the only wise God forever ! Amen .

CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	1	From Paul , chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , and from Sosthenes , who is also a follower .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	2	( A ) To God 's church in Corinth . Christ Jesus chose you to be his very own people , and you worship in his name , as we and all others do who call him Lord .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	3	My prayer is that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I never stop thanking my God for treating you with undeserved grace by giving you Christ Jesus ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	5	who helps you speak and understand so well .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	6	Now you are certain that everything we told you about our Lord Christ Jesus is true .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	7	You are not missing out on any blessings , as you wait for him to return .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	8	And until the day Christ does return , he will keep you completely innocent .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God can be trusted , and he chose you to be partners with his Son , our Lord Jesus Christ . Taking Sides
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	10	My dear friends , as a follower of our Lord Jesus Christ , I beg you to get along with each other . Do n't take sides . Always try to agree in what you think .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	11	Several people from Chloe 's family [ a ] have already reported to me that you keep arguing with each other .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	12	( B ) They have said that some of you claim to follow me , while others claim to follow Apollos or Peter [ b ] or Christ .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Has Christ been divided up ? Was I nailed to a cross for you ? Were you baptized in my name ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	14	( C ) I thank God [ c ] that I did n't baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	15	Not one of you can say that you were baptized in my name .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	16	( D ) I did baptize the family [ d ] of Stephanas , but I do n't remember if I baptized anyone else .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	17	Christ did not send me to baptize . He sent me to tell the good news without using words that sound wise and would make the cross of Christ lose its power . Christ Is God 's Power and Wisdom
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	18	The message about the cross does n't make any sense to lost people . But for those of us who are being saved , it is God 's power at work .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	19	( E ) As God says in the Scriptures , “ I will destroy the wisdom of all who claim to be wise . I will confuse those who think they know so much. ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	20	( F ) What happened to those wise people ? What happened to those experts in the Scriptures ? What happened to the ones who think they have all the answers ? Did n't God show that the wisdom of this world is foolish ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	21	( G ) God was wise and decided not to let the people of this world use their wisdom to learn about him . Instead , God chose to save only those who believe the foolish message we preach .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	22	Jews ask for miracles , and Greeks want something that sounds wise .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	23	But we preach that Christ was nailed to a cross . Most Jews have problems with this , and most Gentiles think it is foolish .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	24	Our message is God 's power and wisdom for the Jews and the Greeks that he has chosen .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	25	Even when God is foolish , he is wiser than everyone else , and even when God is weak , he is stronger than everyone else .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	26	My dear friends , remember what you were when God chose you . The people of this world did n't think that many of you were wise . Only a few of you were in places of power , and not many of you came from important families .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God chose the foolish things of this world to put the wise to shame . He chose the weak things of this world to put the powerful to shame .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	28	What the world thinks is worthless , useless , and nothing at all is what God has used to destroy what the world considers important .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	29	God did all this to keep anyone from bragging to him .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	30	You are God 's children . He sent Christ Jesus to save us and to make us wise , acceptable , and holy .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	1	31	( H ) So if you want to brag , do what the Scriptures say and brag about the Lord . Footnotes - 1.11 family : Family members and possibly slaves and others who may have lived in the house . - 1.12 Peter : The Greek text has “ Cephas , ” which is an Aramaic name meaning “ rock. ” Peter is the Greek name with the same meaning . - 1.14 I thank God : Some manuscripts have “ I thank my God. ” - 1.16 family : See the note at 1.11 .

CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	2	In fact , while I was with you , I made up my mind to speak only about Jesus Christ , who had been nailed to a cross .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	3	( A ) At first , I was weak and trembling with fear .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	4	When I talked with you or preached , I did n't try to prove anything by sounding wise . I simply let God 's Spirit show his power .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	5	That way you would have faith because of God 's power and not because of human wisdom .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	6	We do use wisdom when speaking to people who are mature in their faith . But it is n't the wisdom of this world or of its rulers , who will soon disappear .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	7	We speak of God 's hidden and mysterious wisdom that God decided to use for our glory long before the world began .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	8	( B ) The rulers of this world did n't know anything about this wisdom . If they had known about it , they would not have nailed the glorious Lord to a cross .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	9	( C ) But it is just as the Scriptures say , “ What God has planned for people who love him is more than eyes have seen or ears have heard . It has never even entered our minds ! ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	10	God 's Spirit has shown you everything . His Spirit finds out everything , even what is deep in the mind of God .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	11	You are the only one who knows what is in your own mind , and God 's Spirit is the only one who knows what is in God 's mind .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	12	But God has given us his Spirit . This is why we do n't think the same way that the people of this world think . This is also why we can recognize the blessings God has given us .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	13	Every word we speak was taught to us by God 's Spirit , not by human wisdom . And this same Spirit helps us teach spiritual things to spiritual people . [ b ]
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	14	This is why only someone who has God 's Spirit can understand spiritual blessings . Anyone who does n't have God 's Spirit thinks these blessings are foolish .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	15	People who are guided by the Spirit can make all kinds of judgments , but they can not be judged by others .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	2	16	( D ) The Scriptures ask , “ Has anyone ever known the thoughts of the Lord or given him advice ? ” But we understand what Christ is thinking . [ c ] Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	3	because you are not yet spiritual . You are jealous and argue with each other . This proves you are not spiritual and you are acting like the people of this world .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	2	( A ) So I had to treat you like babies and feed you milk . You could not take solid food , and you still can not ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	4	( B ) Some of you say you follow me , and others claim to follow Apollos . Is n't this how ordinary people behave ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Apollos and I are merely servants who helped you to have faith . It was the Lord who made it all happen .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	6	( C ) I planted the seeds , Apollos watered them , but God made them sprout and grow .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	7	What matters is n't those who planted or watered , but God who made the plants grow .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	8	The one who plants is just as important as the one who waters . And each one will be paid for what they do .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	9	Apollos and I work together for God , and you are God 's garden and God 's building . Only One Foundation
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	10	God treated me with undeserved grace and let me become an expert builder . I laid a foundation on which others have built . But we must each be careful how we build ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	11	because Christ is the only foundation . 12-13 Whatever we build on this foundation will be tested by fire on the day of judgment . Then everyone will find out if we have used gold , silver , and precious stones , or wood , hay , and straw .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	14	We will be rewarded if our building is left standing .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	15	But if it is destroyed by the fire , we will lose everything . Yet we ourselves will be saved , like someone escaping from flames .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	16	( D ) All of you surely know you are God 's temple and his Spirit lives in you .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	17	Together you are God 's holy temple , and God will destroy anyone who destroys his temple .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Do n't fool yourselves ! If any of you think you are wise in the things of this world , you will have to become foolish before you can be truly wise .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	19	( E ) This is because God considers the wisdom of this world to be foolish . It is just as the Scriptures say , “ God catches the wise when they try to outsmart him. ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	20	( F ) The Scriptures also say , “ The Lord knows that the plans made by wise people are useless. ” 21-22 So stop bragging about what anyone has done . Paul and Apollos and Peter [ a ] all belong to you . In fact , everything is yours , including the world , life , death , the present , and the future . Everything belongs to you ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	3	23	and you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God . Footnotes - 3.21,22 Peter : See the note at 1.12 . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	4	I do n't know of anything against me , but this does n't prove I am right . The Lord is my judge .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	2	And since our first duty is to be faithful to the one we work for ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	3	it does n't matter to me if I am judged by you or even by a court of law . In fact , I do n't judge myself .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So do n't judge anyone until the Lord returns . He will show what is hidden in the dark and what is in everyone 's heart . Then God will be the one who praises each of us .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Friends , I have used Apollos and myself as examples to teach you the meaning of the saying , “ Follow the rules. ” I want you to stop saying one of us is better than the other .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	7	What is so special about you ? What do you have that you were not given ? And if it was given to you , how can you brag ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	8	Are you already satisfied ? Are you now rich ? Have you become kings while we are still nobodies ? I wish you were kings . Then we could have a share in your kingdom .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	9	It seems to me that God has put us apostles in the worst possible place . We are like prisoners on their way to death . Angels and the people of this world just laugh at us .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	10	Because of Christ we are thought of as fools , but Christ has made you wise . We are weak and hated , but you are powerful and respected .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Even today we go hungry and thirsty and do n't have anything to wear except rags . We are mistreated and do n't have a place to live .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	12	( A ) We work hard with our own hands , and when people abuse us , we wish them well . When we suffer , we are patient .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	13	When someone curses us , we answer with kind words . Until now we are thought of as nothing more than the trash and garbage of this world .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I am not writing to embarrass you . I want to help you , just as parents help their own dear children .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	15	Ten thousand people may teach you about Christ , but I am your only father . You became my children when I told you about Christ Jesus ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	16	( B ) and I want you to be like me .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	17	This is why I sent Timothy to you . I love him like a son , and he is a faithful servant of the Lord . Timothy will tell you what I do to follow Christ and how it agrees with what I always teach about Christ in every church .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Some of you think I am not coming for a visit , and so you are bragging .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But if the Lord lets me come , I will soon be there . Then I will find out if the ones who are doing all this bragging really have any power .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	20	God 's kingdom is n't just a lot of words . It is power .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	4	21	What do you want me to do when I arrive ? Do you want me to be hard on you or to be kind and gentle ? Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	5	You must then hand that man over to Satan . His body will be destroyed , but his spirit will be saved when the Lord Jesus returns .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	2	You are proud , when you ought to feel bad enough to chase away anyone who acts like this . 3-4 I am with you only in my thoughts . But in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already judged this man , as though I were with you in person . So when you meet together and the power of the Lord Jesus is with you , I will be there too .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	6	( B ) Stop being proud ! Do n't you know how a little yeast can spread through the whole batch of dough ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	7	( C ) Get rid of the old yeast ! Then you will be like fresh bread made without yeast , and this is what you are . Our Passover lamb is Christ , who has already been sacrificed .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	8	( D ) So do n't celebrate the festival by being evil and sinful , which is like serving bread made with yeast . Be pure and truthful and celebrate by using bread made without yeast .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	9	In my other letter [ b ] I told you not to have anything to do with immoral people .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	10	But I was n't talking about the people of this world . You would have to leave this world to get away from everyone who is immoral or greedy or who cheats or worships idols .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	11	I was talking about your own people who are immoral or greedy or worship idols or curse others or get drunk or cheat . Do n't even eat with them !
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	12	Why should I judge outsiders ? Are n't we supposed to judge only church members ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	5	13	( E ) God judges everyone else . The Scriptures say , “ Chase away any of your own people who are evil. ” Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	6	Why should one of you take another to be tried by unbelievers ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Do n't you know that God 's people will judge the world ? And if you are going to judge the world , ca n't you settle small problems ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Do n't you know we will judge angels ? And if this is so , we can surely judge everyday matters .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	4	Why do you take everyday complaints to judges who are not respected by the church ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say this to your shame . Are n't any of you wise enough to act as a judge between one follower and another ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	7	When one of you takes another to court , all of you lose . It would be better to let yourselves be cheated and robbed .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	8	But instead , you cheat and rob other followers .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Do n't you know that evil people wo n't have a share in the blessings of God 's kingdom ? Do n't fool yourselves ! No one who is immoral or worships idols or is unfaithful in marriage or is a pervert or behaves like a homosexual
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	10	will share in God 's kingdom . Neither will any thief or greedy person or drunkard or anyone who curses and cheats others .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	11	Some of you used to be like that . But now the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the power of God 's Spirit have washed you and made you holy and acceptable to God . Honor God with Your Body
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	12	( A ) Some of you say , “ We can do anything we want to. ” But I tell you not everything is good for us . So I refuse to let anything have power over me .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	13	You also say , “ Food is meant for our bodies , and our bodies are meant for food. ” But I tell you that God will destroy them both . We are not supposed to do indecent things with our bodies . We are to use them for the Lord who is in charge of our bodies .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	14	God will raise us from death by the same power he used when he raised our Lord to life .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Do n't you know that your bodies are part of the body of Christ ? Is it right for me to join part of the body of Christ to a prostitute ? No , it is n't !
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	16	( B ) Do n't you know that a man who does that becomes part of her body ? The Scriptures say , “ The two of them will be like one person. ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But anyone who is joined to the Lord is one in spirit with him .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Do n't be immoral in matters of sex . That is a sin against your own body in a way no other sin is .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	19	( C ) You surely know that your body is a temple where the Holy Spirit lives . The Spirit is in you and is a gift from God . You are no longer your own .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	6	20	God paid a great price for you . So use your body to honor God . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	7	I wish all of you were like me , but God has given different gifts to each of us .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	2	Well , having your own husband or wife should keep you from doing something immoral .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	3	Husbands and wives should be fair with each other about having sex .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	4	A wife belongs to her husband instead of to herself , and a husband belongs to his wife instead of to himself .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	5	So do n't refuse sex to each other , unless you agree not to have sex for a little while , in order to spend time in prayer . Then Satan wo n't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	6	In my opinion that is what should be done , though I do n't know of anything the Lord said about this matter .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	8	My advice for the unmarried and for widows is that it is acceptable for them to remain single , just as I am .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if you do n't have enough self-control , then go ahead and get married . After all , it is better to marry than to burn with desire . [ b ]
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	10	( A ) I instruct married couples to stay together , and this is exactly what the Lord himself taught . A wife who leaves her husband
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	11	should either stay single or go back to her husband . And a husband should not leave his wife .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	12	I do n't know of anything else the Lord said about marriage . All I can do is to give you my own advice . If your wife is n't a follower of the Lord , but is willing to stay with you , do n't divorce her .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	13	If your husband is n't a follower , but is willing to stay with you , do n't divorce him .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	14	Your husband or wife who is n't a follower is made holy by having you as a partner . This also makes your children holy and keeps them from being unclean in God 's sight .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	15	If your husband or wife is n't a follower of the Lord and decides to divorce you , then you should agree to it . You are no longer bound to that person . After all , God chose you and wants you to live at peace .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	16	And besides , how do you know if you will be able to save your husband or wife who is n't a follower ? Obeying the Lord at All Times
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	17	In every church I tell the people to stay as they were when the Lord Jesus chose them and God called them to be his own . Now I say the same thing to you .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	18	( B ) If you are already circumcised , do n't try to change it . If you are not circumcised , do n't get circumcised .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Being circumcised or uncircumcised is n't really what matters . The important thing is to obey God 's commands .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	20	So do n't try to change what you were when God chose you .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Are you a slave ? Do n't let that bother you . But if you can win your freedom , you should .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	22	When the Lord chooses slaves , they become his free people . And when he chooses free people , they become slaves of Christ .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	23	God paid a great price for you . So do n't become slaves of anyone else .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Stay what you were when God chose you . Unmarried People
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	25	I do n't know of anything the Lord said about people who have never been married . [ c ] But I will tell you what I think . And you can trust me , because the Lord has treated me with kindness .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	26	We are now going through hard times , and I think it is best for you to stay as you are .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	27	If you are married , stay married . If you are not married , do n't try to get married .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	28	It is n't wrong to marry , even if you have never been married before . But those who marry will have a lot of trouble , and I want to protect you from this .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	29	My friends , what I mean is that the Lord will soon come , [ d ] and it wo n't matter if you are married or not .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	30	It will be all the same if you are crying or laughing , or if you are buying or are completely broke .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	31	It wo n't make any difference how much good you are getting from this world or how much you like it . This world as we know it is now passing away .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	32	I want all of you to be free from worry . An unmarried man worries about how to please the Lord .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But a married man has more worries . He must worry about the things of this world , because he wants to please his wife .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	34	So he is pulled in two directions . Unmarried women and women who have never been married [ e ] worry only about pleasing the Lord , and they keep their bodies and minds pure . But a married woman worries about the things of this world , because she wants to please her husband .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	35	What I am saying is for your own good—it is n't to limit your freedom . I want to help you to live right and to love the Lord above all else .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	36	“ If you feel that you are not treating your grown daughter right by keeping her from getting married , then let her marry . You wo n't be doing anything wrong .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But it is better to have self-control and make up your mind not to let your daughter get married .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	38	It is all right for you to let her marry . But it is better if you do n't let her marry at all. ” Copyright ©
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife should stay married to her husband until he dies . Then she is free to marry again , but only to a man who is a follower of the Lord .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	7	40	However , I think I am obeying God 's Spirit when I say she would be happier to stay single .

CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But food does n't bring us any closer to God . We are no worse off if we do n't eat , and we are no better off if we do .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	2	In fact , people who think they know so much do n't know anything at all .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But God has no doubts about who loves him .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	4	Even though food is offered to idols , we know that none of the idols in this world are alive . After all , there is only one God .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	5	Many things in heaven and on earth are called gods and lords , but none of them really are gods or lords .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	6	We have only one God , and he is the Father . He created everything , and we live for him . Jesus Christ is our only Lord . Everything was made by him , and by him life was given to us .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	7	Not everyone knows these things . In fact , many people have grown up with the belief that idols have life in them . So when they eat meat offered to idols , they are bothered by a weak conscience .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	9	Do n't cause problems for someone with a weak conscience , just because you have the right to eat anything .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	10	You know all this , and so it does n't bother you to eat in the temple of an idol . But suppose a person with a weak conscience sees you and decides to eat food that has been offered to idols .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	11	Then what you know has destroyed someone Christ died for .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	12	When you sin by hurting a follower with a weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	8	13	So if I hurt one of the Lord 's followers by what I eat , I will never eat meat as long as I live . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	9	I am free . I am an apostle . I have seen the Lord Jesus and have led you to have faith in him .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	2	Others may think that I am not an apostle , but you are proof that I am an apostle to you .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	3	When people question me , I tell them
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	4	that Barnabas and I have the right to our food and drink .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	5	We each have the right to marry one of the Lord 's followers and to take her along with us , just as the other apostles and the Lord 's brothers and Peter [ a ] do .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Are we the only ones who have to support ourselves by working at another job ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Do soldiers pay their own salaries ? Do n't people who raise grapes eat some of what they grow ? Do n't shepherds get milk from their own goats ? 8-9 ( A ) I am not saying this on my own authority . The Law of Moses tells us not to muzzle an ox when it is grinding grain . But was God concerned only about an ox ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	10	No , he was n't ! He was talking about us . This was written in the Scriptures so that all who plow and all who grind the grain will look forward to sharing in the harvest .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	11	( B ) When we told the message to you , it was like planting spiritual seed . So we have the right to accept material things as our harvest from you .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others have the right to do this , we have an even greater right . But we have n't used this right of ours . We are willing to put up with anything to keep from causing trouble for the message about Christ .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	13	( C ) Do n't you know that people who work in the temple make their living from what is brought to the temple ? Do n't you know that a person who serves at the altar is given part of what is offered ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	14	( D ) In the same way , the Lord wants everyone who preaches the good news to make a living from preaching this message .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have never used these privileges of mine , and I am not writing this because I want to start now . I would rather die than have someone rob me of the right to take pride in this .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	16	I do n't have any reason to brag about preaching the good news . Preaching is something God told me to do , and if I do n't do it , I am doomed .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	17	If I preach because I want to , I will be paid . But even if I do n't want to , it is still something God has sent me to do .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What pay am I given ? It is the chance to preach the good news free of charge and not to use the privileges that are mine because I am a preacher .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	19	I am not anyone 's slave . But I have become a slave to everyone , so I can win as many people as possible .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	20	When I am with the Jews , I live like a Jew to win Jews . They are ruled by the Law of Moses , and I am not . But I live by the Law to win them .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	21	And when I am with people who are not ruled by the Law , I forget about the Law to win them . Of course , I never really forget about the law of God . In fact , I am ruled by the law of Christ .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	22	When I am with people whose faith is weak , I live as they do to win them . I do everything I can to win everyone I possibly can .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all this for the good news , because I want to share in its blessings . A Race and a Fight
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	24	( E ) You know that many runners enter a race , and only one of them wins the prize . So run to win !
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	25	( F ) Athletes work hard to win a crown that can not last , but we do it for a crown that will last forever .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	26	I do n't run without a goal . And I do n't box by beating my fists in the air .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	9	27	I keep my body under control and make it my slave , so I wo n't lose out after telling the good news to others . Footnotes - 9.5 Peter : See the note at 1.12 . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	10	( H ) Do n't even grumble , as some of them did and were killed by the destroying angel .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	2	This was like being baptized and becoming followers of Moses .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	3	( B ) All of them also ate the same spiritual food
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	4	( C ) and drank the same spiritual drink , which flowed from the spiritual rock that followed them . That rock was Christ .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	5	( D ) But most of them did not please God . So they died , and their bodies were scattered all over the desert .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	6	What happened to them is a warning to keep us from wanting to do the same evil things .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	7	( E ) They worshiped idols , just as the Scriptures say , “ The people sat down to eat and drink . Then they got up to dance around. ” So do n't worship idols .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	8	( F ) Some of those people did shameful things , and in a single day about 23,000 died . Do n't do shameful things as they did .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	9	( G ) And do n't try to test Christ , [ a ] as some of them did and were later bitten by poisonous snakes .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	11	These things happened to them as a warning to us . All this was written in the Scriptures to teach us who live in these last days .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Even if you think you can stand up to temptation , be careful not to fall .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	13	( I ) You are tempted in the same way that everyone else is tempted . But God can be trusted not to let you be tempted too much , and he will show you how to escape from your temptations .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	14	My friends , you must keep away from idols .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I am speaking to you as people who have enough sense to know what I am talking about .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	16	( J ) When we drink from the cup we ask God to bless , is n't that sharing in the blood of Christ ? When we eat the bread we break , is n't that sharing in the body of Christ ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	17	By sharing in the same loaf of bread , we become one body , even though there are many of us .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	18	( K ) ( L ) Are n't the people of Israel sharing in the worship when they gather around the altar and eat the sacrifices offered there ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	19	Am I saying that either the idols or the food sacrificed to them is anything at all ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	20	( M ) No , I am not ! This food is really sacrificed to demons and not to God . I do n't want you to have anything to do with demons .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can not drink from the cup of demons and still drink from the Lord 's cup . You can not eat at the table of demons and still eat at the Lord 's table .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	22	( N ) We would make the Lord jealous if we did this . And we are not stronger than the Lord . Always Honor God
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	23	( O ) Some of you say , “ We can do whatever we want to ! ” But I tell you not everything may be good or helpful .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	24	We should think about others and not about ourselves .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	25	However , when you buy meat in the market , go ahead and eat it . Keep your conscience clear by not asking where the meat came from .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	26	( P ) The Scriptures say , “ The earth and everything in it belong to the Lord. ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If an unbeliever invites you to dinner , and you want to go , then go . Eat whatever you are served . Do n't cause a problem for someone 's conscience by asking where the food came from . 28-29 But if you are told it has been sacrificed to idols , do n't cause a problem by eating it . I do n't mean a problem for yourself , but for the one who told you . Why should my freedom be limited by someone else 's conscience ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If I give thanks for what I eat , why should anyone accuse me of doing wrong ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	31	When you eat or drink or do anything else , always do it to honor God .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Do n't cause problems for Jews or Greeks or anyone else who belongs to God 's church .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	10	33	I always try to please others instead of myself , in the hope that many of them will be saved . Footnotes - 10.9 Christ : Some manuscripts have “ the Lord. ” Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	1	( A ) You must follow my example , as I follow the example of Christ . Rules for Worship
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	11	As far as the Lord is concerned , men and women need each other .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	2	I am proud of you , because you always remember me and obey the teachings I gave you .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	3	Now I want you to know that Christ is the head of all men , and a man is the head of a woman . But God is the head of Christ .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	4	This means that any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head brings shame to his head .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But any woman who prays or prophesies without something on her head brings shame to her head . In fact , she may as well shave her head . [ a ]
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	6	A woman should wear something on her head . It is a disgrace for a woman to shave her head or cut her hair . But if she refuses to wear something on her head , let her cut off her hair .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	7	( B ) Men were created to be like God and to bring honor to God . This means a man should not wear anything on his head . Women were created to bring honor to men .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	8	( C ) It was the woman who was made from a man , and not the man who was made from a woman .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	9	He was n't created for her . She was created for him .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	10	And so , because of this , and also because of the angels , a woman ought to wear something on her head , as a sign of her authority . [ b ]
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	12	It is true that the first woman came from a man , but all other men have been given birth by women . Yet God is the one who created everything .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Ask yourselves if it is proper for a woman to pray without something on her head .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Is n't it unnatural and disgraceful for men to have long hair ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But long hair is a beautiful way for a woman to cover her head .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	16	This is how things are done in all of God 's churches , [ c ] and this is why none of you should argue about what I have said . Rules for the Lord 's Supper
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	17	Your worship services do you more harm than good . I am certainly not going to praise you for this .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	18	I am told you ca n't get along with each other when you worship , and I am sure that some of what I have heard is true .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	19	You are bound to argue with each other , but it is easy to see which of you have God 's approval .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When you meet together , you do n't really celebrate the Lord 's Supper .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	21	You even start eating before everyone gets to the meeting , and some of you go hungry , while others get drunk .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	22	Do n't you have homes where you can eat and drink ? Do you hate God 's church ? Do you want to embarrass people who do n't have anything ? What can I say to you ? I certainly can not praise you . The Lord 's Supper ( Matthew 26.26-29 ; Mark 14.22-25 ; Luke 22.14-20 )
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	23	I have already told you what the Lord Jesus did on the night he was betrayed . And it came from the Lord himself . He took some bread in his hands .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	24	Then after he had given thanks , he broke it and said , “ This is my body , which is given for you . Eat this and remember me. ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	25	( D ) After the meal , Jesus took a cup of wine in his hands and said , “ This is my blood , and with it God makes his new agreement with you . Drink this and remember me. ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	26	The Lord meant that when you eat this bread and drink from this cup , you tell about his death until he comes .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	27	But if you eat the bread and drink the wine in a way that is n't worthy of the Lord , you sin against his body and blood .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	28	This is why you must examine the way you eat and drink .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	29	If you fail to understand that you are the body of the Lord , you will condemn yourselves by the way you eat and drink .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	30	This is why many of you are sick and weak and why a lot of others have died .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	31	If we carefully judge ourselves , we wo n't be punished .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when the Lord judges and punishes us , he does it to keep us from being condemned with the rest of the world .

CEV	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If you really are hungry , you can eat at home . Then you wo n't condemn yourselves when you meet together . After I arrive , I will instruct you about the other matters .

CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	12	( B ) The body of Christ has many different parts , just as any other body does .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	2	I want you to remember that before you became followers of the Lord , you were led in all the wrong ways by idols that can not even talk .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Now I want you to know that if you are led by God 's Spirit , you will say that Jesus is Lord , and you will never curse Jesus .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	4	( A ) There are different kinds of spiritual gifts , but they all come from the same Spirit .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	5	There are different ways to serve the same Lord ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	6	and we can each do different things . Yet the same God works in all of us and helps us in everything we do .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	7	The Spirit has given each of us a special way of serving others .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	8	Some of us can speak with wisdom , while others can speak with knowledge , but these gifts come from the same Spirit .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	9	To others the Spirit has given great faith or the power to heal the sick
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	10	or the power to work mighty miracles . Some of us are prophets , and some of us recognize when God 's Spirit is present . [ a ] Others can speak different kinds of languages , and still others can tell what these languages mean .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But it is the Spirit who does all this and decides which gifts to give to each of us . One Body with Many Parts
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	13	may also be translated , “ God 's Spirit is inside each of us , and all around us as well . So it does n't matter that some of us are Jews and others are Gentiles and that some are slaves and others are free . Together we are one body. ” - 12.31 I want you to desire the best gifts : Or “ You desire the best gifts. ” Copyright ©
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	14	Our bodies do n't have just one part . They have many parts .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	15	Suppose a foot says , “ I 'm not a hand , and so I 'm not part of the body. ” Would n't the foot still belong to the body ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	16	Or suppose an ear says , “ I 'm not an eye , and so I 'm not part of the body. ” Would n't the ear still belong to the body ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If our bodies were only an eye , we could n't hear a thing . And if they were only an ear , we could n't smell a thing .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But God has put all parts of our body together in the way that he decided is best .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	19	A body is n't really a body , unless there is more than one part .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	20	It takes many parts to make a single body .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	21	That 's why the eyes can not say they do n't need the hands . That 's also why the head can not say it does n't need the feet .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	22	In fact , we can not get along without the parts of the body that seem to be the weakest .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	23	We take special care to dress up some parts of our bodies . We are modest about our personal parts ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	24	but we do n't have to be modest about other parts . God put our bodies together in such a way that even the parts that seem the least important are valuable .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	25	He did this to make all parts of the body work together smoothly , with each part caring about the others .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	26	If one part of our body hurts , we hurt all over . If one part of our body is honored , the whole body will be happy .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Together you are the body of Christ . Each one of you is part of his body .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	28	( C ) First , God chose some people to be apostles and prophets and teachers for the church . But he also chose some to work miracles or heal the sick or help others or be leaders or speak different kinds of languages .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Not everyone is an apostle . Not everyone is a prophet . Not everyone is a teacher . Not everyone can work miracles .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Not everyone can heal the sick . Not everyone can speak different kinds of languages . Not everyone can tell what these languages mean .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	12	31	I want you to desire the best gifts . [ c ] So I will show you a much better way . Footnotes - 12.10 and some of us … present : Or “ and some of us recognize the difference between God 's Spirit and other spirits. ” - 12.13 Some of us are Jews … that same Spirit : Verse

CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	13	For now there are faith , hope , and love . But of these three , the greatest is love . Footnotes - 13.3 and let myself be burned alive : Some manuscripts have “ so that I could brag. ” Copyright ©
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	2	( A ) What if I could prophesy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge ? And what if I had faith that moved mountains ? I would be nothing , unless I loved others .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	3	What if I gave away all that I owned and let myself be burned alive ? [ a ] I would gain nothing , unless I loved others .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient and kind , never jealous , boastful , proud , or
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	5	rude . Love is n't selfish or quick tempered . It does n't keep a record of wrongs that others do .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	6	Love rejoices in the truth , but not in evil .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	7	Love is always supportive , loyal , hopeful , and trusting .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails ! Everyone who prophesies will stop , and unknown languages will no longer be spoken . All that we know will be forgotten .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	9	We do n't know everything , and our prophecies are not complete .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But what is perfect will someday appear , and what is n't perfect will then disappear .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When we were children , we thought and reasoned as children do . But when we grew up , we quit our childish ways .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	13	12	Now all we can see of God is like a cloudy picture in a mirror . Later we will see him face to face . We do n't know everything , but then we will , just as God completely understands us .

CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For example , if I use an unknown language in my prayers , my spirit prays but my mind is useless .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	2	If you speak languages that others do n't know , God will understand what you are saying , though no one else will know what you mean . You will be talking about mysteries that only the Spirit understands .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But when you prophesy , you will be understood , and others will be helped . They will be encouraged and made to feel better .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	4	By speaking languages that others do n't know , you help only yourself . But by prophesying you help everyone in the church .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I am glad for you to speak unknown languages , although I prefer that you would prophesy . In fact , prophesying does much more good than speaking unknown languages , unless someone can help the church by explaining what you mean .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	6	My friends , what good would it do , if I came and spoke unknown languages to you and did n't explain what I meant ? How would I help you , unless I told you what God had shown me or gave you some knowledge or prophecy or teaching ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	7	If all musical instruments sounded alike , how would you know the difference between a flute and a harp ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	8	If a bugle call is n't clear , how would you know to get ready for battle ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	9	This is how it is when you speak unknown languages . If no one can understand what you are talking about , you will only be talking to the wind .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are many different languages in this world , and all of them make sense .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	11	But if I do n't understand the language that someone is using , we will be like foreigners to each other .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	12	If you really want spiritual gifts , choose the ones that will be most helpful to the church .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	13	When we speak languages that others do n't know , we should pray for the power to explain what we mean .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	15	Then what should I do ? There are times when I should pray with my spirit , and times when I should pray with my mind . Sometimes I should sing with my spirit , and at other times I should sing with my mind .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Suppose some strangers are in your worship service , when you are praising God with your spirit . If they do n't understand you , how will they know to say , “ Amen ” ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	17	You may be worshiping God in a wonderful way , but no one else will be helped .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God that I speak unknown languages more than any of you .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	19	But words that make sense can help the church . This is why in church I would rather speak five words that make sense than to speak 10,000 words in a language that others do n't know .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	20	My friends , stop thinking like children . Think like mature people and be as innocent as tiny babies .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	21	( A ) In the Scriptures the Lord says , “ I will use strangers who speak unknown languages to talk to my people . They will speak to them in foreign languages , but still my people wo n't listen to me. ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Languages others do n't know may mean something to unbelievers , but not to the Lord 's followers . Prophecy , on the other hand , is for followers , not for unbelievers .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Suppose everyone in your worship service started speaking unknown languages , and some outsiders or some unbelievers come in . Wo n't they think you are crazy ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But suppose all of you are prophesying when those unbelievers and outsiders come in . They will realize that they are sinners , and they will want to change their ways because of what you are saying .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	25	They will tell what is hidden in their hearts . Then they will kneel down and say to God , “ We are certain that you are with these people. ” Worship Must Be Orderly
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	26	My friends , when you meet to worship , you must do everything for the good of everyone there . That 's how it should be when someone sings or teaches or tells what God has said or speaks an unknown language or explains what the language means .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	27	No more than two or three of you should speak unknown languages during the meeting . You must take turns , and someone should always be there to explain what you mean .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	28	If no one can explain , you must keep silent in church and speak only to yourself and to God .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Two or three persons may prophesy , and everyone else must listen carefully .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	30	If someone sitting there receives a message from God , the speaker must stop and let the other person speak .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	31	Let only one person speak at a time , then all of you will learn something and be encouraged .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	32	A prophet should be willing to stop and let someone else speak .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	33	God wants everything to be done peacefully and in order . When God 's people meet in church ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	34	the women must not be allowed to speak . They must keep quiet and listen , as the Law of Moses teaches .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If there is something they want to know , they can ask their husbands when they get home . It is disgraceful for women to speak in church .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	36	God 's message did not start with you people , and you are not the only ones it has reached .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If you think of yourself as a prophet or a spiritual person , you will know I am writing only what the Lord has commanded .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	38	So do n't pay attention to anyone who ignores what I am writing .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	39	My friends , be eager to prophesy and do n't stop anyone from speaking languages that others do n't know .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	14	40	But do everything properly and in order . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	15	If the dead wo n't be raised to life , we have told lies about God by saying he raised Christ to life , when he really did not .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	2	You will be saved by this message , if you hold firmly to it . But if you do n't , your faith was all for nothing .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	3	( A ) I told you the most important part of the message exactly as it was told to me . This part is : Christ died for our sins , as the Scriptures say .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	4	( B ) He was buried , and three days later he was raised to life , as the Scriptures say .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	5	( C ) Christ appeared to Peter , [ a ] then to the twelve .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After this , he appeared to more than five hundred other followers . Most of them are still alive , but some have died .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	7	He also appeared to James , then to all of the apostles .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	8	( D ) Finally , he appeared to me , even though I am like someone who was born at the wrong time . [ b ]
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	9	( E ) I am the least important of all the apostles . In fact , I caused so much trouble for God 's church that I do n't even deserve to be called an apostle .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But God treated me with undeserved grace ! He made me what I am , and his grace was n't wasted . I worked much harder than any of the other apostles , although it was really God 's grace at work and not me .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	11	But it does n't matter if I preached or if they preached . All of you believed the message just the same . God 's People Will Be Raised to Life
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	12	If we preach that Christ was raised from death , how can some of you say the dead will not be raised to life ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	13	If they wo n't be raised to life , Christ himself was n't raised to life .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ was n't raised to life , our message is worthless , and so is your faith .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	16	So if the dead wo n't be raised to life , Christ was n't raised to life .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	17	Unless Christ was raised to life , your faith is useless , and you are still living in your sins .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	18	And those people who died after putting their faith in him are completely lost .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If our hope in Christ is good only for this life , we are worse off than anyone else .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But Christ has been raised to life ! And he makes us certain that others will also be raised to life .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	21	Just as we will die because of Adam , we will be raised to life because of Christ .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	22	Adam brought death to all of us , and Christ will bring life to all of us .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But we must each wait our turn . Christ was the first to be raised to life , and his people will be raised to life when he returns .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then after Christ has destroyed all powers and forces , the end will come , and he will give the kingdom to God the Father .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	25	( F ) Christ will rule until he puts all his enemies under his power ,
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	26	and the last enemy he destroys will be death .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	27	( G ) When the Scriptures say he will put everything under his power , they do n't include God . It was God who put everything under the power of Christ .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	28	After everything is under the power of God 's Son , he will put himself under the power of God , who put everything under his Son 's power . Then God will mean everything to everyone .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	29	( H ) If the dead are not going to be raised to life , what will people do who are being baptized for them ? Why are they being baptized for those dead people ?
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And why do we always risk our lives
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	31	and face death every day ? The pride that I have in you because of Christ Jesus our Lord is what makes me say this .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	32	( I ) What do you think I gained by fighting wild animals in Ephesus ? If the dead are not raised to life , “ Let 's eat and drink . Tomorrow we die. ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Do n't fool yourselves . Bad friends will destroy you .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Be sensible and stop sinning . You should be embarrassed that some people still do n't know about God . What Our Bodies Will Be Like
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	35	Some of you have asked , “ How will the dead be raised to life ? What kind of bodies will they have ? ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Do n't be foolish . A seed must die before it can sprout from the ground .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	37	Wheat seeds and all other seeds look different from the sprouts that come up .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	38	This is because God gives everything the kind of body he wants it to have .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	39	People , animals , birds , and fish are each made of flesh , but none of them are alike .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	40	Everything in the heavens has a body , and so does everything on earth . But each one is very different from all the others .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun is n't like the moon , the moon is n't like the stars , and each star is different .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	42	That 's how it will be when our bodies are raised to life . These bodies will die , but the bodies that are raised will live forever .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	43	These ugly and weak bodies will become beautiful and strong .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	44	As surely as there are physical bodies , there are spiritual bodies . And our physical bodies will be changed into spiritual bodies .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	45	( J ) The first man was named Adam , and the Scriptures tell us that he was a living person . But Jesus , who may be called the last Adam , is a life-giving spirit .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	46	We see that the one with a spiritual body did not come first . He came after the one who had a physical body .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man was made from the dust of the earth , but the second man came from heaven .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	48	Everyone on earth has a body like the body of the one who was made from the dust of the earth . And everyone in heaven has a body like the body of the one who came from heaven .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	49	Just as we are like the one who was made out of earth , we will be like the one who came from heaven .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	50	My friends , I want you to know that our bodies of flesh and blood will decay . This means they can not share in God 's kingdom , which lasts forever .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	51	( K ) I will explain a mystery to you . Not every one of us will die , but we will all be changed .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	52	It will happen suddenly , quicker than the blink of an eye . At the sound of the last trumpet the dead will be raised . We will all be changed , so we will never die again .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	53	Our dead and decaying bodies will be changed into bodies that wo n't die or decay .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	54	( L ) The bodies we now have are weak and can die . But they will be changed into bodies that are eternal . Then the Scriptures will come true , “ Death has lost the battle !
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	55	( M ) Where is its victory ? Where is its sting ? ”
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Sin is what gives death its sting , and the Law is the power behind sin .
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thank God for letting our Lord Jesus Christ give us the victory !
CEV	1%20Corinthians	15	58	My dear friends , stand firm and do n't be shaken . Always keep busy working for the Lord . You know that everything you do for him is worthwhile . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	2	I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace ! Paul Gives Thanks
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	1	( A ) From Paul , chosen by God to be an apostle of Jesus Christ , and from Timothy , who is also a follower . To God 's church in Corinth and to all of God 's people in Achaia .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Praise God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! The Father is a merciful God , who always gives us comfort .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	4	He comforts us when we are in trouble , so that we can share this same comfort with others in trouble .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	5	We share in the terrible sufferings of Christ , but also in the wonderful comfort he gives .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	6	We suffer in the hope that you will be comforted and saved . And because we are comforted , you will also be comforted , as you patiently endure suffering like ours .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	7	You never disappoint us . You suffered as much as we did , and we know that you will be comforted as we were .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	8	( B ) My friends , I want you to know what a hard time we had in Asia . Our sufferings were so horrible and so unbearable that death seemed certain .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	9	In fact , we felt sure we were going to die . But this made us stop trusting in ourselves and start trusting God , who raises the dead to life .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	10	God saved us from the threat of death , [ a ] and we are sure that he will do it again and again .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	11	Please help us by praying for us . Then many people will give thanks for the blessings we receive in answer to all these prayers . Paul 's Change of Plans
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	12	We can be proud of our clear conscience . We have always lived honestly and sincerely , especially when we were with you . And we were guided by God 's gift of undeserved grace instead of by the wisdom of this world .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	13	I am not writing anything you can not read and understand . I hope you will understand it completely ,
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	14	just as you already partly understand us . Then when our Lord Jesus returns , you can be as proud of us as we are of you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	15	I was so sure of your pride in us that I had planned to visit you first of all . In this way you would have the blessing of two visits from me—
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	16	( C ) once on my way to Macedonia and again on my return from there . Then you could send me on to Judea .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Do you think I could n't make up my mind about what to do ? Or do I seem like someone who says “ Yes ” or “ No ” simply to please others ?
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	18	God can be trusted , and so can I , when I say our answer to you has always been “ Yes ” and never “ No. ”
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	19	( D ) This is because Jesus Christ the Son of God is always “ Yes ” and never “ No. ” And he is the one Silas , [ b ] Timothy , and I told you about .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	20	Christ says “ Yes ” to all God 's promises . This is why we have Christ to say “ Amen ” [ c ] for us to the glory of God .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	21	And so God makes it possible for you and us to stand firmly together with Christ . God is also the one who chose us
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	22	and put his Spirit in our hearts to show that we belong only to him .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	23	God is my witness that I stayed away from Corinth , just to keep from being hard on you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	1	24	We are not bosses who tell you what to believe . We are working with you to make you glad , because your faith is strong . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	2	If I make you feel bad , who would be left to cheer me up , except the people I had made to feel bad ?
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	3	The reason I want to be happy is to make you happy . I wrote as I did because I did n't want to visit you and be made to feel bad , when you should make me feel happy .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	4	At the time I wrote , I was suffering terribly . My eyes were full of tears , and my heart was broken . But I did n't want to make you feel bad . I only wanted to let you know how much I cared for you . Forgiveness
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	5	I do n't want to be hard on you . But if one of you has made someone feel bad , I am not really the one who has been made to feel bad . Some of you are the ones .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	6	Most of you have already pointed out the wrong that person did , and this is punishment enough for what was done .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	7	When people sin , you should forgive and comfort them , so they wo n't give up in despair .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	8	You should make them sure of your love for them .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	9	I also wrote because I wanted to test you and find out if you would follow my instructions .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	10	I will forgive anyone you forgive . Yes , for your sake and with Christ as my witness , I have forgiven whatever needed to be forgiven .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	11	I have done this to keep Satan from getting the better of us . We all know what goes on in his mind .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	12	( A ) When I went to Troas to preach the good news about Christ , I found that the Lord had already prepared the way .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	13	But I was worried when I did n't find my friend Titus there . So I left the other followers and went on to Macedonia .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	14	I am grateful that God always makes it possible for Christ to lead us to victory . God also helps us spread the knowledge about Christ everywhere , and this knowledge is like the smell of perfume . 15-16 In fact , God thinks of us as a perfume that brings Christ to everyone . For people who are being saved , this perfume has a sweet smell and leads them to a better life . But for people who are lost , it has a bad smell and leads them to a horrible death . No one really has what it takes to do this work .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	2	17	A lot of people try to get rich from preaching God 's message . But we are God 's sincere messengers , and by the power of Christ we speak our message with God as our witness . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	2	But you are our letter , and you are in our [ a ] hearts for everyone to read and understand .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	3	( A ) You are like a letter written by Christ and delivered by us . But you are not written with pen and ink or on tablets made of stone . You are written in our hearts by the Spirit of the living God .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	4	We are sure about all this . Christ makes us sure in the very presence of God .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	5	We do n't have the right to claim that we have done anything on our own . God gives us what it takes to do all we do .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	6	( B ) He makes us worthy to be the servants of his new agreement that comes from the Holy Spirit and not from a written Law . After all , the Law brings death , but the Spirit brings life .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	7	( C ) The Law of Moses brought only the promise of death , even though it was carved on stones and given in a wonderful way . Still the Law made Moses ' face shine so brightly the people of Israel could not look at it , even though it was a fading glory .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	8	So wo n't the agreement the Spirit brings to us be even more wonderful ?
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	9	If something that brings the death sentence is glorious , wo n't something that makes us acceptable to God be even more glorious ?
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	10	In fact , the new agreement is so wonderful that the Law is no longer glorious at all .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	11	The Law was given with a glory that faded away . But the glory of the new agreement is much greater , because it will never fade away .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	12	This wonderful hope makes us feel like speaking freely .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	13	( D ) We are not like Moses . His face was shining , but he covered it to keep the people of Israel from seeing the brightness fade away .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	14	The people were stubborn , and something still keeps them from seeing the truth when the Law is read . Only Christ can take away the covering that keeps them from seeing .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	15	When the Law of Moses is read , they have their minds covered over
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	16	( E ) with a covering that is removed only for those who turn to the Lord .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	17	The Lord and the Spirit are one and the same , and the Lord 's Spirit sets us free .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	3	18	( F ) So our faces are not covered . They show the bright glory of the Lord , as the Lord 's Spirit makes us more and more like our glorious Lord . Footnotes - 3.2 our : Some manuscripts have “ your. ” Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	2	We do n't do shameful things that must be kept secret . And we do n't try to fool anyone or twist God 's message around . God is our witness that we speak only the truth , so others will be sure we can be trusted .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	4	The god who rules this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers . They can not see the light , which is the good news about our glorious Christ , who shows what God is like .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	3	If there is anything hidden about our message , it is hidden only to someone who is lost .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	5	We are not preaching about ourselves . Our message is that Jesus Christ is Lord . He also sent us to be your servants .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	6	( A ) The Scriptures say , “ God commanded light to shine in the dark. ” Now God is shining in our hearts to let you know that his glory is seen in Jesus Christ .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	7	We are like clay jars in which this treasure is stored . The real power comes from God and not from us .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We often suffer , but we are never crushed . Even when we do n't know what to do , we never give up .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	9	In times of trouble , God is with us , and when we are knocked down , we get up again . 10-11 We face death every day because of Jesus . Our bodies show what his death was like , so his life can also be seen in us .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	12	This means that death is working in us , but life is working in you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	13	In the Scriptures it says , “ I spoke because I had faith. ” We have this same kind of faith . So we speak
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	14	because we know that God raised the Lord Jesus to life . And just as God raised Jesus , he will also raise us to life . Then he will bring us into his presence together with you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	15	All of this has been done for you , so more and more people will know how kind God is and will praise and honor him . Faith in the Lord
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	16	We never give up . Our bodies are gradually dying , but we ourselves are being made stronger each day .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	17	These little troubles are getting us ready for an eternal glory that will make all our troubles seem like nothing .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	4	18	Things that are seen do n't last forever , but things that are not seen are eternal . This is why we keep our minds on the things that can not be seen . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	2	While we are here on earth , we sigh because we want to live in that heavenly home .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	5	God is the one who makes all this possible . He has given us his Spirit to make us certain he will do it .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	3	We want to put it on like clothes and not be naked .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	4	These tents we now live in are like a heavy burden , and we groan . But we do n't do this just because we want to leave these bodies that will die . It is because we want to change them for bodies that will never die .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So always be cheerful ! As long as we are in these bodies , we are away from the Lord .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	7	But we live by faith , not by what we see .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	8	We should be cheerful , because we would rather leave these bodies and be at home with the Lord .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	9	But whether we are at home with the Lord or away from him , we still try our best to please him .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	10	( B ) After all , Christ will judge each of us for the good or the bad that we do while living in these bodies . Bringing People to God
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	11	We know what it means to respect the Lord , and we encourage everyone to turn to him . God himself knows what we are like , and I hope you also know what kind of people we are .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not trying once more to brag about ourselves . But we want you to be proud of us , when you are with those who are not sincere and brag about what others think of them .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	13	If we seem out of our minds , it is between God and us . But if we are in our right minds , it is for your good .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	14	We are ruled by Christ 's love for us . We are certain that if one person died for everyone else , then all of us have died .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	15	And Christ did die for all of us . He died so we would no longer live for ourselves , but for the one who died and was raised to life for us .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	16	We are careful not to judge people by what they seem to be , though we once judged Christ in this way .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Anyone who belongs to Christ is a new person . The past is forgotten , and everything is new .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	18	God has done it all ! He sent Christ to make peace between himself and us , and he has given us the work of making peace between himself and others .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	19	What we mean is that God was in Christ , offering peace and forgiveness to the people of this world . And he has given us the work of sharing his message about peace .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	20	We were sent to speak for Christ , and God is begging you to listen to our message . We speak for Christ and sincerely ask you to make peace with God .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	5	21	Christ never sinned ! But God treated him as a sinner , so Christ could make us acceptable to God . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	2	( A ) In the Scriptures God says , “ When the time came , I listened to you , and when you needed help , I came to save you. ” That time has come . This is the day for you to be saved .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	6	But we have kept ourselves pure and have been understanding , patient , and kind . The Holy Spirit has been with us , and our love has been real .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We do n't want anyone to find fault with our work , and so we try hard not to cause problems .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	4	But in everything and in every way we show we truly are God 's servants . We have always been patient , though we have had a lot of trouble , suffering , and hard times .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	5	( B ) We have been beaten , put in jail , and hurt in riots . We have worked hard and have gone without sleep or food .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	7	We have spoken the truth , and God 's power has worked in us . In all our struggles we have said and done only what is right .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	8	Whether we were honored or dishonored or praised or cursed , we always told the truth about ourselves . But some people said we did not .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	9	We are unknown to others , but well known to you . We seem to be dying , and yet we are still alive . We have been punished , but never killed ,
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	10	and we are always happy , even in times of suffering . Although we are poor , we have made many people rich . And though we own nothing , everything is ours .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	11	Friends in Corinth , we are telling the truth when we say there is room in our hearts for you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	12	We are not holding back on our love for you , but you are holding back on your love for us .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	13	I speak to you as I would speak to my own children . Please make room in your hearts for us . The Temple of the Living God
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Stay away from people who are not followers of the Lord ! Can someone who is good get along with someone who is evil ? Are light and darkness the same ?
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	15	Is Christ a friend of Satan ? [ a ] Can people who follow the Lord have anything in common with those who do n't ?
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	16	( C ) Do idols belong in the temple of God ? We are the temple of the living God , as God himself says , “ I will live with these people and walk among them . I will be their God , and they will be my people. ”
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	17	( D ) The Lord also says , “ Leave them and stay away ! Do n't touch anything that is n't clean . Then I will welcome you
CEV	2%20Corinthians	6	18	( E ) and be your Father . You will be my sons and my daughters , as surely as I am God , the All-Powerful. ” Footnotes - 6.15 Satan : The Greek text has “ Beliar , ” which is another form of the Hebrew word “ Belial , ” meaning “ wicked ” or “ useless. ” The Jewish people sometimes used this as a name for Satan .

CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Make a place for us in your hearts ! We have n't mistreated or hurt anyone . We have n't cheated anyone .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	7	Of course , we were glad to see Titus , but what really made us glad is the way you cheered him up . He told how sorry you were and how concerned you were about me . And this made me even happier .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I am not saying this to be hard on you . But , as I have said before , you will always be in our thoughts , whether we live or die .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I trust you completely . [ a ] I am always proud of you , and I am greatly encouraged . In all my trouble I am still very happy .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	5	( A ) After we came to Macedonia , we did n't have any chance to rest . We were faced with all kinds of problems . We were troubled by enemies and troubled by fears .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God cheers up people in need , and this is what he did when he sent Titus to us .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	8	I do n't feel bad anymore , even though my letter [ b ] hurt your feelings . I did feel bad at first , but I do n't now . I know that the letter hurt you for a while .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I am happy , but not because I hurt your feelings . It is because God used your hurt feelings to make you turn back to him , and none of you were harmed by us .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	10	When God makes you feel sorry enough to turn to him and be saved , you do n't have anything to feel bad about . But when this world makes you feel sorry , it can cause your death .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	11	Just look what God has done by making you feel sorry ! You sincerely want to prove you are innocent . You are angry . You are shocked . You are eager to see that justice is done . You have proved that you were completely right in this matter .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	12	When I wrote you , it was n't to accuse the one who was wrong or to take up for the one who was hurt . I wrote , so God would show you how much you do care for us .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	13	And we were greatly encouraged . Although we were encouraged , we felt even better when we saw how happy Titus was , because you had shown he had nothing to worry about .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	14	We had told him how much we thought of you , and you did not disappoint us . Just as we have always told you the truth , so everything we told him about you has also proved to be true .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	15	Titus loves all of you very much , especially when he remembers how you obeyed him and how you trembled with fear when you welcomed him .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	7	16	It makes me really glad to know I can depend on you . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	2	Although they were going through hard times and were very poor , they were glad to give generously .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I am not ordering you to do this . I am simply testing how real your love is by comparing it with the concern that others have shown .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	3	They gave as much as they could afford and even more , simply because they wanted to .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	4	They even asked and begged us to let them have the joy of giving their money for God 's people .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And they did more than we had hoped . They gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us , just as God wanted them to do .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	6	Titus was the one who got you started doing this good thing , so we begged him to help you finish what you had begun .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	7	You do everything better than anyone else . You have stronger faith . You speak better and know more . You are eager to give , and you love us better . [ b ] Now you must give more generously than anyone else .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	9	You know our Lord Jesus Christ treated us with undeserved grace by giving up all his riches , so you could become rich .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	10	A year ago you were the first ones to give , and you gave because you wanted to . So listen to my advice .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	11	I think you should finish what you started . If you give according to what you have , you will prove you are as eager to give as you were to think about giving .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	12	It does n't matter how much you have . What matters is how much you are willing to give from what you have .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	13	I am not trying to make life easier for others by making life harder for you . But it is only fair
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	14	for you to share with them when you have so much , and they have so little . Later , when they have more than enough , and you are in need , they can share with you . Then everyone will have a fair share ,
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	15	( B ) just as the Scriptures say , “ Those who gathered too much had nothing left . Those who gathered only a little had all they needed. ” Titus and His Friends
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	16	I am grateful that God made Titus care as much about you as we do .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	17	When we begged Titus to visit you , he said he would . He wanted to because he cared so much for you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	18	With Titus we are also sending one of the Lord 's followers who is well known in every church for spreading the good news .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	19	The churches chose this follower to travel with us while we carry this gift that will bring praise to the Lord and show how much we hope to help .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	20	We do n't want anyone to find fault with the way we handle your generous gift .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	21	( C ) But we want to do what pleases the Lord and what people think is right .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	22	We are also sending someone else with Titus and the other follower . We approve of this man . In fact , he has already shown us many times that he wants to help . And now he wants to help even more than ever , because he trusts you so much .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Titus is my partner , who works with me to serve you . The other two followers are sent by the churches , and they bring honor to Christ .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Treat them in such a way that the churches will see your love and will know why we bragged about you . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	2	I know how eager you are to give . And I have proudly told the Lord 's followers in Macedonia that you people in Achaia have been ready for a whole year . Now your desire to give has made them want to give .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	9	( B ) The Scriptures say , “ God freely gives his gifts to the poor , and always does right. ”
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	3	This is why I am sending Titus and the two others to you . I want you to be ready , just as I promised . This will prove we were not wrong to brag about you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	4	Some followers from Macedonia may come with me , and I want them to find that you have the money ready . If you do n't , I would be embarrassed for trusting you to do this . But you would be embarrassed even more .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I have decided to ask Titus and the others to spend some time with you before I arrive . This way they can arrange to collect the money you have promised . Then you will have the chance to give because you want to , and not because you feel forced to .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Remember this saying , “ A few seeds make a small harvest , but a lot of seeds make a big harvest. ”
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	7	( A ) Each of you must make up your own mind about how much to give . But do n't feel sorry that you must give and do n't feel you are forced to give . God loves people who love to give .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	8	God can bless you with everything you need , and you will always have more than enough to do all kinds of good things for others .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	10	( C ) God gives seed to farmers and provides everyone with food . He will increase what you have , so you can give even more to those in need .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	11	You will be blessed in every way , and you will be able to keep on being generous . Then many people will thank God when we deliver your gift .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	12	What you are doing is much more than a service that supplies God 's people with what they need . It is something that will make many others thank God .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	13	The way in which you have proved yourselves by this service will bring honor and praise to God . You believed the message about Christ , and you obeyed it by sharing generously with God 's people and with everyone else .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	9	14	Now they are praying for you and want to see you , because God used you to bless them so very much .

CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	2	Some people have said we act like the people of this world . So when I arrive , I expect I will have to be firm and forceful in what I say to them . Please do n't make me treat you that way .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	10	Some of you are saying , “ Paul 's letters are harsh and powerful . But in person , he is a weakling and has nothing worth saying. ”
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	3	We live in this world , but we do n't act like its people
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	4	or fight our battles with the weapons of this world . Instead , we use God 's power that can destroy fortresses . We destroy arguments
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	5	and every bit of pride that keeps anyone from knowing God . We capture people 's thoughts and make them obey Christ .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	6	And when you completely obey him , we will punish anyone who refuses to obey .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	7	You judge by appearances . [ a ] If any of you think you are the only ones who belong to Christ , then think again . We belong to Christ as much as you do .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	8	Maybe I brag a little too much about the authority that the Lord gave me to help you and not to hurt you . Yet I am not embarrassed to brag .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	9	And I am not trying to scare you with my letters .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Those people had better understand that when I am with you , I will do exactly what I say in my letters .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	12	We wo n't dare compare ourselves with those who think so much of themselves . But they are foolish to compare themselves with themselves .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	13	We wo n't brag about something we do n't have a right to brag about . We will only brag about the work God has sent us to do , and you are part of that work .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	14	We are not bragging more than we should . After all , we did bring the message about Christ to you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	15	We do n't brag about what others have done , as if we had done those things ourselves . But I hope as you become stronger in your faith , we will be able to reach many more of the people around you . [ b ] That has always been our goal .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	16	Then we will be able to preach the good news in other lands where we can not take credit for work someone else has already done .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	10	17	( A ) The Scriptures say , “ If you want to brag , then brag about the Lord. ”

CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	2	I am as concerned about you as God is . You were like a virgin bride I had chosen only for Christ .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	11	And it is n't because I do n't love you . God himself knows how much I do love you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	3	( A ) But now I fear that you will be tricked , just as Eve was tricked by that lying snake . I am afraid that you might stop thinking about Christ in an honest and sincere way .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	4	We told you about Jesus , and you received the Holy Spirit and accepted our message . But you let some people tell you about another Jesus . Now you are ready to receive another spirit and accept a different message .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	5	I think I am as good as any of those super apostles .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	6	I may not speak as well as they do , but I know as much . And this has already been made perfectly clear to you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Was it wrong for me to lower myself and honor you by preaching God 's message free of charge ?
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by taking money from them to serve you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	9	( B ) Even when I was in need , I still did n't bother you . In fact , some of the Lord 's followers from Macedonia brought me what I needed . I have not been a burden to you in the past , and I will never be a burden .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	10	As surely as I speak the truth about Christ , no one in Achaia can stop me from bragging about this .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	12	I plan to go on doing just what I have always done . Then those people wo n't be able to brag about doing the same things we are doing .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	13	Anyway , they are no more than false apostles and dishonest workers . They only pretend to be apostles of Christ .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And it is no wonder . Even Satan tries to make himself look like an angel of light .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	15	So why does it seem strange for Satan 's servants to pretend to do what is right ? Someday they will get exactly what they deserve . Paul 's Sufferings for Christ
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I do n't want any of you to think I am a fool . But if you do , then let me be a fool and brag a little .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	17	When I do all this bragging , I do it as a fool and not for the Lord .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Yet if others want to brag about what they have done , so will I .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	19	And since you are so smart , you will gladly put up with a fool .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	20	In fact , you let people make slaves of you and cheat you and steal from you . Why , you even let them strut around and slap you in the face .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I am ashamed to say we are too weak to behave in such a way . If they can brag , so can I , but it is a foolish thing to do .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Jews ? So am I . Are they from the family of Abraham ? Well , so am I .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	23	( C ) Are they servants of Christ ? I am a fool to talk this way , but I serve him better than they do . I have worked harder and have been put in jail more times . I have been beaten with whips more and have been in danger of death more often .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	24	( D ) Five times my own people gave me
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	39	lashes with a whip .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	25	( E ) Three times the Romans beat me with a big stick , and once my enemies stoned me . I have been shipwrecked three times , and I even had to spend a night and a day in the sea .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	26	( F ) During my many travels , I have been in danger from rivers , robbers , my own people , and foreigners . My life has been in danger in cities , in deserts , at sea , and with people who only pretended to be the Lord 's followers .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	27	I have worked and struggled and spent many sleepless nights . I have gone hungry and thirsty and often had nothing to eat . I have been cold from not having enough clothes to keep me warm .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Besides everything else , each day I am burdened down , worrying about all the churches .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	29	When others are weak , I am weak too . When others are tricked into sin , I get angry . [ a ]
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I have to brag , I will brag about how weak I am .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	31	God , the Father of our Lord Jesus , knows I am not lying . And God is to be praised forever !
CEV	2%20Corinthians	11	32	( G ) The governor of Damascus at the time of King Aretas had the city gates guarded , so he could capture me .

CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I know about one of Christ 's followers who was taken up into the third heaven
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	12	When I was with you , I was patient and worked all the powerful miracles and signs and wonders of a true apostle .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	14	I am planning to visit you for the third time . But I still wo n't make a burden of myself . What I really want is you , and not what you have . Children are not supposed to save up for their parents , but parents are supposed to take care of their children .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	3	As I said , only God really knows if this man was in his body at the time .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	4	But he was taken up into paradise , [ a ] where he heard things too wonderful to tell .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	5	I will brag about that man , but not about myself , except to say how weak I am .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	6	Yet even if I did brag , I would not be foolish . I would simply be speaking the truth . But I will try not to say too much . That way , none of you will think more highly of me than you should because of what you have seen me do and say .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	7	Of course , I am now referring to the wonderful things I saw . One of Satan 's angels was sent to make me suffer terribly , so that I would not feel too proud . [ b ]
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Three times I begged the Lord to make this suffering go away .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	9	But he replied , “ My gift of undeserved grace is all you need . My power is strongest when you are weak. ” So if Christ keeps giving me his power , I will gladly brag about how weak I am .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Yes , I am glad to be weak or insulted or mistreated or to have troubles and sufferings , if it is for Christ . Because when I am weak , I am strong . Paul 's Concern for the Lord 's Followers at Corinth
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have been making a fool of myself . But you forced me to do it , when you should have been speaking up for me . I may be nothing at all , but I am as good as those super apostles .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	13	You missed out on only one blessing the other churches received . That is , you did n't have to support me . Forgive me for doing you wrong .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	15	So I will gladly give all I have and all I am . Will you love me less for loving you too much ?
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	16	You agree that I was n't a burden to you . Maybe that 's because I was trying to catch you off guard and trick you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Were you cheated by any of those I sent to you ?
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I urged Titus to visit you , and I sent another follower with him . But Titus did n't cheat you , and we felt and behaved the same way he did .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you ? Actually , we have been speaking to God as followers of Christ . But , my friends , we did it all for your good .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	20	I am afraid when I come , we wo n't be pleased with each other . I fear that some of you may be arguing or jealous or angry or selfish or gossiping or insulting each other . I even fear that you may be proud and acting like a mob .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid God will make me ashamed when I visit you again . I will feel like crying because many of you have never given up your old sins . You are still doing things that are immoral , indecent , and shameful . Footnotes - 12.4 paradise : In the Greek translation of the Old Testament , this word is used for the Garden of Eden . In New Testament times it was sometimes used for the place where God 's people are happy and at rest , as they wait for the final judgment . - 12.7 Of course … too proud : Or “ Because of the wonderful things I saw , one of Satan 's angels was sent to make me suffer terribly , so I would not feel too proud. ” Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Corinthians	13	3	This should prove to you that I am speaking for Christ . When he corrects you , he wo n't be weak . He will be powerful !
CEV	2%20Corinthians	13	4	Although he was weak when he was nailed to the cross , he now lives by the power of God . We are weak , just as Christ was . But you will see that we will live by the power of God , just as Christ does .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Test yourselves and find out if you really are true to your faith . If you pass the test , you will discover that Christ is living in you . But if Christ is n't living in you , you have failed .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	13	6	I hope you will discover we have not failed .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	13	7	We pray you will stop doing evil things . We do n't pray like this to make ourselves look good , but to get you to do right , even if we are failures .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	13	8	All we can do is to follow the truth and not fight against it .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	13	9	Even though we are weak , we are glad that you are strong , and we pray you will do even better .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	13	10	I am writing these things to you before I arrive . This way I wo n't have to be hard on you when I use the authority the Lord has given me . I was given this authority , so I could help you and not destroy you .
CEV	2%20Corinthians	13	11	Goodbye , my friends . Do better and pay attention to what I have said . Try to get along and live peacefully with each other . Now I pray that God , who gives love and peace , will be with you .

CEV	Galatians	1	1	1-2 From the apostle Paul and from all the Lord 's followers with me . I was chosen to be an apostle by Jesus Christ and by God the Father , who raised him from death . No mere human chose or appointed me to this work . To the churches in Galatia :
CEV	Galatians	1	3	I pray that God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
CEV	Galatians	1	4	Christ obeyed God our Father and gave himself as a sacrifice for our sins to rescue us from this evil world .
CEV	Galatians	1	5	God will be given glory forever and ever . Amen . The Only True Message
CEV	Galatians	1	6	I am shocked that you have so quickly turned from God , who chose you with his gift of undeserved grace . [ a ] You have believed another message ,
CEV	Galatians	1	7	when there is really only one true message . But some people are causing you trouble and want to make you turn away from the good news about Christ .
CEV	Galatians	1	8	I pray that God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from our message to you ! It does n't matter if that person is one of us or an angel from heaven .
CEV	Galatians	1	9	I have said it before , and I will say it again . I hope God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from what you have already believed .
CEV	Galatians	1	10	I am not trying to please people . I want to please God . Do you think I am trying to please people ? If I were doing that , I would not be a servant of Christ . How Paul Became an Apostle
CEV	Galatians	1	11	My friends , I want you to know that no one made up the message I preach .
CEV	Galatians	1	12	It was n't given or taught to me by some mere human . My message came directly from Jesus Christ when he appeared to me .
CEV	Galatians	1	13	( A ) You know how I used to live as a Jew . I was cruel to God 's church and even tried to destroy it .
CEV	Galatians	1	14	( B ) I was a much better Jew than anyone else my own age , and I obeyed every law our ancestors had given us .
CEV	Galatians	1	15	days .
CEV	Galatians	1	16	to show me his Son , so I would announce his message to the Gentiles . I did n't talk this over with anyone .
CEV	Galatians	1	17	I did n't say a word , not even to the men in Jerusalem who were apostles before I was . Instead , I went at once to Arabia , and afterwards I returned to Damascus .
CEV	Galatians	1	18	( D ) Three years later I went to visit Peter [ b ] in Jerusalem and stayed with him for
CEV	Galatians	1	19	The only other apostle I saw was James , the Lord 's brother .
CEV	Galatians	1	20	And in the presence of God I swear I am telling the truth .
CEV	Galatians	1	21	Later , I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
CEV	Galatians	1	22	But no one who belonged to Christ 's churches in Judea had ever seen me in person .
CEV	Galatians	1	23	They had only heard that the one who had been cruel to them was now preaching the message that he had once tried to destroy .
CEV	Galatians	1	24	And because of me , they praised God . Copyright ©

CEV	Galatians	2	2	But I went there because God had told me to go , and I explained the good news I had been preaching to the Gentiles . Then I met privately with the ones who seemed to be the most important leaders . I wanted to make sure my work in the past and my future work would not be for nothing .
CEV	Galatians	2	3	Titus went to Jerusalem with me . He was a Greek , but still he was n't forced to be circumcised .
CEV	Galatians	2	4	We went there because of those who pretended to be followers and had sneaked in among us as spies . They had come to take away the freedom Christ Jesus had given us , and they were trying to make us their slaves .
CEV	Galatians	2	5	But we wanted you to have the true message . This is why we did n't give in to them , not even for a second .
CEV	Galatians	2	6	( B ) Some of them were supposed to be important leaders , but I did n't care who they were . God does n't have any favorites ! None of these so-called special leaders added anything to my message .
CEV	Galatians	2	7	They realized God had sent me with the good news for Gentiles , and he had sent Peter with the same message for Jews .
CEV	Galatians	2	8	God , who had sent Peter on a mission to the Jews , was now using me to preach to the Gentiles .
CEV	Galatians	2	9	James , Peter , [ a ] and John realized that God had given me the message about his gift of undeserved grace . And these men are supposed to be the backbone of the church . They even gave Barnabas and me a friendly handshake . This was to show that we would work with Gentiles and that they would work with Jews .
CEV	Galatians	2	10	They only asked us to remember the poor , and this was something I had always been eager to do . Paul Corrects Peter at Antioch
CEV	Galatians	2	11	When Peter came to Antioch , I told him face to face that he was wrong .
CEV	Galatians	2	12	He used to eat with Gentile followers of the Lord , until James sent some Jewish followers . Peter was afraid of the Jews and soon stopped eating with Gentiles .
CEV	Galatians	2	13	He and the others hid their true feelings so well that even Barnabas was fooled .
CEV	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw they were not really obeying the truth that is in the good news , I corrected Peter in front of everyone and said : Peter , you are a Jew , but you live like a Gentile . So how can you force Gentiles to live like Jews ?
CEV	Galatians	2	15	We are Jews by birth and are not sinners like Gentiles .
CEV	Galatians	2	16	( C ) But we know that God accepts only those who have faith in Jesus Christ . No one can please God by simply obeying the Law . So we put our faith in Christ Jesus , and God accepted us because of our faith .
CEV	Galatians	2	17	When we Jews started looking for a way to please God , we discovered that we are sinners too . Does this mean that Christ is the one who makes us sinners ? No , it does n't !
CEV	Galatians	2	18	But if I tear down something and then build it again , I prove that I was wrong at first .
CEV	Galatians	2	19	It was the Law itself that killed me and freed me from its power , so I could live for God . I have been nailed to the cross with Christ .
CEV	Galatians	2	20	I have died , but Christ lives in me . And I now live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave his life for me .
CEV	Galatians	2	21	I do n't turn my back on God 's gift of undeserved grace . If we can be acceptable to God by obeying the Law , it was useless for Christ to die . Footnotes - 2.9 Peter : See the note at 1.18 . Copyright ©

CEV	Galatians	3	3	How can you be so stupid ? Do you think that by yourself you can complete what God 's Spirit started in you ?
CEV	Galatians	3	2	I want to know only one thing . How were you given God 's Spirit ? Was it by obeying the Law of Moses or by hearing about Christ and having faith in him ?
CEV	Galatians	3	4	Have you gone through all of this for nothing ? Is it all really for nothing ?
CEV	Galatians	3	5	God gives you his Spirit and works miracles in you . But does he do this because you obey the Law of Moses or because you have heard about Christ and have faith in him ?
CEV	Galatians	3	6	( A ) The Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith .
CEV	Galatians	3	7	( B ) And so , you should understand that everyone who has faith is a child of Abraham . [ a ]
CEV	Galatians	3	8	( C ) Long ago the Scriptures said God would accept the Gentiles because of their faith . This is why God told Abraham the good news that all nations would be blessed because of him .
CEV	Galatians	3	9	This means everyone who has faith will share in the blessings given to Abraham because of his faith .
CEV	Galatians	3	10	( D ) Anyone who tries to please God by obeying the Law is under a curse . The Scriptures say , “ Everyone who does n't obey everything in the Law is under a curse. ”
CEV	Galatians	3	11	( E ) No one can please God by obeying the Law . The Scriptures also say , “ The people God accepts because of their faith will live. ” [ b ]
CEV	Galatians	3	12	( F ) The Law is n't based on faith . It promises life only to people who obey its commands .
CEV	Galatians	3	13	( G ) But Christ rescued us from the Law 's curse , when he became a curse in our place . This is because the Scriptures say that anyone who is nailed to a tree is under a curse .
CEV	Galatians	3	14	And because of what Jesus Christ has done , the blessing promised to Abraham was taken to the Gentiles . This happened so that by faith we would be given the promised Holy Spirit . The Law and the Promise
CEV	Galatians	3	15	My friends , I will use an everyday example to explain what I mean . Once someone agrees to something , no one else can change or cancel the agreement . [ c ]
CEV	Galatians	3	16	That is how it is with the promises God made to Abraham and his descendant . [ d ] The promises were not made to many descendants , but only to one , and that one is Christ .
CEV	Galatians	3	17	( H ) What I am saying is that the Law can not change or cancel God 's promise made
CEV	Galatians	3	430	years before the Law was given .
CEV	Galatians	3	18	( I ) If we have to obey the Law in order to receive God 's blessings , those blessings do n't really come to us because of God 's promise . But God was kind to Abraham and made him a promise .
CEV	Galatians	3	19	What is the use of the Law ? It was given later to show that we sin . But it was only supposed to last until the coming of that descendant [ e ] who was given the promise . In fact , angels gave the Law to Moses , and he gave it to the people .
CEV	Galatians	3	20	There is only one God , and the Law did not come directly from him . Slaves and Children
CEV	Galatians	3	21	Does the Law disagree with God 's promises ? No , it does n't ! If any law could give life to us , we could become acceptable to God by obeying that law .
CEV	Galatians	3	22	But the Scriptures say that sin controls everyone , so that God 's promises will be for anyone who has faith in Jesus Christ .
CEV	Galatians	3	23	The Law controlled us and kept us under its power until the time came when we would have faith .
CEV	Galatians	3	24	In fact , the Law was to be our teacher until Christ came . Then we could have faith and be acceptable to God .
CEV	Galatians	3	25	But once a person has learned to have faith , there is no more need to have the Law as a teacher .
CEV	Galatians	3	26	All of you are God 's children because of your faith in Christ Jesus .
CEV	Galatians	3	27	And when you were baptized , it was as though you had put on Christ in the same way you put on new clothes .
CEV	Galatians	3	28	Faith in Christ Jesus is what makes each of you equal with each other , whether you are a Jew or a Greek , a slave or a free person , a man or a woman .
CEV	Galatians	3	29	( J ) So if you belong to Christ , you are now part of Abraham 's family , [ f ] and you will be given what God has promised . Footnotes - 3.7 a child of Abraham : God chose Abraham , and so it was believed that anyone who was a child of Abraham was also a child of God ( see the note at 3.29 ) . - 3.11 The people God accepts because of their faith will live : Or “ The people God accepts will live because of their faith. ” - 3.15 Once someone … cancel the agreement : Or “ Once a person makes out a will , no one can change or cancel it. ” - 3.16 descendant : The Greek text has “ seed , ” which may mean one or many descendants . In this verse Paul says it means Christ . - 3.19 that descendant : Jesus . - 3.29 you are now part of Abraham 's family : Paul tells the Galatians that faith in Jesus Christ is what makes someone a true child of Abraham and of God ( see the note at 3.7 ) .

CEV	Galatians	4	4	But when the time was right , God sent his Son , and a woman gave birth to him . His Son obeyed the Law ,
CEV	Galatians	4	1	Children who are under age are no better off than slaves , even though everything their parents own will someday be theirs .
CEV	Galatians	4	2	This is because children are placed in the care of guardians and teachers until the time their parents have set .
CEV	Galatians	4	3	This is how it was with us . We were like children ruled by the powers of this world .
CEV	Galatians	4	5	( A ) so he could set us free from the Law , and we could become God 's children .
CEV	Galatians	4	6	( B ) Now that we are his children , God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts . And his Spirit tells us that God is our Father .
CEV	Galatians	4	7	You are no longer slaves . You are God 's children , and you will be given what he has promised . Paul 's Concern for the Galatians
CEV	Galatians	4	8	Before you knew God , you were slaves of gods that are not real .
CEV	Galatians	4	9	But now you know God , or better still , God knows you . How can you turn back and become the slaves of those weak and pitiful powers ? [ a ]
CEV	Galatians	4	10	You even celebrate certain days , months , seasons , and years .
CEV	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid I have wasted my time working with you .
CEV	Galatians	4	12	My friends , I beg you to be like me , just as I once tried to be like you . Did you mistreat me
CEV	Galatians	4	13	when I first preached to you ? No you did n't , even though you knew I had come there because I was sick .
CEV	Galatians	4	14	My illness must have caused you some trouble , but you did n't hate me or turn me away because of it . You welcomed me as though I were one of God 's angels or even Christ Jesus himself .
CEV	Galatians	4	15	Where is that good feeling now ? I am sure if it had been possible , you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me .
CEV	Galatians	4	16	Am I now your enemy , just because I told you the truth ?
CEV	Galatians	4	17	Those people may be paying you a lot of attention , but it is n't for your good . They only want to keep you away from me , so you will pay them a lot of attention .
CEV	Galatians	4	18	It is always good to give your attention to something worthwhile , even when I am not with you .
CEV	Galatians	4	19	My children , I am in terrible pain until Christ may be seen living in you .
CEV	Galatians	4	20	I wish I were with you now . Then I would not have to talk this way . You really have me puzzled . Hagar and Sarah
CEV	Galatians	4	21	Some of you would like to be under the rule of the Law of Moses . But do you know what the Law says ?
CEV	Galatians	4	22	( C ) In the Scriptures we learn that Abraham had two sons . The mother of one of them was a slave , while the mother of the other one had always been free .
CEV	Galatians	4	23	The son of the slave woman was born in the usual way . But the son of the free woman was born because of God 's promise .
CEV	Galatians	4	24	All of this has another meaning as well . Each of the two women stands for one of the agreements God made with his people . Hagar , the slave woman , stands for the agreement that was made at Mount Sinai . Everyone born into her family is a slave .
CEV	Galatians	4	25	Hagar also stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia [ b ] and for the present city of Jerusalem . She [ c ] and her children are slaves .
CEV	Galatians	4	26	( D ) But our mother is the city of Jerusalem in heaven above , and she is n't a slave .
CEV	Galatians	4	27	( E ) The Scriptures say about her , “ You have never had children , but now you can be glad . You have never given birth , but now you can shout . Once you had no children , but now you will have more children than a woman who has been married for a long time. ”
CEV	Galatians	4	28	My friends , you were born because of this promise , just as Isaac was .
CEV	Galatians	4	29	( F ) But the child who was born in the natural way made trouble for the child who was born because of the Spirit . The same thing is happening today .
CEV	Galatians	4	30	( G ) The Scriptures say , “ Get rid of the slave woman and her son ! He wo n't be given anything . The son of the free woman will receive everything. ”
CEV	Galatians	4	31	My friends , we are children of the free woman and not of the slave . Footnotes - 4.9 powers : Spirits were thought to control human lives and were believed to be connected with the movements of the stars . - 4.25 Hagar also stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia : Some manuscripts have “ Sinai is a mountain in Arabia. ” This sentence would then be translated : “ Sinai is a mountain in Arabia , and Hagar stands for the present city of Jerusalem. ” - 4.25 She : “ Hagar ” or “ Jerusalem. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Galatians	5	5	But the Spirit makes us sure God will accept us because of our faith in Christ .
CEV	Galatians	5	2	I , Paul , promise you that Christ wo n't do you any good if you get circumcised .
CEV	Galatians	5	3	If you do , you must obey the whole Law .
CEV	Galatians	5	4	And if you try to please God by obeying the Law , you have cut yourself off from Christ and his gift of undeserved grace .
CEV	Galatians	5	6	If you are a follower of Christ Jesus , it makes no difference whether you are circumcised or not . All that matters is your faith that makes you love others .
CEV	Galatians	5	7	You were doing so well until someone made you turn from the truth .
CEV	Galatians	5	8	And that person was certainly not sent by the one who chose you .
CEV	Galatians	5	9	( A ) A little yeast can change a whole batch of dough ,
CEV	Galatians	5	10	but you belong to the Lord . This makes me certain you will do what I say , instead of what someone else tells you to do . Whoever is causing trouble for you will be punished .
CEV	Galatians	5	11	My friends , if I still preach that people need to be circumcised , why am I in so much trouble ? The message about the cross would no longer be a problem , if I told people to be circumcised .
CEV	Galatians	5	12	I wish everyone who is upsetting you would not only get circumcised , but would cut off much more !
CEV	Galatians	5	13	My friends , you were chosen to be free . So do n't use your freedom as an excuse to do anything you want . Use it as an opportunity to serve each other with love .
CEV	Galatians	5	14	( B ) All the Law says can be summed up in the command to love others as much as you love yourself .
CEV	Galatians	5	15	But if you keep attacking each other like wild animals , you had better watch out or you will destroy yourselves . God 's Spirit and Our Own Desires
CEV	Galatians	5	16	If you are guided by the Spirit , you wo n't obey your selfish desires .
CEV	Galatians	5	17	( C ) The Spirit and your desires are enemies of each other . They are always fighting each other and keeping you from doing what you feel you should .
CEV	Galatians	5	18	But if you obey the Spirit , the Law of Moses has no control over you .
CEV	Galatians	5	19	People 's desires make them give in to immoral ways , filthy thoughts , and shameful deeds .
CEV	Galatians	5	20	They worship idols , practice witchcraft , hate others , and are hard to get along with . People become jealous , angry , and selfish . They not only argue and cause trouble , but they are
CEV	Galatians	5	21	envious . They get drunk , carry on at wild parties , and do other evil things as well . I told you before , and I am telling you again : No one who does these things will share in the blessings of God 's kingdom .
CEV	Galatians	5	22	God 's Spirit makes us loving , happy , peaceful , patient , kind , good , faithful ,
CEV	Galatians	5	23	gentle , and self-controlled . There is no law against behaving in any of these ways .
CEV	Galatians	5	24	And because we belong to Christ Jesus , we have killed our selfish feelings and desires .
CEV	Galatians	5	25	God 's Spirit has given us life , and so we should follow the Spirit .
CEV	Galatians	5	26	But do n't be conceited or make others jealous by claiming to be better than they are . Copyright ©

CEV	Galatians	6	6	Share every good thing you have with anyone who teaches you what God has said .
CEV	Galatians	6	2	You obey the law of Christ when you offer each other a helping hand .
CEV	Galatians	6	3	If you think you are better than others , when you really are n't , you are wrong .
CEV	Galatians	6	4	Do your own work well , and then you will have something to be proud of . But do n't compare yourself with others .
CEV	Galatians	6	5	We each must carry our own load .
CEV	Galatians	6	7	You can not fool God , so do n't make a fool of yourself ! You will harvest what you plant .
CEV	Galatians	6	8	If you follow your selfish desires , you will harvest destruction , but if you follow the Spirit , you will harvest eternal life .
CEV	Galatians	6	9	Do n't get tired of helping others . You will be rewarded when the time is right , if you do n't give up .
CEV	Galatians	6	10	We should help people whenever we can , especially if they are followers of the Lord . Final Warnings
CEV	Galatians	6	11	You can see what big letters I make when I write with my own hand .
CEV	Galatians	6	12	Those people who are telling you to get circumcised are only trying to show how important they are . And they do n't want to get into trouble for preaching about the cross of Christ .
CEV	Galatians	6	13	They are circumcised , but they do n't obey the Law of Moses . All they want is to brag about having you circumcised .
CEV	Galatians	6	14	But I will never brag about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . Because of his cross , the world is dead as far as I am concerned , and I am dead as far as the world is concerned .
CEV	Galatians	6	15	It does n't matter if you are circumcised or not . All that matters is that you are a new person .
CEV	Galatians	6	16	If you follow this rule , you will belong to God 's true people . God will treat you with undeserved kindness and will bless you with peace .
CEV	Galatians	6	17	( A ) On my own body are scars that prove I belong to Christ Jesus . So I do n't want anyone to bother me anymore .
CEV	Galatians	6	18	My friends , I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you ! Amen . Copyright ©

CEV	Ephesians	2	2	You followed the ways of this world and obeyed the devil . He rules the world , and his spirit has power over everyone who does n't obey God .
CEV	Ephesians	2	3	Once we were also ruled by the selfish desires of our bodies and minds . We had made God angry , and we were going to be punished like everyone else . 4-5 But God was merciful ! We were dead because of our sins , but God loved us so much he made us alive with Christ , and God 's gift of undeserved grace is what saves you .
CEV	Ephesians	2	6	God raised us from death to life with Christ Jesus , and he has given us a place beside Christ in heaven .
CEV	Ephesians	2	7	God did this so in the future world he could show how truly good and kind he is to us because of what Christ Jesus has done .
CEV	Ephesians	2	8	You were saved by faith in God , who treats us much better than we deserve . [ a ] This is God 's gift to you , and not anything you have done on your own .
CEV	Ephesians	2	9	It is n't something you have earned , so there is nothing you can brag about .

CEV	Ephesians	2	11	Do n't forget that you are Gentiles . In fact , you used to be called “ uncircumcised ” by those who take pride in being circumcised .
CEV	Ephesians	2	12	At that time you did not know about Christ . You were foreigners to the people of Israel , and you had no part in the promises God had made to them . You were living in this world without hope and without God ,
CEV	Ephesians	2	13	and you were far from God . But Christ offered his life 's blood as a sacrifice and brought you near God .
CEV	Ephesians	2	14	Christ has made peace between Jews and Gentiles , and he has united us by breaking down the wall of hatred that separated us . Christ gave his own body
CEV	Ephesians	2	15	( B ) to destroy the Law of Moses with all its rules and commands . He even brought Jews and Gentiles together as though we were only one person , when he united us in peace .
CEV	Ephesians	2	16	( C ) On the cross Christ did away with our hatred for each other . He also made peace [ b ] between us and God by uniting Jews and Gentiles in one body .

CEV	Ephesians	2	21	Christ is the one who holds the building together and makes it grow into a holy temple for the Lord .

CEV	Ephesians	3	3	In fact , this letter tells you a little about how God has shown me his mysterious ways .
CEV	Ephesians	3	2	You have surely heard about God 's gift of undeserved grace in choosing me to help you .
CEV	Ephesians	3	4	( A ) As you read the letter , you will also find out how well I really do understand the mystery about Christ .
CEV	Ephesians	3	5	No one knew about this mystery until God 's Spirit told it to his holy apostles and prophets .
CEV	Ephesians	3	6	And the mystery is this : Because of Christ Jesus , the good news has given the Gentiles a share in the promises God gave to the Jews . God has also let the Gentiles be part of the same body .
CEV	Ephesians	3	7	God treated me with kindness . His power worked in me , and it became my job to spread the good news .
CEV	Ephesians	3	8	I am the least important of all God 's people . But God was kind and chose me to tell the Gentiles that because of Christ there are blessings that can not be measured .
CEV	Ephesians	3	9	( B ) God , who created everything , wanted me to help everyone understand the mysterious plan that had always been hidden in his mind .
CEV	Ephesians	3	10	Then God would use the church to show the powers and authorities in the spiritual world that he has many different kinds of wisdom .
CEV	Ephesians	3	11	God did this according to his eternal plan . And he was able to do what he had planned because of all Christ Jesus our Lord had done .
CEV	Ephesians	3	12	Christ now gives us courage and confidence , so we can come to God by faith .
CEV	Ephesians	3	13	This is why you should not be discouraged when I suffer for you . After all , it will bring honor to you . Christ 's Love for Us

CEV	Ephesians	3	17	and that Christ will live in your hearts because of your faith . Stand firm and be deeply rooted in his love .
CEV	Ephesians	3	18	( C ) I pray that you and all God 's people will understand what is called wide or long or high or deep . [ b ]
CEV	Ephesians	3	19	I want you to know all about Christ 's love , although it is too wonderful to be measured .

CEV	Ephesians	4	9	When it says , “ he went up , ” it means that Christ had been deep in the earth .
CEV	Ephesians	4	10	This also means that the one who went deep into the earth is the same one who went into the highest heaven , so he would fill the whole universe .
CEV	Ephesians	4	11	Christ chose some of us to be apostles , prophets , missionaries , pastors , and teachers ,
CEV	Ephesians	4	12	so his people would learn to serve and his body would grow strong .

CEV	Philippians	1	7	You have a special place in my heart . So it is only natural for me to feel the way I do . All of you have helped in the work God has given me , as I defend the good news and tell about it here in jail .
CEV	Philippians	1	8	God himself knows how much I want to see you . He knows I care for you in the same way Christ Jesus does .
CEV	Philippians	1	9	I pray that your love will keep on growing and you will fully know and understand
CEV	Philippians	1	10	how to make the right choices . Then you will still be pure and innocent when Christ returns . And until that day ,
CEV	Philippians	1	11	Jesus Christ will keep you busy doing good deeds that bring glory and praise to God . What Life Means to Paul
CEV	Philippians	1	12	My dear friends , I want you to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the good news .
CEV	Philippians	1	13	( B ) The Roman guards and all the others know I am here in jail because I serve Christ .
CEV	Philippians	1	14	Now most of the Lord 's followers have become brave and are fearlessly telling the message . [ a ]
CEV	Philippians	1	15	Some are preaching about Christ because they are jealous and envious of us . Others are preaching because they want to help .
CEV	Philippians	1	16	They love Christ and know I am here to defend the good news about him .
CEV	Philippians	1	17	But the ones who are jealous of us are not sincere . They just want to cause trouble for me while I am in jail .
CEV	Philippians	1	18	But that does n't matter . All that matters is that people are telling about Christ , whether they are sincere or not . This is what makes me glad . I will keep on being glad ,
CEV	Philippians	1	19	because I know that your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Christ Jesus will keep me safe .
CEV	Philippians	1	20	I honestly expect and hope I will never do anything to be ashamed of . Whether I live or die , I always want to be as brave as I am now and bring honor to Christ .
CEV	Philippians	1	21	If I live , it will be for Christ , and if I die , I will gain even more .
CEV	Philippians	1	22	I do n't know what to choose . I could keep on living and doing something useful .
CEV	Philippians	1	23	It is a hard choice to make . I want to die and be with Christ , because this would be much better . 24-25 But I know that all of you still need me . This is why I am sure I will stay on to help you grow and be happy in your faith .
CEV	Philippians	1	26	Then , when I visit you again , you will have good reason to take great pride in Christ Jesus because of me . [ b ]
CEV	Philippians	1	27	Above all else , you must live in a way that brings honor to the good news about Christ . Then , whether I visit you or not , I will hear that all of you think alike . I will know that you are working together and are struggling side by side to get others to believe the good news .
CEV	Philippians	1	28	Be brave when you face your enemies . Your courage will show them that they are going to be destroyed , and it will show you that you will be saved . God will make all of this happen ,
CEV	Philippians	1	29	and he has blessed you . Not only do you have faith in Christ , but you suffer for him .
CEV	Philippians	1	30	( C ) You saw me suffer , and you still hear about my troubles . Now you must suffer in the same way . Copyright ©

CEV	Philippians	2	2	Now make me completely happy ! Live in harmony by showing love for each other . Be united in what you think , as if you were only one person .
CEV	Philippians	2	3	Do n't be jealous or proud , but be humble and consider others more important than yourselves .
CEV	Philippians	2	4	Care about them as much as you care about yourselves
CEV	Philippians	2	5	and think the same way that Christ Jesus thought : [ a ]
CEV	Philippians	2	6	Christ was truly God . But he did not try to remain [ b ] equal with God .
CEV	Philippians	2	7	Instead he gave up everything [ c ] and became a slave , when he became like one of us .
CEV	Philippians	2	8	Christ was humble . He obeyed God and even died on a cross .
CEV	Philippians	2	9	Then God gave Christ the highest place and honored his name above all others .
CEV	Philippians	2	10	( A ) So at the name of Jesus everyone will bow down , those in heaven , on earth , and under the earth .
CEV	Philippians	2	11	And to the glory of God the Father everyone will openly agree , “ Jesus Christ is Lord ! ” Lights in the World
CEV	Philippians	2	12	My dear friends , you always obeyed when I was with you . Now that I am away , you should obey even more . So work with fear and trembling to discover what it really means to be saved .
CEV	Philippians	2	13	God is working in you to make you willing and able to obey him .
CEV	Philippians	2	14	Do everything without grumbling or arguing .
CEV	Philippians	2	15	( B ) Then you will be the pure and innocent children of God . You live among people who are crooked and evil , but you must not do anything they can say is wrong . Try to shine as lights among the people of this world ,
CEV	Philippians	2	16	as you hold firmly to [ d ] the message that gives life . Then on the day when Christ returns , I can take pride in you . I can also know that my work and efforts were not useless .
CEV	Philippians	2	17	Your faith in the Lord and your service are like a sacrifice offered to him . And my own blood may have to be poured out with the sacrifice . [ e ] If this happens , I will be glad and rejoice with you .
CEV	Philippians	2	18	In the same way , you should be glad and rejoice with me . Timothy and Epaphroditus
CEV	Philippians	2	19	I want to be encouraged by news about you . So I hope the Lord Jesus will soon let me send Timothy to you .
CEV	Philippians	2	20	I do n't have anyone else who cares about you as much as he does .
CEV	Philippians	2	21	The others think only about what interests them and not about what concerns Christ Jesus .
CEV	Philippians	2	22	But you know what kind of person Timothy is . He has worked with me like a son in spreading the good news .
CEV	Philippians	2	23	I hope to send him to you , as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me .
CEV	Philippians	2	24	And I feel sure the Lord will also let me come soon .
CEV	Philippians	2	25	I think I ought to send my dear friend Epaphroditus back to you . He is a follower and a worker and a soldier of the Lord , just as I am . You sent him to look after me ,
CEV	Philippians	2	26	but now he is eager to see you . He is worried , because you heard he was sick .
CEV	Philippians	2	27	In fact , he was very sick and almost died . But God was kind to him , and also to me , and he kept me from being burdened down with sorrow .
CEV	Philippians	2	28	Now I am more eager than ever to send Epaphroditus back again . You will be glad to see him , and I wo n't have to worry any longer .
CEV	Philippians	2	29	Be sure to give him a cheerful welcome , just as people who serve the Lord deserve .
CEV	Philippians	2	30	He almost died working for Christ , and he risked his own life to do for me what you could not . Footnotes - 2.5 think the same way that Christ Jesus thought : Or “ think the way you should because you belong to Christ Jesus. ” - 2.6 remain : Or “ become. ” - 2.7 he gave up everything : Greek , “ he emptied himself. ” - 2.16 hold firmly to : Or “ offer them. ” - 2.17 my own blood may have to be poured out with the sacrifice : Offerings of water or wine were sometimes poured out when animals were sacrificed on the altar .

CEV	Philippians	3	3	But we are the ones who are truly circumcised , because we worship by the power of God 's Spirit [ a ] and take pride in Christ Jesus . We do n't brag about what we have done ,
CEV	Philippians	3	2	Watch out for those people who behave like dogs ! They are evil and want to do more than just circumcise you .
CEV	Philippians	3	4	although I could . Others may brag about themselves , but I have more reason to brag than anyone else .
CEV	Philippians	3	5	( A ) I was circumcised when I was eight days old , [ b ] and I am from the nation of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin . I am a true Hebrew . As a Pharisee , I strictly obeyed the Law of Moses .
CEV	Philippians	3	6	( B ) And I was so eager I even made trouble for the church . I did everything the Law demands in order to please God .
CEV	Philippians	3	7	But Christ has shown me that what I once thought was valuable is worthless .
CEV	Philippians	3	8	Nothing is as wonderful as knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . I have given up everything else and count it all as garbage . All I want is Christ
CEV	Philippians	3	9	and to know that I belong to him . I could not make myself acceptable to God by obeying the Law of Moses . God accepted me simply because of my faith in Christ .
CEV	Philippians	3	10	All I want is to know Christ and the power that raised him to life . I want to suffer and die as he did ,
CEV	Philippians	3	11	so that somehow I also may be raised to life . Running toward the Goal
CEV	Philippians	3	12	I have not yet reached my goal , and I am not perfect . But Christ has taken hold of me . So I keep on running and struggling to take hold of the prize .
CEV	Philippians	3	13	My friends , I do n't feel I have already arrived . But I forget what is behind , and I struggle for what is ahead .
CEV	Philippians	3	14	I run toward the goal , so I can win the prize of being called to heaven . This is the prize God offers because of what Christ Jesus has done .
CEV	Philippians	3	15	All of us who are mature should think in this same way . And if any of you think differently , God will make it clear to you .
CEV	Philippians	3	16	But we must keep going in the direction that we are now headed .
CEV	Philippians	3	17	( C ) My friends , I want you to follow my example and learn from others who closely follow the example we set for you .
CEV	Philippians	3	18	I often warned you that many people are living as enemies of the cross of Christ . And now with tears in my eyes , I warn you again
CEV	Philippians	3	19	that they are headed for hell ! They worship their stomachs and brag about the disgusting things they do . All they can think about are the things of this world .
CEV	Philippians	3	20	But we are citizens of heaven and are eagerly waiting for our Savior to come from there . Our Lord Jesus Christ
CEV	Philippians	3	21	( D ) has power over everything , and he will make these poor bodies of ours like his own glorious body . Copyright ©

CEV	Philippians	4	2	Euodia and Syntyche , you belong to the Lord , so I beg you to stop arguing with each other .
CEV	Philippians	4	3	And , my true partner , [ a ] I ask you to help them . These women have worked together with me and with Clement and with the others in spreading the good news . Their names are now written in the book of life . [ b ]
CEV	Philippians	4	5	Always be gentle with others . The Lord will soon be here .
CEV	Philippians	4	6	Do n't worry about anything , but pray about everything . With thankful hearts offer up your prayers and requests to God .
CEV	Philippians	4	7	Then , because you belong to Christ Jesus , God will bless you with peace that no one can completely understand . And this peace will control the way you think and feel .
CEV	Philippians	4	8	Finally , my friends , keep your minds on whatever is true , pure , right , holy , friendly , and proper . Do n't ever stop thinking about what is truly worthwhile and worthy of praise .
CEV	Philippians	4	9	You know the teachings I gave you , and you know what you heard me say and saw me do . So follow my example . And God , who gives peace , will be with you . Paul Gives Thanks for the Gifts He Was Given
CEV	Philippians	4	10	The Lord has made me very grateful that at last you have thought about me once again . Actually , you were thinking about me all along , but you did n't have any chance to show it .
CEV	Philippians	4	11	I am not complaining about having too little . I have learned to be satisfied with [ c ] whatever I have .
CEV	Philippians	4	12	I know what it is to be poor or to have plenty , and I have lived under all kinds of conditions . I know what it means to be full or to be hungry , to have too much or too little .
CEV	Philippians	4	13	Christ gives me the strength to face anything .
CEV	Philippians	4	14	It was good of you to help me when I was having such a hard time .
CEV	Philippians	4	15	( A ) My friends at Philippi , you remember what it was like when I started preaching the good news in Macedonia . [ d ] After I left there , you were the only church that became my partner by giving blessings and by receiving them in return .
CEV	Philippians	4	16	( B ) Even when I was in Thessalonica , you helped me more than once .
CEV	Philippians	4	17	I am not trying to get something from you , but I want you to receive the blessings that come from giving .
CEV	Philippians	4	18	( C ) I have been paid back everything , and with interest . I am completely satisfied with the gifts you sent with Epaphroditus . They are like a sweet-smelling offering or like the right kind of sacrifice that pleases God .
CEV	Philippians	4	19	I pray that God will take care of all your needs with the wonderful blessings that come from Christ Jesus !
CEV	Philippians	4	20	May God our Father be praised forever and ever . Amen . Final Greetings

CEV	Colossians	1	1	From Paul , chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , and from Timothy , who is also a follower .
CEV	Colossians	1	2	To God 's people who live in Colossae and are faithful followers of Christ . I pray that God our Father will be kind to you and will bless you with peace ! A Prayer of Thanks
CEV	Colossians	1	3	Each time we pray for you , we thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
CEV	Colossians	1	4	We have heard of your faith in Christ and of your love for all God 's people ,

CEV	Colossians	1	13	God rescued us from the dark power of Satan and brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son ,
CEV	Colossians	1	14	( B ) who forgives our sins and sets us free .
CEV	Colossians	1	15	( C ) Christ is exactly like God , who can not be seen . He is the first-born Son , superior to all creation .
CEV	Colossians	1	16	Everything was created by him , everything in heaven and on earth , everything seen and unseen , including all forces and powers , and all rulers and authorities . All things were created by God 's Son , and everything was made for him .
CEV	Colossians	1	17	God 's Son was before all else , and by him everything is held together .
CEV	Colossians	1	18	( D ) He is the head of his body , which is the church . He is the very beginning , the first to be raised from death , so that he would be above all others .
CEV	Colossians	1	19	God himself was pleased to live fully in his Son .
CEV	Colossians	1	20	( E ) And God was pleased for him to make peace by sacrificing his blood on the cross , so that all beings in heaven and on earth would be brought back to God .
CEV	Colossians	1	21	You used to be far from God . Your thoughts made you his enemies , and you did evil things .
CEV	Colossians	1	22	But his Son became a human and died . So God made peace with you , and now he lets you stand in his presence as people who are holy and faultless and innocent .

CEV	Colossians	1	26	For ages and ages this message was kept secret from everyone , but now it has been explained to God 's people .
CEV	Colossians	1	27	God did this because he wanted you Gentiles to understand his wonderful and glorious mystery . And the mystery is that Christ lives in you , and he is your hope of sharing in God 's glory .

CEV	Colossians	2	9	God lives fully in Christ .
CEV	Colossians	2	10	And you are fully grown because you belong to Christ , who is over every power and authority .
CEV	Colossians	2	11	Christ has also taken away your selfish desires , just as circumcision removes flesh from the body .
CEV	Colossians	2	12	( A ) And when you were baptized , it was the same as being buried with Christ . Then you were raised to life because you had faith in the power of God , who raised Christ from death .
CEV	Colossians	2	13	( B ) You were dead , because you were sinful and were not God 's people . But God let Christ make you [ b ] alive , when he forgave all our sins .
CEV	Colossians	2	14	( C ) God wiped out the charges that were against us for disobeying the Law of Moses . He took them away and nailed them to the cross .

CEV	Colossians	2	20	You died with Christ . Now the forces of the universe [ d ] do n't have any power over you . Why do you live as if you had to obey such rules as ,
CEV	Colossians	2	21	“ Do n't handle this . Do n't taste that . Do n't touch this. ” ?
CEV	Colossians	2	22	After these things are used , they are no longer good for anything . So why be bothered with the rules that humans have made up ?
CEV	Colossians	2	23	Obeying these rules may seem to be the smart thing to do . They appear to make you love God more and to be very humble and to have control over your body . But they do n't really have any power over our desires .

CEV	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	My dear friends , God loves you , and we know he has chosen you to be his people .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	When we told you the good news , it was with the power and assurance that come from the Holy Spirit , and not simply with words . You knew what kind of people we were and how we helped you .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	( B ) So , when you accepted the message , you followed our example and the example of the Lord . You suffered , but the Holy Spirit made you glad .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	You became an example for all the Lord 's followers in Macedonia and Achaia .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	And because of you , the Lord 's message has spread everywhere in those regions . Now the news of your faith in God is known all over the world , and we do n't have to say a thing about it .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	Everyone is talking about how you welcomed us and how you turned away from idols to serve the true and living God .

CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	1	Thessalonians
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	( A ) As you remember , we had been mistreated and insulted at Philippi . But God gave us the courage to tell you the good news about him , even though many people caused us trouble .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	We did n't have any hidden motives when we won you over , and we did n't try to fool or trick anyone .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	God was pleased to trust us with his message . We did n't speak to please people , but to please God who knows our motives .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	You also know we did n't try to flatter anyone . God himself knows what we did was n't a cover-up for greed .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	We were not trying to get you or anyone else to praise us .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	But as apostles , we could have demanded help from you . After all , Christ is the one who sent us . We chose to be like children or like a mother [ a ] nursing her baby .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	We cared so much for you , and you became so dear to us , that we were willing to give our lives for you when we gave you God 's message .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	My dear friends , you surely have n't forgotten our hard work and hardships . You remember how night and day we struggled to make a living , so we could tell you God 's message without being a burden to anyone .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	Both you and God are witnesses that we were pure and honest and innocent in our dealings with you followers of the Lord .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	You also know we did everything for you that parents would do for their own children .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	We begged , encouraged , and urged each of you to live in a way that would honor God . He is the one who chose you to share in his own kingdom and glory .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	We always thank God that you believed the message we preached . It came from him , and it is n't something made up by humans . You accepted it as God 's message , and now he is working in you .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	( B ) My friends , you did just like God 's churches in Judea and like the other followers of Christ Jesus there . And so , you were mistreated by your own people , in the same way they were mistreated by their people .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	( C ) Those evil people killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and they even chased us away . God does n't like what they do and neither does anyone else .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	They keep us from speaking his message to the Gentiles and from leading them to be saved . They have always gone too far with their sins . Now God has finally become angry and will punish them . Paul Wants To Visit the Church Again
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	My friends , we were kept from coming to you for a while , but we never stopped thinking about you . We were eager to see you and tried our best to visit you in person .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	We really wanted to come . I myself tried several times , but Satan always stopped us .
CEV	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	After all , when the Lord Jesus appears , who else but you will give us hope and joy and be like a glorious crown for us ?

CEV	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	We do n't have to write you about the need to love each other . God has taught you to do this ,

CEV	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	This is why we brag about you to all of God 's churches . We tell them how patient you are and how you keep on having faith , even though you are going through a lot of trouble and suffering .
CEV	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	All this shows that God judges fairly and is making you fit to share in his kingdom for which you are suffering .
CEV	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	It is only right for God to punish everyone who is causing you trouble ,

CEV	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	( B ) Their punishment will be eternal destruction , and they will be kept far from the presence of our Lord and his glorious strength .
CEV	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	This will happen on the day when the Lord returns to be praised and honored by all who have faith in him and belong to him . This includes you , because you believed what we said .
CEV	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	God chose you , and we keep praying that God will make you worthy of being his people . We pray for God 's power to help you do all the good things you hope to do and your faith makes you want to do .

CEV	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	You surely know that you should follow our example . We did n't waste our time loafing ,
CEV	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	and we did n't accept food from anyone without paying for it . We did n't want to be a burden to any of you , so night and day we worked as hard as we could .
CEV	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	We had the right not to work , but we wanted to set an example for you .
CEV	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	We also gave you this rule : If you do n't work , you do n't eat .
CEV	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	Now we learn that some of you just loaf around and wo n't do any work , except the work of a busybody .

CEV	1%20Timothy	1	3	When I was leaving for Macedonia , I asked you to stay on in Ephesus and warn certain people there to stop spreading their false teachings .
CEV	1%20Timothy	1	4	You needed to warn them to stop wasting their time on senseless stories and endless lists of ancestors . Such things only cause arguments . They do n't help anyone to do God 's work that can only be done by faith .
CEV	1%20Timothy	1	5	You must teach people to have genuine love , as well as a good conscience and true faith .
CEV	1%20Timothy	1	6	There are some who have given up these for nothing but empty talk .
CEV	1%20Timothy	1	7	They want to be teachers of the Law of Moses . But they do n't know what they are talking about , even though they think they do .

CEV	1%20Timothy	1	9	We also understand it was n't given to control people who please God , but to control lawbreakers , criminals , godless people , and sinners . It is for wicked and evil people , and for murderers , who would even kill their own parents .
CEV	1%20Timothy	1	10	The Law was written for people who are sexual perverts or who live as homosexuals or are kidnappers or liars or wo n't tell the truth in court . It is for anything else that opposes the correct teaching

CEV	1%20Timothy	1	13	( B ) I used to say terrible and insulting things about him , and I was cruel . But Christ had mercy on me because I did n't know what I was doing , and I had not yet put my faith in him .

CEV	1%20Timothy	1	16	But since I was worse than anyone else , God had mercy on me and let me be an example of the endless patience of Christ Jesus . He did this so that others would put their faith in Christ and have eternal life .

CEV	1%20Timothy	3	3	They must not be heavy drinkers or troublemakers . Instead , they must be kind and gentle and not love money .
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	2	( A ) That 's why officials must have a good reputation and be faithful in marriage . [ c ] They must be self-controlled , sensible , well-behaved , friendly to strangers , and able to teach .
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	4	Church officials must be in control of their own families , and they must see that their children are obedient and always respectful .
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	5	If they do n't know how to control their own families , how can they look after God 's people ?
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	6	They must not be new followers of the Lord . If they are , they might become proud and be doomed along with the devil .
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	7	Finally , they must be well-respected by people who are not followers . Then they wo n't be trapped and disgraced by the devil . Church Officers
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	8	Church officers [ d ] should be serious . They must not be liars , heavy drinkers , or greedy for money .
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	9	And they must have a clear conscience and hold firmly to what God has shown us about our faith .
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	10	They must first prove themselves . Then if no one has anything against them , they can serve as officers .

CEV	1%20Timothy	3	14	I hope to visit you soon . But I am writing these instructions ,
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	15	so if I am delayed , you will know how everyone who belongs to God 's family ought to behave . After all , the church of the living God is the strong foundation of truth .
CEV	1%20Timothy	3	16	Here is the great mystery of our religion : Christ [ g ] came as a human . The Spirit proved that he pleased God , and he was seen by angels . Christ was preached to the nations . People in this world put their faith in him , and he was taken up to glory . Footnotes - 3.1 It is true that : These words may be taken with 2.15 . If so , that verse would be translated : “ It is true that women will be saved … holy , and modest. ” And 3.1 would be translated , “ Anyone who desires … something worthwhile. ” - 3.1 church official : Or “ bishop. ” - 3.2 be faithful in marriage : Or “ be the husband of only one wife. ” - 3.8 Church officers : Or “ Deacons. ” - 3.11 Women : Either church officers or the wives of church officers . - 3.12 be faithful in marriage : See the note at 3.2 . - 3.16 Christ : The Greek text has “ he , ” probably meaning “ Christ. ” Some manuscripts have “ God. ” Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	4	Everything God created is good . And if you give thanks , you may eat anything .
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	2	They will also be fooled by the false claims of liars whose consciences have lost all feeling . These liars
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	3	will forbid people to marry or to eat certain foods . But God created these foods to be eaten with thankful hearts by his followers who know the truth .
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	5	What God has said and your prayer will make it fit to eat . Paul 's Advice to Timothy
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	6	If you teach these things to other followers , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus . You will show you have grown up on the teachings about our faith and on the good instructions you have obeyed .
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	7	Do n't have anything to do with worthless , senseless stories . Work hard to be truly religious . 8-9 As the saying goes , “ Exercise is good for your body , but religion helps you in every way . It promises life now and forever. ” These words are worthwhile and should not be forgotten .
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	10	We have put our hope in the living God , who is the Savior of everyone , but especially of those who have faith . This is why we work and struggle so hard . [ a ]
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	11	Teach these things and tell everyone to do what you say .
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	12	Do n't let anyone make fun of you , just because you are young . Set an example for other followers by what you say and do , as well as by your love , faith , and purity .
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	13	Until I arrive , be sure to keep on reading the Scriptures in worship , and do n't stop preaching and teaching .
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	14	Use the gift you were given when the prophets spoke and the group of church leaders [ b ] blessed you by placing their hands on you .
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	15	Remember these things and think about them , so everyone can see how well you are doing .
CEV	1%20Timothy	4	16	Be careful about the way you live and about what you teach . Keep on doing this , and you will save not only yourself , but the people who hear you . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	5	( A ) A widow who is really in need is one who does n't have any relatives . She has faith in God , and she keeps praying to him night and day , asking for his help .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	2	and treat older women as you would your own mother . Show the same respect to younger women that you would to your sister .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	3	Take care of any widow who is really in need .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , they should learn to serve God by taking care of her , as she once took care of them . This is what God wants them to do .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	6	A widow who thinks only about having a good time is already dead , even though she is still alive .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	7	Tell all this to everyone , so they will do the right thing .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	8	People who do n't take care of their relatives , and especially their own families , have given up their faith . They are worse than someone who does n't have faith in the Lord .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	9	For a widow to be put on the list of widows , she must be at least
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	60	years old , and she must have been faithful in marriage . [ a ]
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	10	She must also be well-known for doing all sorts of good things , such as raising children , giving food to strangers , welcoming God 's people into her home , [ b ] helping people in need , and always making herself useful .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	11	Do n't put young widows on the list . They may later have a strong desire to get married . Then they will turn away from Christ
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	12	and become guilty of breaking their promise to him .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	13	Besides , they will become lazy and get into the habit of going from house to house . Next , they will start gossiping and become busybodies , talking about things that are none of their business .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	14	I would prefer that young widows get married , have children , and look after their families . Then the enemy wo n't have any reason to say insulting things about us .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	15	Look what 's already happened to some of the young widows ! They have turned away to follow Satan .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	16	If a woman who is a follower has any widows in her family , she [ c ] should help them . This will keep the church from having that burden , and then the church can help widows who are really in need . Church Leaders
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	17	Church leaders [ d ] who do their job well deserve to be paid [ e ] twice as much , especially if they work hard at preaching and teaching .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	18	( B ) It is just as the Scriptures say , “ Do n't muzzle an ox when you are using it to grind grain. ” You also know the saying , “ Workers are worth their pay. ”
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	19	( C ) Do n't listen to any charge against a church leader , unless at least two or three people bring the same charges .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	20	But if any of the leaders should keep on sinning , they must be corrected in front of the whole group , as a warning to everyone else .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	21	In the presence of God and Christ Jesus and their chosen angels , I order you to follow my instructions ! Be fair with everyone , and do n't have any favorites .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	22	Do n't be too quick to accept people into the service of the Lord [ f ] by placing your hands on them . Do n't sin because others do , but stay close to God .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	23	Stop drinking only water . Take a little wine to help your stomach trouble and the other illnesses you often have .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	24	Some people get caught in their sins almost at once , even before the time of judgment . But other people 's sins do n't show up until later .
CEV	1%20Timothy	5	25	It is the same with good deeds . Some are easily seen , but none of them can be hidden . Footnotes - 5.9 been faithful in marriage : Or “ been the wife of only one husband. ” - 5.10 welcoming God 's people into her home : The Greek text has “ washing the feet of God 's people. ” In New Testament times most people either went barefoot or wore sandals , and a host would often wash the feet of special guests . - 5.16 woman … she : Some manuscripts have “ man or woman … that person. ” - 5.17 church leaders : Or “ elders ” or “ presbyters. ” - 5.17 paid : Or “ honored ” or “ respected. ” - 5.22 to accept people into the service of the Lord : Or “ to forgive people. ” Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	6	And religion does make your life rich , by making you content with what you have .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	2	If any of you slaves have owners who are followers , you should show them respect . After all , they are also followers of Christ , and he loves them . So you should serve and help them the best you can . False Teaching and True Wealth These are the things you must teach and tell the people to do .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	3	Anyone who teaches something different disagrees with the correct and godly teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	4	Those people who disagree are proud of themselves , but they do n't really know a thing . Their minds are sick , and they like to argue over words . They cause jealousy , disagreements , unkind words , evil suspicions ,
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	5	and nasty quarrels . They have wicked minds and have missed out on the truth . These people think religion is supposed to make you rich .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	7	We did n't bring anything into this world , and we wo n't [ a ] take anything with us when we leave .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	8	So we should be satisfied just to have food and clothes .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	9	People who want to be rich fall into all sorts of temptations and traps . They are caught by foolish and harmful desires that drag them down and destroy them .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	10	The love of money causes all kinds of trouble . Some people want money so much they have given up their faith and caused themselves a lot of pain . Fighting a Good Fight for the Faith
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	11	Timothy , you belong to God , so keep away from all these evil things . Try your best to please God and to be like him . Be faithful , loving , dependable , and gentle .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	12	Fight a good fight for the faith and claim eternal life . God offered it to you when you clearly told about your faith , while so many people listened .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	13	( A ) Now I ask you to make a promise . Make it in the presence of God , who gives life to all , and in the presence of Christ Jesus , who openly told Pontius Pilate about his faith .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	14	Promise to obey completely and fully all that you have been told until our Lord Jesus Christ returns .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	15	( B ) The glorious God is the only Ruler , the King of kings and Lord of lords . At the time that God has already decided , he will send Jesus Christ back again .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	16	( C ) Only God lives forever ! And he lives in light that no one can come near . No human has ever seen God or ever can see him . God will be honored , and his power will last forever . Amen .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	17	Warn the rich people of this world not to be proud or to trust in wealth that is easily lost . Tell them to have faith in God , who is rich and blesses us with everything we need to enjoy life .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	18	Instruct them to do as many good deeds as they can and to help everyone . Remind the rich to be generous and share what they have .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	19	This will lay a solid foundation for the future , so they will know what true life is like .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	20	Timothy , guard what God has placed in your care ! Do n't pay any attention to godless and stupid talk that sounds smart but really is n't .
CEV	1%20Timothy	6	21	Some people have even lost their faith by believing this talk . I pray that the Lord will be kind to all of you ! Footnotes - 6.7 we wo n't : Some manuscripts have “ we surely won't. ” Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Timothy	1	2	( A ) Timothy , you are like a dear child to me . I pray that God our Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will be kind and merciful to you and will bless you with peace ! Do Not Be Ashamed of the Lord
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . God himself chose me to be an apostle , and he gave me the promised life that Jesus Christ makes possible .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	3	Night and day I mention you in my prayers . I am always grateful for you , as I pray to the God my ancestors and I have served with a clear conscience .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	4	I remember how you cried , and I want to see you , because this would make me truly happy .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	5	( B ) I also remember the genuine faith of your mother Eunice . Your grandmother Lois had the same sort of faith , and I am sure you have it as well .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	6	So I ask you to make full use of the gift God gave you when I placed my hands on you . [ a ] Use it well .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	7	God 's Spirit [ b ] does n't make cowards out of us . The Spirit gives us power , love , and self-control .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	8	Do n't be ashamed to speak for our Lord . And do n't be ashamed of me , just because I am in jail for serving him . Use the power that comes from God and join with me in suffering for telling the good news .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	9	God saved us and chose us to be his holy people . We did nothing to deserve this , but God planned it because he is so kind . Even before time began God planned for Christ Jesus to show kindness to us .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	10	Now Christ Jesus has come to offer us God 's gift of undeserved grace . Christ our Savior defeated death and brought us the good news . It shines like a light and offers life that never ends .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	11	( C ) My work is to be a preacher , an apostle , and a teacher . [ c ]
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	12	This is why I am suffering now . But I am not ashamed ! I know the one I have faith in , and I am sure he can guard until the last day what he has trusted me with . [ d ]
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	13	Now follow the example of the correct teaching I gave you , and let the faith and love of Christ Jesus be your model .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	14	You have been trusted with a wonderful treasure . Guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit , who lives within us .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	15	You know that everyone in Asia has turned against me , especially Phygelus and Hermogenes .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	16	I pray that the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus . He often cheered me up and was n't ashamed of me when I was put in jail .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	17	Then after he arrived in Rome , he searched everywhere until he found me .
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	18	I pray that the Lord Jesus will ask God to show mercy to Onesiphorus on the day of judgment . You know how much he helped me in Ephesus . Footnotes Copyright ©
CEV	2%20Timothy	1	1995	by American Bible Society For more information about CEV , visit www.bibles.com and www.cev.bible .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	2	You have often heard me teach . Now I want you to tell these same things to followers who can be trusted to tell others .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	3	As a good soldier of Christ Jesus you must endure your share of suffering .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	4	Soldiers on duty do n't work at outside jobs . They try only to please their commanding officer .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	5	No one wins an athletic contest without obeying the rules .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	6	And farmers who work hard are the first to eat what grows in their field .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	7	If you keep in mind what I have told you , the Lord will help you understand completely .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	8	Keep your mind on Jesus Christ ! He was from the family of David and was raised from death , just as my good news says .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	9	And because of this message , I am locked up in jail and treated like a criminal . But God 's good news is n't locked in jail ,
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	10	and so I am willing to put up with anything . Then God 's special people will be saved and given eternal glory because they belong to Christ Jesus .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	11	Here is a true message : “ If we died with Christ , we will live with him .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	12	( A ) If we do n't give up , we will rule with him . If we deny that we know him , he will deny that he knows us .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we are not faithful , he will still be faithful . Christ can not deny who he is. ” An Approved Worker
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	14	Do n't let anyone forget these things . And with God [ a ] as your witness , you must warn them not to argue about words . These arguments do n't help anyone . In fact , they ruin everyone who listens to them .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	15	Do your best to win God 's approval as a worker who does n't need to be ashamed and who teaches only the true message .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	16	Keep away from worthless and useless talk . It only leads people farther away from God .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	17	That sort of talk is like a sore that wo n't heal . And Hymenaeus and Philetus have been talking this way
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	18	by teaching that the dead have already been raised to life . This is far from the truth , and it is destroying the faith of some people .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	19	But the foundation God has laid is solid . On it is written , “ The Lord knows who his people are . So everyone who worships the Lord must turn away from evil. ”
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	20	In a large house some dishes are made of gold or silver , while others are made of wood or clay . Some of these are special , and others are not .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	21	This is also how it is with people . The ones who stop doing evil and make themselves pure will become special . Their lives will be holy and pleasing to their Master , and they will be able to do all kinds of good deeds .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	22	Run from temptations that capture young people . Always do the right thing . Be faithful , loving , and easy to get along with . Worship with people whose hearts are pure .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	23	Stay away from stupid and senseless arguments . These only lead to trouble ,
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	24	and God 's servants must not be troublemakers . They must be kind to everyone , and they must be good teachers and very patient .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	25	Be humble when you correct people who oppose you . Maybe God will lead them to turn to him and learn the truth .
CEV	2%20Timothy	2	26	They have been trapped by the devil , and he makes them obey him , but God may help them escape . Footnotes - 2.14 God : Some manuscripts have “ the Lord , ” and others have “ Christ. ” Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Timothy	3	2	People will love only themselves and money . They will be proud , stuck-up , rude , and disobedient to their parents . They will also be ungrateful , godless ,
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	3	heartless , and hateful . Their words will be cruel , and they will have no self-control or pity . These people will hate everything good .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	4	They will be sneaky , reckless , and puffed up with pride . Instead of loving God , they will love pleasure .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	5	Even though they will make a show of being religious , their religion wo n't be real . Do n't have anything to do with such people .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	6	Some men fool whole families , just to get power over those women who are slaves of sin and are controlled by all sorts of desires .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	7	These women always want to learn something new , but they never can discover the truth .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	8	( A ) Just as Jannes and Jambres [ a ] opposed Moses , these people are enemies of the truth . Their minds are sick , and their faith is n't real .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they wo n't get very far with their foolishness . Soon everyone will know the truth about them , just as Jannes and Jambres were found out . Paul 's Last Instructions to Timothy
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	10	Timothy , you know what I teach and how I live . You know what I want to do and what I believe . You have seen how patient and loving I am , and how in the past I put up with
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	11	( B ) trouble and suffering in the cities of Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . Yet the Lord rescued me from all those terrible troubles .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	12	In fact , anyone who belongs to Christ Jesus and wants to live right will have trouble from others .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	13	But evil people who pretend to be what they are not will become worse than ever , as they fool others and are fooled themselves .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	14	Keep on being faithful to what you were taught and to what you believed . After all , you know who taught you these things .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	15	Since childhood , you have known the Holy Scriptures that are able to make you wise enough to have faith in Christ Jesus and be saved .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	16	Everything in the Scriptures is God 's Word . All of it is useful for teaching and helping people and for correcting them and showing them how to live .
CEV	2%20Timothy	3	17	The Scriptures train God 's servants to do all kinds of good deeds . Footnotes - 3.8 Jannes and Jambres : These names are not found in the Old Testament . But many believe these were the names of the two Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses when he wanted to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt ( see Exodus 7.11,22 ) . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Timothy	4	2	to preach God 's message . Do it willingly , even if it is n't the popular thing to do . You must correct people and point out their sins . But also cheer them up , and when you instruct them , always be patient .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	4	They will turn from the truth and eagerly listen to senseless stories .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	3	The time is coming when people wo n't listen to good teaching . Instead , they will look for teachers who will please them by telling them only what they are itching to hear .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	5	But you must stay calm and be willing to suffer . You must work hard , telling the good news and to do your job well .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	6	Now the time has come for me to die . My life is like a drink offering [ a ] being poured out on the altar .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	7	I have fought well . I have finished the race , and I have been faithful .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	8	So a crown will be given to me for pleasing the Lord . He judges fairly , and on the day of judgment he will give a crown to me and to everyone else who wants him to appear with power . Personal Instructions
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	9	Come to see me as soon as you can .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	10	( A ) Demas loves the things of this world so much that he left me and went to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus has gone to Dalmatia .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	11	( B ) Only Luke has stayed with me . Mark can be very helpful to me , so please find him and bring him with you .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	12	( C ) I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	13	( D ) When you come , bring the coat I left at Troas with Carpus . Do n't forget to bring the scrolls , especially the ones made of leather . [ b ]
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	14	( E ) Alexander , the metalworker , has hurt me in many ways . But the Lord will pay him back for what he has done .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	15	Alexander opposes what we preach , so you had better watch out for him .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	16	When I was first put on trial , no one helped me . In fact , everyone deserted me . I hope it wo n't be held against them .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stood beside me . He gave me the strength to tell his full message , so that all Gentiles would hear it . And I was kept safe from hungry lions .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	18	( F ) The Lord will always keep me from being harmed by evil , and he will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom . Praise him forever and ever ! Amen . Final Greetings
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	19	( G ) Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and to the family of Onesiphorus .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	20	( H ) Erastus stayed at Corinth . Trophimus was sick when I left him at Miletus .
CEV	2%20Timothy	4	21	Do your best to come before winter . Eubulus , Pudens , Linus , and Claudia send you their greetings , and so do the rest of the Lord 's followers .

CEV	Titus	1	1	From Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I encourage God 's own people to have more faith and to understand the truth about religion .
CEV	Titus	1	2	Then they will have the hope of eternal life God promised long ago . And God never tells a lie !
CEV	Titus	1	3	So , at the proper time , God our Savior gave this message and told me to announce what he had said .
CEV	Titus	1	4	( A ) Titus , because of our faith , you are like a son to me . I pray that God our Father and Christ Jesus our Savior will be kind to you and will bless you with peace ! What Titus Was To Do in Crete
CEV	Titus	1	5	I left you in Crete to do what had been left undone and to appoint leaders [ a ] for the churches in each town . As I told you ,
CEV	Titus	1	6	( B ) they must have a good reputation and be faithful in marriage . [ b ] Their children must be followers of the Lord and not have a reputation for being wild and disobedient .
CEV	Titus	1	7	Church officials [ c ] are in charge of God 's work , and so they must also have a good reputation . They must not be bossy , quick-tempered , heavy drinkers , bullies , or dishonest in business .
CEV	Titus	1	8	Instead , they must be friendly to strangers and enjoy doing good things . They must also be sensible , fair , pure , and self-controlled .
CEV	Titus	1	9	They must stick to the true message they were taught , so their good teaching can help others and correct everyone who opposes it .
CEV	Titus	1	10	There are many who do n't respect authority , and they fool others by talking nonsense . This is especially true of some Jewish followers .
CEV	Titus	1	11	But you must make them be quiet . They are after money , and they upset whole families by teaching what they should not .
CEV	Titus	1	12	It is like one of their own prophets once said , “ The people of Crete always tell lies . They are greedy and lazy like wild animals. ”
CEV	Titus	1	13	This surely is a true saying . And you should be hard on such people , so you can help them grow stronger in their faith .
CEV	Titus	1	14	Do n't pay any attention to any of those senseless Jewish stories and human commands . These are made up by people who wo n't obey the truth .
CEV	Titus	1	15	Everything is pure for someone whose heart is pure . But nothing is pure for an unbeliever with a dirty mind . That person 's mind and conscience are destroyed .
CEV	Titus	1	16	Such people claim to know God , but their actions prove they really do n't . They are disgusting . They wo n't obey God , and they are too worthless to do anything good . Copyright ©

CEV	Titus	2	2	Tell the older men to have self-control and to be serious and sensible . Their faith , love , and patience must never fail .
CEV	Titus	2	3	Tell the older women to behave as those who love the Lord should . They must not gossip about others or be slaves of wine . They must teach what is proper ,
CEV	Titus	2	4	so the younger women will be loving wives and mothers .
CEV	Titus	2	5	Each of the younger women must be sensible and kind , as well as a good homemaker , who puts her own husband first . Then no one can say insulting things about God 's message .
CEV	Titus	2	6	Tell the young men to have self-control in everything .
CEV	Titus	2	7	Always set a good example for others . Be sincere and serious when you teach .
CEV	Titus	2	8	Use clean language that no one can criticize . Do this , and your enemies will be too ashamed to say anything against you .
CEV	Titus	2	9	Tell slaves always to please their owners by obeying them in everything . Slaves must not talk back to their owners
CEV	Titus	2	10	or steal from them . They must be completely honest and trustworthy . Then everyone will show great respect for what is taught about God our Savior . God 's Kindness and the New Life
CEV	Titus	2	11	God has shown us undeserved grace by coming to save all people .
CEV	Titus	2	12	He taught us to give up our wicked ways and our worldly desires and to live decent and honest lives in this world .
CEV	Titus	2	13	We are filled with hope , as we wait for the glorious return of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ . [ a ]
CEV	Titus	2	14	( A ) He gave himself to rescue us from everything evil and to make our hearts pure . He wanted us to be his own people and to be eager to do right .
CEV	Titus	2	15	Teach these things , as you use your full authority to encourage and correct people . Make sure you earn everyone 's respect .

CEV	Titus	3	3	We used to be stupid , disobedient , and foolish , as well as slaves of all sorts of desires and pleasures . We were evil and jealous . Everyone hated us , and we hated everyone .
CEV	Titus	3	2	and not say cruel things or argue . They should be gentle and kind to everyone .
CEV	Titus	3	4	God our Savior showed us how good and kind he is .
CEV	Titus	3	5	He saved us because of his mercy , and not because of any good things we have done . God washed us by the power of the Holy Spirit . He gave us new birth and a fresh beginning .
CEV	Titus	3	6	God sent Jesus Christ our Savior to give us his Spirit .
CEV	Titus	3	7	Jesus treated us much better than we deserve . He made us acceptable to God and gave us the hope of eternal life .
CEV	Titus	3	8	This message is certainly true . These teachings are useful and helpful for everyone . I want you to insist that the people follow them , so that all who have faith in God will be sure to do good deeds .
CEV	Titus	3	9	But do n't have anything to do with stupid arguments about ancestors . And stay away from disagreements and quarrels about the Law of Moses . Such arguments are useless and senseless .
CEV	Titus	3	10	Warn troublemakers once or twice . Then do n't have anything else to do with them .
CEV	Titus	3	11	You know their minds are twisted , and their own sins show how guilty they are . Personal Instructions and Greetings
CEV	Titus	3	12	( A ) I plan to send Artemas or Tychicus to you . After he arrives , please try your best to meet me at Nicopolis . I have decided to spend the winter there .
CEV	Titus	3	13	( B ) When Zenas the lawyer and Apollos get ready to leave , help them as much as you can , so they wo n't have need of anything .
CEV	Titus	3	14	Our people should learn to spend their time doing something useful and worthwhile .
CEV	Titus	3	15	Greetings to you from everyone here . Greet all of our friends who share in our faith . I pray that the Lord will be kind to all of you ! Copyright ©

CEV	Philemon	1	1	From Paul , who is in jail for serving Christ Jesus , and from Timothy , who is like a brother because of our faith . Philemon , you work with us and are very dear to us . This letter is to you
CEV	Philemon	1	2	( A ) and to the church that meets in your home . It is also to our dear friend Apphia and to Archippus , who serves the Lord as we do .
CEV	Philemon	1	3	I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace ! Philemon 's Love and Faith
CEV	Philemon	1	4	Philemon , each time I mention you in my prayers , I thank God .
CEV	Philemon	1	5	I hear about your faith in our Lord Jesus and about your love for all God 's people .
CEV	Philemon	1	6	As you share your faith with others , I pray they may come to know all the blessings Christ has given us .
CEV	Philemon	1	7	My friend , your love has made me happy and has greatly encouraged me . It has also cheered the hearts of God 's people . Paul Speaks to Philemon about Onesimus
CEV	Philemon	1	8	Christ gives me the courage to tell you what to do .
CEV	Philemon	1	9	But I would rather ask you to do it simply because of love . Yes , as someone [ a ] in jail for Christ ,
CEV	Philemon	1	10	( B ) I beg you to help Onesimus ! [ b ] He is like a son to me because I led him to Christ here in jail .
CEV	Philemon	1	11	Before this , he was useless to you , but now he is useful both to you and to me .
CEV	Philemon	1	12	Sending Onesimus back to you makes me very sad .
CEV	Philemon	1	13	I would like to keep him here with me , where he could take your place in helping me while I am here in prison for preaching the good news .
CEV	Philemon	1	14	But I wo n't do anything unless you agree to it first . I want your act of kindness to come from your heart , and not be something you feel forced to do .
CEV	Philemon	1	15	Perhaps Onesimus was taken from you for a little while so you could have him back for good ,
CEV	Philemon	1	16	but not as a slave . Onesimus is much more than a slave . To me he is a dear friend , but to you he is even more , both as a person and as a follower of the Lord .
CEV	Philemon	1	17	If you consider me a friend because of Christ , then welcome Onesimus as you would welcome me .
CEV	Philemon	1	18	If he has cheated you or owes you anything , charge it to my account .
CEV	Philemon	1	19	With my own hand I write : I , PAUL , WILL PAY YOU BACK . But do n't forget you owe me your life .
CEV	Philemon	1	20	My dear friend and follower of Christ our Lord , please cheer me up by doing this for me .
CEV	Philemon	1	21	I am sure you will do all I have asked , and even more .
CEV	Philemon	1	22	Please get a room ready for me . I hope your prayers will be answered , and I can visit you .
CEV	Philemon	1	23	( C ) Epaphras is also here in jail for being a follower of Christ Jesus . He sends his greetings ,
CEV	Philemon	1	24	( D ) and so do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , who work together with me .

CEV	Hebrews	1	1	Long ago in many ways and at many times God 's prophets spoke his message to our ancestors .
CEV	Hebrews	1	2	( A ) But now at last , God sent his Son to bring his message to us . God created the universe by his Son , and everything will someday belong to the Son .
CEV	Hebrews	1	3	( B ) God 's Son has all the brightness of God 's own glory and is like him in every way . By his own mighty word , he holds the universe together . After the Son had washed away our sins , he sat down at the right side [ a ] of the glorious God in heaven .
CEV	Hebrews	1	4	He had become much greater than the angels , and the name he was given is far greater than any of theirs . God 's Son Is Greater than Angels
CEV	Hebrews	1	5	( C ) God has never said to any of the angels , “ You are my Son , because today I have become your Father ! ” Neither has God said to any of them , “ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son ! ”
CEV	Hebrews	1	6	( D ) When God brings his first-born Son [ b ] into the world , he commands all of his angels to worship him .
CEV	Hebrews	1	7	( E ) And when God speaks about the angels , he says , “ I change my angels into wind and my servants into flaming fire. ”
CEV	Hebrews	1	8	( F ) But God says about his Son , “ You are God , and you will rule as King forever ! Your [ c ] royal power brings about justice .
CEV	Hebrews	1	9	You loved justice and hated evil , and so I , your God , have chosen you . I appointed you and made you happier than any of your friends. ”
CEV	Hebrews	1	10	( G ) The Scriptures also say , “ In the beginning , Lord , you were the one who laid the foundation of the earth and created the heavens .
CEV	Hebrews	1	11	They will all disappear and wear out like clothes , but you will last forever .
CEV	Hebrews	1	12	You will roll them up like a robe and change them like a garment . But you are always the same , and you will live forever. ”
CEV	Hebrews	1	13	( H ) God never said to any of the angels , “ Sit at my right side until I make your enemies into a footstool for you ! ”
CEV	Hebrews	1	14	( I ) Angels are merely spirits sent to serve people who are going to be saved . Copyright ©

CEV	Hebrews	2	2	The message spoken by angels proved to be true , and all who disobeyed or rejected it were punished as they deserved .
CEV	Hebrews	2	3	So if we refuse this great way of being saved , how can we hope to escape ? The Lord himself was the first to tell about it , and people who heard the message proved to us that it was true .
CEV	Hebrews	2	4	God himself showed that his message was true by working all kinds of powerful miracles and wonders . He also gave his Holy Spirit to anyone he chose to . The One Who Leads Us To Be Saved
CEV	Hebrews	2	5	We know that God did not put the future world under the power of angels .
CEV	Hebrews	2	6	( A ) Somewhere in the Scriptures someone says to God , “ What makes you care about us humans ? Why are you concerned for weaklings such as we ?
CEV	Hebrews	2	7	You made us lower than the angels for a while . Yet you have crowned us with glory and honor . [ a ]
CEV	Hebrews	2	8	And you have put everything under our power ! ” God has put everything under our power and has not left anything out of our power . But we still do n't see it all under our control .
CEV	Hebrews	2	9	What we do see is Jesus , who for a little while was made lower than the angels . Because of God 's gift of undeserved grace , Jesus died for everyone . And now that Jesus has suffered and died , he is crowned with glory and honor !
CEV	Hebrews	2	10	Everything belongs to God , and all things were created by his power . So God did the right thing when he made Jesus perfect by suffering , as Jesus led many of God 's children to be saved and to share in his glory .
CEV	Hebrews	2	11	Jesus and the people he makes holy all belong to the same family . This is why he is n't ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters .
CEV	Hebrews	2	12	( B ) He even said to God , “ I will tell them your name and sing your praises when they come together to worship. ”
CEV	Hebrews	2	13	( C ) He also said , “ I will trust God. ” Then he said , “ Here I am with the children God has given me. ”
CEV	Hebrews	2	14	We are people of flesh and blood . This is why Jesus became one of us . He died to destroy the devil , who had power over death .
CEV	Hebrews	2	15	But he also died to rescue all of us who live each day in fear of dying .
CEV	Hebrews	2	16	( D ) Jesus clearly did not come to help angels , but he did come to help Abraham 's descendants .
CEV	Hebrews	2	17	He had to be one of us , so he could serve God as our merciful and faithful high priest and sacrifice himself for the forgiveness of our sins .
CEV	Hebrews	2	18	And now that Jesus has suffered and was tempted , he can help anyone else who is tempted . Footnotes - 2.7 and honor : Some manuscripts add “ and you have placed us in charge of all you created. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Hebrews	3	3	But Jesus deserves more honor than Moses , just as the builder of a house deserves more honor than the house .
CEV	Hebrews	3	2	( A ) Jesus was faithful to God , who appointed him , just as Moses was faithful in serving all [ a ] God 's people .
CEV	Hebrews	3	4	Of course , every house is built by someone , and God is really the one who built everything .
CEV	Hebrews	3	5	Moses was a faithful servant and told God 's people what would be said in the future .
CEV	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ is the Son in charge of God 's people . And we are those people , if we keep on being brave and do n't lose hope . A Rest for God 's People
CEV	Hebrews	3	7	( B ) It is just as the Holy Spirit says , “ If you hear God 's voice today ,
CEV	Hebrews	3	8	do n't be stubborn ! Do n't rebel like those people who were tested in the desert . *
CEV	Hebrews	3	9	[ b ] For forty years your ancestors tested God and saw the things he did .
CEV	Hebrews	3	10	“ Then God got tired of them and said , ‘ You people never show good sense , and you do n't understand what I want you to do. ’
CEV	Hebrews	3	11	God became angry and told the people , ‘ You will never enter my place of rest ! ’ ”
CEV	Hebrews	3	12	My friends , watch out ! Do n't let evil thoughts or doubts make any of you turn from the living God .
CEV	Hebrews	3	13	You must encourage one another each day . And you must keep on while there is still a time that can be called “ today. ” If you do n't , then sin may fool some of you and make you stubborn .
CEV	Hebrews	3	14	We were sure about Christ when we first became his people . So let 's hold tightly to our faith until the end .
CEV	Hebrews	3	15	( C ) The Scriptures say , “ If you hear his voice today , do n't be stubborn like those who rebelled. ”
CEV	Hebrews	3	16	( D ) Who were those people that heard God 's voice and rebelled ? Were n't they the same ones that came out of Egypt with Moses ?
CEV	Hebrews	3	17	Who were the people that made God angry for
CEV	Hebrews	3	40	years ? Were n't they the ones that sinned and died in the desert ?
CEV	Hebrews	3	18	And who did God say would never enter his place of rest ? Were n't they the ones that disobeyed him ?
CEV	Hebrews	3	19	We see that those people did not enter the place of rest because they did not have faith . Copyright ©
CEV	Hebrews	3	1995	by American Bible Society For more information about CEV , visit www.bibles.com and www.cev.bible .
CEV	Hebrews	4	4	( B ) In fact , somewhere the Scriptures say that by the seventh day , God had finished his work , and so he rested .
CEV	Hebrews	4	2	We have heard the message , just as they did . But they failed to believe what they heard , and the message did not do them any good .
CEV	Hebrews	4	3	( A ) Only people who have faith will enter the place of rest . It is just as the Scriptures say , “ God became angry and told the people , ‘ You will never enter my place of rest ! ’ ” God said this , even though everything has been ready from the time of creation .
CEV	Hebrews	4	5	( C ) We also read that he later said , “ You people will never enter my place of rest ! ”
CEV	Hebrews	4	6	This means that the promise to enter is still good , because those who first heard about it disobeyed and did not enter .
CEV	Hebrews	4	7	( D ) Much later God told David to make the promise again , just as I have already said , “ If you hear his voice today , do n't be stubborn ! ”
CEV	Hebrews	4	8	( E ) If Joshua had really given the people rest , there would not be any need for God to talk about another day of rest .
CEV	Hebrews	4	9	But God has promised us a Sabbath when we will rest , even though it has not yet come .
CEV	Hebrews	4	10	( F ) On that day God 's people will rest from their work , just as God rested from his work .
CEV	Hebrews	4	11	We should do our best to enter the place of rest , so none of us will disobey and miss going there , as they did .
CEV	Hebrews	4	12	God 's word is alive and powerful ! It is sharper than any double-edged sword . His word can cut through our spirits and souls and through our joints and marrow , until it discovers the desires and thoughts of our hearts .
CEV	Hebrews	4	13	( G ) Nothing is hidden from God ! He sees through everything , and we will have to tell him the truth . Jesus Is the Great High Priest
CEV	Hebrews	4	14	We have a great high priest , who has gone into heaven , and he is Jesus the Son of God . This is why we must hold on to what we have said about him .
CEV	Hebrews	4	15	Jesus understands every weakness of ours , because he was tempted in every way that we are . But he did not sin !
CEV	Hebrews	4	16	So whenever we are in need , we should come bravely before the throne of our merciful God . There we will be treated with undeserved grace , and we will find help . Copyright ©
CEV	Hebrews	4	1995	by American Bible Society For more information about CEV , visit www.bibles.com and www.cev.bible .
CEV	Hebrews	5	5	( C ) This is how it was with Christ . He became a high priest , but not just because he wanted the honor of being one . It was God who told him , “ You are my Son , because today I have become your Father ! ”
CEV	Hebrews	5	2	A high priest has weaknesses of his own , and he feels sorry for foolish and sinful people .
CEV	Hebrews	5	3	( A ) This is why he must offer sacrifices for his own sins and for the sins of others .
CEV	Hebrews	5	4	( B ) But no one can have the honor of being a high priest simply by wanting to be one . Only God can choose a priest , and God is the one who chose Aaron .
CEV	Hebrews	5	6	( D ) In another place , God says , “ You are a priest forever just like Melchizedek. ” [ a ]
CEV	Hebrews	5	7	( E ) God had the power to save Jesus from death . And while Jesus was on earth , he begged God with loud crying and tears to save him . He truly worshiped God , and God listened to his prayers .
CEV	Hebrews	5	8	Jesus is God 's own Son , but still he had to suffer before he could learn what it really means to obey God .
CEV	Hebrews	5	9	Suffering made Jesus perfect , and now he can save forever all who obey him .
CEV	Hebrews	5	10	This is because God chose him to be a high priest like Melchizedek . Warning against Turning Away
CEV	Hebrews	5	11	Much more could be said about this subject . But it is hard to explain , and all of you are slow to understand .
CEV	Hebrews	5	12	( F ) By now you should have been teachers , but once again you need to be taught the simplest things about what God has said . You need milk instead of solid food .
CEV	Hebrews	5	13	People who live on milk are like babies who do n't really know what is right .
CEV	Hebrews	5	14	Solid food is for mature people who have been trained to know right from wrong . Footnotes - 5.6 Melchizedek : When Melchizedek is mentioned in the Old Testament , he is described as a priest who lived before Aaron . Nothing is said about his ancestors or his death ( see 7.3 and Genesis 14.17-20 ) . Copyright ©
CEV	Hebrews	5	1995	by American Bible Society For more information about CEV , visit www.bibles.com and www.cev.bible .
CEV	Hebrews	6	6	We must try to become mature and start thinking about more than just the basic things we were taught about Christ . We should n't need to keep talking about why we ought to turn from deeds that bring death and why we ought to have faith in God .
CEV	Hebrews	6	2	And we should n't need to keep teaching about baptisms [ a ] or about the laying on of hands [ b ] or about people being raised from death and the future judgment .
CEV	Hebrews	6	3	Let 's grow up , if God is willing . 4-6 But what about people who turn away after they have already seen the light and have received the gift from heaven and have shared in the Holy Spirit ? What about those who turn away after they have received the good message of God and the powers of the future world ? There is no way to bring them back . What they are doing is the same as nailing the Son of God to a cross and insulting him in public !
CEV	Hebrews	6	7	A field is useful to farmers , if there is enough rain to make good crops grow . In fact , God will bless such a field .
CEV	Hebrews	6	8	( A ) But land that produces only thornbushes is worthless . It is likely to fall under God 's curse , and in the end it will be set on fire .
CEV	Hebrews	6	9	My friends , we are talking this way . But we are sure that you are doing those really good things people do when they are being saved .
CEV	Hebrews	6	10	God is always fair . He will remember how you helped his people in the past and how you are still helping them . You belong to God , and he wo n't forget the love you have shown his people .
CEV	Hebrews	6	11	We wish each of you would always be eager to show how strong and lasting your hope really is .
CEV	Hebrews	6	12	Then you would never be lazy . You would be following the example of those who had faith and were patient until God kept his promise to them . God 's Promise Is Sure
CEV	Hebrews	6	13	No one is greater than God . So he made a promise in his own name when he said to Abraham ,
CEV	Hebrews	6	14	( B ) “ I , the Lord , will bless you with many descendants ! ”
CEV	Hebrews	6	15	Then after Abraham had been very patient , he was given what God had promised .
CEV	Hebrews	6	16	When anyone wants to settle an argument , they make a vow by using the name of someone or something greater than themselves .
CEV	Hebrews	6	17	So when God wanted to prove for certain his promise to his people could not be broken , he made a vow .
CEV	Hebrews	6	18	God can not tell lies ! And so his promises and vows are two things that can never be changed . We have run to God for safety . Now his promises should greatly encourage us to take hold of the hope that is right in front of us .
CEV	Hebrews	6	19	( C ) This hope is like a firm and steady anchor for our souls . In fact , hope reaches behind the curtain [ c ] and into the most holy place .
CEV	Hebrews	6	20	( D ) Jesus has gone there ahead of us , and he is our high priest forever , just like Melchizedek . [ d ] Footnotes - 6.2 baptisms : Or “ ceremonies of washing. ” - 6.2 laying on of hands : This was a ceremony in which church leaders and others put their hands on people to show that those people were chosen to do some special kind of work . - 6.19 behind the curtain : In the tent that was used for worship , a curtain separated the “ holy place ” from the “ most holy place , ” which only the high priest could enter . - 6.20 Melchizedek : See the note at 5.6 .

CEV	Hebrews	7	7	Everyone agrees a person who gives a blessing is greater than the one who receives the blessing .
CEV	Hebrews	7	2	Then Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had . The meaning of the name Melchizedek is “ King of Justice. ” But since Salem means “ peace , ” he is also “ King of Peace. ”
CEV	Hebrews	7	3	We are not told he had a father or mother or ancestors or beginning or end . He is like the Son of God and will be a priest forever . [ a ]
CEV	Hebrews	7	4	Notice how great Melchizedek was ! Our famous ancestor Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had taken from his enemies .
CEV	Hebrews	7	5	( B ) The Law teaches that even Abraham 's descendants must give a tenth of what they possess . And they are to give this to their own relatives , who are the descendants of Levi and are priests .
CEV	Hebrews	7	6	Although Melchizedek was n't a descendant of Levi , Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had . Then Melchizedek blessed Abraham , who had been given God 's promise .
CEV	Hebrews	7	8	Priests are given a tenth of what people earn . But all priests die , except Melchizedek , and the Scriptures teach that he is alive .
CEV	Hebrews	7	9	Levi 's descendants are now the ones who receive a tenth from people . We could even say that when Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth , Levi also gave him a tenth .
CEV	Hebrews	7	10	This is because Levi was born later into the family of Abraham , who gave a tenth to Melchizedek .
CEV	Hebrews	7	11	Even though the Law of Moses says the priests must be descendants of Levi , those priests can not make anyone perfect . So there needs to be a priest like Melchizedek , rather than one from the priestly family of Aaron . [ b ]
CEV	Hebrews	7	12	And when the rules for selecting a priest are changed , the Law must also be changed .
CEV	Hebrews	7	13	The person we are talking about is our Lord , who came from a tribe that had never had anyone to serve as a priest at the altar .
CEV	Hebrews	7	14	Everyone knows he came from the tribe of Judah , and Moses never said priests would come from that tribe .
CEV	Hebrews	7	15	All of this becomes clearer , when someone who is like Melchizedek is appointed to be a priest .
CEV	Hebrews	7	16	That person was n't appointed because of his ancestors , but because his life can never end .
CEV	Hebrews	7	17	( C ) The Scriptures say about him , “ You are a priest forever , just like Melchizedek. ”
CEV	Hebrews	7	18	In this way a weak and useless command was put aside ,
CEV	Hebrews	7	19	because the Law can not make anything perfect . At the same time , we are given a much better hope , and it can bring us close to God . 20-21 ( D ) God himself made a promise when this priest was appointed . But he did not make a promise like this when the other priests were appointed . The promise he made is , “ I , the Lord , promise that you will be a priest forever ! And I will never change my mind ! ”
CEV	Hebrews	7	22	This means that Jesus guarantees us a better agreement with God .
CEV	Hebrews	7	23	There have been a lot of other priests , and all of them have died .
CEV	Hebrews	7	24	But Jesus will never die , and so he will be a priest forever !
CEV	Hebrews	7	25	He is forever able to save [ c ] the people he leads to God , because he always lives to speak to God for them .
CEV	Hebrews	7	26	Jesus is the high priest we need . He is holy and innocent and faultless , and not at all like us sinners . Jesus is honored above all beings in heaven ,
CEV	Hebrews	7	27	( E ) and he is better than any other high priest . Jesus does n't need to offer sacrifices each day for his own sins and then for the sins of the people . He offered a sacrifice once for all , when he gave himself .
CEV	Hebrews	7	28	The Law appoints priests who have weaknesses . But God 's promise , which came later than the Law , appoints his Son . And he is the perfect high priest forever . Footnotes - 7.3 will be a priest forever : See the note at 5.6 . - 7.11 descendants of Levi … from the priestly family of Aaron : Levi was the ancestor of the tribe from which priests and their helpers ( called “ Levites ” ) were chosen . Aaron was the first high priest . - 7.25 forever able to save : Or “ able to save forever. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Hebrews	8	8	( C ) But the Lord found fault with it and said , “ I tell you the time will come , when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and the people of Judah .
CEV	Hebrews	8	2	He also serves as the priest in the most holy place [ b ] inside the real tent there in heaven . This tent of worship was set up by the Lord , not by humans .
CEV	Hebrews	8	3	Since all priests must offer gifts and sacrifices , Christ also needed to have something to offer .
CEV	Hebrews	8	4	If he were here on earth , he would not be a priest at all , because here the Law appoints other priests to offer sacrifices .
CEV	Hebrews	8	5	( B ) But the tent where they serve is just a copy and a shadow of the real one in heaven . Before Moses made the tent , he was told , “ Be sure to make it exactly like the pattern you were shown on the mountain ! ”
CEV	Hebrews	8	6	Now Christ has been appointed to serve as a priest in a much better way , and he has given us much assurance of a better agreement .
CEV	Hebrews	8	7	If the first agreement with God had been all right , there would not have been any need for another one .
CEV	Hebrews	8	9	It wo n't be like the agreement that I made with their ancestors , when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt . They broke their agreement with me , and I stopped caring about them !
CEV	Hebrews	8	10	“ But now I tell the people of Israel this is my new agreement : ‘ The time will come when I , the Lord , will write my laws on their minds and hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
CEV	Hebrews	8	11	Not one of them will have to teach another to know me , their Lord. ’ “ All of them will know me , no matter who they are .
CEV	Hebrews	8	12	I will treat them with kindness , even though they are wicked . I will forget their sins. ”
CEV	Hebrews	8	13	When the Lord talks about a new agreement , he means that the first one is out of date . And anything that is old and useless will soon disappear . Copyright ©

CEV	Hebrews	9	9	This also has a meaning for today . It shows we can not make our consciences clear by offering gifts and sacrifices .
CEV	Hebrews	9	2	( A ) The first part of the tent was called the holy place , and a lampstand , a table , and the sacred loaves of bread were kept there .
CEV	Hebrews	9	3	( B ) Behind the curtain was the most holy place .
CEV	Hebrews	9	4	( C ) The gold altar for burning incense was in this holy place . The gold-covered sacred chest was also there , and inside it were three things . First , there was a gold jar filled with manna . [ a ] Then there was Aaron 's walking stick that sprouted . [ b ] Finally , there were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments written on them .
CEV	Hebrews	9	5	( D ) On top of the chest were the glorious creatures with wings [ c ] opened out above the place of mercy . [ d ] Now is n't the time to go into detail about these things .
CEV	Hebrews	9	6	( E ) But this is how everything was when the priests went each day into the first part of the tent to do their duties .
CEV	Hebrews	9	7	( F ) However , only the high priest could go into the second part of the tent , and he went in only once a year . Each time he carried blood to offer for his sins and for any sins that the people had committed without meaning to .
CEV	Hebrews	9	8	All of this is the Holy Spirit 's way of saying no one could enter the most holy place while the tent was still the place of worship .
CEV	Hebrews	9	10	These rules are merely about such things as eating and drinking and ceremonies for washing ourselves . And rules about physical things will last only until the time comes to change them for something better .
CEV	Hebrews	9	11	( G ) Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here . [ e ] He also went into a much better tent that was n't made by humans and that does n't belong to this world .
CEV	Hebrews	9	12	Then Christ went once for all into the most holy place and freed us from sin forever . He did this by offering his own blood instead of the blood of goats and bulls .
CEV	Hebrews	9	13	( H ) According to the Law of Moses , those people who become unclean are not fit to worship God . Yet they will be considered clean , if they are sprinkled with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a sacrificed calf .
CEV	Hebrews	9	14	But Christ was sinless , and he offered himself as an eternal and spiritual sacrifice to God . This is why his blood is much more powerful and makes our [ f ] consciences clear . Now we can serve the living God and no longer do things that lead to death .
CEV	Hebrews	9	15	Christ died to rescue those who had sinned and broken the old agreement . Now he brings his chosen ones a new agreement with its guarantee of God 's eternal blessings !
CEV	Hebrews	9	16	In fact , making an agreement of this kind is like writing a will . This is because the one who makes the will must die before it is of any use .
CEV	Hebrews	9	17	In other words , a will does n't go into effect as long as the one who made it is still alive .
CEV	Hebrews	9	18	Blood was also used [ g ] to put the first agreement into effect .
CEV	Hebrews	9	19	( I ) Moses told the people all the Law said they must do . Then he used red wool and a hyssop plant to sprinkle the people and the book of the Law with the blood of bulls and goats [ h ] and with water .
CEV	Hebrews	9	20	He told the people , “ With this blood God makes his agreement with you. ”
CEV	Hebrews	9	21	( J ) Moses also sprinkled blood on the tent and on everything else used in worship .
CEV	Hebrews	9	22	( K ) The Law says that almost everything must be sprinkled with blood , and no sins can be forgiven unless blood is offered . Christ 's Great Sacrifice
CEV	Hebrews	9	23	These things are only copies of what is in heaven , and so they had to be made holy by these ceremonies . But the real things in heaven must be made holy by something better .
CEV	Hebrews	9	24	This is why Christ did not go into a tent made by humans and was only a copy of the real one . Instead , he went into heaven and is now there with God to help us .
CEV	Hebrews	9	25	Christ did not have to offer himself many times . He was n't like a high priest who goes into the most holy place each year to offer the blood of an animal .
CEV	Hebrews	9	26	If he had offered himself every year , he would have suffered many times since the creation of the world . But instead , near the end of time he offered himself once and for all , so he could be a sacrifice that does away with sin .
CEV	Hebrews	9	27	We die only once , and then we are judged .
CEV	Hebrews	9	28	( L ) So Christ died only once to take away the sins of many people . But when he comes again , it will not be to take away sin . He will come to save everyone who is waiting for him . Footnotes - 9.4 manna : When the people of Israel were wandering through the desert , the Lord provided them with food that could be made into thin wafers . This food was called manna , which in Hebrew means “ What is it ? ” - 9.4 Aaron 's walking stick that sprouted : According to Numbers 17.1-11 , Aaron 's walking stick sprouted and produced almonds to show that the Lord was pleased with him and Moses . - 9.5 glorious creatures with wings : Two of these creatures ( called “ cherubim ” in Hebrew and Greek ) with outspread wings were on top of the sacred chest and were symbols of God 's throne . - 9.5 place of mercy : The lid of the sacred chest , which was thought to be God 's throne on earth . - 9.11 that are now here : Some manuscripts have “ that were coming. ” - 9.14 our : Some manuscripts have “ your , ” and others have “ their. ” - 9.18 Blood was also used : Or “ There also had to be a death. ” - 9.19 blood of bulls and goats : Some manuscripts do not have “ and goats. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Hebrews	10	10	So we are made holy because Christ obeyed God and offered himself once for all .
CEV	Hebrews	10	2	If there were worshipers who already have their sins washed away and their consciences made clear , there would not be any need to go on offering sacrifices . 3-4 But the blood of bulls and goats can not take away sins . It only reminds people of their sins from one year to the next .
CEV	Hebrews	10	5	( A ) When Christ came into the world , he said to God , “ Sacrifices and offerings are not what you want , but you have given me my body .
CEV	Hebrews	10	6	No , you are not pleased with animal sacrifices and offerings for sin. ”
CEV	Hebrews	10	7	Then Christ said , “ And so , my God , I have come to do what you want , as the Scriptures say. ”
CEV	Hebrews	10	8	The Law teaches that offerings and sacrifices must be made because of sin . But why did Christ mention these things and say that God did not want them ?
CEV	Hebrews	10	9	Well , it was to do away with offerings and sacrifices and to replace them . This is what he meant by saying to God , “ I have come to do what you want. ”
CEV	Hebrews	10	11	( B ) The priests do their work each day , and they keep on offering sacrifices that can never take away sins .
CEV	Hebrews	10	12	( C ) But Christ offered himself as a sacrifice that is good forever . Now he is sitting at God 's right side , [ a ]
CEV	Hebrews	10	13	and he will stay there until his enemies are put under his power .
CEV	Hebrews	10	14	By his one sacrifice he has forever set free from sin the people he brings to God .
CEV	Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also speaks of this by telling us that the Lord said ,
CEV	Hebrews	10	16	( D ) “ When the time comes , I will make an agreement with them . I will write my laws on their minds and hearts .
CEV	Hebrews	10	17	( E ) Then I will forget about their sins and no longer remember their evil deeds. ”
CEV	Hebrews	10	18	When sins are forgiven , there is no more need to offer sacrifices . Encouragement and Warning
CEV	Hebrews	10	19	My friends , the blood of Jesus gives us courage to enter the most holy place
CEV	Hebrews	10	20	by a new way that leads to life ! And this way takes us through the curtain that is Christ himself .
CEV	Hebrews	10	21	We have a great high priest who is in charge of God 's house .
CEV	Hebrews	10	22	( F ) So let 's come near God with pure hearts and a confidence that comes from having faith . Let 's keep our hearts pure , our consciences free from evil , and our bodies washed with clean water .
CEV	Hebrews	10	23	We must hold tightly to the hope we say is ours . After all , we can trust the one who made the agreement with us .
CEV	Hebrews	10	24	We should keep on encouraging each other to be thoughtful and to do helpful things .
CEV	Hebrews	10	25	Some people have given up the habit of meeting for worship , but we must not do that . We should keep on encouraging each other , especially since you know that the day of the Lord 's coming is getting closer .
CEV	Hebrews	10	26	No sacrifices can be made for people who decide to sin after they find out about the truth .
CEV	Hebrews	10	27	( G ) They are God 's enemies , and all they can look forward to is a terrible judgment and a furious fire .
CEV	Hebrews	10	28	( H ) If two or more witnesses accused someone of breaking the Law of Moses , that person could be put to death .
CEV	Hebrews	10	29	( I ) But it is much worse to dishonor God 's Son and to disgrace the blood of the promise that made us holy . And it is just as bad to insult the Holy Spirit , who shows us mercy .
CEV	Hebrews	10	30	( J ) We know that God has said he will punish and take revenge . We also know that the Scriptures say the Lord will judge his people .
CEV	Hebrews	10	31	It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God !
CEV	Hebrews	10	32	Do n't forget all the hard times you went through when you first received the light .
CEV	Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes you were abused and mistreated in public , and at other times you shared in the sufferings of others .
CEV	Hebrews	10	34	You were kind to people in jail . And you gladly let your possessions be taken away , because you knew you had something better , something that would last forever .
CEV	Hebrews	10	35	Keep on being brave ! It will bring you great rewards .
CEV	Hebrews	10	36	Learn to be patient , so you will please God and be given what he has promised .
CEV	Hebrews	10	37	( K ) As the Scriptures say , “ God is coming soon ! It wo n't be very long .
CEV	Hebrews	10	38	The people God accepts will live because of their faith . [ b ] But he is n't pleased with anyone who turns back. ”
CEV	Hebrews	10	39	We are not like those people who turn back and get destroyed . We will keep on having faith until we are saved . Copyright ©

CEV	Hebrews	11	11	( H ) Even when Sarah was too old to have children , she had faith that God would do what he had promised , and she had a son .
CEV	Hebrews	11	2	( A ) It was their faith that made our ancestors pleasing to God .
CEV	Hebrews	11	3	( B ) Because of our faith , we know that the world was made at God 's command . We also know that what can be seen was made out of what can not be seen .
CEV	Hebrews	11	4	( C ) Because Abel had faith , he offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did . God was pleased with him and his gift , and even though Abel is now dead , his faith still speaks for him .
CEV	Hebrews	11	5	( D ) Enoch had faith and did not die . He pleased God , and God took him up to heaven . This is why his body was never found .
CEV	Hebrews	11	6	But without faith no one can please God . We must believe that God is real and rewards everyone who searches for him .
CEV	Hebrews	11	7	( E ) Because Noah had faith , he was warned about something that had not yet happened . He obeyed and built a boat that saved him and his family . In this way the people of the world were judged , and Noah was given the blessings that come to everyone who pleases God .
CEV	Hebrews	11	8	( F ) Abraham had faith and obeyed God . He was told to go to the land that God had said would be his , and he left for a country he had never seen .
CEV	Hebrews	11	9	( G ) Because Abraham had faith , he lived as a stranger in the promised land . He lived there in a tent , and so did Isaac and Jacob , who were later given the same promise .
CEV	Hebrews	11	10	Abraham did this , because he was waiting for the eternal city God had planned and built .
CEV	Hebrews	11	12	( I ) Her husband Abraham was almost dead , but he became the ancestor of many people . In fact , there are as many of them as there are stars in the sky or grains of sand along the seashore .
CEV	Hebrews	11	13	( J ) Every one of those people died . But they still had faith , even though they had not received what they had been promised . They were glad just to see these things from far away , and they agreed that they were only strangers and foreigners on this earth .
CEV	Hebrews	11	14	When people talk this way , it is clear they are looking for a place to call their own .
CEV	Hebrews	11	15	If they had been talking about the land where they had once lived , they could have gone back at any time .
CEV	Hebrews	11	16	But they were looking forward to a better home in heaven . This is why God was n't ashamed for them to call him their God . He even built a city for them . 17-18 ( K ) ( L ) Abraham had been promised that Isaac , his only son , [ a ] would continue his family . But when Abraham was tested , he had faith and was willing to sacrifice Isaac ,
CEV	Hebrews	11	19	because he was sure that God could raise people to life . This was just like getting Isaac back from death .
CEV	Hebrews	11	20	( M ) Isaac had faith , and he promised blessings to Jacob and Esau .
CEV	Hebrews	11	21	( N ) Later , when Jacob was about to die , he leaned on his walking stick and worshiped . Then because of his faith he blessed each of Joseph 's sons .
CEV	Hebrews	11	22	( O ) And right before Joseph died , he had faith that God would lead the people of Israel out of Egypt . So he told them to take his bones with them .
CEV	Hebrews	11	23	( P ) Because Moses ' parents had faith , they kept him hidden until he was three months old . They saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid to disobey the king 's orders . [ b ]
CEV	Hebrews	11	24	( Q ) Then after Moses grew up , his faith made him refuse to be called the king 's grandson .
CEV	Hebrews	11	25	( R ) He chose to be mistreated with God 's people instead of having the good time that sin could bring for a little while .
CEV	Hebrews	11	26	Moses knew that the treasures of Egypt were not as wonderful as what he would receive from suffering for the Messiah , [ c ] and he looked forward to his reward .
CEV	Hebrews	11	27	Because of his faith , Moses left Egypt . Moses had seen the invisible God and was n't afraid of the king 's anger .
CEV	Hebrews	11	28	( S ) His faith also made him celebrate Passover . He sprinkled the blood of animals on the doorposts , so that the first-born sons of the people of Israel would not be killed by the destroying angel .
CEV	Hebrews	11	29	( T ) Because of their faith , the people walked through the Red Sea [ d ] on dry land . But when the Egyptians tried to do it , they were drowned .
CEV	Hebrews	11	30	( U ) God 's people had faith , and when they had walked around the city of Jericho for seven days , its walls fell down .
CEV	Hebrews	11	31	( V ) Rahab had been a prostitute , but she had faith and welcomed the spies . So she was n't killed with the people who disobeyed .
CEV	Hebrews	11	32	( W ) What else can I say ? There is n't enough time to tell about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
CEV	Hebrews	11	33	( X ) Their faith helped them conquer kingdoms , and because they did right , God made promises to them . They closed the jaws of lions
CEV	Hebrews	11	34	( Y ) and put out raging fires and escaped from the swords of their enemies . Although they were weak , they were given the strength and power to chase foreign armies away .
CEV	Hebrews	11	35	( Z ) Some women received their loved ones back from death . Many of these people were tortured , but they refused to be released . They were sure they would get a better reward when the dead are raised to life .
CEV	Hebrews	11	36	( AA ) Others were made fun of and beaten with whips , and some were chained in jail .
CEV	Hebrews	11	37	( AB ) Still others were stoned to death or sawed in two [ e ] or killed with swords . Some had nothing but sheep skins or goat skins to wear . They were poor , mistreated , and tortured .
CEV	Hebrews	11	38	The world did not deserve these good people , who had to wander in deserts and on mountains and had to live in caves and holes in the ground .
CEV	Hebrews	11	39	All of them pleased God because of their faith ! But still they died without being given what had been promised .
CEV	Hebrews	11	40	This was because God had something better in store for us . And he did not want them to reach the goal of their faith without us . Footnotes - 11.17,18 his only son : Although Abraham had a son by a slave woman , his son Isaac was considered his only son , because he was born as a result of God 's promise to Abraham . - 11.23 the king 's orders : The king of Egypt ordered all Israelite baby boys to be left outside of their homes , so they would die or be killed . - 11.26 the Messiah : Or “ Christ. ” - 11.29 Red Sea : This name comes from the Bible of the early Christians , a translation made into Greek about

CEV	Hebrews	12	12	( D ) Now stand up straight ! Stop your knees from shaking
CEV	Hebrews	12	2	( B ) We must keep our eyes on Jesus , who leads us and makes our faith complete . He endured the shame of being nailed to a cross , because he knew later on he would be glad he did . Now he is seated at the right side [ a ] of God 's throne !
CEV	Hebrews	12	3	So keep your mind on Jesus , who put up with many insults from sinners . Then you wo n't get discouraged and give up .
CEV	Hebrews	12	4	None of you have yet been hurt [ b ] in your battle against sin .
CEV	Hebrews	12	5	( C ) But you have forgotten that the Scriptures say to God 's children , “ When the Lord punishes you , do n't make light of it , and when he corrects you , do n't be discouraged .
CEV	Hebrews	12	6	The Lord corrects the people he loves and disciplines those he calls his own. ”
CEV	Hebrews	12	7	Be patient when you are being corrected ! This is how God treats his children . Do n't all parents correct their children ?
CEV	Hebrews	12	8	God corrects all his children , and if he does n't correct you , then you do n't really belong to him .
CEV	Hebrews	12	9	Our earthly fathers correct us , and we still respect them . Is n't it even better to be given true life by letting our spiritual Father correct us ?
CEV	Hebrews	12	10	Our human fathers correct us for a short time , and they do it as they think best . But God corrects us for our own good , because he wants us to be holy , as he is .
CEV	Hebrews	12	11	It is never fun to be corrected . In fact , at the time it is always painful . But if we learn to obey by being corrected , we will do right and live at peace .
CEV	Hebrews	12	13	( E ) and walk a straight path . Then lame people will be healed , instead of getting worse . Warning against Turning from God
CEV	Hebrews	12	14	Try to live at peace with everyone ! Live a clean life . If you do n't , you will never see the Lord .
CEV	Hebrews	12	15	( F ) Make sure no one misses out on God 's wonderful kindness . Do n't let anyone become bitter and cause trouble for the rest of you .
CEV	Hebrews	12	16	( G ) Watch out for immoral and ungodly people like Esau , who sold his future blessing [ c ] for only one meal .
CEV	Hebrews	12	17	( H ) You know how he later wanted it back . But there was nothing he could do to change things , even though he begged his father and cried .
CEV	Hebrews	12	18	( I ) You have not come to a place like Mount Sinai [ d ] that can be seen and touched . There is no flaming fire or dark cloud or storm
CEV	Hebrews	12	19	or trumpet sound . The people of Israel heard a voice speak . But they begged it to stop ,
CEV	Hebrews	12	20	( J ) because they could not obey its commands . They were even told to kill any animal that touched the mountain .
CEV	Hebrews	12	21	The sight was so frightening that Moses said he shook with fear .
CEV	Hebrews	12	22	You have now come to Mount Zion and to the heavenly Jerusalem . This is the city of the living God , where thousands and thousands of angels have come to celebrate .
CEV	Hebrews	12	23	Here you will find all of God 's dearest children , [ e ] whose names are written in heaven . And you will find God himself , who judges everyone . Here also are the spirits of those good people who have been made perfect .
CEV	Hebrews	12	24	( K ) And Jesus is here ! He is the one who makes God 's new agreement with us , and his sprinkled blood says much better things than the blood of Abel . [ f ]
CEV	Hebrews	12	25	( L ) Make sure you obey the one who speaks to you . The people did not escape , when they refused to obey the one who spoke to them at Mount Sinai . Do you think you can possibly escape , if you refuse to obey the one who speaks to you from heaven ?
CEV	Hebrews	12	26	( M ) When God spoke the first time , his voice shook only the earth . This time he has promised to shake the earth once again , and heaven too .
CEV	Hebrews	12	27	The words “ once again ” mean that these created things will someday be shaken and removed . Then what can not be shaken will last .
CEV	Hebrews	12	28	We should be grateful we were given a kingdom that can not be shaken . And in this kingdom we please God by worshiping him and by showing him great honor and respect .
CEV	Hebrews	12	29	( N ) Our God is like a destructive fire !

CEV	Hebrews	13	13	This is why we should go outside the camp to Jesus and share in his disgrace .
CEV	Hebrews	13	2	( A ) Be sure to welcome strangers into your home . By doing this , some people have welcomed angels as guests , without even knowing it .
CEV	Hebrews	13	3	Remember the Lord 's people who are in jail and be concerned for them . Do n't forget those who are suffering , but imagine you are there with them .
CEV	Hebrews	13	4	( B ) Have respect for marriage . Always be faithful to your partner , because God will punish anyone who is immoral or unfaithful in marriage .
CEV	Hebrews	13	5	( C ) Do n't fall in love with money . Be satisfied with what you have . The Lord has promised that he will not leave us or desert us .
CEV	Hebrews	13	6	( D ) This should make you feel like saying , “ The Lord helps me ! Why should I be afraid of what people can do to me ? ”
CEV	Hebrews	13	7	Do n't forget about your leaders who taught you God 's message . Remember what kind of lives they lived and try to have faith like theirs .
CEV	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ never changes ! He is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
CEV	Hebrews	13	9	Do n't be fooled by any kind of strange teachings . It is better to receive strength from God 's gift of undeserved grace than to depend on certain foods . After all , these foods do n't really help the people who eat them .
CEV	Hebrews	13	10	But we have an altar where even the priests who serve in the place of worship have no right to eat .
CEV	Hebrews	13	11	( E ) After the high priest offers the blood of animals as a sin offering , the bodies of those animals are burned outside the camp .
CEV	Hebrews	13	12	Jesus himself suffered outside the city gate , so his blood would make people holy .
CEV	Hebrews	13	14	On this earth we do n't have a city that lasts forever , but we are waiting for such a city .
CEV	Hebrews	13	15	Our sacrifice is to keep offering praise to God in the name of Jesus .
CEV	Hebrews	13	16	But do n't forget to help others and to share your possessions with them . This too is like offering a sacrifice that pleases God .
CEV	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders and do what they say . They are watching over you , and they must answer to God . So do n't make them sad as they do their work . Make them happy . Otherwise , they wo n't be able to help you at all .
CEV	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us . Our consciences are clear , and we always try to live right .
CEV	Hebrews	13	19	I especially want you to pray that I can visit you again soon . Final Prayers and Greetings
CEV	Hebrews	13	20	God gives peace , and he raised our Lord Jesus Christ from death . Now Jesus is like a Great Shepherd whose blood was used to make God 's eternal agreement with his flock . [ a ]

CEV	James	1	1	( A ) From James , a servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ . Greetings to the twelve tribes scattered all over the world . [ a ] Faith and Wisdom
CEV	James	1	2	( B ) My friends , be glad , even if you have a lot of trouble .
CEV	James	1	3	You know you learn to endure by having your faith tested .
CEV	James	1	4	But you must learn to endure everything , so you will be completely mature and not lacking in anything .
CEV	James	1	5	( C ) If any of you need wisdom , you should ask God , and it will be given to you . God is generous and wo n't correct you for asking .
CEV	James	1	6	But when you ask for something , you must have faith and not doubt . Anyone who doubts is like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm . 7-8 If you are that kind of person , you ca n't make up your mind , and you surely ca n't be trusted . So do n't expect the Lord to give you anything at all . Poor People and Rich People
CEV	James	1	9	Any of God 's people who are poor should be glad he thinks so highly of them .
CEV	James	1	10	( D ) But any who are rich should be glad when God makes them humble . Rich people will disappear like wild flowers
CEV	James	1	11	scorched by the burning heat of the sun . The flowers lose their blossoms , and their beauty is destroyed . This is how the rich will disappear , as they go about their business . Trials and Temptations
CEV	James	1	12	( E ) God will bless you , if you do n't give up when your faith is being tested . He will reward you with a glorious life , [ b ] just as he rewards everyone who loves him .
CEV	James	1	13	( F ) Do n't blame God when you are tempted ! God can not be tempted by evil , and he does n't use evil to tempt others .
CEV	James	1	14	We are tempted by our own desires that drag us off and trap us .
CEV	James	1	15	Our desires make us sin , and when sin is finished with us , it leaves us dead .
CEV	James	1	16	Do n't be fooled , my dear friends .
CEV	James	1	17	Every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father who created all the lights in the heavens . He is always the same and never makes dark shadows by changing .
CEV	James	1	18	He wanted us to be his own special people , [ c ] and so he sent the true message to give us new birth . Hearing and Obeying
CEV	James	1	19	( G ) My dear friends , you should be quick to listen and slow to speak or to get angry .
CEV	James	1	20	If you are angry , you can not do any of the good things God wants done .
CEV	James	1	21	You must stop doing anything immoral or evil . Instead be humble and accept the message planted in you to save you .
CEV	James	1	22	Obey God 's message ! Do n't fool yourselves by just listening to it .
CEV	James	1	23	If you hear the message and do n't obey it , you are like people who stare at themselves in a mirror
CEV	James	1	24	and forget what they look like as soon as they leave .
CEV	James	1	25	But you must never stop looking at the perfect law that sets you free . God will bless you in everything you do , if you listen and obey , and do n't just hear and forget .
CEV	James	1	26	If you think you are being religious , but ca n't control your tongue , you are fooling yourself , and your religion is useless .
CEV	James	1	27	Religion that pleases God the Father must be pure and spotless . You must help needy orphans and widows and not let this world make you evil . Footnotes - 1.1 twelve tribes scattered all over the world : James is saying that the Lord 's followers are like the tribes of Israel that were scattered everywhere by their enemies . - 1.12 a glorious life : The Greek text has “ the crown of life. ” In ancient times an athlete who had won a contest was rewarded with a crown of flowers as a sign of victory . - 1.18 his own special people : The Greek text has “ the first of his creatures. ” The Law of Moses taught that the first-born of all animals and the first part of the harvest were special and belonged to the Lord .

CEV	James	2	2	Suppose a rich person wearing fancy clothes and a gold ring comes to one of your meetings . And suppose a poor person dressed in worn-out clothes also comes .
CEV	James	2	3	You must not give the best seat to the one in fancy clothes and tell the one who is poor to stand at the side or sit on the floor .
CEV	James	2	4	This is the same as saying that some people are better than others , and you would be acting like a crooked judge .
CEV	James	2	5	My dear friends , pay attention . God has given a lot of faith to the poor people in this world . God has also promised them a share in his kingdom that he will give to everyone who loves him .
CEV	James	2	6	You mistreat the poor . But is n't it the rich who boss you around and drag you off to court ?
CEV	James	2	7	Are n't they the ones who make fun of your Lord ?
CEV	James	2	8	( A ) You will do all right , if you obey the most important law [ a ] in the Scriptures . It is the law that commands us to love others as much as we love ourselves .
CEV	James	2	9	But if you treat some people better than others , you have done wrong , and the Scriptures teach that you have sinned .
CEV	James	2	10	( B ) If you obey every law except one , you are still guilty of breaking them all .
CEV	James	2	11	( C ) The same God who told us to be faithful in marriage also told us not to murder . So even if you are faithful in marriage , but murder someone , you still have broken God 's Law .
CEV	James	2	12	Speak and act like people who will be judged by the law that sets us free .
CEV	James	2	13	Do this , because on the day of judgment there will be no pity for those who have not had pity on others . But even in judgment , God is merciful ! [ b ] Faith and Works
CEV	James	2	14	My friends , what good is it to say you have faith , when you do n't do anything to show you really do have faith ? Can this kind of faith save you ?
CEV	James	2	15	If you know someone who does n't have any clothes or food ,
CEV	James	2	16	you should n't just say , “ I hope all goes well for you . I hope you will be warm and have plenty to eat. ” What good is it to say this , unless you do something to help ?
CEV	James	2	17	Faith that does n't lead us to do good deeds is all alone and dead !
CEV	James	2	18	Suppose someone disagrees and says , “ It is possible to have faith without doing kind deeds. ” I would answer , “ Prove that you have faith without doing kind deeds , and I will prove that I have faith by doing them. ”
CEV	James	2	19	You surely believe there is only one God . That 's fine . Even demons believe this , and it makes them shake with fear .
CEV	James	2	20	Does some stupid person want proof that faith without deeds is useless ?
CEV	James	2	21	( D ) Well , our ancestor Abraham pleased God by putting his son Isaac on the altar to sacrifice him .
CEV	James	2	22	Now you see how Abraham 's faith and deeds worked together . He proved his faith was real by what he did .
CEV	James	2	23	( E ) This is what the Scriptures mean by saying , “ Abraham had faith in God , and God accepted him. ” That 's how Abraham became God 's friend .
CEV	James	2	24	You can now see that we please God by what we do and not only by what we believe .
CEV	James	2	25	( F ) For example , Rahab had been a prostitute . But she pleased God when she welcomed the spies and sent them home by another way .
CEV	James	2	26	Anyone who does n't breathe is dead , and faith that does n't do anything is just as dead ! Copyright ©

CEV	James	3	3	By putting a bit into the mouth of a horse , we can turn the horse in different directions .
CEV	James	3	2	( A ) All of us do many wrong things . But if you can control your tongue , you are mature and able to control your whole body .
CEV	James	3	4	It takes strong winds to move a large sailing ship , but the captain uses only a small rudder to make it go in any direction .
CEV	James	3	5	Our tongues are small too , and yet they brag about big things . It takes only a spark to start a forest fire !
CEV	James	3	6	( B ) The tongue is like a spark . It is an evil power that dirties the rest of the body and sets a person 's entire life on fire with flames that come from hell itself .
CEV	James	3	7	All kinds of animals , birds , reptiles , and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed .
CEV	James	3	8	But our tongues get out of control . They are restless and evil , and always spreading deadly poison . 9-10 ( C ) My dear friends , with our tongues we speak both praises and curses . We praise our Lord and Father , and we curse people who were created to be like God , and this is n't right .
CEV	James	3	11	Can clean water and dirty water both flow from the same spring ?
CEV	James	3	12	Can a fig tree produce olives or a grapevine produce figs ? Does fresh water come from a well full of salt water ? Wisdom from Above
CEV	James	3	13	( D ) Are any of you wise or sensible ? Then show it by living right and by being humble and wise in everything you do .
CEV	James	3	14	But if your heart is full of bitter jealousy and selfishness , do n't brag or lie to cover up the truth .
CEV	James	3	15	This kind of wisdom does n't come from above . It is earthly and selfish and comes from the devil himself .
CEV	James	3	16	Whenever people are jealous or selfish , they cause trouble and do all sorts of cruel things .
CEV	James	3	17	But the wisdom that comes from above leads us to be pure , friendly , gentle , sensible , kind , helpful , genuine , and sincere .
CEV	James	3	18	When peacemakers plant seeds of peace , they will harvest justice . Copyright ©

CEV	James	4	4	You people are n't faithful to God ! Do n't you know if you love the world , you are God 's enemies ? And if you decide to be a friend of the world , you make yourself an enemy of God .
CEV	James	4	2	You want something you do n't have , and you will do anything to get it . You will even kill ! But you still can not get what you want , and you wo n't get it by fighting and arguing . You should pray for it .
CEV	James	4	3	Yet even when you do pray , your prayers are not answered , because you pray just for selfish reasons .
CEV	James	4	5	Do you doubt the Scriptures that say , “ God truly cares about the Spirit he has put in us ” ? [ a ]
CEV	James	4	6	( A ) In fact , God treats us with even greater kindness , just as the Scriptures say , “ God opposes everyone who is proud , but he blesses all who are humble with undeserved grace. ”
CEV	James	4	7	Surrender to God ! Resist the devil , and he will run from you .
CEV	James	4	8	Come near to God , and he will come near to you . Clean up your lives , you sinners . Purify your hearts , you people who ca n't make up your mind .
CEV	James	4	9	Be sad and sorry and weep . Stop laughing and start crying . Be gloomy instead of glad .
CEV	James	4	10	Be humble in the Lord 's presence , and he will honor you . Saying Cruel Things about Others
CEV	James	4	11	My friends , do n't say cruel things about others ! If you do , or if you condemn others , you are condemning God 's Law . And if you condemn the Law , you put yourself above the Law and refuse to obey either it
CEV	James	4	12	or God who gave it . God is our judge , and he can save or destroy us . What right do you have to condemn anyone ? Warning against Bragging
CEV	James	4	13	( B ) ( C ) You should know better than to say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to the city . We will do business there for a year and make a lot of money ! ”
CEV	James	4	14	What do you know about tomorrow ? How can you be so sure about your life ? It is nothing more than mist that appears for only a little while before it disappears .
CEV	James	4	15	You should say , “ If the Lord lets us live , we will do these things. ”
CEV	James	4	16	Yet you are stupid enough to brag , and it is wrong to be so proud .
CEV	James	4	17	If you do n't do what you know is right , you have sinned . Footnotes - 4.5 God truly cares about the Spirit he has put in us : One possible meaning for the difficult Greek text ; other translations are possible , such as , “ the Spirit that God put in us truly cares. ” Copyright ©

CEV	James	5	5	While here on earth , you have thought only of filling your own stomachs and having a good time . But now you are like fat cattle on their way to be butchered .
CEV	James	5	2	( A ) Your treasures have already rotted , and moths have eaten your clothes .
CEV	James	5	3	( B ) Your money has rusted , and the rust will be evidence against you , as it burns your body like fire . Yet you keep on storing up wealth in these last days .
CEV	James	5	4	( C ) You refused to pay the people who worked in your fields , and now their unpaid wages are shouting out against you . The Lord All-Powerful has surely heard the cries of the workers who harvested your crops .
CEV	James	5	6	( D ) You have condemned and murdered innocent people , who could n't even fight back . Be Patient and Kind
CEV	James	5	7	My friends , be patient until the Lord returns . Think of farmers who wait patiently for the autumn and spring rains to make their valuable crops grow .
CEV	James	5	8	Be patient like those farmers and do n't give up . The Lord will soon be here !
CEV	James	5	9	Do n't grumble about each other or you will be judged , and the judge is right outside the door .
CEV	James	5	10	My friends , follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the Lord . They were patient , even when they had to suffer .
CEV	James	5	11	( E ) In fact , we praise the ones who endured the most . You remember how patient Job was and how the Lord finally helped him . The Lord did this because he is so merciful and kind .
CEV	James	5	12	( F ) My friends , above all else , do n't take an oath . You must not swear by heaven or by earth or by anything else . “ Yes ” or “ No ” is all you need to say . If you say anything more , you will be condemned .
CEV	James	5	13	If you are having trouble , you should pray . And if you are feeling good , you should sing praises .
CEV	James	5	14	( G ) If you are sick , ask the church leaders [ a ] to come and pray for you . Ask them to put olive oil [ b ] on you in the name of the Lord .
CEV	James	5	15	If you have faith when you pray for sick people , they will get well . The Lord will heal them , and if they have sinned , he will forgive them .
CEV	James	5	16	( H ) If you have sinned , you should tell each other what you have done . Then you can pray for one another and be healed . The prayer of an innocent person is powerful , and it can help a lot .
CEV	James	5	17	( I ) Elijah was just as human as we are , and for three and a half years his prayers kept the rain from falling .
CEV	James	5	18	( J ) But when he did pray for rain , it fell from the skies and made the crops grow .
CEV	James	5	19	My friends , if any followers have wandered away from the truth , you should try to lead them back .
CEV	James	5	20	( K ) If you turn sinners from the wrong way , you will save them from death , and many of their sins will be forgiven . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Peter	1	1	From Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ . To God 's people who are scattered like foreigners in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	2	God the Father decided to choose you as his people , and his Spirit has made you holy . You have obeyed Jesus Christ and are sprinkled with his blood . [ a ] I pray that God will be kind to you and will keep on giving you peace ! A Real Reason for Hope
CEV	1%20Peter	1	3	Praise God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . God is so good , and by raising Jesus from death , he has given us new life and a hope that lives on .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	4	( A ) God has something stored up for you in heaven , where it will never decay or be ruined or disappear .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	5	You have faith in God , whose power will protect you until the last day . [ b ] Then he will save you , just as he has always planned to do .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	6	On that day you will be glad , even if you have to go through many hard trials for a while .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	7	( B ) Your faith will be like gold that has been tested in a fire . And these trials will prove that your faith is worth much more than gold that can be destroyed . They will show that you will be given praise and honor and glory when Jesus Christ returns .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	8	You have never seen Jesus , and you do n't see him now . But still you love him and have faith in him , and no words can tell how glad and happy
CEV	1%20Peter	1	9	you are to be saved . This is why you have faith .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	10	Some prophets told how God would treat you with undeserved grace , and they searched hard to find out more about the way you would be saved .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	11	The Spirit of Christ was in them and was telling them how Christ would suffer and would then be given great honor . So they searched to find out exactly who Christ would be and when this would happen .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	12	But they were told that they were serving you and not themselves . They preached to you by the power of the Holy Spirit , who was sent from heaven . And their message was only for you , even though angels would like to know more about it . Chosen To Live a Holy Life
CEV	1%20Peter	1	13	Be alert and think straight . Put all your hope in how God will treat you with undeserved grace when Jesus Christ appears .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	14	Behave like obedient children . Do n't let your lives be controlled by your desires , as they used to be .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	15	Always live as God 's holy people should , because God is the one who chose you , and he is holy .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	16	( C ) That 's why the Scriptures say , “ I am the holy God , and you must be holy too. ”
CEV	1%20Peter	1	17	You say that God is your Father , but God does n't have favorites ! He judges all people by what they do . So you must honor God while you live as strangers here on earth .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	18	You were rescued [ c ] from the useless way of life you learned from your ancestors . But you know you were not rescued by such things as silver or gold that do n't last forever .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	19	( D ) You were rescued by the precious blood of Christ , that spotless and innocent lamb .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	20	Christ was chosen even before the world was created , but because of you , he did not come until these last days .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	21	And when he did come , it was to lead you to have faith in God , who raised him from death and honored him in a glorious way . This is why you have put your faith and hope in God .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	22	You obeyed the truth , [ d ] and your souls were made pure . Now you sincerely love each other . But you must keep on loving with all your heart .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	23	Do this because God has given you new birth by his message that lives on forever .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	24	( E ) The Scriptures say , “ Humans wither like grass , and their glory fades like wild flowers . Grass dries up , and flowers fall to the ground .
CEV	1%20Peter	1	25	But what the Lord has said will stand forever. ” Our good news to you is what the Lord has said . Footnotes - 1.2 sprinkled with his blood : According to Exodus 24.3-8 the people of Israel were sprinkled with the blood of cows to show they would keep their agreement with God . Peter says that it is the blood of Jesus that seals the agreement between God and his people ( see Hebrews 9.18-21 ) . - 1.5 the last day : When God will judge all people . - 1.18 rescued : The Greek word often , though not always , means payment of a price to free a slave or prisoner . - 1.22 You obeyed the truth : Some manuscripts add “ by the power of the Spirit. ” Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter
CEV	1%20Peter	2	2	Be like newborn babies who are thirsty for the pure spiritual milk that will help you grow and be saved .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	3	( A ) You have already found out how good the Lord really is .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	4	Come to Jesus Christ . He is the living stone people have rejected , but which God has chosen and highly honored .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	5	And now you are living stones being used to build a spiritual house . You are also a group of holy priests , and with the help of Jesus Christ you will offer sacrifices that please God .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	6	( B ) It is just as God says in the Scriptures , “ Look ! I am placing in Zion a choice and precious cornerstone . No one who has faith in this one will be disappointed. ”
CEV	1%20Peter	2	7	( C ) You are followers of the Lord , and this stone is precious to you . But it is n't precious to those who refuse to follow him . They are the builders who tossed aside the stone that turned out to be the most important one of all .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	8	( D ) They disobeyed the message and stumbled and fell over this stone , because they were doomed .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	9	( E ) But you are God 's chosen and special people . You are a group of royal priests and a holy nation . God has brought you out of darkness into his marvelous light . Now you must tell all the wonderful things he has done . The Scriptures say ,
CEV	1%20Peter	2	10	( F ) “ Once you were nobody . Now you are God 's people . At one time no one had mercy on you . Now God has treated you with kindness. ” Live as God 's Servants Should
CEV	1%20Peter	2	11	Dear friends , you are foreigners and strangers on this earth . So I beg you not to surrender to those desires that fight against you .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	12	Always let others see you behaving properly , even though they may still accuse you of doing wrong . Then on the day of judgment , they will honor God by telling the good things they saw you do .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	13	The Lord wants you to obey all human authorities , especially the Emperor , who rules over everyone .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	14	You must also obey governors , because they are sent by the Emperor to punish criminals and to praise good citizens .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	15	God wants you to silence stupid and ignorant people by doing right .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	16	You are free , but still you are God 's servants , and you must not use your freedom as an excuse for doing wrong .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	17	Respect everyone and show special love for God 's people . Honor God and respect the Emperor . The Example of Christ 's Suffering
CEV	1%20Peter	2	18	Servants , you must obey your masters and always show respect to them . Do this , not only to those who are kind and thoughtful , but also to those who are cruel .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	19	God will bless you , even if others treat you unfairly for being loyal to him .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	20	You do n't gain anything by being punished for some wrong you have done . But God will bless you , if you have to suffer for doing something good .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	21	After all , God chose you to suffer as you follow in the footsteps of Christ , who set an example by suffering for you .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	22	( G ) Christ did not sin or ever tell a lie .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	23	( H ) Although he was abused , he never tried to get even . And when he suffered , he made no threats . Instead , he had faith in God , who judges fairly .
CEV	1%20Peter	2	24	( I ) Christ carried the burden of our sins . He was nailed to the cross , so we would stop sinning and start living right . By his cuts and bruises you are healed .

CEV	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter
CEV	1%20Peter	3	3	( B ) Do n't depend on things like fancy hairdos or gold jewelry or expensive clothes to make you look beautiful .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	2	because he will see how you honor God and live a pure life .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	4	Be beautiful in your heart by being gentle and quiet . This kind of beauty will last , and God considers it very special .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	5	Long ago those women who worshiped God and put their hope in him made themselves beautiful by putting their husbands first .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	6	For example , Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him her master . You are her true children , if you do right and do n't let anything frighten you .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	7	( C ) If you are a husband , you should be thoughtful of your wife . Treat her with honor , because she is n't as strong as you are , and she shares with you in the gift of life . Then nothing will stand in the way of your prayers . Suffering for Doing Right
CEV	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , all of you should agree and have concern and love for each other . You should also be kind and humble .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	9	Do n't be hateful and insult people just because they are hateful and insult you . Instead , treat everyone with kindness . You are God 's chosen ones , and he will bless you . The Scriptures say ,
CEV	1%20Peter	3	10	( D ) “ Do you really love life ? Do you want to be happy ? Then stop saying cruel things and quit telling lies .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	11	Give up your evil ways and do right , as you find and follow the road to peace .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	12	The Lord watches over everyone who obeys him , and he listens to their prayers . But he opposes everyone who does evil. ”
CEV	1%20Peter	3	13	Can anyone really harm you for being eager to do good deeds ?
CEV	1%20Peter	3	14	( E ) ( F ) Even if you have to suffer for doing good things , God will bless you . So stop being afraid and do n't worry about what people might do .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	15	Honor Christ and let him be the Lord of your life . Always be ready to give an answer when someone asks you about your hope .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	16	Give a kind and respectful answer and keep your conscience clear . This way you will make people ashamed for saying bad things about your good conduct as a follower of Christ .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	17	You are better off to obey God and suffer for doing right than to suffer for doing wrong .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	18	Christ died once for our sins . An innocent person died for those who are guilty . Christ did this to bring you to God , when his body was put to death and his spirit was made alive .
CEV	1%20Peter	3	19	Christ then preached to the spirits that were being kept in prison .

CEV	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter
CEV	1%20Peter	4	4	Now your former friends wonder why you have stopped running around with them , and they curse you for it .
CEV	1%20Peter	4	2	It means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey God for the rest of your life .
CEV	1%20Peter	4	3	You have already lived long enough like people who do n't know God . You were immoral and followed your evil desires . You went around drinking and partying and carrying on . In fact , you even worshiped disgusting idols .
CEV	1%20Peter	4	5	But they will have to answer to God , who judges the living and the dead .
CEV	1%20Peter	4	6	The good news has even been preached to the dead , [ a ] so that after they have been judged for what they have done in this life , their spirits will live with God .
CEV	1%20Peter	4	7	Everything will soon come to an end . So be serious and be sensible enough to pray .
CEV	1%20Peter	4	8	( A ) Most important of all , you must sincerely love each other , because love wipes away many sins .
CEV	1%20Peter	4	9	Welcome people into your home and do n't grumble about it .

CEV	1%20Peter	4	13	Be glad for the chance to suffer as Christ suffered . It will prepare you for even greater happiness when he makes his glorious return .
CEV	1%20Peter	4	14	Count it a blessing when you suffer for being a Christian . This shows that God 's glorious Spirit is with you .

CEV	1%20Peter	4	16	Do n't be ashamed to suffer for being a Christian . Praise God that you belong to him .
CEV	1%20Peter	4	17	God has already begun judging his own people . And if his judgment begins with us , imagine how terrible it will be for those who refuse to obey his message . The Scriptures say ,
CEV	1%20Peter	4	18	( B ) “ If good people barely escape , what will happen to sinners and to others who do n't respect God ? ”
CEV	1%20Peter	4	19	If you suffer for obeying God , you must have complete faith in your faithful Creator and keep on doing right . Footnotes - 4.6 the dead : Either people who died after becoming followers of Christ or the people of Noah 's day ( see 3.19 ) . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Peter	5	1	Peter
CEV	1%20Peter	5	5	( B ) All of you young people should obey your elders . In fact , everyone should be humble toward everyone else . The Scriptures say , “ God opposes proud people , but he helps everyone who is humble. ”
CEV	1%20Peter	5	2	( A ) Just as shepherds watch over their sheep , you must watch over everyone God has placed in your care . Do it willingly in order to please God , and not simply because you think you must . Let it be something you want to do , instead of something you do merely to make money .
CEV	1%20Peter	5	3	Do n't be bossy to those people who are in your care , but set an example for them .

CEV	1%20Peter	5	9	But you must resist the devil and stay strong in your faith . You know that all over the world the Lord 's followers are suffering just as you are .
CEV	1%20Peter	5	10	But God shows undeserved kindness to everyone . That 's why he appointed Christ Jesus to choose you to share in his eternal glory . You will suffer for a while , but God will make you complete , steady , strong , and firm .
CEV	1%20Peter	5	11	God will be in control forever ! Amen . Final Greetings
CEV	1%20Peter	5	12	( E ) Silvanus helped me write this short letter , and I consider him a faithful follower of the Lord . I wanted to encourage you and tell you how kind God really is , so you will keep on having faith in him .
CEV	1%20Peter	5	13	( F ) Greetings from the Lord 's followers in Babylon . [ a ] They are God 's chosen ones . Mark , who is like a son to me , sends his greetings too .

CEV	2%20Peter	1	1	From Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ . To everyone who shares with us in the privilege of believing that our God and Savior Jesus Christ will do what is just and fair . [ a ]
CEV	2%20Peter	1	3	We have everything we need to live a life that pleases God . It was all given to us by God 's own power , when we learned he had invited us to share in his wonderful goodness .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	4	God made great and marvelous promises , so his nature would become part of us . Then we could escape our evil desires and the corrupt influences of this world .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	5	Do your best to improve your faith by adding goodness , understanding ,
CEV	2%20Peter	1	6	self-control , patience , devotion to God ,
CEV	2%20Peter	1	7	concern for others , and love .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	8	If you keep growing in this way , it will show that what you know about our Lord Jesus Christ has made your lives useful and meaningful .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	9	But if you do n't grow , you are like someone who is nearsighted or blind , and you have forgotten that your past sins are forgiven .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	10	My friends , you must do all you can to show God has really chosen and selected you . If you keep on doing this , you wo n't stumble and fall .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	11	Then our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will give you a glorious welcome into his kingdom that will last forever .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	12	You are holding firmly to the truth you were given . But I am still going to remind you of these things .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	13	In fact , I think I should keep on reminding you until I leave this body .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	14	And our Lord Jesus Christ has already told me that I will soon leave it behind .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	15	This is why I am doing my best to make sure that each of you remembers all of this after I am gone . The Message about the Glory of Christ
CEV	2%20Peter	1	16	When we told you about the power and the return of our Lord Jesus Christ , we were not telling clever stories someone had made up . But with our own eyes we saw his true greatness .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	17	( A ) God , our great and wonderful Father , truly honored him by saying , “ This is my own dear Son , and I am pleased with him. ”
CEV	2%20Peter	1	18	We were there with Jesus on the holy mountain and heard this voice speak from heaven .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	19	All of this makes us even more certain that what the prophets said is true . So you should pay close attention to their message , as you would to a lamp shining in some dark place . You must keep on paying attention until daylight comes and the morning star rises in your hearts .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	20	But you need to realize that no one alone can understand any of the prophecies in the Scriptures .
CEV	2%20Peter	1	21	The prophets did not think these things up on their own , but they were guided by the Spirit of God .

CEV	2%20Peter	2	2	Many people will follow their evil ways and cause others to tell lies about the true way .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	3	They will be greedy and cheat you with smooth talk . But long ago God decided to punish them , and God does n't sleep .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	4	God did not have pity on the angels that sinned . He had them tied up and thrown into the dark pits of hell until the time of judgment .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	5	( A ) And during Noah 's time , God did not have pity on the ungodly people of the world . He destroyed them with a flood , though he did save eight people , including Noah , who preached the truth .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	6	( B ) God punished the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah [ a ] by burning them to ashes , and this is a warning to anyone else who wants to sin . 7-8 ( C ) Lot lived right and was greatly troubled by the terrible way those wicked people were living . He was a good man , and day after day he suffered because of the evil things he saw and heard . So the Lord rescued him .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	9	This shows that the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their sufferings and to punish evil people while they wait for the day of judgment .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	10	The Lord is especially hard on people who disobey him and do n't think of anything except their own filthy desires . They are reckless and proud and are not afraid of cursing the glorious beings in heaven .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	11	Although angels are more powerful than these evil beings , [ b ] even the angels do n't dare to accuse them to the Lord .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	12	These people are no better than senseless animals that live by their feelings and are born to be caught and killed . They speak evil of things they do n't know anything about . But their own corrupt deeds will destroy them .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	13	They have done evil , and they will be rewarded with evil . They think it is fun to have wild parties during the day . They are immoral , and the meals they eat with you are spoiled by the shameful and selfish way they carry on . [ c ]
CEV	2%20Peter	2	14	All they think about is having sex with someone else 's husband or wife . There is no end to their wicked deeds . They trick people who are easily fooled , and their minds are filled with greedy thoughts . But they are headed for trouble !
CEV	2%20Peter	2	15	( D ) They have left the true road and have gone down the wrong path by following the example of the prophet Balaam . He was the son of Beor and loved what he got from being a crook .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	16	But a donkey corrected him for this evil deed . It spoke to him with a human voice and made him stop his foolishness .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	17	These people are like dried up water holes and clouds blown by a windstorm . The darkest part of hell is waiting for them .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	18	They brag out loud about their stupid nonsense . And by being vulgar and crude , they trap people who have barely escaped from living the wrong kind of life .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	19	They promise freedom to everyone . But they are merely slaves of filthy living , because people are slaves of whatever controls them .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	20	When they learned about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they escaped from the filthy things of this world . But they are again caught up and controlled by these filthy things , and now they are in worse shape than they were at first .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	21	They would have been better off if they had never known about the right way . Even after they knew what was right , they turned their backs on the holy commandments they were given .
CEV	2%20Peter	2	22	( E ) What happened to them is just like the true saying , “ A dog will come back to lick up its own vomit . A pig that has been washed will roll in the mud. ” Footnotes - 2.6 Sodom and Gomorrah : During the time of Abraham the Lord destroyed these cities because the people there were so evil ( see Genesis 19.24 ) . - 2.11 evil beings : Or “ evil teachers. ” - 2.13 and the meals they eat with you are spoiled by the shameful and selfish way they carry on : Some manuscripts have “ and the meals they eat with you are spoiled by the shameful way they carry on during your feasts of Christian love. ” Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Peter	3	2	what God 's prophets said would happen . You must never forget what the holy prophets taught in the past . And you must remember what the apostles told you our Lord and Savior has commanded us to do .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	3	( A ) But first you must realize that in the last days some people wo n't think about anything except their own selfish desires . They will make fun of you
CEV	2%20Peter	3	4	and say , “ Did n't your Lord promise to come back ? Yet the first leaders have already died , and the world has n't changed a bit. ”
CEV	2%20Peter	3	5	( B ) They will say this because they want to forget that long ago the heavens and the earth were made at God 's command . The earth came out of water and was made from water .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	6	( C ) Later it was destroyed by the waters of a mighty flood .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	7	But God has commanded the present heavens and earth to remain until the day of judgment . Then they will be set on fire , and ungodly people will be destroyed .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	8	( D ) Dear friends , do n't forget that for the Lord one day is the same as 1,000 years , and 1,000 years is the same as one day .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is n't slow about keeping his promises , as some people think he is . In fact , God is patient , because he wants everyone to turn from sin and no one to be lost .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	10	( E ) The day of the Lord 's return will surprise us like a thief . The heavens will disappear with a loud noise , and the heat will melt the whole universe . [ a ] Then the earth and everything on it will be seen for what they are . [ b ]
CEV	2%20Peter	3	11	Everything will be destroyed . So you should serve and honor God by the way you live .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	12	You should look forward to the day when God judges everyone , and you should try to make it come soon . [ c ] On that day the heavens will be destroyed by fire , and everything else will melt in the heat .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	13	( F ) But God has promised us a new heaven and a new earth , where justice will rule . We are really looking forward to this !
CEV	2%20Peter	3	14	My friends , while you are waiting , you should make certain the Lord finds you pure , spotless , and living at peace .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	15	Do n't forget that the Lord is patient because he wants people to be saved . This is also what our dear friend Paul said when he wrote you with the wisdom God had given him .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	16	Paul talks about these same things in all his letters , but part of what he says is hard to understand . Some ignorant and unsteady people even destroy themselves by twisting what he said . They do the same thing with other Scriptures too .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	17	My dear friends , you have been warned ahead of time ! So do n't let the errors of evil people lead you down the wrong path and make you lose your balance .
CEV	2%20Peter	3	18	Let the gift of undeserved grace and the understanding that come from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ help you keep on growing . Praise Jesus now and forever ! Amen .

CEV	1%20John	4	3	But when someone does n't say this about Jesus , you know this person has a spirit that does n't come from God and is the enemy of Christ . You knew this enemy was coming into the world and now is already here .
CEV	1%20John	4	5	These enemies belong to this world , and the world listens to them , because they speak its language .
CEV	1%20John	4	6	We belong to God , and everyone who knows God will listen to us . But the people who do n't know God wo n't listen to us . This is how we can tell the Spirit that speaks the truth from the one that tells lies .
CEV	1%20John	4	7	My dear friends , we must love each other . Love comes from God , and when we love each other , it shows we have been given new life . We are now God 's children , and we know him .
CEV	1%20John	4	8	God is love , and anyone who does n't love others has never known him .
CEV	1%20John	4	9	God showed his love for us when he sent his only Son into the world to give us life .
CEV	1%20John	4	10	Real love is n't our love for God , but his love for us . God sent his Son to be the sacrifice by which our sins are forgiven .
CEV	1%20John	4	11	Dear friends , since God loved us this much , we must love each other .
CEV	1%20John	4	12	( A ) No one has ever seen God . But if we love each other , God lives in us , and his love is truly in our hearts .
CEV	1%20John	4	13	God has given us his Spirit . This is how we know we are one with him , just as he is one with us .
CEV	1%20John	4	14	God sent his Son to be the Savior of the world . We saw his Son and are now telling others about him .
CEV	1%20John	4	15	God stays one with everyone who openly says Jesus is the Son of God . This is how we stay one with God
CEV	1%20John	4	16	and are sure God loves us . God is love . If we keep on loving others , we will stay one in our hearts with God , and he will stay one with us .
CEV	1%20John	4	17	If we truly love others and live as Christ did in this world , we wo n't be worried about the day of judgment .
CEV	1%20John	4	18	A real love for others will chase those worries away . The thought of being punished is what makes us afraid . It shows we have not really learned to love .
CEV	1%20John	4	19	We love because God loved us first .
CEV	1%20John	4	20	But if we say we love God and do n't love each other , we are liars . We can not see God . So how can we love God , if we do n't love the people we can see ?
CEV	1%20John	4	21	The commandment that God has given us is : “ Love God and love each other ! ” Footnotes - 4.4 God 's Spirit : The Greek text has “ he ” and may refer to the Spirit or to God or to Jesus . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20John	5	6	Water and blood came out from the side of Jesus Christ . It was n't just water , but water and blood . [ a ] The Spirit tells about this , because the Spirit is truthful .
CEV	1%20John	5	7	In fact , there are three who tell about it .
CEV	1%20John	5	8	They are the Spirit , the water , and the blood , and they all agree .
CEV	1%20John	5	9	We believe what people tell us . But we can trust what God says even more , and God is the one who has spoken about his Son .
CEV	1%20John	5	10	If we have faith in God 's Son , we have believed what God has said . But if we do n't believe what God has said about his Son , it is the same as calling God a liar .
CEV	1%20John	5	11	( B ) God has also said he gave us eternal life and this life comes to us from his Son .
CEV	1%20John	5	12	And so , if we have God 's Son , we have this life . But if we do n't have the Son , we do n't have this life . Knowing about Eternal Life

CEV	1%20John	5	14	We are certain God will hear our prayers when we ask for what pleases him .
CEV	1%20John	5	15	And if we know God listens when we pray , we are sure our prayers have already been answered .
CEV	1%20John	5	16	Suppose you see one of our people commit a sin that is n't a deadly sin . You can pray , and this person will be given eternal life . But the sin must not be one that is deadly .
CEV	1%20John	5	17	Everything that is wrong is sin , but not all sins are deadly .
CEV	1%20John	5	18	We are sure God 's children do not keep on sinning . God 's own Son protects them , and the devil can not harm them .
CEV	1%20John	5	19	We are certain we come from God and the rest of the world is under the power of the devil .
CEV	1%20John	5	20	We know that Jesus Christ the Son of God has come and has shown us the true God . And because of Jesus , we now belong to the true God who gives eternal life .
CEV	1%20John	5	21	Children , you must stay away from idols . Footnotes - 5.6 Water and blood came out from the side of Jesus Christ . It was n't just water , but water and blood : See John 19.34 . It is also possible to translate , “ Jesus Christ came by the water of baptism and by the blood of his death ! He was not only baptized , but he bled and died. ” The purpose of the verse is to tell that Jesus was truly human and that he really died . Copyright ©

CEV	3%20John	1	3	It makes me very happy when the Lord 's followers come by and speak openly of how you obey the truth .
CEV	3%20John	1	1	( A ) From the church leader . [ a ] To my dear friend Gaius . I love you because we follow the truth ,
CEV	3%20John	1	2	dear friend , and I pray all goes well for you . I hope you are as strong in body , as I know you are in spirit .
CEV	3%20John	1	4	Nothing brings me greater happiness than to hear that my children [ b ] are obeying the truth . Working Together
CEV	3%20John	1	5	Dear friend , you have always been faithful in helping other followers of the Lord , even the ones you did n't know before .
CEV	3%20John	1	6	They have told the church about your love . They say you were good enough to welcome them and to send them on their mission in a way God 's servants deserve .
CEV	3%20John	1	7	When they left to tell others about the Lord , they decided not to accept help from anyone who was n't a follower .
CEV	3%20John	1	8	We must support people like them , so we can take part in what they are doing to spread the truth .
CEV	3%20John	1	9	I wrote to the church . But Diotrephes likes to be the number-one leader , and he wo n't pay any attention to us .
CEV	3%20John	1	10	So if I come , I will remind him of how he has been attacking us with gossip . Not only has he been doing this , but he refuses to welcome any of the Lord 's followers who come by . And when other church members want to welcome them , he puts them out of the church .
CEV	3%20John	1	11	Dear friend , do n't imitate the evil deeds of others , but follow the example of people who do kind deeds . They are God 's children , but those who are always doing evil have never seen God .
CEV	3%20John	1	12	Everyone speaks well of Demetrius , and so does the true message that he teaches . I also speak well of him , and you know what I say is true . Final Greetings
CEV	3%20John	1	13	I have much more to say to you , but I do n't want to write it with pen and ink .

CEV	Jude	1	1	( A ) From Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James . To all who are chosen and loved by God the Father and are kept safe by Jesus Christ .
CEV	Jude	1	2	I pray that God will greatly bless you with mercy , peace , and love ! False Teachers
CEV	Jude	1	3	My dear friends , I really wanted to write you about God 's saving power at work in our lives . But instead , I must write and ask you to defend the faith that God has once for all given to his people .
CEV	Jude	1	4	Some godless people have sneaked in among us and are saying , “ God treats us much better than we deserve , and so it is all right to be immoral. ” They even deny we must obey Jesus Christ as our only Master and Lord . But long ago the Scriptures warned that these godless people were doomed .
CEV	Jude	1	5	( B ) Do n't forget what happened to those people the Lord rescued from Egypt . Some of them did not have faith , and he later destroyed them .
CEV	Jude	1	6	angels : This may refer to the angels who liked the women on earth so much that they came down and married them ( see Genesis 6.2 ) . -

CEV	Jude	1	8	The people I am talking about are behaving just like those dreamers who destroyed their own bodies . They reject all authority and insult angels .
CEV	Jude	1	9	Michael … the body of Moses : This refers to what was said in an ancient Jewish book about Moses . -
CEV	Jude	1	10	But these people insult powers they do n't know anything about . They are like senseless animals that end up getting destroyed , because they live only by their feelings .
CEV	Jude	1	11	just as Korah did : Together with Dathan and Abiram , Korah led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron ( see Numbers 16.1-35 ; 26.9,10 ) . -
CEV	Jude	1	12	These people are filthy minded , and by their shameful and selfish actions they spoil the meals you eat together . They are like clouds blown along by the wind , but never bringing any rain . They are like leafless trees , uprooted and dead , and unable to produce fruit .
CEV	Jude	1	13	Their shameful deeds show up like foam on wild ocean waves . They are like wandering stars forever doomed to the darkest pits of hell .
CEV	Jude	1	14	( F ) Enoch was the seventh person after Adam , and he was talking about these people when he said : Look ! The Lord is coming with thousands and thousands of holy angels
CEV	Jude	1	15	to judge everyone . He will punish all those ungodly people for all the evil things they have done . The Lord will surely punish those ungodly sinners for every evil thing they have ever said about him .
CEV	Jude	1	16	These people grumble and complain and live by their own selfish desires . They brag about themselves and flatter others to get what they want . More Warnings
CEV	Jude	1	17	My dear friends , remember the warning you were given by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
CEV	Jude	1	18	( G ) They told you that near the end of time , selfish and godless people would start making fun of God .
CEV	Jude	1	19	And now these people are already making you turn against each other . They think only about this life , and they do n't have God 's Spirit .
CEV	Jude	1	20	Dear friends , keep building on the foundation of your most holy faith , as the Holy Spirit helps you to pray .
CEV	Jude	1	21	And keep in step with God 's love , as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to show how kind he is by giving you eternal life .
CEV	Jude	1	22	Be helpful to : Some manuscripts have “ Correct. ” Copyright ©
CEV	Jude	1	23	Rescue any who need to be saved , as you would rescue someone from a fire . Then with fear in your own hearts , have mercy on everyone who needs it . But hate even the clothes of those who have been made dirty by their filthy deeds . Final Prayer 24-25 Offer praise to God our Savior because of our Lord Jesus Christ ! Only God can keep you from falling and make you pure and joyful in his glorious presence . Before time began and now and forever , God is worthy of glory , honor , power , and authority . Amen .

CEV	Revelation	4	4	Twenty-four other thrones were in a circle around that throne . And on each of these thrones there was an elder dressed in white clothes and wearing a gold crown .
CEV	Revelation	4	2	( A ) Right then the Spirit took control of me , and there in heaven I saw a throne and someone sitting on it .
CEV	Revelation	4	3	The one who was sitting there sparkled like precious stones of jasper [ a ] and carnelian . [ b ] A rainbow that looked like an emerald [ c ] surrounded the throne .
CEV	Revelation	4	5	( B ) Flashes of lightning and roars of thunder came out from the throne in the center of the circle . Seven torches , which are the seven spirits of God , were burning in front of the throne .
CEV	Revelation	4	6	( C ) ( D ) Also in front of the throne was something that looked like a glass sea , clear as crystal . Around the throne in the center were four living creatures covered front and back with eyes .
CEV	Revelation	4	7	The first creature was like a lion , the second one was like a bull , the third one had the face of a human , and the fourth was like a flying eagle .
CEV	Revelation	4	8	( E ) Each of the four living creatures had six wings , and their bodies were covered with eyes . Day and night they never stopped singing , “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord , the all-powerful God , who was and is and is coming ! ”
CEV	Revelation	4	9	The living creatures kept praising , honoring , and thanking the one who sits on the throne and who lives forever and ever .
CEV	Revelation	4	10	At the same time the
CEV	Revelation	4	24	elders knelt down before the one sitting on the throne . And as they worshiped the one who lives forever , they placed their crowns in front of the throne and said ,
CEV	Revelation	4	11	( F ) “ Our Lord and God , you are worthy to receive glory , honor , and power . You created all things , and by your decision they are and were created. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	5	5	( B ) Then one of the elders said to me , “ Stop crying and look ! The one who is called both the ‘ Lion from the Tribe of Judah ’ [ b ] and ‘ King David 's Great Descendant ’ [ c ] has won the victory . He will open the scroll and its seven seals. ”
CEV	Revelation	5	2	I saw a mighty angel ask with a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals ? ”
CEV	Revelation	5	3	No one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it .
CEV	Revelation	5	4	I cried hard because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it .
CEV	Revelation	5	6	( C ) Then I looked and saw a Lamb standing in the center of the throne surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders . The Lamb looked as if it had once been killed . It had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits [ d ] of God , sent out to all the earth .
CEV	Revelation	5	7	The Lamb went over and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat on the throne .
CEV	Revelation	5	8	( D ) After he had taken it , the four living creatures and the
CEV	Revelation	5	24	elders knelt down before him . Each of them had a harp and a gold bowl full of incense , [ e ] which are the prayers of God 's people .
CEV	Revelation	5	9	( E ) Then they sang a new song , “ You are worthy to receive the scroll and open its seals , because you were killed . And with your own blood you bought for God people from every tribe , language , nation , and race .
CEV	Revelation	5	10	( F ) You let them become kings and serve God as priests , and they will rule on earth. ”
CEV	Revelation	5	11	( G ) As I looked , I heard the voices of a large number of angels around the throne and the voices of the living creatures and of the elders . There were millions and millions of them ,
CEV	Revelation	5	12	and they were saying in a loud voice , “ The Lamb who was killed is worthy to receive power , riches , wisdom , strength , honor , glory , and praise. ”
CEV	Revelation	5	13	Then I heard all beings in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and in the sea offer praise . Together , all of them were saying , “ Praise , honor , glory , and strength forever and ever to the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb ! ”
CEV	Revelation	5	14	The four living creatures said “ Amen , ” while the elders knelt down and worshiped . Footnotes - 5.1 scroll : A roll of paper or special leather used for writing on .

CEV	Revelation	6	6	I heard what sounded like a voice from somewhere among the four living creatures . It said , “ A liter of wheat will cost you a whole day 's wages ! Three liters of barley will cost you a day 's wages too . But do n't ruin the olive oil or the wine. ”
CEV	Revelation	6	2	( A ) Then I saw a white horse . Its rider carried a bow and was given a crown . He had already won some victories , and he went out to win more .
CEV	Revelation	6	3	When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , “ Come out ! ”
CEV	Revelation	6	4	( B ) Then another horse came out . It was fiery red . And its rider was given the power to take away all peace from the earth , so people would slaughter one another . He was also given a big sword .
CEV	Revelation	6	5	( C ) When the Lamb opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , “ Come out ! ” Then I saw a black horse , and its rider had a balance scale in one hand .
CEV	Revelation	6	7	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , “ Come out ! ”
CEV	Revelation	6	8	( D ) Then I saw a pale green horse . Its rider was named Death , and Death 's Kingdom followed close behind . They were given power over one fourth of the earth , and they could kill its people with swords , famines , diseases , and wild animals .
CEV	Revelation	6	9	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of everyone who had been killed for speaking God 's message and telling about their faith .
CEV	Revelation	6	10	They shouted , “ Master , you are holy and faithful ! How long will it be before you judge and punish the people of this earth who killed us ? ”
CEV	Revelation	6	11	( E ) Then each of those who had been killed was given a white robe and told to rest for a little while . They had to wait until the complete number of the Lord 's other servants and followers would be killed .
CEV	Revelation	6	12	( F ) When I saw the Lamb open the sixth seal , I looked and saw a great earthquake . The sun turned as dark as sackcloth , [ a ] and the moon became red as blood .
CEV	Revelation	6	13	( G ) The stars in the sky fell to earth , just like figs shaken loose by a windstorm .
CEV	Revelation	6	14	( H ) Then the sky was rolled up like a scroll , [ b ] and all mountains and islands were moved from their places .
CEV	Revelation	6	15	( I ) The kings of the earth , its famous people , and its military leaders hid in caves or behind rocks on the mountains . They hid there together with the rich and the powerful and with all the slaves and free people .
CEV	Revelation	6	16	( J ) Then they shouted to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us ! Hide us from the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb .
CEV	Revelation	6	17	( K ) That terrible day has come ! God and the Lamb will show their anger , and who can face it ? ” Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	7	3	( B ) “ Do n't harm the earth or the sea or any tree ! Wait until I have marked the foreheads of the servants of our God. ”
CEV	Revelation	7	4	Then I heard how many people had been marked on the forehead . There were 144,000 , and they came from every tribe of Israel :

CEV	Revelation	7	10	as they shouted , “ Our God , who sits upon the throne , has the power to save his people , and so does the Lamb. ”
CEV	Revelation	7	11	The angels who stood around the throne knelt in front of it with their faces to the ground . The elders and the four living creatures knelt there with them . Then they all worshiped God
CEV	Revelation	7	12	and said , “ Amen ! Praise , glory , wisdom , thanks , honor , power , and strength belong to our God forever and ever ! Amen ! ”
CEV	Revelation	7	13	One of the elders asked me , “ Do you know who these people are that are dressed in white robes ? Do you know where they come from ? ”
CEV	Revelation	7	14	( D ) “ Sir , ” I answered , “ you must know. ” Then he told me : “ These are the ones who have gone through the great suffering . They have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb and have made them white .
CEV	Revelation	7	15	And so they stand before the throne of God and worship him in his temple day and night . The one who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them .
CEV	Revelation	7	16	( E ) They will never hunger or thirst again , and they wo n't be troubled by the sun or any scorching heat .
CEV	Revelation	7	17	( F ) “ The Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd . He will lead them to streams of life-giving water , and God will wipe all tears from their eyes. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	8	8	When the second angel blew his trumpet , something like a great fiery mountain was thrown into the sea . A third of the sea turned to blood ,
CEV	Revelation	8	2	I noticed that the seven angels who stood before God were each given a trumpet .
CEV	Revelation	8	3	( A ) Another angel , who had a gold container for incense , [ a ] came and stood at the altar . This one was given a lot of incense to offer with the prayers of God 's people on the gold altar in front of the throne .
CEV	Revelation	8	4	Then the smoke of the incense , together with the prayers of God 's people , went up to God from the hand of the angel .
CEV	Revelation	8	5	( B ) After this , the angel filled the incense container with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth . Thunder roared , lightning flashed , and the earth shook . The Trumpets
CEV	Revelation	8	6	( C ) The seven angels now got ready to blow their trumpets .
CEV	Revelation	8	7	( D ) When the first angel blew his trumpet , hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth . A third of the earth , a third of the trees , and a third of all green plants were burned .
CEV	Revelation	8	9	a third of the living creatures in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
CEV	Revelation	8	10	( E ) When the third angel blew his trumpet , a great star fell from heaven . It was burning like a torch , and it fell on a third of the rivers and on a third of the springs of water .

CEV	Revelation	8	12	( G ) When the fourth angel blew his trumpet , a third of the sun , a third of the moon , and a third of the stars were struck . They each lost a third of their light . So during a third of the day there was no light , and a third of the night was also without light .
CEV	Revelation	8	13	Then I looked and saw a lone eagle flying across the sky . It was shouting , “ Trouble , trouble , trouble to everyone who lives on earth ! The other three angels are now going to blow their trumpets. ” Footnotes - 8.3 incense : See the note at 5.8 . Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	9	9	( G ) On their chests they wore armor made of iron . Their wings roared like an army of horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle .
CEV	Revelation	9	2	( A ) As it opened the tunnel , smoke poured out like the smoke of a great furnace . The sun and the air turned dark because of the smoke .
CEV	Revelation	9	3	( B ) Locusts [ b ] came out of the smoke and covered the earth . They were given the same power that scorpions have .
CEV	Revelation	9	4	( C ) The locusts were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or any tree . They were to punish only those people who did not have God 's mark on their foreheads .
CEV	Revelation	9	5	The locusts were allowed to make them suffer for five months , but not to kill them . The suffering they caused was like the sting of a scorpion .
CEV	Revelation	9	6	( D ) In those days people will want to die , but they will not be able to . They will hope for death , but it will escape from them .
CEV	Revelation	9	7	( E ) These locusts looked like horses ready for battle . On their heads they wore something like gold crowns , and they had human faces .
CEV	Revelation	9	8	( F ) Their hair was like a woman 's long hair , and their teeth were like those of a lion .
CEV	Revelation	9	10	Their tails were like a scorpion 's tail with a stinger that had the power to hurt someone for five months .
CEV	Revelation	9	11	Their king was the angel in charge of the deep pit . In Hebrew his name was Abaddon , and in Greek it was Apollyon . [ c ]
CEV	Revelation	9	12	The first horrible thing has now happened ! But wait . Two more horrible things will happen soon .
CEV	Revelation	9	13	( H ) Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet . I heard a voice speak from the four corners of the gold altar that stands in the presence of God .
CEV	Revelation	9	14	The voice spoke to this angel and said , “ Release the four angels who are tied up beside the great Euphrates River. ”
CEV	Revelation	9	15	The four angels had been prepared for this very hour and day and month and year . Now they were set free to kill a third of all people .
CEV	Revelation	9	16	By listening , I could tell there were more than 200,000,000 war horses .
CEV	Revelation	9	17	( I ) In my vision their riders wore fiery-red , dark-blue , and yellow armor on their chests . The heads of the horses looked like lions , with fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
CEV	Revelation	9	18	One third of all people were killed by the three terrible troubles caused by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .
CEV	Revelation	9	19	The horses had powerful mouths , and their tails were like poisonous snakes that bite and hurt .
CEV	Revelation	9	20	( J ) The people who lived through these terrible troubles did not turn away from the idols they had made , and they did not stop worshiping demons . They kept on worshiping idols that were made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood . Not one of these idols could see , hear , or walk .

CEV	Revelation	10	10	I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it . The taste was sweet as honey , but my stomach turned sour .
CEV	Revelation	10	2	and with his hand he held a little scroll [ a ] that had been unrolled . He stood there with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
CEV	Revelation	10	3	Then he shouted with a voice that sounded like a growling lion . Thunder roared seven times .
CEV	Revelation	10	4	After the thunder stopped , I was about to write what it had said . But a voice from heaven shouted , “ Keep it secret ! Do n't write these things. ”
CEV	Revelation	10	5	( A ) The angel I had seen standing on the sea and the land then held his right hand up toward heaven .
CEV	Revelation	10	6	He made a promise in the name of God who lives forever and who created heaven , earth , the sea , and every living creature . The angel said , “ You wo n't have to wait any longer .
CEV	Revelation	10	7	God told his secret plans to his servants the prophets , and it will all happen by the time the seventh angel sounds his trumpet. ”
CEV	Revelation	10	8	( B ) Once again the voice from heaven spoke to me . It said , “ Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel standing on the sea and the land. ”
CEV	Revelation	10	9	When I went over to ask the angel for the little scroll , the angel said , “ Take the scroll and eat it ! Your stomach will turn sour , but the taste in your mouth will be sweet as honey. ”
CEV	Revelation	10	11	Then some voices said , “ Keep on telling what will happen to the people of many nations , races , and languages , and also to kings. ” Footnotes - 10.2 scroll : See the note at 5.1 . Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	11	11	( G ) But three and a half days later , God will breathe life into their bodies . They will stand up , and everyone who sees them will be terrified .
CEV	Revelation	11	2	( B ) But do n't measure the courtyard outside the temple building . Leave it out . It has been given to those people who do n't know God , and they will trample all over the holy city for
CEV	Revelation	11	42	months .
CEV	Revelation	11	3	My two witnesses will wear sackcloth , [ a ] while I let them preach for 1,260 days .
CEV	Revelation	11	4	( C ) These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand in the presence of the Lord who rules the earth .
CEV	Revelation	11	5	Any enemy who tries to harm them will be destroyed by the fire that comes out of their mouths .
CEV	Revelation	11	6	( D ) They have the power to lock up the sky and to keep rain from falling while they are prophesying . And whenever they want to , they can turn water to blood and cause all kinds of terrible troubles on earth .
CEV	Revelation	11	7	( E ) After the two witnesses have finished preaching God 's message , the beast that lives in the deep pit will come up and fight against them . It will win the battle and kill them .
CEV	Revelation	11	8	( F ) Their bodies will be left lying in the streets of the same great city where their Lord was nailed to a cross . And this city is spiritually like the city of Sodom or the country of Egypt .
CEV	Revelation	11	9	For three and a half days the people of every nation , tribe , language , and race will stare at the bodies of these two witnesses and refuse to let them be buried .
CEV	Revelation	11	10	Everyone on earth will celebrate and be happy . They will give gifts to each other , because of what happened to the two prophets who caused them so much trouble .
CEV	Revelation	11	12	( H ) The witnesses then heard a loud voice from heaven , saying , “ Come up here. ” And while their enemies were watching , they were taken up to heaven in a cloud .
CEV	Revelation	11	13	( I ) At that same moment there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city . Seven thousand people were killed , and the rest were frightened and praised the God who rules in heaven .
CEV	Revelation	11	14	The second horrible thing has now happened ! And the third one will be here soon . The Seventh Trumpet
CEV	Revelation	11	15	( J ) At the sound of the seventh trumpet , loud voices were heard in heaven . They said , “ Now the kingdom of this world belongs to our Lord and to his Chosen One ! And he will rule forever and ever ! ”
CEV	Revelation	11	16	Then the
CEV	Revelation	11	24	elders , who were seated on thrones in God 's presence , knelt down and worshiped him .
CEV	Revelation	11	17	They said , “ Lord God All-Powerful , you are and you were , and we thank you . You used your great power and started ruling .
CEV	Revelation	11	18	( K ) When the nations got angry , you became angry too ! Now the time has come for the dead to be judged . It is time for you to reward your servants the prophets and all your people who honor your name , no matter who they are . It is time to destroy everyone who has destroyed the earth. ”
CEV	Revelation	11	19	( L ) The door to God 's temple in heaven was then opened , and the sacred chest [ b ] could be seen inside the temple . I saw lightning and heard roars of thunder . The earth trembled and huge hailstones fell to the ground . Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	12	12	“ The heavens should rejoice , together with everyone who lives there . But pity the earth and the sea , because the devil was thrown down to the earth . He knows his time is short , and he is very angry. ”
CEV	Revelation	12	2	She was about to give birth , and she was crying because of the great pain .
CEV	Revelation	12	3	( A ) Something else appeared in the sky . It was a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns , and a crown on each of its seven heads .
CEV	Revelation	12	4	( B ) With its tail , it dragged a third of the stars from the sky and threw them down to the earth . Then the dragon turned toward the woman , because it wanted to eat her child as soon as it was born .
CEV	Revelation	12	5	( C ) The woman gave birth to a son , who would rule all nations with an iron rod . The boy was snatched away . He was taken to God and placed on his throne .
CEV	Revelation	12	6	The woman ran into the desert to a place that God had prepared for her . There she would be taken care of for 1,260 days . Michael Fights the Dragon
CEV	Revelation	12	7	( D ) A war broke out in heaven . Michael and his angels were fighting against the dragon and its angels .
CEV	Revelation	12	8	But the dragon lost the battle . It and its angels were forced out of their places in heaven
CEV	Revelation	12	9	( E ) and were thrown down to the earth . Yes , that old snake and his angels were thrown out of heaven ! That snake , who fools everyone on earth , is known as the devil and Satan .
CEV	Revelation	12	10	( F ) Then I heard a voice from heaven shout , “ Our God has shown his saving power , and his kingdom has come ! God 's own Chosen One has shown his authority . Satan accused our people in the presence of God day and night . Now he has been thrown out !
CEV	Revelation	12	11	“ Our people defeated Satan because of the blood [ a ] of the Lamb and the message of God . They were willing to give up their lives .
CEV	Revelation	12	13	When the dragon realized it had been thrown down to the earth , it tried to make trouble for the woman who had given birth to a son .
CEV	Revelation	12	14	( G ) But the woman was given two wings like those of a huge eagle , so she could fly into the desert . There she would escape from the snake and be taken care of for a time , two times , and half a time .
CEV	Revelation	12	15	The snake then spewed out water like a river to sweep the woman away .
CEV	Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped her and swallowed the water that had come from the dragon 's mouth .
CEV	Revelation	12	17	This made the dragon terribly angry with the woman . So it started a war against the rest of her children . They are the people who obey God and are faithful to what Jesus did and taught .

CEV	Revelation	13	13	It worked mighty miracles , and while people watched , it even made fire come down from the sky .
CEV	Revelation	13	2	( B ) The beast I saw had the body of a leopard , the feet of a bear , and the mouth of a lion . The dragon handed over its own power and throne and great authority to this beast .
CEV	Revelation	13	3	One of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded , but now it was well . Everyone on earth marveled at this beast ,
CEV	Revelation	13	4	and they worshiped the dragon who had given its authority to the beast . They also worshiped the beast and said , “ No one is like this beast ! No one can fight against it. ”
CEV	Revelation	13	5	( C ) The beast was allowed to brag and claim to be God , and for
CEV	Revelation	13	42	months it was allowed to rule .
CEV	Revelation	13	6	The beast cursed God , and it cursed the name of God . It even cursed the place where God lives , as well as everyone who lives in heaven with God .
CEV	Revelation	13	7	( D ) It was allowed to fight against God 's people and defeat them . It was also given authority over the people of every tribe , nation , language , and race .
CEV	Revelation	13	8	( E ) The beast was worshiped by everyone whose name was n't written before the time of creation in the book of the Lamb who was killed . [ a ]
CEV	Revelation	13	9	If you have ears , then listen !
CEV	Revelation	13	10	( F ) If you are doomed to be captured , you will be captured . If you are doomed to be killed by a sword , you will be killed by a sword . This means God 's people must learn to endure and be faithful !
CEV	Revelation	13	11	I now saw another beast . This one came out of the ground . It had two horns like a lamb , but spoke like a dragon .
CEV	Revelation	13	12	It worked for the beast whose fatal wound had been healed . And it used all its authority to force the earth and its people to worship that beast .
CEV	Revelation	13	14	This second beast fooled people on earth by working miracles for the first one . Then it talked them into making an idol in the form of the beast that did not die after being wounded by a sword .
CEV	Revelation	13	15	It was allowed to put breath into the idol , so it could speak . Everyone who refused to worship the idol of the beast was put to death .
CEV	Revelation	13	16	( G ) All people were forced to put a mark on their right hand or forehead . Whether they were powerful or weak , rich or poor , free people or slaves ,
CEV	Revelation	13	17	they all had to have this mark , or else they could not buy or sell anything . This mark stood for the name of the beast and for the number of its name .

CEV	Revelation	14	14	( G ) I looked and saw a bright cloud , and someone who seemed to be the Son of Man [ c ] was sitting on the cloud . He wore a gold crown on his head and held a sharp sickle [ d ] in his hand .
CEV	Revelation	14	2	( B ) Then I heard a sound from heaven that was like a roaring flood or loud thunder or even like the music of harps .
CEV	Revelation	14	3	And a new song was being sung in front of God 's throne and in front of the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn that song , except the 144,000 who had been rescued from the earth .
CEV	Revelation	14	4	All of these are pure virgins , and they follow the Lamb wherever he leads . They have been rescued to be presented to God and the Lamb as the most precious people [ b ] on earth .
CEV	Revelation	14	5	( C ) They never tell lies , and they are innocent . The Messages of the Three Angels
CEV	Revelation	14	6	I saw another angel . This one was flying across the sky and had the eternal good news to announce to the people of every race , tribe , language , and nation on earth .
CEV	Revelation	14	7	The angel shouted , “ Worship and honor God ! The time has come for him to judge everyone . Kneel down before the one who created heaven and earth , the oceans , and every stream. ”
CEV	Revelation	14	8	( D ) A second angel followed and said , “ The great city of Babylon has fallen ! This is the city that made all nations drunk and immoral . Now God is angry , and Babylon has fallen. ”
CEV	Revelation	14	9	Finally , a third angel came and shouted : Here is what will happen if you worship the beast and the idol and have the mark of the beast on your hand or forehead .
CEV	Revelation	14	10	( E ) You will have to drink the wine that God gives to everyone who makes him angry . You will feel his mighty anger , and you will be tortured with fire and burning sulfur , while the holy angels and the Lamb look on .
CEV	Revelation	14	11	( F ) If you worship the beast and the idol and accept the mark of its name , you will be tortured day and night . The smoke from your torture will go up forever and ever , and you will never be able to rest .
CEV	Revelation	14	12	God 's people must learn to endure . They must also obey his commands and have faith in Jesus .
CEV	Revelation	14	13	Then I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Put this in writing . From now on , the Lord will bless everyone who has faith in him when they die. ” The Spirit answered , “ Yes , they will rest from their hard work , and they will be rewarded for what they have done. ” The Earth Is Harvested
CEV	Revelation	14	15	( H ) An angel came out of the temple and shouted , “ Start cutting with your sickle ! Harvest season is here , and all crops on earth are ripe. ”
CEV	Revelation	14	16	The one on the cloud swung his sickle and harvested the crops .
CEV	Revelation	14	17	Another angel with a sharp sickle then came out of the temple in heaven .
CEV	Revelation	14	18	After this , an angel with power over fire came from the altar and shouted to the angel who had the sickle . He said , “ All grapes on earth are ripe ! Harvest them with your sharp sickle. ”
CEV	Revelation	14	19	The angel swung his sickle on earth and cut off its grapes . He threw them into a pit [ e ] where they were trampled on as a sign of God 's anger .
CEV	Revelation	14	20	( I ) The pit was outside the city , and when the grapes were mashed , blood flowed out . The blood turned into a river that was about
CEV	Revelation	14	300	kilometers long and almost deep enough to cover a horse . Footnotes - 14.1 Mount Zion : Another name for Jerusalem . - 14.4 the most precious people : The Greek text has “ the first people. ” The Law of Moses taught that the first-born of all animals and the first part of the harvest were special and belonged to the Lord . - 14.14 Son of Man : See the note at 1.13 . - 14.14 sickle : A knife with a long curved blade , used to cut grain and other crops . - 14.19 pit : It was the custom to put grapes in a pit ( called a wine press ) and trample on them to make juice that would later turn to wine .

CEV	Revelation	15	15	After this , I looked at the sky and saw something else that was strange and important . Seven angels were bringing the seven last terrible troubles . When these are ended , God will no longer be angry .
CEV	Revelation	15	2	Then I saw something that looked like a glass sea mixed with fire , and people were standing on it . They were the ones who had defeated the beast and the idol and the number that tells the name of the beast . God had given them harps ,
CEV	Revelation	15	3	( A ) and they were singing the song his servant Moses and the Lamb had sung . They were singing , “ Lord God All-Powerful , you have done great and marvelous things . You are the ruler of all nations , and you do what is right and fair .
CEV	Revelation	15	4	( B ) Lord , who does n't honor and praise your name ? You alone are holy , and all nations will come and worship you , because you have shown that you judge with fairness. ”
CEV	Revelation	15	5	( C ) After this , I noticed something else in heaven . The sacred tent used for a temple was open .
CEV	Revelation	15	6	And the seven angels who were bringing the terrible troubles were coming out of it . They were dressed in robes of pure white linen and wore belts made of pure gold .
CEV	Revelation	15	7	One of the four living creatures gave each of the seven angels a bowl made of gold . These bowls were filled with the anger of God who lives forever and ever .
CEV	Revelation	15	8	( D ) The temple quickly filled with smoke from the glory and power of God . No one could enter it until the seven angels had finished pouring out the seven last troubles . Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	16	16	( F ) Those armies came together in a place that in Hebrew is called Armagedon . [ b ]
CEV	Revelation	16	2	( A ) The first angel emptied his bowl on the earth . At once ugly and painful sores broke out on everyone who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the idol .
CEV	Revelation	16	3	The second angel emptied his bowl on the sea . At once the sea turned into blood like that of a dead person , and every living thing in the sea died .
CEV	Revelation	16	4	( B ) The third angel emptied his bowl into the rivers and streams . At once they turned to blood .
CEV	Revelation	16	5	Then I heard the angel , who has power over water , say , “ You have always been , and you always will be the holy God . You had the right to judge in this way .
CEV	Revelation	16	6	They poured out the blood [ a ] of your people and your prophets . So you gave them blood to drink as they deserve ! ”
CEV	Revelation	16	7	After this , I heard the altar shout , “ Yes , Lord God All-Powerful , your judgments are honest and fair. ”
CEV	Revelation	16	8	The fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun , and it began to scorch people like fire .
CEV	Revelation	16	9	Everyone was scorched by its great heat , and all of them cursed the name of God who had power over these terrible troubles . But no one turned to God and praised him .
CEV	Revelation	16	10	( C ) The fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the beast . At once darkness covered its kingdom , and its people began biting their tongues in pain .
CEV	Revelation	16	11	And because of their painful sores , they cursed the God who rules in heaven . But still they did not stop doing evil things .
CEV	Revelation	16	12	( D ) The sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great Euphrates River , and it completely dried up to make a road for the kings from the east .
CEV	Revelation	16	13	An evil spirit that looked like a frog came out of the mouth of the dragon . One also came out of the mouth of the beast , and another out of the mouth of the false prophet .
CEV	Revelation	16	14	These evil spirits had the power to work miracles . They went to every king on earth , to bring them together for a war against God All-Powerful . But that will be the day of God 's great victory .
CEV	Revelation	16	15	( E ) Remember Christ says , “ When I come , it will surprise you like a thief ! But God will bless you , if you are awake and ready . Then you wo n't have to walk around naked and be ashamed. ”
CEV	Revelation	16	17	As soon as the seventh angel emptied his bowl in the air , a loud voice from the throne in the temple shouted , “ It 's done ! ”
CEV	Revelation	16	18	( G ) There were flashes of lightning , roars of thunder , and the worst earthquake in all history .
CEV	Revelation	16	19	( H ) The great city of Babylon split into three parts , and the cities of other nations fell . So God made Babylon drink from the wine cup filled with his anger .
CEV	Revelation	16	20	( I ) Every island ran away , and the mountains disappeared .
CEV	Revelation	16	21	( J ) Hailstones , weighing about
CEV	Revelation	16	50	kilograms each , fell from the sky on people . Finally , the people cursed God , because the hail was so terrible . Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	17	17	God is the one who made these kings all think alike and decide to give their power to the beast . And they will do this until what God has said comes true .
CEV	Revelation	17	2	( B ) Every king on earth has slept with her , and her shameless ways are like wine that has made everyone on earth drunk. ”
CEV	Revelation	17	3	( C ) With the help of the Spirit , the angel took me into a desert , where I saw a woman sitting on a red beast . The beast was covered with names that were an insult to God , and it had seven heads and ten horns .
CEV	Revelation	17	4	( D ) The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet robes , and she wore jewelry made of gold , precious stones , and pearls . In her hand she held a gold cup filled with the filthy and nasty things she had done .
CEV	Revelation	17	5	On her forehead a mysterious name was written : I AM THE GREAT CITY OF BABYLON , THE MOTHER OF EVERY IMMORAL AND FILTHY THING ON EARTH .
CEV	Revelation	17	6	I could tell that the woman was drunk on the blood of God 's people who had given their lives for Jesus . This surprising sight amazed me ,
CEV	Revelation	17	7	and the angel said : Why are you so amazed ? I will explain the mystery about this woman and about the beast she is sitting on , with its seven heads and ten horns .
CEV	Revelation	17	8	( E ) The beast you saw is one that used to be and no longer is . It will come back from the deep pit , but only to be destroyed . Everyone on earth whose names were not written in the book of life [ a ] before the time of creation will be amazed . They will see this beast that used to be and no longer is , but will be once more .
CEV	Revelation	17	9	Anyone with wisdom can figure this out . The seven heads that the woman is sitting on stand for seven hills . These heads are also seven kings .
CEV	Revelation	17	10	Five of the kings are dead . One is ruling now , and the other one has not yet come . But when he does , he will rule for only a little while .
CEV	Revelation	17	11	You also saw a beast that used to be and no longer is . That beast is one of the seven kings who will return as the eighth king , but only to be destroyed .
CEV	Revelation	17	12	( F ) The ten horns you saw are ten more kings , who have not yet come into power , and they will rule with the beast for only a short time .
CEV	Revelation	17	13	They all think alike and will give their power and authority to the beast .
CEV	Revelation	17	14	( G ) These kings will go to war against the Lamb . But he will defeat them , because he is Lord over all lords and King over all kings . His followers are chosen and special and faithful .
CEV	Revelation	17	15	The oceans you saw the prostitute sitting on are crowds of people from all races and languages .
CEV	Revelation	17	16	The ten horns and the beast will start hating the shameless woman . They will strip off her clothes and leave her naked . Then they will eat her flesh and throw the rest of her body into a fire .
CEV	Revelation	17	18	The woman you saw is the great city that rules over all kings on earth . Footnotes - 17.8 book of life : See the note at 3.5 . Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	18	18	( L ) When they saw the smoke from her fire , they shouted , “ This was the greatest city ever ! ”
CEV	Revelation	18	2	( A ) The angel shouted , “ Fallen ! Powerful Babylon has fallen and is now the home of demons . It is the den of every filthy spirit and of all unclean birds , and every dirty and hated animal .
CEV	Revelation	18	3	( B ) Babylon 's evil and immoral wine has made all nations drunk . Every king on earth has slept with her , and every merchant on earth is rich because of her evil desires. ”
CEV	Revelation	18	4	( C ) Then I heard another voice from heaven shout , “ My people , you must escape from Babylon . Do n't take part in her sins and share her punishment .
CEV	Revelation	18	5	( D ) Her sins are piled as high as heaven . God has remembered the evil she has done .
CEV	Revelation	18	6	( E ) Treat her as she has treated others . Make her pay double for what she has done . Make her drink twice as much of what she mixed for others .
CEV	Revelation	18	7	( F ) That woman honored herself with a life of luxury . Reward her now with suffering and pain . “ Deep in her heart Babylon said , ‘ I am the queen ! Never will I be a widow or know what it means to be sad. ’
CEV	Revelation	18	8	And so , in a single day she will suffer the pain of sorrow , hunger , and death . Fire will destroy her dead body , because her judge is the powerful Lord God. ”
CEV	Revelation	18	9	( G ) Every king on earth who slept with her and shared in her luxury will mourn . They will weep , when they see the smoke from that fire .
CEV	Revelation	18	10	Her sufferings will frighten them , and they will stand at a distance and say , “ Pity that great and powerful city ! Pity Babylon ! In a single hour her judgment has come. ”
CEV	Revelation	18	11	( H ) Every merchant on earth will mourn , because there is no one to buy their goods .
CEV	Revelation	18	12	( I ) There wo n't be anyone to buy their gold , silver , jewels , pearls , fine linen , purple cloth , silk , scarlet cloth , sweet-smelling wood , fancy carvings of ivory and wood , as well as things made of bronze , iron , or marble .
CEV	Revelation	18	13	No one will buy their cinnamon , spices , incense , myrrh , frankincense , [ a ] wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat , cattle , sheep , horses , chariots , slaves , and other humans .
CEV	Revelation	18	14	Babylon , the things your heart desired have all escaped from you . Every luxury and all your glory will be lost forever . You will never get them back .
CEV	Revelation	18	15	( J ) The merchants had become rich because of her . But when they saw her sufferings , they were terrified . They stood at a distance , crying and mourning .
CEV	Revelation	18	16	Then they shouted , “ Pity the great city of Babylon ! She dressed in fine linen and wore purple and scarlet cloth . She had jewelry made of gold and precious stones and pearls .
CEV	Revelation	18	17	( K ) Yet in a single hour her riches disappeared. ” Every ship captain and passenger and sailor stood at a distance , together with everyone who does business by traveling on the sea .
CEV	Revelation	18	19	( M ) They cried loudly , and in their sorrow they threw dust on their heads , as they said , “ Pity the great city of Babylon ! Everyone who sailed the seas became rich from her treasures . But in a single hour the city was destroyed .
CEV	Revelation	18	20	( N ) The heavens should be happy with God 's people and apostles and prophets . God has punished her for them. ”
CEV	Revelation	18	21	( O ) A powerful angel then picked up a huge stone and threw it into the sea . The angel said , “ This is how the great city of Babylon will be thrown down , never to rise again .
CEV	Revelation	18	22	( P ) ( Q ) The music of harps and singers and of flutes and trumpets will no longer be heard . No workers will ever set up shop in that city , and the sound of grinding grain will be silenced forever .
CEV	Revelation	18	23	Lamps will no longer shine anywhere in Babylon , and couples will never again say wedding vows there . Her merchants ruled the earth , and by her witchcraft she fooled all nations .
CEV	Revelation	18	24	( R ) On the streets of Babylon is found the blood of God 's people and of his prophets , and everyone else. ” Footnotes - 18.13 myrrh , frankincense : Myrrh was a valuable sweet-smelling powder often used in perfume . Frankincense was a valuable powder that was burned to make a sweet smell . Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	19	19	I also saw the beast and all kings of the earth come together . They fought against the rider on the white horse and against his army .
CEV	Revelation	19	2	( A ) because his judgments are honest and fair . That filthy prostitute ruined the earth with shameful deeds . But God has judged her and made her pay the price for murdering his servants. ”
CEV	Revelation	19	3	( B ) Then the crowd shouted , “ Praise the Lord ! Smoke will never stop rising from her burning body. ”
CEV	Revelation	19	4	After this , the
CEV	Revelation	19	24	elders and the four living creatures all knelt before the throne of God and worshiped him . They said , “ Amen ! Praise the Lord ! ” The Marriage Supper of the Lamb
CEV	Revelation	19	5	( C ) From the throne a voice said , “ If you worship and fear our God , give praise to him , no matter who you are. ”
CEV	Revelation	19	6	( D ) Then I heard what seemed to be a large crowd that sounded like a roaring flood and loud thunder all mixed together . They were saying , “ Praise the Lord ! Our Lord God All-Powerful now rules as king .
CEV	Revelation	19	7	So we will be glad and happy and give him praise . The wedding day of the Lamb is here , and his bride is ready .
CEV	Revelation	19	8	She will be given a wedding dress made of pure and shining linen . This linen stands for the good things God 's people have done. ”
CEV	Revelation	19	9	( E ) Then the angel told me , “ Put this in writing . God will bless everyone who is invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb. ” The angel also said , “ These things God has said are true. ”
CEV	Revelation	19	10	I knelt at the feet of the angel and began to worship him . But the angel said , “ Do n't do that ! I am a servant , just like you and everyone else who tells about Jesus . Do n't worship anyone but God . Everyone who tells about Jesus does it by the power of the Spirit. ” The Rider on the White Horse
CEV	Revelation	19	11	( F ) I looked and saw heaven was open , and a white horse was there . Its rider was called Faithful and True , and he is always fair when he judges or goes to war .
CEV	Revelation	19	12	( G ) He had eyes like flames of fire , and he was wearing a lot of crowns . His name was written on him , but he was the only one who knew what the name meant .
CEV	Revelation	19	13	( H ) The rider wore a robe that was covered with [ a ] blood , and he was known as “ The Word of God. ”
CEV	Revelation	19	14	He was followed by armies from heaven that rode on white horses and were dressed in pure white linen .
CEV	Revelation	19	15	( I ) From his mouth a sharp sword went out to attack the nations . He will rule them with an iron rod and will show the fierce anger of God All-Powerful by trampling the grapes in the pit where wine is made .
CEV	Revelation	19	16	On the part of the robe that covered his thigh was written , “ KING OF KINGS AND Lord OF LordS. ”
CEV	Revelation	19	17	( J ) I then saw an angel standing on the sun , and he shouted to all the birds flying in the sky , “ Come and join in God 's great feast !
CEV	Revelation	19	18	You can eat the flesh of kings , rulers , leaders , horses , riders , free people , slaves , important people , and everyone else. ”
CEV	Revelation	19	20	( K ) But the beast was captured and so was the false prophet . This is the same prophet who had worked miracles for the beast , so he could fool everyone who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the idol . The beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into a lake of burning sulfur .
CEV	Revelation	19	21	But the rest of their army was killed by the sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse . Then birds stuffed themselves on the dead bodies . Footnotes - 19.13 covered with : Some manuscripts have “ sprinkled with. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	20	20	I saw an angel come down from heaven , carrying the key to the deep pit and a big chain .
CEV	Revelation	20	2	( A ) He chained the dragon for 1,000 years . It is that old snake , who is also known as the devil and Satan .
CEV	Revelation	20	3	Then the angel threw the dragon into the pit . He locked and sealed it , so 1,000 years would go by before the dragon could fool the nations again . But after that , it would have to be set free for a little while .
CEV	Revelation	20	4	( B ) I saw thrones , and sitting on those thrones were the ones who had been given the right to judge . I also saw the souls of the people who had their heads cut off because they had told about Jesus and preached God 's message . They were the same ones who had not worshiped the beast or the idol , and they had refused to let its mark be put on their foreheads or hands . They will come to life and rule with Christ for 1,000 years . 5-6 These people are the first to be raised to life , and they are especially blessed and holy . The second death [ a ] has no power over them . They will be priests for God and Christ and will rule with them for 1,000 years . No other dead people were raised to life until 1,000 years later . Satan Is Defeated
CEV	Revelation	20	7	At the end of the 1,000 years , Satan will be set free .
CEV	Revelation	20	8	( C ) He will fool the countries of Gog and Magog , which are at the far ends of the earth , and their people will follow him into battle . They will have as many followers as there are grains of sand along the beach ,
CEV	Revelation	20	9	and they will march all the way across the earth . They will surround the camp of God 's people and the city God loves . But fire will come down from heaven and destroy the whole army .
CEV	Revelation	20	10	Then the devil who fooled them will be thrown into the lake of fire and burning sulfur . He will be there with the beast and the false prophet , and they will be in pain day and night forever and ever . The Judgment at the Great White Throne
CEV	Revelation	20	11	( D ) I saw a great white throne with someone sitting on it . Earth and heaven tried to run away , but there was no place for them to go .
CEV	Revelation	20	12	( E ) I also saw all the dead people standing in front of that throne . Every one of them was there , no matter who they had once been . Several books were opened , and then the book of life [ b ] was opened . The dead were judged by what those books said they had done .
CEV	Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up the dead people who were in it , and death and its kingdom also gave up their dead . Then everyone was judged by what they had done .
CEV	Revelation	20	14	Afterwards , death and its kingdom were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death . [ c ]
CEV	Revelation	20	15	Anyone whose name was n't written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire . Copyright ©

CEV	Revelation	21	21	Each of the twelve gates was a solid pearl . The streets of the city were made of pure gold , clear as crystal .
CEV	Revelation	21	2	( B ) Then I saw New Jerusalem , the holy city , coming down from God in heaven . It was like a bride dressed in her wedding gown and ready to meet her husband .
CEV	Revelation	21	3	( C ) I heard a loud voice shout from the throne : God 's home is now with his people . He will live with them , and they will be his own . Yes , God will make his home among his people .
CEV	Revelation	21	4	( D ) He will wipe all tears from their eyes , and there will be no more death , suffering , crying , or pain . These things of the past are gone forever .
CEV	Revelation	21	5	Then the one sitting on the throne said : I am making everything new . Write down what I have said . My words are true and can be trusted .
CEV	Revelation	21	6	( E ) Everything is finished ! I am Alpha and Omega , [ a ] the beginning and the end . I will freely give water from the life-giving fountain to everyone who is thirsty .
CEV	Revelation	21	7	( F ) All who win the victory will be given these blessings . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
CEV	Revelation	21	8	But I will tell you what will happen to cowards and to everyone who is unfaithful or dirty-minded or who murders or is sexually immoral or uses witchcraft or worships idols or tells lies . They will be thrown into that lake of fire and burning sulfur . This is the second death . [ b ] The New Jerusalem
CEV	Revelation	21	9	I saw one of the seven angels who had the bowls filled with the seven last terrible troubles . The angel came to me and said , “ Come on ! I will show you the one who will be the bride and wife of the Lamb. ”
CEV	Revelation	21	10	( G ) Then with the help of the Spirit , he took me to the top of a very high mountain . There he showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down from God in heaven .
CEV	Revelation	21	11	The glory of God made the city bright . It was dazzling and crystal clear like a precious jasper stone .
CEV	Revelation	21	12	( H ) The city had a high and thick wall with twelve gates , and each one of them was guarded by an angel . On each of the gates was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel .
CEV	Revelation	21	13	Three of these gates were on the east , three were on the north , three more were on the south , and the other three were on the west .
CEV	Revelation	21	14	The city was built on twelve foundation stones . On each of the stones was written the name of one of the Lamb 's twelve apostles .
CEV	Revelation	21	15	( I ) The angel who spoke to me had a gold measuring stick to measure the city and its gates and its walls .
CEV	Revelation	21	16	The city was shaped like a cube , because it was just as high as it was wide . When the angel measured the city , it was about 2,400 kilometers high and 2,400 kilometers wide .
CEV	Revelation	21	17	Then the angel measured the wall , and by our measurements it was about
CEV	Revelation	21	60	meters high .
CEV	Revelation	21	18	( J ) ( K ) The wall was built of jasper , and the city was made of pure gold , clear as crystal .
CEV	Revelation	21	19	Each of the twelve foundations was a precious stone . The first was jasper , [ c ] the second was sapphire , the third was agate , the fourth was emerald ,
CEV	Revelation	21	20	the fifth was onyx , the sixth was carnelian , the seventh was chrysolite , the eighth was beryl , the ninth was topaz , the tenth was chrysoprase , the eleventh was jacinth , and the twelfth was amethyst .
CEV	Revelation	21	22	I did not see a temple there . The Lord God All-Powerful and the Lamb were its temple .
CEV	Revelation	21	23	( L ) And the city did not need the sun or the moon . The glory of God was shining on it , and the Lamb was its light .
CEV	Revelation	21	24	( M ) Nations will walk by the light of that city , and kings will bring their riches there .
CEV	Revelation	21	25	( N ) Its gates are always open during the day , and night never comes .
CEV	Revelation	21	26	The glorious treasures of nations will be brought into the city .
CEV	Revelation	21	27	( O ) But nothing unworthy will be allowed to enter . No one who is dirty-minded or who tells lies will be there . Only those whose names are written in the Lamb 's book of life [ d ] will be in the city .
