CJB	Genesis	1	1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth .
CJB	Genesis	1	2	The earth was unformed and void , darkness was on the face of the deep , and the Spirit of God hovered over the surface of the water .
CJB	Genesis	1	3	Then God said , “ Let there be light ” ; and there was light .
CJB	Genesis	1	4	God saw that the light was good , and God divided the light from the darkness .
CJB	Genesis	1	5	God called the light Day , and the darkness he called Night . So there was evening , and there was morning , one day .
CJB	Genesis	1	6	God said , “ Let there be a dome in the middle of the water ; let it divide the water from the water. ”
CJB	Genesis	1	7	God made the dome and divided the water under the dome from the water above the dome ; that is how it was ,
CJB	Genesis	1	8	and God called the dome Sky . So there was evening , and there was morning , a second day .
CJB	Genesis	1	9	God said , “ Let the water under the sky be gathered together into one place , and let dry land appear , ” and that is how it was .
CJB	Genesis	1	10	God called the dry land Earth , the gathering together of the water he called Seas , and God saw that it was good .
CJB	Genesis	1	11	God said , “ Let the earth put forth grass , seed-producing plants , and fruit trees , each yielding its own kind of seed-bearing fruit , on the earth ” ; and that is how it was .
CJB	Genesis	1	12	The earth brought forth grass , plants each yielding its own kind of seed , and trees each producing its own kind of seed-bearing fruit ; and God saw that it was good .
CJB	Genesis	1	13	So there was evening , and there was morning , a third day . ( A : ii )
CJB	Genesis	1	14	God said , “ Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to divide the day from the night ; let them be for signs , seasons , days and years ;
CJB	Genesis	1	15	and let them be for lights in the dome of the sky to give light to the earth ” ; and that is how it was .
CJB	Genesis	1	16	God made the two great lights — the larger light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night — and the stars .
CJB	Genesis	1	17	God put them in the dome of the sky to give light to the earth ,
CJB	Genesis	1	18	to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness ; and God saw that it was good .
CJB	Genesis	1	19	So there was evening , and there was morning , a fourth day .
CJB	Genesis	1	20	God said , “ Let the water swarm with swarms of living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth in the open dome of the sky. ”
CJB	Genesis	1	21	God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that creeps , so that the water swarmed with all kinds of them , and there was every kind of winged bird ; and God saw that it was good .
CJB	Genesis	1	22	Then God blessed them , saying , “ Be fruitful , multiply and fill the water of the seas , and let birds multiply on the earth. ”
CJB	Genesis	1	23	So there was evening , and there was morning , a fifth day . ( A : iii )
CJB	Genesis	1	24	God said , “ Let the earth bring forth each kind of living creature — each kind of livestock , crawling animal and wild beast ” ; and that is how it was .
CJB	Genesis	1	25	God made each kind of wild beast , each kind of livestock and every kind of animal that crawls along the ground ; and God saw that it was good .
CJB	Genesis	1	26	Then God said , “ Let us make humankind in our image , in the likeness of ourselves ; and let them rule over the fish in the sea , the birds in the air , the animals , and over all the earth , and over every crawling creature that crawls on the earth. ”
CJB	Genesis	1	27	So God created humankind in his own image ; in the image of God he created him : male and female he created them .
CJB	Genesis	1	28	God blessed them : God said to them , “ Be fruitful , multiply , fill the earth and subdue it . Rule over the fish in the sea , the birds in the air and every living creature that crawls on the earth. ”
CJB	Genesis	1	29	Then God said , “ Here ! Throughout the whole earth I am giving you as food every seed-bearing plant and every tree with seed-bearing fruit .
CJB	Genesis	1	30	And to every wild animal , bird in the air and creature crawling on the earth , in which there is a living soul , I am giving as food every kind of green plant. ” And that is how it was .
CJB	Genesis	1	31	God saw everything that he had made , and indeed it was very good . So there was evening , and there was morning , a sixth day .
CJB	Genesis	2	2	On the seventh day God was finished with his work which he had made , so he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
CJB	Genesis	2	3	God blessed the seventh day and separated it as holy ; because on that day God rested from all his work which he had created , so that it itself could produce . ( A : iv , S : ii )
CJB	Genesis	2	4	Here is the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created . On the day when Adonai , God , made earth and heaven ,
CJB	Genesis	2	5	there was as yet no wild bush on the earth , and no wild plant had as yet sprung up ; for Adonai , God , had not caused it to rain on the earth , and there was no one to cultivate the ground .
CJB	Genesis	2	6	Rather , a mist went up from the earth which watered the entire surface of the ground .
CJB	Genesis	2	7	Then Adonai , God , formed a person [ a ] from the dust of the ground [ b ] and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life , so that he became a living being .
CJB	Genesis	2	8	Adonai , God , planted a garden toward the east , in ‘ Eden , and there he put the person whom he had formed .
CJB	Genesis	2	9	Out of the ground Adonai , God , caused to grow every tree pleasing in appearance and good for food , including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .
CJB	Genesis	2	10	A river went out of ‘ Eden to water the garden , and from there it divided into four streams .
CJB	Genesis	2	11	The name of the first is Pishon ; it winds throughout the land of Havilah , where there is gold .
CJB	Genesis	2	12	The gold of that land is good ; aromatic resin and onyx stone are also found there .
CJB	Genesis	2	13	The name of the second river is Gichon ; it winds throughout the land of Kush .
CJB	Genesis	2	14	The name of the third river is Tigris ; it is the one that flows toward the east of Ashur . The fourth river is the Euphrates .
CJB	Genesis	2	15	Adonai , God , took the person and put him in the garden of ‘ Eden to cultivate and care for it .
CJB	Genesis	2	16	Adonai , God , gave the person this order : “ You may freely eat from every tree in the garden
CJB	Genesis	2	17	except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil . You are not to eat from it , because on the day that you eat from it , it will become certain that you will die. ”
CJB	Genesis	2	18	Adonai , God , said , “ It isn ’ t good that the person should be alone . I will make for him a companion suitable for helping him. ”
CJB	Genesis	2	19	So from the ground Adonai , God , formed every wild animal and every bird that flies in the air , and he brought them to the person to see what he would call them . Whatever the person would call each living creature , that was to be its name . ( S : iii )
CJB	Genesis	2	20	So the person gave names to all the livestock , to the birds in the air and to every wild animal . But for Adam there was not found a companion suitable for helping him .
CJB	Genesis	2	21	Then God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the person ; and while he was sleeping , he took one of his ribs and closed up the place from which he took it with flesh .
CJB	Genesis	2	22	The rib which Adonai , God , had taken from the person , he made a woman-person ; and he brought her to the man-person .
CJB	Genesis	2	23	The man-person said , “ At last ! This is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh . She is to be called Woman [ c ] , because she was taken out of Man [ d ] . ”
CJB	Genesis	2	24	This is why a man is to leave his father and mother and stick with his wife , and they are to be one flesh .
CJB	Genesis	2	25	They were both naked , the man and his wife , and they were not ashamed . Footnotes - Genesis 2:7 Hebrew : adam - Genesis 2:7 Hebrew : adamah - Genesis 2:23 Hebrew : ishah - Genesis 2:23 Hebrew : ish
CJB	Genesis	3	3	but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden God said , ‘ You are neither to eat from it nor touch it , or you will die. ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	3	2	The woman answered the serpent , “ We may eat from the fruit of the trees of the garden ,
CJB	Genesis	3	4	The serpent said to the woman , “ It is not true that you will surely die ;
CJB	Genesis	3	5	because God knows that on the day you eat from it , your eyes will be opened , and you will be like God , knowing good and evil. ”
CJB	Genesis	3	6	When the woman saw that the tree was good for food , that it had a pleasing appearance and that the tree was desirable for making one wise , she took some of its fruit and ate . She also gave some to her husband , who was with her ; and he ate .
CJB	Genesis	3	7	Then the eyes of both of them were opened , and they realized that they were naked . So they sewed fig leaves together to make themselves loincloths .
CJB	Genesis	3	8	They heard the voice of Adonai , God , walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze , so the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Adonai , God , among the trees in the garden .
CJB	Genesis	3	9	Adonai , God , called to the man , “ Where are you ? ”
CJB	Genesis	3	10	He answered , “ I heard your voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked , so I hid myself. ”
CJB	Genesis	3	11	He said , “ Who told you that you were naked ? Have you eaten from the tree from which I ordered you not to eat ? ”
CJB	Genesis	3	12	The man replied , “ The woman you gave to be with me — she gave me fruit from the tree , and I ate. ”
CJB	Genesis	3	13	Adonai , God , said to the woman , “ What is this you have done ? ” The woman answered , “ The serpent tricked me , so I ate. ”
CJB	Genesis	3	14	Adonai , God , said to the serpent , “ Because you have done this , you are cursed more than all livestock and wild animals . You will crawl on your belly and eat dust as long as you live .
CJB	Genesis	3	15	I will put animosity between you and the woman , and between your descendant and her descendant ; he will bruise your head , and you will bruise his heel. ”
CJB	Genesis	3	16	To the woman he said , “ I will greatly increase your pain in childbirth . You will bring forth children in pain . Your desire will be toward your husband , but he will rule over you. ”
CJB	Genesis	3	17	To Adam he said , “ Because you listened to what your wife said and ate from the tree about which I gave you the order , ‘ You are not to eat from it , ’ the ground is cursed on your account ; you will work hard to eat from it as long as you live .
CJB	Genesis	3	18	It will produce thorns and thistles for you , and you will eat field plants .
CJB	Genesis	3	19	You will eat bread by the sweat of your forehead till you return to the ground — for you were taken out of it : you are dust , and you will return to dust. ”
CJB	Genesis	3	20	The man called his wife Havah [ life ] , because she was the mother of all living .
CJB	Genesis	3	21	Adonai , God , made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them . ( A : v , S : iv )
CJB	Genesis	3	22	Adonai , God , said , “ See , the man has become like one of us , knowing good and evil . Now , to prevent his putting out his hand and taking also from the tree of life , eating , and living forever — ”
CJB	Genesis	3	23	therefore Adonai , God , sent him out of the garden of ‘ Eden to cultivate the ground from which he was taken .
CJB	Genesis	3	24	So he drove the man out , and he placed at the east of the garden of ‘ Eden the k ’ ruvim and a flaming sword which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life .
CJB	Genesis	4	4	and Hevel too brought from the firstborn of his sheep , including their fat . Adonai accepted Hevel and his offering
CJB	Genesis	4	2	In addition she gave birth to his brother Hevel . Hevel kept sheep , while Kayin worked the soil .
CJB	Genesis	4	3	In the course of time Kayin brought an offering to Adonai from the produce of the soil ;
CJB	Genesis	4	5	but did not accept Kayin and his offering . Kayin was very angry , and his face fell .
CJB	Genesis	4	6	Adonai said to Kayin , “ Why are you angry ? Why so downcast ?
CJB	Genesis	4	7	If you are doing what is good , shouldn ’ t you hold your head high ? And if you don ’ t do what is good , sin is crouching at the door — it wants you , but you can rule over it. ”
CJB	Genesis	4	8	Kayin had words with Hevel his brother ; then one time , when they were in the field , Kayin turned on Hevel his brother and killed him .
CJB	Genesis	4	9	Adonai said to Kayin , “ Where is Hevel your brother ? ” And he replied , “ I don ’ t know ; am I my brother ’ s guardian ? ”
CJB	Genesis	4	10	He said , “ What have you done ? The voice of your brother ’ s blood is crying out to me from the ground !
CJB	Genesis	4	11	Now you are cursed from the ground , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother ’ s blood at your hands .
CJB	Genesis	4	12	When you farm the ground it will no longer yield its strength to you . You will be a fugitive , wandering the earth. ”
CJB	Genesis	4	13	Kayin said to Adonai , “ My punishment is greater than I can bear .
CJB	Genesis	4	14	You are banning me today from the land and from your presence . I will be a fugitive wandering the earth , and whoever finds me will kill me. ”
CJB	Genesis	4	15	Adonai answered him , “ Therefore , whoever kills Kayin will receive vengeance sevenfold , ” and Adonai put a sign on Kayin , so that no one who found him would kill him .
CJB	Genesis	4	16	So Kayin left the presence of Adonai and lived in the land of Nod [ wandering ] , east of ‘ Eden .
CJB	Genesis	4	17	Kayin had sexual relations with his wife ; she conceived and gave birth to Hanokh . Kayin built a city and named the city after his son Hanokh .
CJB	Genesis	4	18	To Hanokh was born ‘ Irad . ‘ Irad fathered Mechuya ’ el , Mechuya ’ el fathered Metusha ’ el , and Metusha ’ el fathered Lemekh . ( S : v )
CJB	Genesis	4	19	Lemekh took himself two wives ; the name of the one was ‘ Adah , while the name of the other was Tzilah .
CJB	Genesis	4	20	‘ Adah gave birth to Yaval ; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have cattle .
CJB	Genesis	4	21	His brother ’ s name was Yuval ; and he was the ancestor of all who play lyre and flute .
CJB	Genesis	4	22	Tzilah gave birth to Tuval-Kayin , who forged all kinds of tools from brass and iron ; the sister of Tuval-Kayin was Na ‘ amah .
CJB	Genesis	4	23	Lemekh said to his wives , “ ‘ Adah and Tzilah , listen to me ; wives of Lemekh , hear what I say : I killed a man for wounding me , a young man who injured me .
CJB	Genesis	4	24	If Kayin will be avenged sevenfold , then Lemekh seventy-sevenfold ! ”
CJB	Genesis	4	25	Adam again had sexual relations with his wife , and she gave birth to a son whom she named Shet [ granted ] , “ For God has granted me another seed in place of Hevel , since Kayin killed him. ”
CJB	Genesis	4	26	To Shet too was born a son , whom he called Enosh . That is when people began to call on the name of Adonai .
CJB	Genesis	5	5	In all , Adam lived
CJB	Genesis	5	2	he created them male and female ; he blessed them and called them Adam [ humankind , man ] on the day they were created .
CJB	Genesis	5	3	After Adam lived
CJB	Genesis	5	130	years he fathered a son like himself and named him Shet .
CJB	Genesis	5	4	After Shet was born , Adam lived another
CJB	Genesis	5	800	years and had sons and daughters .

CJB	Genesis	5	6	Shet lived

CJB	Genesis	5	12	Kenan lived seventy years and fathered Mahalal ’ el .
CJB	Genesis	5	13	After Mahalal ’ el was born , Kenan lived another
CJB	Genesis	5	840	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	5	14	In all , Kenan lived
CJB	Genesis	5	910	years ; then he died .
CJB	Genesis	5	15	Mahalal ’ el lived sixty-five years and fathered Yered .
CJB	Genesis	5	16	After Yered was born , Mahalal ’ el lived another
CJB	Genesis	5	830	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	5	17	In all , Mahalal ’ el lived
CJB	Genesis	5	895	years ; then he died .
CJB	Genesis	5	18	Yered lived
CJB	Genesis	5	162	years and fathered Hanokh .
CJB	Genesis	5	19	After Hanokh was born , Yered lived
CJB	Genesis	5	20	In all , Yered lived
CJB	Genesis	5	962	years ; then he died .
CJB	Genesis	5	21	Hanokh lived sixty-five years and fathered Metushelach .
CJB	Genesis	5	22	After Metushelach was born , Hanokh walked with God
CJB	Genesis	5	300	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	5	23	In all , Hanokh lived
CJB	Genesis	5	365	years .
CJB	Genesis	5	24	Hanokh walked with God , and then he wasn ’ t there , because God took him . ( vii )
CJB	Genesis	5	25	Metushelach lived
CJB	Genesis	5	187	years and fathered Lemekh .
CJB	Genesis	5	26	After Lemekh was born , Metushelach lived
CJB	Genesis	5	782	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	5	27	In all , Metushelach lived
CJB	Genesis	5	969	years ; then he died .
CJB	Genesis	5	28	Lemekh lived
CJB	Genesis	5	182	years and fathered a son ,
CJB	Genesis	5	29	whom he called Noach [ restful ] ; for he said , “ This one will comfort us in our labor , in the hard work we do with our hands [ to get what comes ] from the ground that Adonai cursed. ”
CJB	Genesis	5	30	After Noach was born , Lemekh lived
CJB	Genesis	5	595	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	5	31	In all , Lemekh lived
CJB	Genesis	5	777	years ; then he died .
CJB	Genesis	5	32	Noach was
CJB	Genesis	5	500	years old ; and Noach fathered Shem , Ham and Yefet .
CJB	Genesis	6	6	Adonai regretted that he had made humankind on the earth ; it grieved his heart .
CJB	Genesis	6	2	: Noach ( Noah ) 6:9–11:32
CJB	Genesis	6	3	Adonai said , “ My Spirit will not live in human beings forever , for they too are flesh ; therefore their life span is to be
CJB	Genesis	6	120	years. ”
CJB	Genesis	6	4	The N ’ filim were on the earth in those days , and also afterwards , when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men , and they bore children to them ; these were the ancient heroes , men of renown . ( Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	6	5	Adonai saw that the people on earth were very wicked , that all the imaginings of their hearts were always of evil only .
CJB	Genesis	6	7	Adonai said , “ I will wipe out humankind , whom I have created , from the whole earth ; and not only human beings , but animals , creeping things and birds in the air ; for I regret that I ever made them. ”
CJB	Genesis	6	8	But Noach found grace in the sight of Adonai . Haftarah B ’ resheet : Yesha ‘ yahu ( Isaiah ) 42:5–43:10 ( A ) ; 42:5–21 ( S ) B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah B ’ resheet : Mattityahu ( Matthew ) 1:1–17 ; 19:3–9 ; Mark 10:1–12 ; Luke 3:23–38 ; Yochanan ( John ) 1:1–18 ;
CJB	Genesis	6	1	Timothy 2:11–15 ; Messianic Jews ( Hebrews ) 1:1–3 ; 3:7–4:11 ; 11:1–7 ;
CJB	Genesis	6	9	Here is the history of Noach . In his generation , Noach was a man righteous and wholehearted ; Noach walked with God .
CJB	Genesis	6	10	Noach fathered three sons , Shem , Ham and Yefet .
CJB	Genesis	6	11	The earth was corrupt before God , the earth was filled with violence .
CJB	Genesis	6	12	God saw the earth , and , yes , it was corrupt ; for all living beings had corrupted their ways on the earth .
CJB	Genesis	6	13	God said to Noach , “ The end of all living beings has come before me , for because of them the earth is filled with violence . I will destroy them along with the earth .
CJB	Genesis	6	14	Make yourself an ark of gofer-wood ; you are to make the ark with rooms and cover it with pitch both outside and inside .
CJB	Genesis	6	15	Here is how you are to build it : the length of the ark is to be
CJB	Genesis	6	450	feet , its width seventy-five feet and its height forty-five feet .
CJB	Genesis	6	16	You are to make an opening for daylight in the ark eighteen inches below its roof . Put a door in its side ; and build it with lower , second and third decks .
CJB	Genesis	6	17	“ Then I myself will bring the flood of water over the earth to destroy from under heaven every living thing that breathes ; everything on earth will be destroyed .
CJB	Genesis	6	18	But I will establish my covenant with you ; you will come into the ark , you , your sons , your wife and your sons ’ wives with you .
CJB	Genesis	6	19	“ From everything living , from each kind of living being , you are to bring two into the ark , to keep them alive with you ; they are to be male and female .
CJB	Genesis	6	20	Of each kind of bird , each kind of livestock , and each kind of animal creeping on the ground , two are to come to you , so that they can be kept alive .
CJB	Genesis	6	21	Also take from all the kinds of food that are eaten , and collect it for yourself ; it is to be food for you and for them. ”
CJB	Genesis	6	22	This is what Noach did ; he did all that God ordered him to do .
CJB	Genesis	7	7	Noach went into the ark with his sons , his wife and his sons ’ wives , because of the floodwaters .
CJB	Genesis	7	2	Of every clean animal you are to take seven couples , and of the animals that are not clean , one couple ;
CJB	Genesis	7	3	also of the birds in the air take seven couples — in order to preserve their species throughout the earth .
CJB	Genesis	7	4	For in seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights ; I will wipe out every living thing that I have made from the face of the earth. ”
CJB	Genesis	7	5	Noach did all that Adonai ordered him to do .
CJB	Genesis	7	6	Noach was
CJB	Genesis	7	600	years old when the water flooded the earth .
CJB	Genesis	7	8	Of clean animals , of animals that are not clean , of birds , and of everything that creeps on the ground ,
CJB	Genesis	7	9	couples , male and female , went in to Noach in the ark , as God had ordered Noach .
CJB	Genesis	7	10	After seven days the water flooded the earth .
CJB	Genesis	7	11	On the seventeenth day of the second month of the 600th year of Noach ’ s life all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the windows of the sky were opened .
CJB	Genesis	7	12	It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights .
CJB	Genesis	7	13	On that same day Noach entered the ark with Shem , Ham and Yefet the sons of Noach , Noach ’ s wife and the three wives of his sons accompanying them ;
CJB	Genesis	7	14	they , and every animal of every species , all the livestock of every species , every animal that creeps on the ground of every species , and every bird of every species — all sorts of winged creatures .
CJB	Genesis	7	15	They went in to Noach in the ark , couples from every kind of living thing that breathes .
CJB	Genesis	7	16	Those that entered went in , male and female , from every kind of living being , as God had ordered him ; and Adonai shut him inside . ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	7	17	The flood was forty days on the earth ; the water grew higher and floated the ark , so that it was lifted up off the earth .
CJB	Genesis	7	18	The water overflowed the earth and grew deeper , until the ark floated on the surface of the water .
CJB	Genesis	7	19	The water overpowered the earth mightily ; all the high mountains under the entire sky were covered ;
CJB	Genesis	7	20	the water covered the mountains by more than twenty-two-and-a-half feet .
CJB	Genesis	7	21	All living beings that moved on the earth perished — birds , livestock , other animals , insects , and every human being ,
CJB	Genesis	7	22	everything in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life ; whatever was on dry land died .
CJB	Genesis	7	23	He wiped out every living thing on the surface of the ground — not only human beings , but livestock , creeping animals and birds in the air . They were wiped out from the earth ; only Noach was left , along with those who were with him in the ark .
CJB	Genesis	7	24	The water held power over the earth for
CJB	Genesis	7	150	days .
CJB	Genesis	8	8	Then he sent out a dove , to see if the water had gone from the surface of the ground .
CJB	Genesis	8	2	Also the fountains of the deep and the windows of the sky were stopped , the rain from the sky was restrained ,
CJB	Genesis	8	3	and the water came back from completely covering the earth . It was after
CJB	Genesis	8	150	days that the water went down .
CJB	Genesis	8	4	On the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat .
CJB	Genesis	8	5	The water kept going down until the tenth month ; on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen .
CJB	Genesis	8	6	After forty days Noach opened the window of the ark which he had built ;
CJB	Genesis	8	7	and he sent out a raven , which flew back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth .
CJB	Genesis	8	9	But the dove found no place for her feet to rest , so she returned to him in the ark , because the water still covered the whole earth . He put out his hand , took her and brought her in to him in the ark .
CJB	Genesis	8	10	He waited another seven days and again sent the dove out from the ark .
CJB	Genesis	8	11	The dove came in to him in the evening , and there in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf , so Noach knew that the water had cleared from the earth .
CJB	Genesis	8	12	He waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove , and she didn ’ t return to him any more .
CJB	Genesis	8	13	By the first day of the first month of the 601st year the water had dried up from off the earth ; so Noach removed the covering of the ark and looked ; and , yes , the surface of the ground was dry .
CJB	Genesis	8	14	It was on the twenty-seventh day of the second month that the earth was dry . ( iv )
CJB	Genesis	8	15	God said to Noach ,
CJB	Genesis	8	16	“ Go out from the ark , you , your wife , your sons and your son ’ s wives with you .
CJB	Genesis	8	17	Bring out with you every living thing you have with you — birds , livestock and every animal that creeps on the earth — so that they can swarm on the earth , be fruitful and multiply on the earth. ”
CJB	Genesis	8	18	So Noach went out with his sons , his wife and his sons ’ wives ;
CJB	Genesis	8	19	every animal , every creeping thing and every bird , whatever moves on the earth , according to their families , went out of the ark .
CJB	Genesis	8	20	Noach built an altar to Adonai . Then he took from every clean animal and every clean bird , and he offered burnt offerings on the altar .
CJB	Genesis	8	21	Adonai smelled the sweet aroma , and Adonai said in his heart , “ I will never again curse the ground because of humankind , since the imaginings of a person ’ s heart are evil from his youth ; nor will I ever again destroy all living things , as I have done .
CJB	Genesis	8	22	So long as the earth exists , sowing time and harvest , cold and heat , summer and winter , and day and night will not cease . ”
CJB	Genesis	9	9	“ As for me — I am herewith establishing my covenant with you , with your descendants after you ,
CJB	Genesis	9	2	The fear and dread of you will be upon every wild animal , every bird in the air , every creature populating the ground , and all the fish in the sea ; they have been handed over to you .
CJB	Genesis	9	3	Every moving thing that lives will be food for you ; just as I gave you green plants before , so now I give you everything —
CJB	Genesis	9	4	only flesh with its life , which is its blood , you are not to eat .
CJB	Genesis	9	5	I will certainly demand an accounting for the blood of your lives : I will demand it from every animal and from every human being . I will demand from every human being an accounting for the life of his fellow human being .
CJB	Genesis	9	6	Whoever sheds human blood , by a human being will his own blood be shed ; for God made human beings in his image .
CJB	Genesis	9	7	And you people , be fruitful , multiply , swarm on the earth and multiply on it. ” ( v )
CJB	Genesis	9	8	God spoke to Noach and his sons with him ; he said ,
CJB	Genesis	9	10	and with every living creature that is with you — the birds , the livestock and every wild animal with you , all going out of the ark , every animal on earth .
CJB	Genesis	9	11	I will establish my covenant with you that never again will all living beings be destroyed by the waters of a flood , and there will never again be a flood to destroy the earth. ”
CJB	Genesis	9	12	God added , “ Here is the sign of the covenant I am making between myself and you and every living creature with you , for all generations to come :
CJB	Genesis	9	13	I am putting my rainbow in the cloud — it will be there as a sign of the covenant between myself and the earth .
CJB	Genesis	9	14	Whenever I bring clouds over the earth , and the rainbow is seen in the cloud ;
CJB	Genesis	9	15	I will remember my covenant which is between myself and you and every living creature of any kind ; and the water will never again become a flood to destroy all living beings .
CJB	Genesis	9	16	The rainbow will be in the cloud ; so that when I look at it , I will remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of any kind on the earth. ”
CJB	Genesis	9	17	God said to Noach , “ This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between myself and every living creature on the earth. ” ( vi )
CJB	Genesis	9	18	The sons of Noach who went out from the ark were Shem , Ham and Yefet . Ham is the father of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Genesis	9	19	These three were the sons of Noach , and the whole earth was populated by them .
CJB	Genesis	9	20	Noach , a farmer , was the first to plant a vineyard .
CJB	Genesis	9	21	He drank so much of the wine that he got drunk and lay uncovered in his tent .
CJB	Genesis	9	22	Ham , the father of Kena ‘ an , saw his father shamefully exposed , went out and told his two brothers .
CJB	Genesis	9	23	Shem and Yefet took a cloak , put it over both their shoulders , and , walking backward , went in and covered their naked father . Their faces were turned away , so that they did not see their father lying there shamefully exposed .
CJB	Genesis	9	24	When Noach awoke from his wine , he knew what his youngest son had done to him .
CJB	Genesis	9	25	He said , “ Cursed be Kena ‘ an ; he will be a servant of servants to his brothers. ”
CJB	Genesis	9	26	Then he said , “ Blessed be Adonai , the God of Shem ; Kena ‘ an will be their servant .
CJB	Genesis	9	27	May God enlarge Yefet ; he will live in the tents of Shem , but Kena ‘ an will be their servant. ”
CJB	Genesis	9	28	After the flood Noach lived
CJB	Genesis	9	350	years .
CJB	Genesis	9	29	In all , Noach lived
CJB	Genesis	9	950	years ; then he died .
CJB	Genesis	10	10	His kingdom began with Bavel , Erekh , Akkad and Kalneh , in the land of Shin ‘ ar .
CJB	Genesis	10	2	The sons of Yefet were Gomer , Magog , Madai , Yavan , Tuval , Meshekh and Tiras .
CJB	Genesis	10	3	The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz , Rifat and Togarmah .
CJB	Genesis	10	4	The sons of Yavan were Elishah , Tarshish , Kittim and Dodanim .
CJB	Genesis	10	5	From these the islands of the nations were divided into their lands , each according to its language , according to their families , in their nations .
CJB	Genesis	10	6	The sons of Ham were Kush , Mitzrayim , Put and Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Genesis	10	7	The sons of Kush were S ’ va , Havilah , Savta , Ra ‘ mah and Savt ’ kha . The sons of Ra ‘ mah were Sh ’ va and D ’ dan .
CJB	Genesis	10	8	Kush fathered Nimrod , who was the first powerful ruler on earth .
CJB	Genesis	10	9	He was a mighty hunter before Adonai — this is why people say , “ Like Nimrod , a mighty hunter before Adonai. ”
CJB	Genesis	10	11	Ashur went out from that land and built Ninveh , the city Rechovot , Kelach ,
CJB	Genesis	10	12	and Resen between Ninveh and Kelach — that one is the great city .
CJB	Genesis	10	13	Mitzrayim fathered the Ludim , the ‘ Anamim , the L ’ havim , the Naftuchim ,
CJB	Genesis	10	14	the Patrusim , the Kasluchim ( from whom came the P ’ lishtim ) and the Kaftorim .
CJB	Genesis	10	15	Kena ‘ an fathered Tzidon his firstborn , Het ,
CJB	Genesis	10	16	the Y ’ vusi , the Emori , the Girgashi ,
CJB	Genesis	10	17	the Hivi , the ‘ Arki , the Sini ,
CJB	Genesis	10	18	the Arvadi , the Tz ’ mari and the Hamati . Afterwards , the families of the Kena ‘ ani were dispersed .
CJB	Genesis	10	19	The border of the Kena ‘ ani was from Tzidon , as you go toward G ’ rar , to ‘ Azah ; as you go toward S ’ dom , ‘ Amora , Admah and Tzvoyim , to Lesha .
CJB	Genesis	10	20	These were the descendants of Ham , according to their families and languages , in their lands and in their nations .
CJB	Genesis	10	21	Children were also born to Shem , ancestor of all the descendants of ‘ Ever and older brother of Yefet .
CJB	Genesis	10	22	The sons of Shem were ‘ Elam , Ashur , Arpakhshad , Lud and Aram .
CJB	Genesis	10	23	The sons of Aram were ‘ Utz , Hul , Geter and Mash .
CJB	Genesis	10	24	Arpakhshad fathered Shelach , and Shelach fathered ‘ Ever .
CJB	Genesis	10	25	To ‘ Ever were born two sons . One was given the name Peleg [ division ] , because during his lifetime the earth was divided . His brother ’ s name was Yoktan .
CJB	Genesis	10	26	Yoktan fathered Almodad , Shelef , Hatzar-Mavet , Yerach ,
CJB	Genesis	10	27	Hadoram , Uzal , Diklah ,
CJB	Genesis	10	28	‘ Oval , Avima ’ el , Sheva ,
CJB	Genesis	10	29	Ofir , Havilah and Yovav — all these were the sons of Yoktan .
CJB	Genesis	10	30	Their territory stretched from Mesha , as you go toward S ’ far , to the mountain in the east .
CJB	Genesis	10	31	These were the descendants of Shem , according to their families and languages , in their lands and in their nations .
CJB	Genesis	10	32	These were the families of the sons of Noach , according to their generations , in their nations . From these the nations of the earth were divided up after the flood .
CJB	Genesis	11	11	After Arpakhshad was born , Shem lived another
CJB	Genesis	11	2	Peter ) 2:5
CJB	Genesis	11	3	They said to one another , “ Come , let ’ s make bricks and bake them in the fire. ” So they had bricks for building-stone and clay for mortar .
CJB	Genesis	11	4	Then they said , “ Come , let ’ s build ourselves a city with a tower that has its top reaching up into heaven , so that we can make a name for ourselves and not be scattered all over the earth. ”
CJB	Genesis	11	5	Adonai came down to see the city and the tower the people were building .
CJB	Genesis	11	6	Adonai said , “ Look , the people are united , they all have a single language , and see what they ’ re starting to do ! At this rate , nothing they set out to accomplish will be impossible for them !
CJB	Genesis	11	7	Come , let ’ s go down and confuse their language , so that they won ’ t understand each other ’ s speech. ”
CJB	Genesis	11	8	So from there Adonai scattered them all over the earth , and they stopped building the city .
CJB	Genesis	11	9	For this reason it is called Bavel [ confusion ] — because there Adonai confused the language of the whole earth , and from there Adonai scattered them all over the earth .
CJB	Genesis	11	10	Here is the genealogy of Shem . Shem was
CJB	Genesis	11	100	years old when he fathered Arpakhshad two years after the flood .
CJB	Genesis	11	500	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	11	12	Arpakhshad lived thirty-five years and fathered Shelach .
CJB	Genesis	11	13	After Shelach was born , Arpakhshad lived another
CJB	Genesis	11	403	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	11	14	Shelach lived thirty years and fathered ‘ Ever .
CJB	Genesis	11	15	After ‘ Ever was born , Shelach lived another
CJB	Genesis	11	16	‘ Ever lived thirty-four years and fathered Peleg .
CJB	Genesis	11	17	After Peleg was born , ‘ Ever lived another
CJB	Genesis	11	430	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	11	18	Peleg lived thirty years and fathered Re ‘ u .
CJB	Genesis	11	19	After Re ‘ u was born , Peleg lived another
CJB	Genesis	11	209	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	11	20	Re ‘ u lived thirty-two years and fathered S ’ rug .
CJB	Genesis	11	21	After S ’ rug was born , Re ‘ u lived another
CJB	Genesis	11	207	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	11	22	S ’ rug lived thirty years and fathered Nachor .
CJB	Genesis	11	23	After Nachor was born , S ’ rug lived another
CJB	Genesis	11	200	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	11	24	Nachor lived twenty-nine years and fathered Terach .
CJB	Genesis	11	25	After Terach was born , Nachor lived another
CJB	Genesis	11	119	years and had sons and daughters .
CJB	Genesis	11	26	Terach lived seventy years and fathered Avram , Nachor and Haran .
CJB	Genesis	11	27	Here is the genealogy of Terach . Terach fathered Avram , Nachor and Haran ; and Haran fathered Lot .
CJB	Genesis	11	28	Haran died before his father Terach in the land where he was born , in Ur of the Kasdim . ( Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	11	29	Then Avram and Nachor took wives for themselves . The name of Avram ’ s wife was Sarai , and the name of Nachor ’ s wife was Milkah the daughter of Haran . He was the father of Milkah and of Yiskah .
CJB	Genesis	11	30	Sarai was barren — she had no child .
CJB	Genesis	11	31	Terach took his son Avram , his son Haran ’ s son Lot , and Sarai his daughter-in-law , his son Avram ’ s wife ; and they left Ur of the Kasdim to go to the land of Kena ‘ an . But when they came to Haran , they stayed there .
CJB	Genesis	11	32	Terach lived
CJB	Genesis	11	205	years , and he died in Haran . Haftarah Noach : Yesha ‘ yahu ( Isaiah ) 54:1–55:5 ( A ) ; 54:1–10 ( S ) [ Messianic adaptation : commence the reading at 52:13 ] B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Noach : Mattityahu ( Matthew ) 24:36–44 ; Luke 17:26–37 ; Acts 2:1–16 ;
CJB	Genesis	11	1	Peter ) 3:18–22 ;
CJB	Genesis	12	12	so that when the Egyptians see you , they will say , ‘ This is his wife , ’ and kill me but keep you alive .
CJB	Genesis	12	3	I will bless those who bless you , but I will curse anyone who curses you ; and by you all the families of the earth will be blessed. ”
CJB	Genesis	12	2	I will make of you a great nation , I will bless you , and I will make your name great ; and you are to be a blessing .
CJB	Genesis	12	4	So Avram went , as Adonai had said to him , and Lot went with him . Avram was
CJB	Genesis	12	75	years old when he left Haran .
CJB	Genesis	12	5	Avram took his wife Sarai , his brother ’ s son Lot , and all their possessions which they had accumulated , as well as the people they had acquired in Haran ; then they set out for the land of Kena ‘ an and entered the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Genesis	12	6	Avram passed through the land to the place called Sh ’ khem , to the oak of Moreh . The Kena ‘ ani were then in the land .
CJB	Genesis	12	7	Adonai appeared to Avram and said , “ To your descendants I will give this land. ” So he built an altar there to Adonai , who had appeared to him .
CJB	Genesis	12	8	He left that place , went to the hill east of Beit-El and pitched his tent . With Beit-El to the west and ‘ Ai to the east , he built an altar there and called on the name of Adonai .
CJB	Genesis	12	9	Then Avram traveled on , continuing toward the Negev .
CJB	Genesis	12	10	But there was a famine in the land , so Avram went down into Egypt to stay there , because the famine in the land was severe .
CJB	Genesis	12	11	When he came close to Egypt and was about to enter , he said to Sarai his wife , “ Here now , I know that you are a good-looking woman ;
CJB	Genesis	12	13	Please say that you are my sister , so that it will go well with me for your sake , and so that I will stay alive because of you. ” ( ii )
CJB	Genesis	12	14	When Avram entered Egypt , the Egyptians did notice that the woman was very beautiful .
CJB	Genesis	12	15	Pharaoh ’ s princes saw her and commended her to Pharaoh , so the woman was taken into Pharaoh ’ s house .
CJB	Genesis	12	16	He treated Avram well for her sake , giving him sheep , cattle , male and female donkeys , male and female slaves , and camels .
CJB	Genesis	12	17	But Adonai inflicted great plagues on Pharaoh and his household because of Sarai Avram ’ s wife .
CJB	Genesis	12	18	Pharaoh called Avram and said , “ What is this that you have done to me ? Why didn ’ t you tell me that she was your wife ?
CJB	Genesis	12	19	Why did you say , ‘ She is my sister , ’ so that I took her to be my own wife ? Now therefore , here is your wife ! Take her , and go away ! ”
CJB	Genesis	12	20	So Pharaoh gave orders concerning him to his men , and they sent him on his way with his wife and everything he had .
CJB	Genesis	13	13	Now the men of S ’ dom were evil , committing great sins against Adonai .
CJB	Genesis	13	2	Avram became wealthy , with much cattle , silver and gold .
CJB	Genesis	13	3	As he went on his travels from the Negev , he came to Beit-El , to the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Beit-El and ‘ Ai ,
CJB	Genesis	13	4	where he had first built the altar ; and there Avram called on the name of Adonai . ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	13	5	Lot , who was traveling with Avram , also had flocks , herds and tents .
CJB	Genesis	13	6	But the land could not support their living together , because their possessions were too great for them to remain together .
CJB	Genesis	13	7	Moreover , quarreling arose between Avram ’ s and Lot ’ s herdsmen . The Kena ‘ ani and the P ’ rizi were then living in the land .
CJB	Genesis	13	8	Avram said to Lot , “ Please , let ’ s not have quarreling between me and you , or between my herdsmen and yours , since we ’ re kinsmen .
CJB	Genesis	13	9	Isn ’ t the whole land there in front of you ? Please separate yourself from me — if you go to the left , I will go to the right ; if you go to the right , I will go to the left. ”
CJB	Genesis	13	10	Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Yarden was well watered everywhere , before Adonai destroyed S ’ dom and ‘ Amora , like the garden of Adonai , like the land of Egypt in the direction of Tzo ‘ ar .
CJB	Genesis	13	11	So Lot chose all the plain of the Yarden for himself , and Lot traveled eastward ; thus they separated themselves from each other .
CJB	Genesis	13	12	Avram lived in the land of Kena ‘ an ; and Lot lived in the cities of the plain , setting up his tent near S ’ dom .
CJB	Genesis	13	14	Adonai said to Avram , after Lot had moved away from him , “ Look all around you from where you are , to the north , the south , the east and the west .
CJB	Genesis	13	15	All the land you see I will give to you and your descendants forever ,
CJB	Genesis	13	16	and I will make your descendants as numerous as the specks of dust on the earth — so that if a person can count the specks of dust on the earth , then your descendants can be counted .
CJB	Genesis	13	17	Get up and walk through the length and breadth of the land , because I will give it to you. ”
CJB	Genesis	13	18	Avram moved his tent and came to live by the oaks of Mamre , which are in Hevron . There he built an altar to Adonai .
CJB	Genesis	14	14	When Avram heard that his nephew had been taken captive , he led out his trained men , who had been born in his house ,
CJB	Genesis	14	2	they made war together against Bera king of S ’ dom and against Birsha king of ‘ Amora , Shin ’ av king of Admah , Shem ’ ever king of Tzvoyim , and the king of Bela ( which is the same as Tzo ‘ ar ) .
CJB	Genesis	14	3	All the latter kings joined forces in the Siddim Valley , where the Dead Sea is .
CJB	Genesis	14	4	They had served K ’ dorla ‘ omer twelve years , but in the thirteenth year they rebelled .
CJB	Genesis	14	5	In the fourteenth year K ’ dorla ‘ omer and the kings with him came and defeated the Refa ’ im in ‘ Asht ’ rot-Karnayim , the Zuzim in Ham , the Eimim in Shaveh-Kiryatayim
CJB	Genesis	14	6	and the Hori at Se ‘ ir , their mountain , all the way to Eil-Pa ’ ran by the desert .
CJB	Genesis	14	7	Next they turned back , came to ‘ Ein-Mishpat ( which is the same as Kadesh ) , and defeated all the country of the ‘ Amaleki , and also the Emori , who lived in Hatzatzon-Tamar .
CJB	Genesis	14	8	Then the kings of S ’ dom , ‘ Amora , Admah , Tzvoyim and Bela ( that is , Tzo ‘ ar ) came out and arrayed themselves for battle in the Siddim Valley
CJB	Genesis	14	9	against K ’ dorla ‘ omer king of ‘ Elam , Tid ‘ al king of Goyim , Amrafel king of Admah and Aryokh king of Elasar , four kings against the five .
CJB	Genesis	14	10	Now the Siddim Valley was full of clay pits ; and when the kings of S ’ dom and ‘ Amora fled , some fell into them ; while the rest fled to the hills .
CJB	Genesis	14	11	The victors took all the possessions of S ’ dom and ‘ Amora and all their food supply ; then they left .
CJB	Genesis	14	12	But as they left , they took Lot , Avram ’ s brother ’ s son , and his possessions ; since he was living in S ’ dom .
CJB	Genesis	14	13	Someone who had escaped came and told Avram the Hebrew , who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Emori , brother of Eshkol and brother of ‘ Aner ; all of them allies of Avram .
CJB	Genesis	14	318	of them , and went in pursuit as far as Dan .
CJB	Genesis	14	15	During the night he and his servants divided his forces against them , then attacked and pursued them all the way to Hovah , north of Dammesek .
CJB	Genesis	14	16	He recovered all the goods and brought back his nephew Lot with his goods , together with the women and the other people .
CJB	Genesis	14	17	After his return from slaughtering K ’ dorla ‘ omer and the kings with him , the king of S ’ dom went out to meet him in the Shaveh Valley , also known as the King ’ s Valley .
CJB	Genesis	14	18	Malki-Tzedek king of Shalem brought out bread and wine . He was cohen of El ‘ Elyon [ God Most High ] ,
CJB	Genesis	14	19	so he blessed him with these words : “ Blessed be Avram by El ‘ Elyon , maker of heaven of earth .
CJB	Genesis	14	20	and blessed be El ‘ Elyon , who handed your enemies over to you. ” Avram gave him a tenth of everything . ( v )
CJB	Genesis	14	21	The king of S ’ dom said to Avram , “ Give me the people , and keep the goods for yourself. ”
CJB	Genesis	14	22	But Avram answered the king of S ’ dom , “ I have raised my hand in an oath to Adonai , El ‘ Elyon , maker of heaven and earth ,
CJB	Genesis	14	23	that I will not take so much as a thread or a sandal thong of anything that is yours ; so that you won ’ t be able to say , ‘ I made Avram rich. ’
CJB	Genesis	14	24	I will take only what my troops have eaten and the share of the spoil belonging to the men who came with me — ‘ Aner , Eshkol and Mamre ; let them have their share . ”
CJB	Genesis	15	15	As for you , you will join your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age .
CJB	Genesis	15	2	Avram replied , “ Adonai , God , what good will your gifts be to me if I continue childless ; and Eli ‘ ezer from Dammesek inherits my possessions ?
CJB	Genesis	15	3	You haven ’ t given me a child , ” Avram continued , “ so someone born in my house will be my heir. ”
CJB	Genesis	15	4	But the word of Adonai came to him : “ This man will not be your heir . No , your heir will be a child from your own body. ”
CJB	Genesis	15	5	Then he brought him outside and said , “ Look up at the sky , and count the stars — if you can count them ! Your descendants will be that many ! ”
CJB	Genesis	15	6	He believed in Adonai , and he credited it to him as righteousness . ( vi )
CJB	Genesis	15	7	Then he said to him , “ I am Adonai , who brought you out from Ur-Kasdim to give you this land as your possession. ”
CJB	Genesis	15	8	He replied , “ Adonai , God , how am I to know that I will possess it ? ”
CJB	Genesis	15	9	He answered him , “ Bring me a three-year-old cow , a three-year-old female goat , a three-year-old ram , a dove and a young pigeon. ”
CJB	Genesis	15	10	He brought him all these , cut the animals in two and placed the pieces opposite each other ; but he didn ’ t cut the birds in half .
CJB	Genesis	15	11	Birds of prey swooped down on the carcasses , but Avram drove them away .
CJB	Genesis	15	12	As the sun was about to set , a deep sleep fell on Avram ; horror and great darkness came over him .
CJB	Genesis	15	13	Adonai said to Avram , “ Know this for certain : your descendants will be foreigners in a land that is not theirs . They will be slaves and held in oppression there four hundred years .
CJB	Genesis	15	14	But I will also judge that nation , the one that makes them slaves . Afterwards , they will leave with many possessions .
CJB	Genesis	15	16	Only in the fourth generation will your descendants come back here , because only then will the Emori be ripe for punishment. ”
CJB	Genesis	15	17	After the sun had set and there was thick darkness , a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch appeared , which passed between these animal parts .
CJB	Genesis	15	18	That day Adonai made a covenant with Avram : “ I have given this land to your descendants — from the Vadi of Egypt to the great river , the Euphrates River —
CJB	Genesis	15	19	the territory of the Keni , the K ’ nizi , the Kadmoni ,
CJB	Genesis	15	20	the Hitti , the P ’ rizi , the Refa ’ im ,
CJB	Genesis	15	21	the Emori , the Kena ‘ ani , the Girgashi and the Y ’ vusi . ”
CJB	Genesis	16	16	Avram was
CJB	Genesis	16	2	so Sarai said to Avram , “ Here now , Adonai has kept me from having children ; so go in and sleep with my slave-girl . Maybe I ’ ll be able to have children through her. ” Avram listened to what Sarai said .
CJB	Genesis	16	3	It was after Avram had lived ten years in the land of Kena ‘ an that Sarai Avram ’ s wife took Hagar the Egyptian , her slave-girl , and gave her to Avram her husband to be his wife .
CJB	Genesis	16	4	Avram had sexual relations with Hagar , and she conceived . But when she became aware that she was pregnant , she looked on her mistress with contempt .
CJB	Genesis	16	5	Sarai said to Avram , “ This outrage being done to me is your fault ! True , I gave my slave-girl to you to sleep with ; but when she saw that she was pregnant , she began holding me in contempt . May Adonai decide who is right — I or you ! ”
CJB	Genesis	16	6	However , Avram answered Sarai , “ Look , she ’ s your slave-girl . Deal with her as you think fit. ” Then Sarai treated her so harshly that she ran away from her .
CJB	Genesis	16	7	The angel of Adonai found her by a spring in the desert , the spring on the road to Shur ,
CJB	Genesis	16	8	and said , “ Hagar ! Sarai ’ s slave-girl ! Where have you come from , and where are you going ? ” She answered , “ I ’ m running away from my mistress Sarai. ”
CJB	Genesis	16	9	The angel of Adonai said to her , “ Go back to your mistress , and submit to her authority. ”
CJB	Genesis	16	10	The angel of Adonai said to her , “ I will greatly increase your descendants ; there will be so many that it will be impossible to count them. ”
CJB	Genesis	16	11	The angel of Adonai said to her , “ Look , you are pregnant , and you will give birth to a son . You are to call him Yishma ‘ el [ God pays attention ] because Adonai has paid attention to your misery .
CJB	Genesis	16	12	He will be a wild donkey of a man , with his hand against everyone and everyone ’ s hand against him , living his life at odds with all his kinsmen. ”
CJB	Genesis	16	13	So she named Adonai who had spoken with her El Ro ’ i [ God of seeing ] , because she said , “ Have I really seen the One who sees me [ and stayed alive ] ? ”
CJB	Genesis	16	14	This is why the well has been called Be ’ er-Lachai-Ro ’ i [ well of the one who lives and sees ] ; it lies between Kadesh and Bered .
CJB	Genesis	16	15	Hagar bore Avram a son , and Avram called the son whom Hagar had borne Yishma ‘ el .
CJB	Genesis	16	86	years old when Hagar bore Yishma ‘ el to Avram .
CJB	Genesis	17	17	At this Avraham fell on his face and laughed — he thought to himself , “ Will a child be born to a man a hundred years old ? Will Sarah give birth at ninety ? ”
CJB	Genesis	17	99	years old Adonai appeared to Avram and said to him , “ I am El Shaddai [ God Almighty ] . Walk in my presence and be pure-hearted .
CJB	Genesis	17	2	I will make my covenant between me and you , and I will increase your numbers greatly. ”
CJB	Genesis	17	3	Avram fell on his face , and God continued speaking with him :
CJB	Genesis	17	4	“ As for me , this is my covenant with you : you will be the father of many nations .
CJB	Genesis	17	5	Your name will no longer be Avram [ exalted father ] , but your name will be Avraham [ father of many ] , because I have made you the father of many nations .
CJB	Genesis	17	6	I will cause you to be very fruitful . I will make nations of you , kings will descend from you . ( vii )
CJB	Genesis	17	7	“ I am establishing my covenant between me and you , along with your descendants after you , generation after generation , as an everlasting covenant , to be God for you and for your descendants after you .
CJB	Genesis	17	8	I will give you and your descendants after you the land in which you are now foreigners , all the land of Kena ‘ an , as a permanent possession ; and I will be their God. ”
CJB	Genesis	17	9	God said to Avraham , “ As for you , you are to keep my covenant , you and your descendants after you , generation after generation .
CJB	Genesis	17	10	Here is my covenant , which you are to keep , between me and you , along with your descendants after you : every male among you is to be circumcised .
CJB	Genesis	17	11	You are to be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin ; this will be the sign of the covenant between me and you .
CJB	Genesis	17	12	Generation after generation , every male among you who is eight days old is to be circumcised , including slaves born within your household and those bought from a foreigner not descended from you .
CJB	Genesis	17	13	The slave born in your house and the person bought with your money must be circumcised ; thus my covenant will be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant .
CJB	Genesis	17	14	Any uncircumcised male who will not let himself be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin — that person will be cut off from his people , because he has broken my covenant. ”
CJB	Genesis	17	15	God said to Avraham , “ As for Sarai your wife , you are not to call her Sarai [ mockery ] ; her name is to be Sarah [ princess ] .
CJB	Genesis	17	16	I will bless her ; moreover , I will give you a son by her . Truly I will bless her : she will be a mother of nations ; kings of peoples will come from her. ”
CJB	Genesis	17	18	Avraham said to God , “ If only Yishma ‘ el could live in your presence ! ”
CJB	Genesis	17	19	God answered , “ No , but Sarah your wife will bear you a son , and you are to call him Yitz ’ chak [ laughter ] . I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him .
CJB	Genesis	17	20	But as for Yishma ‘ el , I have heard you . I have blessed him . I will make him fruitful and give him many descendants . He will father twelve princes , and I will make him a great nation .
CJB	Genesis	17	21	But I will establish my covenant with Yitz ’ chak , whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year. ”
CJB	Genesis	17	22	With that , God finished speaking with Avraham and went up from him .
CJB	Genesis	17	23	Avraham took Yishma ‘ el his son , all the slaves born in his house and all who had been bought with his money , every male among the people in Avraham ’ s household , and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin that very day , just as God had said to him . ( Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	17	24	Avraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin ,
CJB	Genesis	17	25	and Yishma ‘ el his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
CJB	Genesis	17	26	Avraham and Yishma ‘ el his son were circumcised on the same day ;
CJB	Genesis	17	27	and all the men in his household , both slaves born in his house and those bought with money from a foreigner , were circumcised with him . Haftarah Lekh L ’ kha : Yesha ‘ yahu ( Isaiah ) 40:27–41:16 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Lekh L ’ kha : Acts 7:1–8 ; Romans 3:19–5:6 ; Galatians 3:15–18 ; 5:1–6 ; Colossians 2:11–15 ; Messianic Jews ( Hebrews ) 7:1–19 ; 11:8–12
CJB	Genesis	18	18	inasmuch as Avraham is sure to become a great and strong nation , and all the nations of the earth will be blessed by him ?
CJB	Genesis	18	4	Please let me send for some water , so that you can wash your feet ; then rest under the tree ,
CJB	Genesis	18	2	He raised his eyes and looked , and there in front of him stood three men . On seeing them , he ran from the tent door to meet them , prostrated himself on the ground ,
CJB	Genesis	18	3	and said , “ My lord , if I have found favor in your sight , please don ’ t leave your servant .
CJB	Genesis	18	5	and I will bring a piece of bread . Now that you have come to your servant , refresh yourselves before going on. ” “ Very well , ” they replied , “ do what you have said. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	6	Avraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said , “ Quickly , three measures of the best flour ! Knead it and make cakes. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	7	Avraham ran to the herd , took a good , tender calf and gave it to the servant , who hurried to prepare it .
CJB	Genesis	18	8	Then he took curds , milk and the calf which he had prepared , and set it all before the men ; and he stood by them under the tree as they ate .
CJB	Genesis	18	9	They said to him , “ Where is Sarah your wife ? ” He said , “ There , in the tent. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	10	He said , “ I will certainly return to you around this time next year , and Sarah your wife will have a son. ” Sarah heard him from the entrance of the tent , behind him .
CJB	Genesis	18	11	Avraham and Sarah were old , advanced in years ; Sarah was past the age of childbearing .
CJB	Genesis	18	12	So Sarah laughed to herself , thinking , “ I am old , and so is my lord ; am I to have pleasure again ? ”
CJB	Genesis	18	13	Adonai said to Avraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh and ask , ‘ Am I really going to bear a child when I am so old ? ’
CJB	Genesis	18	14	Is anything too hard for Adonai ? At the time set for it , at this season next year , I will return to you ; and Sarah will have a son. ” ( ii )
CJB	Genesis	18	15	Sarah denied it , saying , “ I didn ’ t either laugh , ” because she was afraid . He said , “ Not so — you did laugh. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	16	The men set out from there and looked over toward S ’ dom , and Avraham went with them to see them on their way .
CJB	Genesis	18	17	Adonai said , “ Should I hide from Avraham what I am about to do ,
CJB	Genesis	18	19	For I have made myself known to him , so that he will give orders to his children and to his household after him to keep the way of Adonai and to do what is right and just , so that Adonai may bring about for Avraham what he has promised him. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	20	Adonai said , “ The outcry against S ’ dom and ‘ Amora is so great and their sin so serious
CJB	Genesis	18	21	that I will now go down and see whether their deeds warrant the outcry that has reached me ; if not , I will know. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	22	The men turned away from there and went toward S ’ dom , but Avraham remained standing before Adonai .
CJB	Genesis	18	23	Avraham approached and said , “ Will you actually sweep away the righteous with the wicked ?
CJB	Genesis	18	24	Maybe there are fifty righteous people in the city ; will you actually sweep the place away , and not forgive it for the sake of the fifty righteous who are there ?
CJB	Genesis	18	25	Far be it from you to do such a thing — to kill the righteous along with the wicked , so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike ! Far be it from you ! Shouldn ’ t the judge of all the earth do what is just ? ”
CJB	Genesis	18	26	Adonai said , “ If I find in S ’ dom fifty who are righteous , then I will forgive the whole place for their sake. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	27	Avraham answered , “ Here now , I , who am but dust and ashes , have taken it upon myself to speak to Adonai .
CJB	Genesis	18	28	What if there are five less than fifty righteous ? ” He said , “ I won ’ t destroy it if I find forty-five there. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	29	He spoke to him yet again : “ What if forty are found there ? ” He said , “ For the sake of the forty I won ’ t do it. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	30	He said , “ I hope Adonai won ’ t be angry if I speak . What if thirty are found there ? ” He said , “ I won ’ t do it if I find thirty there. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	31	He said , “ Here now , I have taken it upon myself to speak to Adonai . What if twenty are found there ? ” He said , “ For the sake of the twenty I won ’ t destroy it. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	32	He said , “ I hope Adonai won ’ t be angry if I speak just once more . What if ten are found there ? ” He said , “ For the sake of the ten I won ’ t destroy it. ”
CJB	Genesis	18	33	Adonai went on his way as soon as he had finished speaking to Avraham , and Avraham returned to his place .
CJB	Genesis	19	19	Here , your servant has already found favor in your sight , and you have shown me even greater mercy by saving my life . But I can ’ t escape to the hills , because I ’ m afraid the disaster will overtake me , and I will die .
CJB	Genesis	19	2	He said , “ Here now , my lords , please come over to your servant ’ s house . Spend the night , wash your feet , get up early , and go on your way. ” “ No , ” they answered , “ we ’ ll stay in the square. ”
CJB	Genesis	19	3	But he kept pressing them ; so they went home with him ; and he made them a meal , baking matzah for their supper , which they ate .
CJB	Genesis	19	4	But before they could go to bed , the men of the city surrounded the house — young and old , everyone from every neighborhood of S ’ dom .
CJB	Genesis	19	5	They called Lot and said to him , “ Where are the men who came to stay with you tonight ? Bring them out to us ! We want to have sex with them ! ”
CJB	Genesis	19	6	Lot went out to them and stood in the doorway , closing the door behind him ,
CJB	Genesis	19	7	and said , “ Please , my brothers , don ’ t do such a wicked thing .
CJB	Genesis	19	8	Look here , I have two daughters who are virgins . Please , let me bring them out to you , and you can do with them what seems good to you ; but don ’ t do anything to these men , since they are guests in my house. ”
CJB	Genesis	19	9	“ Stand back ! ” they replied . “ This guy came to live here , and now he ’ s decided to play judge . For that we ’ ll deal worse with you than with them ! ” Then they crowded in on Lot , in order to get close enough to break down the door .
CJB	Genesis	19	10	But the men inside reached out their hands , brought Lot into the house to them and shut the door .
CJB	Genesis	19	11	Then they struck the men at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great , so that they couldn ’ t find the doorway .
CJB	Genesis	19	12	The men said to Lot , “ Do you have any people here besides yourself ? Whomever you have in the city — son-in-law , your sons , your daughters — bring them out of this place ;
CJB	Genesis	19	13	because we are going to destroy it . Adonai has become aware of the great outcry against them , and Adonai has sent us to destroy it. ”
CJB	Genesis	19	14	Lot went out and spoke with his sons-in-law , who had married his daughters , and said , “ Get up and leave this place , because Adonai is going to destroy the city. ” But his sons-in-law didn ’ t take him seriously .
CJB	Genesis	19	15	When morning came , the angels told Lot to hurry . “ Get up , ” they said , “ and take your wife and your two daughters who are here ; otherwise you will be swept away in the punishment of the city. ”
CJB	Genesis	19	16	But he dallied , so the men took hold of his hand , his wife ’ s hand and the hands of his two daughters — Adonai was being merciful to him — and led them , leaving them outside the city .
CJB	Genesis	19	17	When they had brought them out , he said , “ Flee for your life ! Don ’ t look behind you , and don ’ t stop anywhere in the plain , but escape to the hills ! Otherwise you will be swept away. ”
CJB	Genesis	19	18	Lot said to them , “ Please , no , my lord !
CJB	Genesis	19	20	Look , there ’ s a town nearby to flee to , and it ’ s a small one . Please let me escape there — isn ’ t it just a small one ? — and that way I will stay alive. ” ( iv )
CJB	Genesis	19	21	He replied , “ All right , I agree to what you have asked . I won ’ t overthrow the city of which you have spoken .
CJB	Genesis	19	22	Hurry , and escape to that place , because I can ’ t do anything until you arrive there. ” For this reason the city was named Tzo ‘ ar [ small ] .
CJB	Genesis	19	23	By the time Lot had come to Tzo ‘ ar , the sun had risen over the land .
CJB	Genesis	19	24	Then Adonai caused sulfur and fire to rain down upon S ’ dom and ‘ Amora from Adonai out of the sky .
CJB	Genesis	19	25	He overthrew those cities , the entire plain , all the inhabitants of the cities and everything growing in the ground .
CJB	Genesis	19	26	But his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a column of salt .
CJB	Genesis	19	27	Avraham got up early in the morning , went to the place where he had stood before Adonai ,
CJB	Genesis	19	28	and looked out toward S ’ dom and ‘ Amora , scanning the entire plain . There before him the smoke was rising from the land like smoke from a furnace !
CJB	Genesis	19	29	But when God destroyed the cities of the plain , he remembered Avraham and sent Lot out , away from the destruction , when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived .
CJB	Genesis	19	30	Lot went up from Tzo ‘ ar and lived in the hills with his two daughters , because he was afraid to stay in Tzo ‘ ar . He and his two daughters lived in a cave .
CJB	Genesis	19	31	The firstborn said to the younger , “ Our father is old , and there isn ’ t a man on earth to come in to us in the manner customary in the world .
CJB	Genesis	19	32	Come , let ’ s have our father drink wine ; then we ’ ll sleep with him , and that way we ’ ll enable our father to have descendants. ”
CJB	Genesis	19	33	So they plied their father with wine that night , and the older one went in and slept with her father ; he didn ’ t know when she lay down or when she got up .
CJB	Genesis	19	34	The following day , the older said to the younger , “ Here , I slept last night with my father . Let ’ s make him drink wine again tonight , and you go in and sleep with him , and that way we ’ ll enable our father to have descendants. ”
CJB	Genesis	19	35	They plied their father with wine that night also , and the younger one got up and slept with him , and he didn ’ t know when she lay down or when she got up .
CJB	Genesis	19	36	Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father .
CJB	Genesis	19	37	The older one gave birth to a son and called him Mo ’ av ; he is the ancestor of Mo ’ av to this day .
CJB	Genesis	19	38	The younger also gave birth to a son , and she called him Ben- ‘ Ammi ; he is the ancestor of the people of ‘ Amon to this day .
CJB	Genesis	20	20	Avraham traveled from there toward the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur . While living as an alien in G ’ rar ,
CJB	Genesis	20	2	Avraham was saying of Sarah his wife , “ She is my sister ” ; so Avimelekh king of G ’ rar sent and took Sarah .
CJB	Genesis	20	3	But God came to Avimelekh in a dream one night and said to him , “ You are about to die because of the woman you have taken , since she is someone ’ s wife. ”
CJB	Genesis	20	4	Now Avimelekh had not come near her ; so he said , “ Lord , will you kill even an upright nation ?
CJB	Genesis	20	5	Didn ’ t he himself say to me , ‘ She is my sister ’ ? And even she herself said , ‘ He is my brother. ’ In doing this , my heart has been pure and my hands innocent. ”
CJB	Genesis	20	6	God said to him in the dream , “ Yes , I know that in doing this , your heart has been pure ; and I too have kept you from sinning against me . This is why I didn ’ t let you touch her .
CJB	Genesis	20	7	Therefore , return the man ’ s wife to him now . He is a prophet , and he will pray for you , so that you will live . But if you don ’ t return her , know that you will certainly die — you and all who belong to you. ”
CJB	Genesis	20	8	Avimelekh got up early in the morning , called all his servants and told them these things ; and the men became very afraid .
CJB	Genesis	20	9	Then Avimelekh called Avraham and said to him , “ What have you done to us ? How have I sinned against you to cause you to bring on me and my kingdom a great sin ? You have done things to me that are just not done. ”
CJB	Genesis	20	10	Avimelekh went on , asking Avraham , “ Whatever could have caused you to do such a thing ? ”
CJB	Genesis	20	11	Avraham replied , “ It was because I thought , ‘ There could not possibly be any fear of God in this place , so they will kill me in order to get my wife. ’
CJB	Genesis	20	12	But she actually is also my sister , the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother , and so she became my wife .
CJB	Genesis	20	13	When God had me leave my father ’ s house , I told her , ‘ Do me this favor : wherever we go , say about me , “ He is my brother. ” ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	20	14	Avimelekh took sheep , cattle , and male and female slaves , and gave them to Avraham ; and he returned to him Sarah his wife .
CJB	Genesis	20	15	Then Avimelekh said , “ Look , my country lies before you ; live where you like. ”
CJB	Genesis	20	16	To Sarah he said , “ Here , I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver . That will allay the suspicions of everyone who is with you . Before everyone you are cleared. ”
CJB	Genesis	20	17	Avraham prayed to God , and God healed Avimelekh and his wife and slave-girls , so that they could have children .
CJB	Genesis	20	18	For Adonai had made every woman in Avimelekh ’ s household infertile on account of Sarah Avraham ’ s wife .
CJB	Genesis	21	21	He lived in the Pa ’ ran Desert , and his mother chose a wife for him from the land of Egypt . ( vi )
CJB	Genesis	21	2	Sarah conceived and bore Avraham a son in his old age , at the very time God had said to him .
CJB	Genesis	21	3	Avraham called his son , born to him , whom Sarah bore to him , Yitz ’ chak .
CJB	Genesis	21	4	Avraham circumcised his son Yitz ’ chak when he was eight days old , as God had ordered him to do . ( v )
CJB	Genesis	21	5	Avraham was one hundred years old when his son Yitz ’ chak [ laughter ] was born to him .
CJB	Genesis	21	6	Sarah said , “ God has given me good reason to laugh ; now everyone who hears about it will laugh with me. ”
CJB	Genesis	21	7	And she said , “ Who would have said to Avraham that Sarah would nurse children ? Nevertheless , I have borne him a son in his old age ! ”
CJB	Genesis	21	8	The child grew and was weaned , and Avraham gave a great banquet on the day that Yitz ’ chak was weaned .
CJB	Genesis	21	9	But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , whom Hagar had borne to Avraham , making fun of Yitz ’ chak ;
CJB	Genesis	21	10	so Sarah said to Avraham , “ Throw this slave-girl out ! And her son ! I will not have this slave-girl ’ s son as your heir along with my son Yitz ’ chak ! ”
CJB	Genesis	21	11	Avraham became very distressed over this matter of his son .
CJB	Genesis	21	12	But God said to Avraham , “ Don ’ t be distressed because of the boy and your slave-girl . Listen to everything Sarah says to you , because it is your descendants through Yitz ’ chak who will be counted .
CJB	Genesis	21	13	But I will also make a nation from the son of the slave-girl , since he is descended from you. ”
CJB	Genesis	21	14	Avraham got up early in the morning , took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child ; then he sent her away . After leaving , she wandered in the desert around Be ’ er-Sheva .
CJB	Genesis	21	15	When the water in the skin was gone , she left the child under a bush ,
CJB	Genesis	21	16	and went and sat down , looking the other way , about a bow-shot ’ s distance from him ; because she said , “ I can ’ t bear to watch my child die. ” So she sat there , looking the other way , crying out and weeping .
CJB	Genesis	21	17	God heard the boy ’ s voice , and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her , “ What ’ s wrong with you , Hagar ? Don ’ t be afraid , because God has heard the voice of the boy in his present situation .
CJB	Genesis	21	18	Get up , lift the boy up , and hold him tightly in your hand , because I am going to make him a great nation. ”
CJB	Genesis	21	19	Then God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water . So she went , filled the skin with water and gave the boy water to drink .
CJB	Genesis	21	20	God was with the boy , and he grew . He lived in the desert and became an archer .
CJB	Genesis	21	22	At that time Avimelekh and Pikhol the commander of his army spoke to Avraham . They said , “ God is with you in everything you do .
CJB	Genesis	21	23	Therefore , swear to me here by God that you will never deal falsely with me or with my son or grandson ; but according to the kindness with which I have treated you , you will treat me and the land in which you have lived as a foreigner .
CJB	Genesis	21	24	Avraham said , “ I swear it. ”
CJB	Genesis	21	25	Now Avraham had complained to Avimelekh about a well which Avimelekh ’ s servants had seized .
CJB	Genesis	21	26	Avimelekh answered , “ I don ’ t know who has done this . You didn ’ t tell me , and I heard about it only today. ”
CJB	Genesis	21	27	Avraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Avimelekh , and the two of them made a covenant .
CJB	Genesis	21	28	Avraham put seven female lambs from the flock by themselves .
CJB	Genesis	21	29	Avimelekh asked Avraham , “ What is the meaning of these seven female lambs you have put by themselves ? ”
CJB	Genesis	21	30	He answered , “ You are to accept these seven female lambs from me as witness that I dug this well. ”
CJB	Genesis	21	31	This is why that place was called Be ’ er-Sheva [ well of seven , well of an oath ] — because they both swore an oath there .
CJB	Genesis	21	32	When they made the covenant at Be ’ er-Sheva , Avimelekh departed with Pikhol the commander of his army and returned to the land of the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	Genesis	21	33	Avraham planted a tamarisk tree in Be ’ er-Sheva , and there he called on the name of Adonai , the everlasting God .
CJB	Genesis	21	34	Avraham lived for a long time as a foreigner in the land of the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	Genesis	22	22	Kesed , Hazo , Pildash , Yidlaf and B ’ tu ’ el .
CJB	Genesis	22	2	Peter ) 2:4–10
CJB	Genesis	22	3	Avraham got up early in the morning , saddled his donkey , and took two of his young men with him , together with Yitz ’ chak his son . He cut the wood for the burnt offering , departed and went toward the place God had told him about .
CJB	Genesis	22	4	On the third day , Avraham raised his eyes and saw the place in the distance .
CJB	Genesis	22	5	Avraham said to his young men , “ Stay here with the donkey . I and the boy will go there , worship and return to you. ”
CJB	Genesis	22	6	Avraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on Yitz ’ chak his son . Then he took in his hand the fire and the knife , and they both went on together .
CJB	Genesis	22	7	Yitz ’ chak spoke to Avraham his father : “ My father ? ” He answered , “ Here I am , my son. ” He said , “ I see the fire and the wood , but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ? ”
CJB	Genesis	22	8	Avraham replied , “ God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering , my son ” ; and they both went on together .
CJB	Genesis	22	9	; Galatians 4:21–31 ; Messianic Jews ( Hebrews ) 6:13–20 ; 11:13–19 ; Ya ‘ akov ( James ) 2:14–24 ;
CJB	Genesis	22	10	Then Avraham put out his hand and took the knife to kill his son .
CJB	Genesis	22	11	But the angel of Adonai called to him out of heaven : “ Avraham ? Avraham ! ” He answered , “ Here I am. ”
CJB	Genesis	22	12	He said , “ Don ’ t lay your hand on the boy ! Don ’ t do anything to him ! For now I know that you are a man who fears God , because you have not withheld your son , your only son , from me. ”
CJB	Genesis	22	13	Avraham raised his eyes and looked , and there behind him was a ram caught in the bushes by its horns . Avraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son .
CJB	Genesis	22	14	Avraham called the place Adonai Yir ’ eh [ Adonai will see ( to it ) , Adonai provides ] — as it is said to this day , “ On the mountain Adonai is seen. ”
CJB	Genesis	22	15	The angel of Adonai called to Avraham a second time out of heaven .
CJB	Genesis	22	16	He said , “ I have sworn by myself — says Adonai — that because you have done this , because you haven ’ t withheld your son , your only son ,
CJB	Genesis	22	17	I will most certainly bless you ; and I will most certainly increase your descendants to as many as there are stars in the sky or grains of sand on the seashore . Your descendants will possess the cities of their enemies ,
CJB	Genesis	22	18	and by your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed — because you obeyed my order. ”
CJB	Genesis	22	19	So Avraham returned to his young men . They got up and went together to Be ’ er-Sheva , and Avraham settled in Be ’ er-Sheva . ( Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	22	20	Afterwards , Avraham was told , “ Milkah too has borne children , to your brother Nachor —
CJB	Genesis	22	21	‘ Utz his firstborn , Buz his brother , K ’ mu ’ el the father of Aram ,
CJB	Genesis	22	23	B ’ tu ’ el fathered Rivkah . These eight Milkah bore to Nachor Avraham ’ s brother .
CJB	Genesis	22	24	His concubine , whose name was Re ’ umah , bore children also : Tevach , Gacham , Tachash and Ma ‘ akhah . Haftarah Vayera : M ’ lakhim Bet (
CJB	Genesis	23	23	Sarah lived to be
CJB	Genesis	23	5	The sons of Het answered Avraham ,
CJB	Genesis	23	127	years old ; these were the years of Sarah ’ s life .
CJB	Genesis	23	2	Sarah died in Kiryat-Arba , also known as Hevron , in the land of Kena ‘ an ; and Avraham came to mourn Sarah and weep for her .
CJB	Genesis	23	3	Then he got up from his dead one and said to the sons of Het ,
CJB	Genesis	23	4	“ I am a foreigner living as an alien with you ; let me have a burial site with you , so that I can bury my dead wife. ”
CJB	Genesis	23	6	“ Listen to us , my lord . You are a prince of God among us , so choose any of our tombs to bury your dead — not one of us would refuse you his tomb for burying your dead. ”
CJB	Genesis	23	7	Avraham got up , bowed before the people of the land , the sons of Het ,
CJB	Genesis	23	8	and spoke with them . “ If it is your desire to help me bury my dead , then listen to me : ask ‘ Efron the son of Tzochar
CJB	Genesis	23	9	to give me the cave of Makhpelah , which he owns , the one at the end of his field . He should sell it to me in your presence at its full value ; then I will have a burial site of my own. ”
CJB	Genesis	23	10	‘ Efron the Hitti was sitting among the sons of Het , and he gave Avraham his answer in the presence of the sons of Het who belonged to the ruling council of the city :
CJB	Genesis	23	11	“ No , my lord , listen to me : I ’ m giving you the field , with its cave — I ’ m giving it to you . In the presence of my people I give it to you. ”
CJB	Genesis	23	12	Avraham bowed before the people of the land
CJB	Genesis	23	13	and spoke to ‘ Efron in their hearing : “ Please be good enough to listen to me . I will pay the price of the field ; accept it from me , and I will bury my dead there. ”
CJB	Genesis	23	14	But ‘ Efron answered Avraham ,
CJB	Genesis	23	15	“ My lord , listen to me . A plot of land worth
CJB	Genesis	23	400	silver shekels of the weight accepted among merchants [ ten pounds ] . ( ii )
CJB	Genesis	23	16	Avraham got the point of what ‘ Efron had said , so he weighed out for ‘ Efron the amount of money he had specified in the presence of the sons of Het ,
CJB	Genesis	23	17	Thus the field of ‘ Efron in Makhpelah , which is by Mamre — the field , its cave and all the trees in and around it — were deeded
CJB	Genesis	23	18	to Avraham as his possession in the presence of the sons of Het who belonged to the ruling council of the city .
CJB	Genesis	23	19	Then Avraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Makhpelah , by Mamre , also known as Hevron , in the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Genesis	23	20	The field and its cave had been purchased by Avraham from the sons of Het as a burial-site which would belong to him .
CJB	Genesis	24	24	She answered , “ I am the daughter of B ’ tu ’ el the son Milkah bore to Nachor , ”
CJB	Genesis	24	2	Avraham said to the servant who had served him the longest , who was in charge of all he owned , “ Put your hand under my thigh ;
CJB	Genesis	24	3	because I want you to swear by Adonai , God of heaven and God of the earth , that you will not choose a wife for my son from among the women of the Kena ‘ ani , among whom I am living ;
CJB	Genesis	24	4	but that you will go to my homeland , to my kinsmen , to choose a wife for my son Yitz ’ chak. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	5	The servant replied , “ Suppose the woman isn ’ t willing to follow me to this land . Must I then bring your son back to the land from which you came ? ”
CJB	Genesis	24	6	Avraham said to him , “ See to it that you don ’ t bring my son back there .
CJB	Genesis	24	7	Adonai , the God of heaven — who took me away from my father ’ s house and away from the land I was born in , who spoke to me and swore to me , ‘ I will give this land to your descendants ’ — he will send his angel ahead of you ; and you are to bring a wife for my son from there .
CJB	Genesis	24	8	But if the woman is unwilling to follow you , then you are released from your obligation under my oath . Just don ’ t bring my son back there. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	9	The servant put his hand under the thigh of Avraham his master and swore to him concerning the matter . ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	24	10	Then the servant took ten of his master ’ s camels and all kinds of gifts from his master , got up and went to Aram-Naharayim , to Nachor ’ s city .
CJB	Genesis	24	11	Toward evening , when the women go out to draw water , he had the camels kneel down outside the city by the well .
CJB	Genesis	24	12	He said , “ Adonai , God of my master Avraham , please let me succeed today ; and show your grace to my master Avraham .
CJB	Genesis	24	13	Here I am , standing by the spring , as the daughters of the townsfolk come out to draw water .
CJB	Genesis	24	14	I will say to one of the girls , ‘ Please lower your jug , so that I can drink. ’ If she answers , ‘ Yes , drink ; and I will water your camels as well , ’ then let her be the one you intend for your servant Yitz ’ chak . This is how I will know that you have shown grace to my master. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	15	Before he had finished speaking , Rivkah the daughter of B ’ tu ’ el son of Milkah the wife of Nachor Avraham ’ s brother , came out with her jug on her shoulder .
CJB	Genesis	24	16	The girl was very beautiful , a virgin , never having had sexual relations with any man . She went down to the spring , filled her jug and came up .
CJB	Genesis	24	17	The servant ran to meet her and said , “ Please give me a sip of water from your jug to drink. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	18	“ Drink , my lord , ” she replied , and immediately lowered her jug onto her arm and let him drink .
CJB	Genesis	24	19	When she was through letting him drink , she said , “ I will also draw water for your camels until they have drunk their fill. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	20	She quickly emptied her jug into the trough , then ran again to the well to draw water , and kept on drawing water for all his camels .
CJB	Genesis	24	21	The man gazed at her in silence , waiting to find out whether Adonai had made his trip successful or not .
CJB	Genesis	24	22	When the camels were done drinking , the man took a gold nose-ring weighing one-fifth of an ounce and two gold bracelets weighing four ounces
CJB	Genesis	24	23	and asked , “ Whose daughter are you ? Tell me , please . Is there room in your father ’ s house for us to spend the night ? ”
CJB	Genesis	24	25	adding , “ We have plenty of straw and fodder , and room for staying overnight. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	26	The man bowed his head and prostrated himself before Adonai . ( iv )
CJB	Genesis	24	27	Then he said , “ Blessed be Adonai , God of my master Avraham , who has not abandoned his faithful love for my master ; because Adonai has guided me to the house of my master ’ s kinsmen. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	28	The girl ran off and told her mother ’ s household what had happened . 29-30 Rivkah had a brother named Lavan . When he saw the nose-ring , and the bracelets on his sister ’ s wrists besides , and when he heard his sister Rivkah ’ s report of what the man had said to her , he ran out to the spring and found the man standing there by the camels .
CJB	Genesis	24	31	“ Come on in , ” he said , “ you whom Adonai has blessed ! Why are you standing outside when I have made room in the house and prepared a place for the camels ? ”
CJB	Genesis	24	32	So the man went inside , and while the camels were being unloaded and provided straw and fodder , water was brought for him to wash his feet and the feet of the men with him .
CJB	Genesis	24	33	But when a meal was set before him , he said , “ I won ’ t eat until I say what I have to say. ” Lavan said , “ Speak. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	34	He said , “ I am Avraham ’ s servant .
CJB	Genesis	24	35	Adonai has greatly blessed my master , so that he has grown wealthy . He has given him flocks and herds , silver and gold , male and female slaves , camels and donkeys .
CJB	Genesis	24	36	Sarah my master ’ s wife bore my master a son when she was old , and he has given him everything he has .
CJB	Genesis	24	37	My master made me swear , saying , ‘ You are not to choose a wife for my son from among the women of the Kena ‘ ani , among whom I am living ;
CJB	Genesis	24	38	rather , you are to go to my father ’ s house , to my kinsmen , to choose a wife for my son. ’
CJB	Genesis	24	39	I said to my master , ‘ Suppose the woman isn ’ t willing to follow me. ’
CJB	Genesis	24	40	Avraham answered me , ‘ Adonai , in whose presence I live , will send his angel with you to make your trip successful ; and you are to pick a wife for my son from my kinsmen in my father ’ s house ;
CJB	Genesis	24	41	this will release you from your obligation under my oath . But if , when you come to my kinsmen , they refuse to give her to you , this too will release you from my oath. ’
CJB	Genesis	24	42	“ So today , I came to the spring and said , ‘ Adonai , God of my master Avraham , if you are causing my trip to succeed in its purpose ,
CJB	Genesis	24	43	then , here I am , standing by the spring . I will say to one of the girls coming out to draw water , “ Let me have a sip of water from your jug. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	44	If she answers , “ Yes , drink ; and I will water your camels as well , ” then let her be the woman you intend for my master ’ s son. ’
CJB	Genesis	24	45	And even before I had finished speaking to my heart , there came Rivkah , going out with her jug on her shoulder ; she went down to the spring and drew water . When I said to her , ‘ Please let me have a drink , ’
CJB	Genesis	24	46	she immediately lowered the jug from her shoulder and said , ‘ Drink , and I will water your camels as well. ’ So I drank , and she had the camels drink too .
CJB	Genesis	24	47	“ I asked her , ‘ Whose daughter are you ? ’ and she answered , ‘ The daughter of B ’ tu ’ el son of Nachor , whom Milkah bore to him. ’ Then I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists ,
CJB	Genesis	24	48	bowed my head , prostrated myself before Adonai and blessed Adonai , God of my master Avraham , for having led me in the right way to obtain my master ’ s brother ’ s [ grand ] daughter for his son .
CJB	Genesis	24	49	“ So now if you people intend to show grace and truth to my master , tell me . But if not , tell me , so that I can turn elsewhere. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	50	Lavan and B ’ tu ’ el replied , “ Since this comes from Adonai , we can ’ t say anything to you either bad or good .
CJB	Genesis	24	51	Rivkah is here in front of you ; take her and go . Let her be your master ’ s son ’ s wife , as Adonai has said. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	52	When Avraham ’ s servant heard what they said , he prostrated himself on the ground to Adonai . ( v )
CJB	Genesis	24	53	Then the servant brought out silver and gold jewelry , together with clothing , and gave them to Rivkah . He also gave valuable gifts to her brother and mother .
CJB	Genesis	24	54	He and his men then ate and drank and stayed the night . In the morning they got up ; and he said , “ Send me off to my master. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	55	Her brother and mother said , “ Let the girl stay with us a few days , at least ten . After that , she will go. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	56	He answered them , “ Don ’ t delay me , since Adonai has made my trip successful , but let me go back to my master. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	57	They said , “ We will call the girl and see what she says. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	58	They called Rivkah and asked her , “ Will you go with this man ? ” and she replied , “ I will. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	59	So they sent their sister Rivkah away , with her nurse , Avraham ’ s servant and his men .
CJB	Genesis	24	60	They blessed Rivkah with these words : “ Our sister , may you be the mother of millions , and may your descendants possess the cities of those who hate them. ”
CJB	Genesis	24	61	Then Rivkah and her maids mounted the camels and followed the man . So the servant took Rivkah and went on his way .
CJB	Genesis	24	62	Meanwhile , Yitz ’ chak , one evening after coming along the road from Be ’ er-Lachai-Ro ’ i — he was living in the Negev —
CJB	Genesis	24	63	went out walking in the field ; and as he looked up , he saw camels approaching .
CJB	Genesis	24	64	Rivkah too looked up ; and when she saw Yitz ’ chak , she quickly dismounted the camel .
CJB	Genesis	24	65	She said to the servant , “ Who is this man walking in the field to meet us ? ” When the servant replied , “ It ’ s my master , ” she took her veil and covered herself .
CJB	Genesis	24	66	The servant told Yitz ’ chak everything he had done .
CJB	Genesis	24	67	Then Yitz ’ chak brought her into his mother Sarah ’ s tent and took Rivkah , and she became his wife , and he loved her . Thus was Yitz ’ chak comforted for the loss of his mother .
CJB	Genesis	25	25	The first to come out was reddish and covered all over with hair , like a coat ; so they named him ‘ Esav [ completely formed , that is , having hair already ] .
CJB	Genesis	25	2	She bore him Zimran , Yokshan , Medan , Midyan , Yishbak ; and Shuach .
CJB	Genesis	25	3	Yokshan fathered Sh ’ va and D ’ dan . The sons of D ’ dan were Ashurim , L ’ tushim and L ’ umim .
CJB	Genesis	25	4	The sons of Midyan were ‘ Eifah , ‘ Efer , Hanokh , Avida and Elda ‘ ah . All these were descendants of K ’ turah .
CJB	Genesis	25	5	Avraham gave everything he owned to Yitz ’ chak .
CJB	Genesis	25	6	: Tol ’ dot ( History ) 25:19–28:9
CJB	Genesis	25	7	This is how long Avraham lived :
CJB	Genesis	25	175	years .
CJB	Genesis	25	8	Then Avraham breathed his last , dying at a ripe old age , an old man full of years ; and he was gathered to his people .
CJB	Genesis	25	9	Yitz ’ chak and Yishma ‘ el his sons buried him in the cave of Makhpelah , in the field of ‘ Efron the son of Tzochar the Hitti , by Mamre ,
CJB	Genesis	25	10	the field which Avraham purchased from the sons of Het . Avraham was buried there with Sarah his wife .
CJB	Genesis	25	11	After Avraham died , God blessed Yitz ’ chak his son , and Yitz ’ chak lived near Be ’ er-Lachai-Ro ’ i . ( vii )
CJB	Genesis	25	12	Here is the genealogy of Yishma ‘ el , Avraham ’ s son , whom Hagar the Egyptian woman bore to Avraham .
CJB	Genesis	25	13	These are the names of the sons of Yishma ‘ el , listed in the order of their birth . The firstborn of Yishma ‘ el was N ’ vayot ; followed by Kedar , Adbe ’ el , Mivsam ,
CJB	Genesis	25	14	Mishma , Dumah , Massa ,
CJB	Genesis	25	15	Hadad , Teima , Y ’ tur , Nafish and Kedmah . ( Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	25	16	These are the sons of Yishma ‘ el , and these are their names , according to their settlements and camps , twelve tribal rulers .
CJB	Genesis	25	17	This is how long Yishma ‘ el lived :
CJB	Genesis	25	137	years . Then he breathed his last , died and was gathered to his people .
CJB	Genesis	25	18	Yishma ‘ el ’ s sons lived between Havilah and Shur , near Egypt as you go toward Ashur ; he settled near all his kinsmen . Haftarah Hayyei-Sarah : M ’ lakhim Alef (
CJB	Genesis	25	1	Kings ) 1:1–31 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Hayyei-Sarah : Mattityahu ( Matthew ) 8:19–22 ; 27:3–10 ; Luke 9:57–62 Parashah
CJB	Genesis	25	19	Here is the history of Yitz ’ chak , Avraham ’ s son . Avraham fathered Yitz ’ chak .
CJB	Genesis	25	20	Yitz ’ chak was forty years old when he took Rivkah , the daughter of B ’ tu ’ el the Arami from Paddan-Aram and sister of Lavan the Arami , to be his wife .
CJB	Genesis	25	21	Yitz ’ chak prayed to Adonai on behalf of his wife , because she was childless . Adonai heeded his prayer , and Rivkah became pregnant .
CJB	Genesis	25	22	The children fought with each other inside her so much that she said , “ If it ’ s going to be like this , why go on living ? ” So she went to inquire of Adonai ,
CJB	Genesis	25	23	who answered her , “ There are two nations in your womb . From birth they will be two rival peoples . One of these peoples will be stronger than the other , and the older will serve the younger. ”
CJB	Genesis	25	24	When the time for her delivery came , there were twins in her womb .
CJB	Genesis	25	26	Then his brother emerged , with his hand holding ‘ Esav ’ s heel , so he was called Ya ‘ akov [ he catches by the heel , he supplants ] . Yitz ’ chak was sixty years old when she bore them .
CJB	Genesis	25	27	The boys grew ; and ‘ Esav became a skillful hunter , an outdoorsman ; while Ya ‘ akov was a quiet man who stayed in the tents .
CJB	Genesis	25	28	Yitz ’ chak favored ‘ Esav , because he had a taste for game ; Rivkah favored Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Genesis	25	29	One day when Ya ‘ akov had cooked some stew , ‘ Esav came in from the open country , exhausted ,
CJB	Genesis	25	30	and said to Ya ‘ akov , “ Please ! Let me gulp down some of that red stuff — that red stuff ! I ’ m exhausted ! ” ( This is why he was called Edom [ red ] . )
CJB	Genesis	25	31	Ya ‘ akov answered , “ First sell me your rights as the firstborn. ”
CJB	Genesis	25	32	“ Look , I ’ m about to die ! ” said ‘ Esav . “ What use to me are my rights as the firstborn ? ”
CJB	Genesis	25	33	Ya ‘ akov said , “ First , swear to me ! ” So he swore to him , thus selling his birthright to Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Genesis	25	34	Then Ya ‘ akov gave him bread and lentil stew ; he ate and drank , got up and went on his way . Thus ‘ Esav showed how little he valued his birthright .
CJB	Genesis	26	26	Then Avimelekh went to him from G ’ rar with his friend Achuzat and Pikhol the commander of his army .
CJB	Genesis	26	2	Adonai appeared to him and said , “ Don ’ t go down into Egypt , but live where I tell you .
CJB	Genesis	26	3	Stay in this land , and I will be with you and bless you , because I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants . I will fulfill the oath which I swore to Avraham your father —
CJB	Genesis	26	4	I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky , I will give all these lands to your descendants , and by your descendants all the nations of the earth will bless themselves .
CJB	Genesis	26	5	All this is because Avraham heeded what I said and did what I told him to do — he followed my mitzvot , my regulations and my teachings. ” ( ii )
CJB	Genesis	26	6	So Yitz ’ chak settled in G ’ rar .
CJB	Genesis	26	7	The men of the place asked him about his wife , and out of fear he said , “ She is my sister. ” He thought , “ If I tell them she ’ s my wife , they might kill me in order to take Rivkah . After all , she is a beautiful woman. ”
CJB	Genesis	26	8	But one day , after he had lived there a long time , Avimelekh king of the P ’ lishtim happened to be looking out of a window when he spotted Yitz ’ chak caressing Rivkah his wife .
CJB	Genesis	26	9	Avimelekh summoned Yitz ’ chak and said , “ So she is your wife , after all ! How come you said , ‘ She is my sister ’ ? ” Yitz ’ chak responded , “ Because I thought , ‘ I could get killed because of her. ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	26	10	Avimelekh said , “ What is this you have done to us ? One of the people could easily have slept with your wife , and you would have brought guilt on us ! ”
CJB	Genesis	26	11	Then Avimelekh warned all the people : “ Whoever touches this man or his wife will certainly be put to death. ”
CJB	Genesis	26	12	Yitz ’ chak planted crops in that land and reaped that year a hundred times as much as he had sowed . Adonai had blessed him . ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	26	13	The man became rich and prospered more and more , until he had become very wealthy indeed .
CJB	Genesis	26	14	He had flocks , cattle and a large household ; and the P ’ lishtim envied him .
CJB	Genesis	26	15	Now the P ’ lishtim had stopped up and filled with dirt all the wells his father ’ s servants had dug during the lifetime of Avraham his father .
CJB	Genesis	26	16	Avimelekh said to Yitz ’ chak , “ You must go away from us , because you have become much more powerful than we are. ”
CJB	Genesis	26	17	So Yitz ’ chak left , set up camp in Vadi G ’ rar and lived there .
CJB	Genesis	26	18	Yitz ’ chak reopened the wells which had been dug during the lifetime of Avraham his father , the ones the P ’ lishtim had stopped up after Avraham died , and called them by the names his father had used for them .
CJB	Genesis	26	19	Yitz ’ chak ’ s servants dug in the vadi and uncovered a spring of running water .
CJB	Genesis	26	20	But the herdsmen of G ’ rar quarreled with Yitz ’ chak ’ s herdsmen , claiming , “ That water is ours ! ” So he called the well ‘ Esek [ quarrel ] , because they quarreled with him .
CJB	Genesis	26	21	They dug another well and quarreled over that one too . So he called it Sitnah [ enmity ] .
CJB	Genesis	26	22	He went away from there and dug another well , and over that one they didn ’ t quarrel . So he called it Rechovot [ wide open spaces ] and said , “ Because now Adonai has made room for us , and we will be productive in the land. ” ( iv )
CJB	Genesis	26	23	From there Yitz ’ chak went up to Be ’ er-Sheva .
CJB	Genesis	26	24	Adonai appeared to him that same night and said , “ I am the God of Avraham your father . Don ’ t be afraid , because I am with you ; I will bless you and increase your descendants for the sake of my servant Avraham. ”
CJB	Genesis	26	25	There he built an altar and called on the name of Adonai . He pitched his tent there , and there Yitz ’ chak ’ s servants dug a well .
CJB	Genesis	26	27	Yitz ’ chak said to them , “ Why have you come to me , even though you were unfriendly to me and sent me away ? ”
CJB	Genesis	26	28	They answered , “ We saw very clearly that Adonai has been with you ; so we said , ‘ Let there be an oath between us : let ’ s make a pact between ourselves and you
CJB	Genesis	26	29	that you will not harm us , just as we have not caused you offense but have done you nothing but good and sent you on your way in peace . Now you are blessed by Adonai. ’ ” ( v )
CJB	Genesis	26	30	Yitz ’ chak prepared a banquet for them , and they ate and drank .
CJB	Genesis	26	31	The next morning , they got up early and swore to each other . Then Yitz ’ chak sent them on their way , and they left him peacefully .
CJB	Genesis	26	32	That very day Yitz ’ chak ’ s servants came and told him about the well they had dug , “ We have found water. ”
CJB	Genesis	26	33	So he called it Shiv ‘ ah [ oath , seven ] , and for this reason the name of the city is Be ’ er-Sheva [ well of seven , well of an oath ] to this day .
CJB	Genesis	26	34	When ‘ Esav was forty years old , he took as wives Y ’ hudit the daughter of Be ’ eri the Hitti and Basmat the daughter of Elon the Hitti .
CJB	Genesis	26	35	But they became a cause for embitterment of spirit to Yitz ’ chak and Rivkah .
CJB	Genesis	27	27	He approached and kissed him . Yitz ’ chak smelled his clothes and blessed Ya ‘ akov with these words : “ See , my son smells like a field which Adonai has blessed . ( vi )
CJB	Genesis	27	2	“ Look , I ’ m old now , I don ’ t know when I will die .
CJB	Genesis	27	3	Therefore , please take your hunting gear — your quiver of arrows and your bow ; go out in the country , and get me some game .
CJB	Genesis	27	4	Make it tasty , the way I like it ; and bring it to me to eat . Then I will bless you [ as firstborn ] , before I die. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	5	Rivkah was listening when Yitz ’ chak spoke to his son ‘ Esav . So when ‘ Esav went out to the country to hunt for game and bring it back ,
CJB	Genesis	27	6	she said to her son Ya ‘ akov , “ Listen ! I heard your father telling ‘ Esav your brother ,
CJB	Genesis	27	7	‘ Bring me game , and make it tasty , so I can eat it . Then I will give you my blessing in the presence of Adonai , before my death. ’
CJB	Genesis	27	8	Now pay attention to me , my son ; and do what I tell you .
CJB	Genesis	27	9	Go to the flock , and bring me back two choice kids . I will make it tasty for your father , the way he likes it ;
CJB	Genesis	27	10	and you will bring it to your father to eat ; so that he will give his blessing to you before his death. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	11	Ya ‘ akov answered Rivkah his mother , “ Look , ‘ Esav is hairy , but I have smooth skin .
CJB	Genesis	27	12	Suppose my father touches me — he ’ ll know I ’ m trying to trick him , and I ’ ll bring a curse on myself , not a blessing ! ”
CJB	Genesis	27	13	But his mother said , “ Let your curse be on me . Just listen to me , and go get me the kids ! ”
CJB	Genesis	27	14	So he went , got them and brought them to his mother ; and his mother prepared them in the tasty way his father loved .
CJB	Genesis	27	15	Next , Rivkah took ‘ Esav her older son ’ s best clothes , which she had with her in the house , and put them on Ya ‘ akov her younger son ;
CJB	Genesis	27	16	and she put the skins of the goats on his hands and on the smooth parts of his neck .
CJB	Genesis	27	17	Then she gave the tasty food and the bread she had prepared to her son Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Genesis	27	18	He went to his father and said , “ My father ? ” He replied , “ Here I am ; who are you , my son ? ”
CJB	Genesis	27	19	Ya ‘ akov said to his father , “ I am ‘ Esav your firstborn . I ’ ve done what you asked me to do . Get up now , sit down , eat the game , and then give me your blessing. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	20	Yitz ’ chak said to his son , “ How did you find it so quickly , my son ? ” He answered , “ Adonai your God made it happen that way. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	21	Yitz ’ chak said to Ya ‘ akov , “ Come here , close to me , so I can touch you , my son , and know whether you are in fact my son ‘ Esav or not. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	22	Ya ‘ akov approached Yitz ’ chak his father , who touched him and said , “ The voice is Ya ‘ akov ’ s voice , but the hands are ‘ Esav ’ s hands. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	23	However , he didn ’ t detect him ; because his hands were hairy like his brother ‘ Esav ’ s hands ; so he gave him his blessing .
CJB	Genesis	27	24	He asked , “ Are you really my son ‘ Esav ? ” And he replied , “ I am. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	25	He said , “ Bring it here to me , and I will eat my son ’ s game , so that I can give you my blessing. ” So he brought it up to him , and he ate ; he also brought him wine , and he drank .
CJB	Genesis	27	26	Then his father Yitz ’ chak said to him , “ Come close now , and kiss me , my son. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	28	So may God give you dew from heaven , the richness of the earth , and grain and wine in abundance .
CJB	Genesis	27	29	May peoples serve you and nations bow down to you . May you be lord over your kinsmen , let your mother ’ s descendants bow down to you . Cursed be everyone who curses you , and blessed be everyone who blesses you ! ”
CJB	Genesis	27	30	But as soon as Yitz ’ chak had finished giving his blessing to Ya ‘ akov , when Ya ‘ akov had barely left his father ’ s presence , ‘ Esav his brother came in from his hunting .
CJB	Genesis	27	31	He too had prepared a tasty meal and brought it to his father , and now he said to his father , “ Let my father get up and eat from his son ’ s game , so that you may give me your blessing. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	32	Yitz ’ chak his father said to him , “ Who are you ? ” and he answered , “ I am your son , your firstborn , ‘ Esav. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	33	Yitz ’ chak began trembling uncontrollably and said , “ Then who was it that took game and brought it to me ? I ate it all just before you came , and I gave my blessing to him . That ’ s the truth , and the blessing must stand. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	34	When ‘ Esav heard his father ’ s words he burst into loud , bitter sobbing . “ Father , bless me too , ” he begged .
CJB	Genesis	27	35	He replied , “ Your brother came deceitfully and took away your blessing. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	36	‘ Esav said , “ His name , Ya ‘ akov [ he supplants ] , really suits him — because he has supplanted me these two times : he took away my birthright , and here , now he has taken away my blessing ! ” Then he asked , “ Haven ’ t you saved a blessing for me ? ”
CJB	Genesis	27	37	Yitz ’ chak answered ‘ Esav , “ Look , I have made him your lord , I have given him all his kinsmen as servants , and I have given him grain and wine to sustain him . What else is there that I can do for you , my son ? ”
CJB	Genesis	27	38	‘ Esav said to his father , “ Have you only one blessing , my father ? Father , bless me too ! ” ‘ Esav wept aloud ,
CJB	Genesis	27	39	and Yitz ’ chak his father answered him : “ Here ! Your home will be of the richness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above .
CJB	Genesis	27	40	You will live by your sword , and you will serve your brother . But when you break loose , you will shake his yoke off your neck. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	41	‘ Esav hated his brother because of the blessing his father had given him . ‘ Esav said to himself , “ The time for mourning my father will soon come , and then I will kill my brother Ya ‘ akov. ”
CJB	Genesis	27	42	But the words of ‘ Esav her older son were told to Rivkah . She sent for Ya ‘ akov her younger son and said to him , “ Here , your brother ‘ Esav is comforting himself over you by planning to kill you .
CJB	Genesis	27	43	Therefore , my son , listen to me : get up and escape to Lavan my brother in Haran .
CJB	Genesis	27	44	Stay with him a little while , until your brother ’ s anger subsides .
CJB	Genesis	27	45	Your brother ’ s anger will turn away from you , and he will forget what you did to him . Then I ’ ll send and bring you back from there . Why should I lose both of you on the same day ? ”
CJB	Genesis	27	46	Rivkah said to Yitz ’ chak , “ I ’ m sick to death of Hitti women ! If Ya ‘ akov marries one of the Hitti women , like those who live here , my life won ’ t be worth living . ”
CJB	Genesis	28	28	So Yitz ’ chak called Ya ‘ akov , and , after blessing him , charged him : “ You are not to choose a wife from the Hitti women .
CJB	Genesis	28	2	)
CJB	Genesis	28	3	May El Shaddai bless you , make you fruitful and increase your descendants , until they become a whole assembly of peoples .
CJB	Genesis	28	4	And may he give you the blessing which he gave Avraham , you and your descendants with you , so that you will possess the land you will travel through , the land God gave to Avraham. ” ( vii )
CJB	Genesis	28	5	So Yitz ’ chak sent Ya ‘ akov away ; and he went to Paddan-Aram , to Lavan , son of B ’ tu ’ el the Arami , the brother of Rivkah Ya ‘ akov ’ s and ‘ Esav ’ s mother .
CJB	Genesis	28	6	Now ‘ Esav saw that Yitz ’ chak had blessed Ya ‘ akov and sent him away to Paddan-Aram to choose a wife from there , and that as he blessed him he charged him , “ You are not to choose a Kena ‘ ani woman as your wife , ” ( Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	28	7	: Vayetze ( He went out ) 28:10 –32:3 (
CJB	Genesis	28	8	‘ Esav also saw that the Kena ‘ ani women did not please Yitz ’ chak his father .
CJB	Genesis	28	9	So ‘ Esav went to Yishma ‘ el and took , in addition to the wives he already had , Machalat the daughter of Yishma ‘ el Avraham ’ s son , the sister of N ’ vayot , to be his wife . Haftarah Tol ’ dot : Mal ’ akhi ( Malachi ) 1:1–2:7 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Tol ’ dot : Romans 9:6–16 ; Messianic Jews ( Hebrews ) 11:20 ; 12:14–17 Parashah
CJB	Genesis	28	10	Ya ‘ akov went out from Be ’ er-Sheva and traveled toward Haran .
CJB	Genesis	28	11	He came to a certain place and stayed the night there , because the sun had set . He took a stone from the place , put it under his head and lay down there to sleep .
CJB	Genesis	28	12	He dreamt that there before him was a ladder resting on the ground with its top reaching to heaven , and the angels of Adonai were going up and down on it .
CJB	Genesis	28	13	Then suddenly Adonai was standing there next to him ; and he said , “ I am Adonai , the God of Avraham your [ grand ] father and the God of Yitz ’ chak . The land on which you are lying I will give to you and to your descendants .
CJB	Genesis	28	14	Your descendants will be as numerous as the grains of dust on the earth . You will expand to the west and to the east , to the north and to the south . By you and your descendants all the families of the earth will be blessed .
CJB	Genesis	28	15	Look , I am with you . I will guard you wherever you go , and I will bring you back into this land , because I won ’ t leave you until I have done what I have promised you. ”
CJB	Genesis	28	16	Ya ‘ akov awoke from his sleep and said , “ Truly , Adonai is in this place — and I didn ’ t know it ! ”
CJB	Genesis	28	17	Then he became afraid and said , “ This place is fearsome ! This has to be the house of God ! This is the gate of heaven ! ”
CJB	Genesis	28	18	Ya ‘ akov got up early in the morning , took the stone he had put under his head , set it up as a standing-stone , poured olive oil on its top
CJB	Genesis	28	19	and named the place Beit-El [ house of God ] ; but the town had originally been called Luz .
CJB	Genesis	28	20	Ya ‘ akov took this vow : “ If God will be with me and will guard me on this road that I am traveling , giving me bread to eat and clothes to wear ,
CJB	Genesis	28	21	so that I return to my father ’ s house in peace , then Adonai will be my God ;
CJB	Genesis	28	22	and this stone , which I have set up as a standing-stone , will be God ’ s house ; and of everything you give me , I will faithfully return one-tenth to you . ”
CJB	Genesis	29	29	Lavan also gave to his daughter Rachel his slave-girl Bilhah as her slave-girl .
CJB	Genesis	29	2	As he looked , he saw a well in a field ; and there were three flocks of sheep lying there next to it ; because they watered the sheep from that well . The stone on the well ’ s mouth was large ,
CJB	Genesis	29	3	and only when all the flocks had gathered there would they roll the stone away from the opening of the well and water the sheep . Then they would put the stone back in its place on the well ’ s opening .
CJB	Genesis	29	4	Ya ‘ akov said to them , “ My brothers , where are you from ? ” They answered , “ We ’ re from Haran. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	5	He asked them , “ Do you know Lavan the [ grand ] son of Nachor ? ” They said , “ We do. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	6	He asked them , “ Are things going well with him ? ” “ Yes , ” they answered , “ and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	7	He said , “ Look , there ’ s still plenty of daylight left ; and it isn ’ t time to bring the animals home ; so water the sheep ; then go , and put them out to pasture. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	8	They answered , “ We can ’ t , not until all the flocks have been gathered together , and they roll the stone away from the opening of the well . That ’ s when we water the sheep. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	9	While he was still speaking with them , Rachel came with her father ’ s sheep , because she took care of them .
CJB	Genesis	29	10	When Ya ‘ akov saw Rachel the daughter of Lavan his mother ’ s brother , and the sheep of Lavan his mother ’ s brother , Ya ‘ akov went up and rolled the stone away from the opening of the well and watered the flock of Lavan his mother ’ s brother .
CJB	Genesis	29	11	Ya ‘ akov kissed Rachel and wept aloud .
CJB	Genesis	29	12	Ya ‘ akov told Rachel that he was her father ’ s relative , and that he was Rivkah ’ s son ; and she ran and told her father .
CJB	Genesis	29	13	When Lavan heard the news of Ya ‘ akov his sister ’ s son , he ran to meet him , hugged him and kissed him , and brought him to his house . Ya ‘ akov told Lavan all that had happened .
CJB	Genesis	29	14	Lavan said to him , “ You are indeed my own flesh and blood. ” After Ya ‘ akov had stayed with him for a whole month ,
CJB	Genesis	29	15	Lavan said to him , “ Why should you work for me for nothing , just because you are my relative ? Tell me how much I should pay you. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	16	Now Lavan had two daughters ; the name of the older was Le ’ ah , and the name of the younger was Rachel .
CJB	Genesis	29	17	Le ’ ah ’ s eyes were weak ; but Rachel was good-looking , with beautiful features . ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	29	18	Ya ‘ akov had fallen in love with Rachel and said , “ I will work for you seven years in exchange for Rachel your younger daughter. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	19	Lavan answered , “ Better that I give her to you than to someone else ; stay with me. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	20	So Ya ‘ akov worked seven years for Rachel , and it seemed only a few days to him , because he was so much in love with her .
CJB	Genesis	29	21	Ya ‘ akov said to Lavan , “ Give me my wife , since my time is finished , so that I can start living with her. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	22	Lavan gathered all the men of the place and gave a banquet .
CJB	Genesis	29	23	In the evening he took Le ’ ah his daughter and brought her to Ya ‘ akov , and he went in and slept with her .
CJB	Genesis	29	24	Lavan also gave his slave-girl Zilpah to his daughter Le ’ ah as her slave-girl .
CJB	Genesis	29	25	In the morning Ya ‘ akov saw that he was with Le ’ ah , and he said to Lavan , “ What kind of thing is this that you ’ ve done to me ? Didn ’ t I work for you for Rachel ? Why have you deceived me ? ”
CJB	Genesis	29	26	Lavan answered , “ In our place that isn ’ t how it ’ s done , to give the younger daughter before the firstborn .
CJB	Genesis	29	27	Finish the marriage week of this one , and we ’ ll give you the other one also in exchange for the work you will do for me during yet another seven years. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	28	Ya ‘ akov agreed to this , so he finished her week , and Lavan gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife .
CJB	Genesis	29	30	So not only did Ya ‘ akov go in and sleep with Rachel , but he also loved Rachel more than Le ’ ah . Then he served Lavan another seven years .
CJB	Genesis	29	31	Adonai saw that Le ’ ah was unloved , so he made her fertile , while Rachel remained childless .
CJB	Genesis	29	32	Le ’ ah conceived and gave birth to a son , whom she named Re ’ uven [ see , a son ! ] , for she said , “ It is because Adonai has seen how humiliated I have been , but now my husband will love me. ”
CJB	Genesis	29	33	She conceived again , gave birth to a son and said , “ It is because Adonai has heard that I am unloved ; therefore he has given me this son also. ” So she named him Shim ‘ on [ hearing ] .
CJB	Genesis	29	34	Once more she conceived and had a son ; and she said , “ Now this time my husband will be joined to me , because I have borne him three sons. ” Therefore she named him Levi [ joining ] .
CJB	Genesis	29	35	She conceived yet again , had a son and said , “ This time I will praise Adonai ” ; therefore she named him Y ’ hudah [ praise ] . Then she stopped having children .
CJB	Genesis	30	30	The few you had before I came have increased substantially ; Adonai has blessed you wherever I went . But now , when will I provide for my own household ? ”
CJB	Genesis	30	2	This made Ya ‘ akov angry at Rachel ; he answered , “ Am I in God ’ s place ? He ’ s the one who is denying you children. ”
CJB	Genesis	30	3	She said , “ Here is my maid Bilhah . Go , sleep with her , and let her give birth to a child that will be laid on my knees , so that through her I too can build a family. ”
CJB	Genesis	30	4	So she gave him Bilhah her slave-girl as his wife , and Ya ‘ akov went in and slept with her .
CJB	Genesis	30	5	Bilhah conceived and bore Ya ‘ akov a son .
CJB	Genesis	30	6	Rachel said , “ God has judged in my favor ; indeed he has heard me and given me a son. ” Therefore she called him Dan [ he judged ] .
CJB	Genesis	30	7	Bilhah Rachel ’ s slave-girl conceived again and bore Ya ‘ akov a second son .
CJB	Genesis	30	8	Rachel said , “ I have wrestled mightily with my sister and won , ” and called him Naftali [ my wrestling ] .
CJB	Genesis	30	9	When Le ’ ah saw that she had stopped having children , she took Zilpah her slave-girl and gave her to Ya ‘ akov as his wife .
CJB	Genesis	30	10	Zilpah Le ’ ah ’ s slave-girl bore Ya ‘ akov a son ;
CJB	Genesis	30	11	and Le ’ ah said , “ Good fortune has come , ” calling him Gad [ good fortune ] .
CJB	Genesis	30	12	Zilpah Le ’ ah ’ s slave-girl bore Ya ‘ akov a second son ;
CJB	Genesis	30	13	and Le ’ ah said , “ How happy I am ! Women will say I am happy ! ” and called him Asher [ happy ] . ( iv )
CJB	Genesis	30	14	During the wheat harvest season Re ’ uven went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Le ’ ah . Rachel said to Le ’ ah , “ Please give me some of your son ’ s mandrakes [ so that I can be fertile ] . ”
CJB	Genesis	30	15	She answered , “ Isn ’ t it enough that you have taken away my husband ? Do you have to take my son ’ s mandrakes too ? ” Rachel said , “ Very well ; in exchange for your son ’ s mandrakes , sleep with him tonight. ”
CJB	Genesis	30	16	When Ya ‘ akov came in from the field in the evening , Le ’ ah went out to meet him and said , “ You have to come and sleep with me , because I ’ ve hired you with my son ’ s mandrakes. ” So Ya ‘ akov slept with her that night .
CJB	Genesis	30	17	God listened to Le ’ ah , and she conceived and bore Ya ‘ akov a fifth son .
CJB	Genesis	30	18	Le ’ ah said , “ God has given me my hire , because I gave my slave-girl to my husband. ” So she called him Yissakhar [ hire , reward ] .
CJB	Genesis	30	19	Le ’ ah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Genesis	30	20	Le ’ ah said , “ God has given me a wonderful gift . Now at last my husband will live with me , since I have borne him six sons. ” And she called him Z ’ vulun [ living together ] .
CJB	Genesis	30	21	After this , she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah [ controversy over rights ] .
CJB	Genesis	30	22	Then God took note of Rachel , heeded her prayer and made her fertile .
CJB	Genesis	30	23	She conceived , had a son and said , “ God has taken away my disgrace. ”
CJB	Genesis	30	24	She called him Yosef [ may he add ] , saying , “ May Adonai add to me another son. ”
CJB	Genesis	30	25	After Rachel had given birth to Yosef , Ya ‘ akov said to Lavan , “ Send me on my way , so that I can return to my own place , to my own country .
CJB	Genesis	30	26	Let me take my wives , for whom I have served you , and my children ; and let me go . You know very well how faithfully I have served you. ”
CJB	Genesis	30	27	Lavan answered him , “ If you regard me favorably , then please listen : I have observed the signs that Adonai has blessed me on account of you . ( v )
CJB	Genesis	30	28	Name your wages , ” he said ; “ I will pay them. ”
CJB	Genesis	30	29	Ya ‘ akov replied , “ You know how faithfully I have served you and how your livestock have prospered under my care .
CJB	Genesis	30	31	Lavan said , “ What should I give you ? ” “ Nothing , ” answered Ya ‘ akov , “ just do this one thing for me : once more I will pasture your flock and take care of it .
CJB	Genesis	30	32	I will also go through the flock and pick out every speckled , spotted or brown sheep , and every speckled or spotted goat ; these and their offspring will be my wages .
CJB	Genesis	30	33	And I will let my integrity stand as witness against me in the future : when you come to look over the animals constituting my wages , every goat that isn ’ t speckled or spotted and every sheep that isn ’ t brown will count as stolen by me. ”
CJB	Genesis	30	34	Lavan replied , “ As you have said , so be it. ”
CJB	Genesis	30	35	That day Lavan removed the male goats that were streaked or spotted and all the female goats that were speckled or spotted , every one with white on it , and all the brown sheep ; turned them over to his sons ;
CJB	Genesis	30	36	and put three days ’ distance between himself and Ya ‘ akov . Ya ‘ akov fed the rest of Lavan ’ s flocks .
CJB	Genesis	30	37	Ya ‘ akov took fresh-cut branches from poplar , almond and plane trees and made white streaks on them by peeling off the bark .
CJB	Genesis	30	38	Then he set the rods he had peeled upright in the watering troughs , so that the animals would see them when they came to drink . And since they bred when they came to drink ,
CJB	Genesis	30	39	the animals mated in sight of the rods and gave birth to streaked , speckled and spotted young .
CJB	Genesis	30	40	Ya ‘ akov divided the lambs and had the animals mate with the streaked and the brown in the flock of Lavan . He also kept his own livestock separate and did not have them mix with Lavan ’ s flock .
CJB	Genesis	30	41	Whenever the hardier animals came into heat , Ya ‘ akov would set up the rods in the watering troughs ; so that the animals would see them and conceive in front of them ;
CJB	Genesis	30	42	but he didn ’ t set up the rods in front of the weaker animals . Thus the more feeble were Lavan ’ s and the stronger Ya ‘ akov ’ s .
CJB	Genesis	30	43	In this way the man became very rich and had large flocks , along with male and female slaves , camels and donkeys .
CJB	Genesis	31	31	Ya ‘ akov answered Lavan , “ Because I was afraid . I said , ‘ Suppose you take your daughters away from me by force ? ’
CJB	Genesis	31	2	He also saw that Lavan regarded him differently than before .
CJB	Genesis	31	3	Adonai said to Ya ‘ akov , “ Return to the land of your ancestors , to your kinsmen ; I will be with you. ”
CJB	Genesis	31	4	So Ya ‘ akov sent for Rachel and Le ’ ah and had them come to the field where his flock was .
CJB	Genesis	31	5	He said to them , “ I see by the way your father looks that he feels differently toward me than before ; but the God of my father has been with me .
CJB	Genesis	31	6	You know that I have served your father with all my strength ,
CJB	Genesis	31	7	and that your father has belittled me and has changed my wages ten times ; but God did not allow him to do me any damage .
CJB	Genesis	31	8	If he said , ‘ The speckled will be your wages , ’ then all the animals gave birth to speckled young ; and if he said , ‘ The streaked will be your wages , ’ then all the animals gave birth to streaked young .
CJB	Genesis	31	9	This is how God has taken away your father ’ s animals and given them to me .
CJB	Genesis	31	10	Once , when the animals were mating , I had a dream : I looked up and there in front of me the male goats which mated with the females were streaked , speckled and mottled .
CJB	Genesis	31	11	Then , in the dream , the angel of God said to me , ‘ Ya ‘ akov ! ’ and I replied , ‘ Here I am. ’
CJB	Genesis	31	12	He continued , ‘ Raise your eyes now , and look : all the male goats mating with the females are streaked , speckled and mottled ; for I have seen everything Lavan has been doing to you .
CJB	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Beit-El , where you anointed a standing-stone with oil , where you vowed your vow to me . Now get up , get out of this land , and return to the land where you were born. ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	31	14	Rachel and Le ’ ah answered him , “ We no longer have any inheritance from our father ’ s possessions ;
CJB	Genesis	31	15	and he considers us foreigners , since he has sold us ; moreover , he has consumed everything he received in exchange for us .
CJB	Genesis	31	16	Nevertheless , the wealth which God has taken away from our father has become ours and our children ’ s anyway ; so whatever God has told you to do , do. ” ( vi )
CJB	Genesis	31	17	Then Ya ‘ akov got up , put his sons and wives on the camels ,
CJB	Genesis	31	18	and carried off all his livestock , along with all the riches he had accumulated , the livestock in his possession which he had acquired in Paddan-Aram , to go to Yitz ’ chak his father in the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Genesis	31	19	Now Lavan had gone to shear his sheep , so Rachel stole the household idols that belonged to her father ,
CJB	Genesis	31	20	and Ya ‘ akov outwitted Lavan the Arami by not telling him of his intended flight .
CJB	Genesis	31	21	So he fled with everything he had : he departed , crossed the [ Euphrates ] River and set out for the hill-country of Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	Genesis	31	22	Not until the third day was Lavan told that Ya ‘ akov had fled .
CJB	Genesis	31	23	Lavan took his kinsmen with him and spent the next seven days pursuing Ya ‘ akov , overtaking him in the hill-country of Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	Genesis	31	24	But God came to Lavan the Arami in a dream that night and said to him , “ Be careful that you don ’ t say anything to Ya ‘ akov , either good or bad. ”
CJB	Genesis	31	25	When Lavan caught up with Ya ‘ akov , Ya ‘ akov had set up camp in the hill-country ; so Lavan and his kinsmen set up camp in the hill-country of Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	Genesis	31	26	Lavan said to Ya ‘ akov , “ What do you mean by deceiving me and carrying off my daughters as if they were captives taken in war ?
CJB	Genesis	31	27	Why did you flee in secret and deceive me and not tell me ? I would have sent you off with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and lyres .
CJB	Genesis	31	28	You didn ’ t even let me kiss my sons and daughters good-bye ! What a stupid thing to do !
CJB	Genesis	31	29	I have it in my power to do you harm ; but the God of your father spoke to me last night and said , ‘ Be careful that you don ’ t say anything to Ya ‘ akov , either good or bad. ’
CJB	Genesis	31	30	Granted that you had to leave , because you longed so deeply for your father ’ s house ; but why did you steal my gods ? ”
CJB	Genesis	31	32	But if you find your gods with someone , that person will not remain alive . So with our kinsmen to witness , if you spot anything that I have which belongs to you , take it back. ” Ya ‘ akov did not know that Rachel had stolen them .
CJB	Genesis	31	33	Lavan went into Ya ‘ akov ’ s tent , then into Le ’ ah ’ s tent and into the tent of the two slave-girls ; but he did not find them . He left Le ’ ah ’ s tent and entered Rachel ’ s tent .
CJB	Genesis	31	34	Now Rachel had taken the household gods , put them in the saddle of the camel and was sitting on them . Lavan felt all around the tent but did not find them .
CJB	Genesis	31	35	She said to her father , “ Please don ’ t be angry that I ’ m not getting up in your presence , but it ’ s the time of my period. ” So he searched , but he didn ’ t find the household gods .
CJB	Genesis	31	36	Then Ya ‘ akov became angry and started arguing with Lavan . “ What have I done wrong ? ” he demanded . “ What is my offense , that you have come after me in hot pursuit ?
CJB	Genesis	31	37	You have felt around in all my stuff , but what have you found of all your household goods ? Put it here , in front of my kinsmen and yours , so that they can render judgment between the two of us !
CJB	Genesis	31	38	I have been with you for these twenty years ! Your female sheep and goats haven ’ t aborted their young , and I haven ’ t eaten the male animals in your flocks .
CJB	Genesis	31	39	If one of your flock was destroyed by a wild animal , I didn ’ t bring the carcass to you but bore the loss myself . You demanded that I compensate you for any animal stolen , whether by day or by night .
CJB	Genesis	31	40	Here ’ s how it was for me : during the day thirst consumed me , and at night the cold — my sleep fled from my eyes .
CJB	Genesis	31	41	These twenty years I ’ ve been in your house — I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock ; and you changed my wages ten times !
CJB	Genesis	31	42	If the God of my father , the God of Avraham , the one whom Yitz ’ chak fears , had not been on my side , by now you would certainly have already sent me away with nothing ! God has seen how distressed I ’ ve been and how hard I ’ ve worked , and last night he passed judgment in my favor. ” ( vii )
CJB	Genesis	31	43	Lavan answered Ya ‘ akov , “ The daughters are mine , the children are mine , the flocks are mine , and everything you see is mine ! But what can I do today about these daughters of mine or the children they have borne ?
CJB	Genesis	31	44	So now , come , let ’ s make a covenant , I and you ; and let it stand as a testimony between me and you. ”
CJB	Genesis	31	45	Ya ‘ akov took a stone and set it upright as a standing-stone .
CJB	Genesis	31	46	Then Ya ‘ akov said to his kinsmen , “ Gather some stones ” ; and they took stones , made a pile of them and ate there by the pile of stones .
CJB	Genesis	31	47	Lavan called it Y ’ gar-Sahaduta [ “ pile of witness ” in Aramaic ] , while Ya ‘ akov called it Gal- ‘ Ed [ “ pile of witness ” in Hebrew ] .
CJB	Genesis	31	48	Lavan said , “ This pile witnesses between me and you today. ” This is why it is called Gal- ‘ Ed
CJB	Genesis	31	49	and also HaMitzpah [ the watchtower ] , because he said , “ May Adonai watch between me and you when we are apart from each other .
CJB	Genesis	31	50	If you cause pain to my daughters , or if you take wives in addition to my daughters , then , even if no one is there with us , still God is witness between me and you. ”
CJB	Genesis	31	51	Lavan also said to Ya ‘ akov , “ Here is this pile , and here is this standing-stone , which I have set up between me and you .
CJB	Genesis	31	52	May this pile be a witness , and may the standing-stone be a witness , that I will not pass beyond this pile to you , and you will not pass beyond this pile and this standing-stone to me , to cause harm .
CJB	Genesis	31	53	May the God of Avraham and also the god of Nachor , the god of their father , judge between us. ” But Ya ‘ akov swore by the One his father Yitz ’ chak feared .
CJB	Genesis	31	54	Ya ‘ akov offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his kinsmen to the meal . They ate the food and spent the whole night on the mountain .
CJB	Genesis	32	32	) This is why , to this day , the people of Isra ’ el do not eat the thigh muscle that passes along the hip socket — because the man struck Ya ‘ akov ’ s hip at its socket .
CJB	Genesis	32	2	) When Ya ‘ akov saw them , he said , “ This is God ’ s camp , ” and called that place Machanayim [ two camps ] . Haftarah Vayetze : Hoshea ( Hosea ) 12:13 (
CJB	Genesis	32	1	) Ya ‘ akov went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
CJB	Genesis	32	3	) Ya ‘ akov sent messengers ahead of him to ‘ Esav his brother toward the land of Se ‘ ir , the country of Edom ,
CJB	Genesis	32	12	) You said , ‘ I will certainly do you good and make your descendants as numerous as the grains of sand by the sea , which are so many they can ’ t be counted. ’ ” ( ii )
CJB	Genesis	32	9	) Then Ya ‘ akov said , “ God of my father Avraham and God of my father Yitz ’ chak , Adonai , who told me , ‘ Return to your country and your kinsmen , and I will do you good ’ :
CJB	Genesis	32	11	) Please ! Rescue me from my brother ‘ Esav ! I ’ m afraid of him , afraid he ’ ll come and attack me , without regard for mothers or children .
CJB	Genesis	32	8	) saying , “ If ‘ Esav comes to the one camp and attacks it , at least the camp that is left will escape. ”
CJB	Genesis	32	4	) with these instructions : “ Here is what you are to say to my lord ‘ Esav : ‘ Your servant Ya ‘ akov says , “ I have been living with Lavan and have stayed until now .
CJB	Genesis	32	5	) I have cattle , donkeys and flocks , and male and female servants . I am sending to tell this news to my lord , in order to win your favor. ” ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	32	6	) The messengers returned to Ya ‘ akov saying , “ We went to your brother ‘ Esav , and he is coming to meet you ; with him are four hundred men. ”
CJB	Genesis	32	7	) Ya ‘ akov became greatly afraid and distressed . He divided the people , flocks , cattle and camels with him into two camps ,
CJB	Genesis	32	10	) I ’ m not worthy of all the love and faithfulness you have shown your servant , since I crossed the Yarden with only my staff . But now I have become two camps .
CJB	Genesis	32	13	) He stayed there that night ; then he chose from among his possessions the following as a present for ‘ Esav his brother :
CJB	Genesis	32	14	) two hundred female goats and twenty males , two hundred female sheep and twenty males ,
CJB	Genesis	32	15	) thirty milk-camels and their colts , forty cows and ten bulls , twenty female donkeys and ten colts .
CJB	Genesis	32	16	) He turned them over to his servants , every drove by itself , and said to his servants , “ Cross over in front of me , and keep a space between each drove and the next one. ”
CJB	Genesis	32	17	) He instructed the servant in front , “ When ‘ Esav my brother meets you and asks you , ‘ Whose servant are you ? Where are you going ? And whose animals are these ? ’
CJB	Genesis	32	18	) then you are to say , ‘ They belong to your servant Ya ‘ akov , and they are a present he has sent to my lord ‘ Esav ; and Ya ‘ akov himself is just behind us. ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	32	19	) He also instructed the second servant , and the third , and all that followed the droves , “ When you encounter ‘ Esav , you are to speak to him in the same way ,
CJB	Genesis	32	20	) and you are to add , ‘ And there , just behind us , is your servant Ya ‘ akov. ’ ” For he said , “ I will appease him first with the present that goes ahead of me ; then , after that , I will see him myself — and maybe he will be friendly toward me. ”
CJB	Genesis	32	21	) So the present crossed over ahead of him , and he himself stayed that night in the camp .
CJB	Genesis	32	22	) He got up that night , took his two wives , his two slave-girls , and his eleven children , and forded the Yabok .
CJB	Genesis	32	23	) He took them and sent them across the stream , then sent his possessions across ;
CJB	Genesis	32	24	) and Ya ‘ akov was left alone . Then some man wrestled with him until daybreak .
CJB	Genesis	32	25	) When he saw that he did not defeat Ya ‘ akov , he struck Ya ‘ akov ’ s hip socket , so that his hip was dislocated while wrestling with him .
CJB	Genesis	32	26	) The man said , “ Let me go , because it ’ s daybreak. ” But Ya ‘ akov replied , “ I won ’ t let you go unless you bless me. ”
CJB	Genesis	32	27	) The man asked , “ What is your name ? ” and he answered , “ Ya ‘ akov. ”
CJB	Genesis	32	28	) Then the man said , “ From now on , you will no longer be called Ya ‘ akov , but Isra ’ el ; because you have shown your strength to both God and men and have prevailed. ”
CJB	Genesis	32	29	) Ya ‘ akov asked him , “ Please tell me your name. ” But he answered , “ Why are you asking about my name ? ” and blessed him there . ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	32	30	) Ya ‘ akov called the place P ’ ni-El [ face of God ] , “ Because I have seen God face to face , yet my life is spared. ”
CJB	Genesis	32	31	) As the sun rose upon him he went on past P ’ ni-El , limping at the hip .
CJB	Genesis	32	33	(
CJB	Genesis	33	33	Ya ‘ akov raised his eyes and looked out ; and there was ‘ Esav coming , and four hundred men with him . So Ya ‘ akov divided the children between Le ’ ah , Rachel and the two slave-girls ,
CJB	Genesis	33	2	putting the slave-girls and their children first , Le ’ ah and her children second , and Rachel and Yosef last .
CJB	Genesis	33	3	Then he himself passed on ahead of them and prostrated himself on the ground seven times before approaching his brother .
CJB	Genesis	33	4	‘ Esav ran to meet him , hugged him , threw his arms around his neck and kissed him ; and they wept .
CJB	Genesis	33	5	Esav looked up ; on seeing the women and children , he asked , “ Who are these with you ? ” Ya ‘ akov answered , “ The children God has graciously given to your servant. ” ( iv )
CJB	Genesis	33	6	Then the slave-girls approached with their children , and they prostrated themselves ;
CJB	Genesis	33	7	Le ’ ah too and her children approached and prostrated themselves ; and last came Yosef and Rachel ; and they prostrated themselves .
CJB	Genesis	33	8	‘ Esav asked , “ What was the meaning of this procession of droves I encountered ? ” and he answered , “ It was to win my lord ’ s favor. ”
CJB	Genesis	33	9	‘ Esav replied , “ I have plenty already ; my brother , keep your possessions for yourself. ”
CJB	Genesis	33	10	Ya ‘ akov said , “ No , please ! If now I have won your favor , then accept my gift . Just seeing your face has been like seeing the face of God , now that you have received me .
CJB	Genesis	33	11	So please accept the gift I have brought you , for God has dealt kindly with me and I have enough. ” Thus he urged him , until he accepted it .
CJB	Genesis	33	12	‘ Esav said , “ Let ’ s break camp and get going . I ’ ll go first. ”
CJB	Genesis	33	13	Ya ‘ akov said to him , “ My lord knows that the children are small , and the sheep and cattle suckling their young concern me , because if they overdrive them even one day , all the flocks will die .
CJB	Genesis	33	14	Instead , please , let my lord go on ahead of his servant . I will travel more slowly , at the pace of the cattle ahead of me and at the pace of the children , until I come to my lord in Se ‘ ir. ”
CJB	Genesis	33	15	‘ Esav replied , “ Then let me leave with you some of the people I have with me. ” But Ya ‘ akov said , “ There ’ s no need for my lord to be so kind to me. ”
CJB	Genesis	33	16	So ‘ Esav left that day to return to Se ‘ ir .
CJB	Genesis	33	17	Ya ‘ akov went on to Sukkot , where he built himself a house and put up shelters for his cattle . This is why the place is called Sukkot [ shelters ] .
CJB	Genesis	33	18	Having traveled from Paddan-Aram , Ya ‘ akov arrived safely at the city of Sh ’ khem , in Kena ‘ an , and set up camp near the city .
CJB	Genesis	33	19	From the sons of Hamor Sh ’ khem ’ s father he bought for one hundred pieces of silver the parcel of land where he had pitched his tent .
CJB	Genesis	33	20	There he put up an altar , which he called El-Elohei-Yisra ’ el [ God , the God of Isra ’ el ] .
CJB	Genesis	34	34	( v ) One time Dinah the daughter of Le ’ ah , whom she had borne to Ya ‘ akov , went out to visit the local girls ;
CJB	Genesis	34	2	and Sh ’ khem the son of Hamor the Hivi , the local ruler , saw her , grabbed her , raped her and humiliated her .
CJB	Genesis	34	3	But actually he was strongly attracted to Dinah the daughter of Ya ‘ akov ; he fell in love with the girl and tried to win her affection .
CJB	Genesis	34	4	Sh ’ khem spoke with his father Hamor and said , “ Get this girl for me ; I want her to be my wife. ”
CJB	Genesis	34	5	When Ya ‘ akov heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter , his sons were with his livestock in the field ; so Ya ‘ akov restrained himself until they came .
CJB	Genesis	34	6	Hamor the father of Sh ’ khem went out to Ya ‘ akov to speak with him
CJB	Genesis	34	7	just as Ya ‘ akov ’ s sons were coming in from the field . When they heard what had happened , the men were saddened and were very angry at the outrage this man had committed against Isra ’ el by raping Ya ‘ akov ’ s daughter , something that is simply not done .
CJB	Genesis	34	8	But Hamor said to them , “ My son Sh ’ khem ’ s heart is set on your daughter . Please give her to him as his wife ;
CJB	Genesis	34	9	and intermarry with us : give your daughters to us , and take our daughters for yourselves .
CJB	Genesis	34	10	You will live with us , and the land will be available to you — you ’ ll live , do business and acquire possessions here. ”
CJB	Genesis	34	11	Then Sh ’ khem said to her father and brothers , “ Only accept me , and I will give whatever you tell me .
CJB	Genesis	34	12	Ask as large a bride-price as you like , I ’ ll pay whatever you tell me . Just let me marry the girl. ”
CJB	Genesis	34	13	The sons of Ya ‘ akov answered Sh ’ khem and Hamor his father deceitfully , because he had defiled Dinah their sister .
CJB	Genesis	34	14	They said to them , “ We can ’ t do it , because it would be a disgrace to give our sister to someone who hasn ’ t been circumcised .
CJB	Genesis	34	15	Only on this condition will we consent to what you are asking : that you become like us by having every male among you get circumcised .
CJB	Genesis	34	16	Then we ’ ll give our daughters to you , and we ’ ll take your daughters for ourselves , and we ’ ll live with you and become one people .
CJB	Genesis	34	17	But if you won ’ t do as we say and get circumcised , then we ’ ll take our daughter and go away. ”
CJB	Genesis	34	18	What they said seemed fair to Hamor and Sh ’ khem the son of Hamor ,
CJB	Genesis	34	19	and the young man did not put off doing what was asked of him , even though he was the most respected member of his father ’ s family , because he so much wanted Ya ‘ akov ’ s daughter .
CJB	Genesis	34	20	Hamor and Sh ’ khem his son came to the entrance of their city and spoke with its leading men :
CJB	Genesis	34	21	“ These people are peaceful toward us ; therefore let them live in the land and do business in it ; for , as you can see , the land is large enough for them . Let us take their daughters as wives for ourselves , and we ’ ll give them our daughters .
CJB	Genesis	34	22	But the people will consent to live with us and become one people only on this condition : that every male among us gets circumcised , as they themselves are circumcised .
CJB	Genesis	34	23	Won ’ t their cattle , their possessions and all their animals be ours ? Only let ’ s consent to do what they ask , and then they will live with us. ”
CJB	Genesis	34	24	Everyone going out the city ’ s gate listened to Hamor and Sh ’ khem his son ; so every male was circumcised , every one that went out the gate of the city .
CJB	Genesis	34	25	On the third day after the circumcision , when they were in pain , two of Ya ‘ akov ’ s sons , Shim ‘ on and Levi , Dinah ’ s brothers , took their swords , boldly descended on the city and slaughtered all the males .
CJB	Genesis	34	26	They killed Hamor and Sh ’ khem his son with their swords , took Dinah out of Sh ’ khem ’ s house , and left .
CJB	Genesis	34	27	Then the sons of Ya ‘ akov entered over the dead bodies of those who had been slaughtered and plundered the city in reprisal for defiling their sister .
CJB	Genesis	34	28	They took their flocks , cattle and donkeys , and everything else , whether in the city or in the field ,
CJB	Genesis	34	29	everything they owned . Their children and wives they took captive , and they looted whatever was in the houses .
CJB	Genesis	34	30	But Ya ‘ akov said to Shim ‘ on and Levi , “ You have caused me trouble by making me stink in the opinion of the local inhabitants , the Kena ‘ ani and the P ’ rizi . Since I don ’ t have many people , they ’ ll align themselves together against me and attack me ; and I will be destroyed , I and my household. ”
CJB	Genesis	34	31	They replied , “ Should we let our sister be treated like a whore ? ”
CJB	Genesis	35	35	God said to Ya ‘ akov , “ Get up , go up to Beit-El and live there , and make there an altar to God , who appeared to you when you fled ‘ Esav your brother. ”
CJB	Genesis	35	2	Then Ya ‘ akov said to his household and all the others with him , “ Get rid of the foreign gods that you have with you , purify yourselves , and put on fresh clothes .
CJB	Genesis	35	3	We ’ re going to move on and go up to Beit-El . There I will build an altar to God , who answered me when I was in such distress and stayed with me wherever I went. ”
CJB	Genesis	35	4	They gave Ya ‘ akov all the foreign gods in their possession and the earrings they were wearing , and Ya ‘ akov buried them under the pistachio tree near Sh ’ khem .
CJB	Genesis	35	5	While they were traveling , a terror from God fell upon the cities around them , so that none of them pursued the sons of Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Genesis	35	6	Ya ‘ akov and all the people with him arrived at Luz ( that is , Beit-El ) in the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Genesis	35	7	He built there an altar and called the place El-Beit-El [ God of Beit-El ] , because it was there that God was revealed to him , at the time when he was fleeing from his brother .
CJB	Genesis	35	8	Then D ’ vorah , Rivkah ’ s nurse , died . She was buried below Beit-El under the oak , which was given the name Alon-Bakhut [ oak of weeping ] .
CJB	Genesis	35	9	After Ya ‘ akov arrived from Paddan-Aram , God appeared to him again and blessed him .
CJB	Genesis	35	10	God said to him , “ Your name is Ya ‘ akov , but you will be called Ya ‘ akov no longer ; your name will be Isra ’ el. ” Thus he named him Isra ’ el .
CJB	Genesis	35	11	God further said to him , “ I am El Shaddai . Be fruitful and multiply . A nation , indeed a group of nations , will come from you ; kings will be descended from you . ( A : vi )
CJB	Genesis	35	12	Moreover , the land which I gave to Avraham and Yitz ’ chak I will give to you , and I will give the land to your descendants after you. ”
CJB	Genesis	35	13	Then God went up from him there where he had spoken with him . ( S : vi )
CJB	Genesis	35	14	Ya ‘ akov set up a standing-stone in the place where he had spoken with him , a stone pillar . Then he poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it .
CJB	Genesis	35	15	Ya ‘ akov called the place where God spoke with him Beit-El .
CJB	Genesis	35	16	Then they traveled on from Beit-El , and while there was still some distance to go before arriving in Efrat , Rachel went into labor , and she had great difficulty with it .
CJB	Genesis	35	17	While she was undergoing this hard labor , the midwife said to her , “ Don ’ t worry , this is also a son for you. ”
CJB	Genesis	35	18	But she died in childbirth . As she was dying she named her son Ben-Oni [ son of my grief ] , but his father called him Binyamin [ son of the right hand , son of the south ] .
CJB	Genesis	35	19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Efrat ( that is , Beit-Lechem ) .
CJB	Genesis	35	20	Ya ‘ akov set up a standing-stone on her grave ; it is the standing-stone of Rachel ’ s grave to this day .
CJB	Genesis	35	21	Isra ’ el continued his travels and pitched his tent on the other side of Migdal- ‘ Eder .
CJB	Genesis	35	22	It was while Isra ’ el was living in that land that Re ’ uven went and slept with Bilhah his father ’ s concubine , and Isra ’ el heard about it . Ya ‘ akov had twelve sons .
CJB	Genesis	35	23	The sons of Le ’ ah were Re ’ uven Ya ‘ akov ’ s firstborn , Shim ‘ on , Levi , Y ’ hudah , Yissakhar and Z ’ vulun .
CJB	Genesis	35	24	The sons of Rachel were Yosef and Binyamin .
CJB	Genesis	35	25	The sons of Bilhah Rachel ’ s slave-girl were Dan and Naftali .
CJB	Genesis	35	26	And the sons of Zilpah Le ’ ah ’ s slave-girl were Gad and Asher . These were Ya ‘ akov ’ s sons , born to him in Paddan-Aram .
CJB	Genesis	35	27	Ya ‘ akov came home to his father Yitz ’ chak at Mamre , near Kiryat-Arba ( also known as Hevron ) , where Avraham and Yitz ’ chak had lived as foreigners .
CJB	Genesis	35	28	Yitz ’ chak lived to be
CJB	Genesis	35	180	years old .
CJB	Genesis	35	29	Then he breathed his last , died and was gathered to his people , an old man full of years ; and his sons ‘ Esav and Ya ‘ akov buried him .
CJB	Genesis	36	36	When Hadad died , Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place .
CJB	Genesis	36	2	‘ Esav chose Kena ‘ ani women as his wives : ‘ Adah the daughter of Eilon the Hitti ; Oholivamah the daughter of ‘ Anah the daughter of Tziv ‘ on the Hivi ;
CJB	Genesis	36	3	and Basmat Yishma ‘ el ’ s daughter , sister of N ’ vayot .
CJB	Genesis	36	4	‘ Adah bore to ‘ Esav Elifaz , Basmat bore Re ‘ u ’ el ,
CJB	Genesis	36	5	and Oholivamah bore Ye ‘ ush , Ya ‘ lam and Korach . These were the sons of ‘ Esav born to him in the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Genesis	36	6	‘ Esav took his wives , his sons and daughters , the others in his household , his cattle and other animals and everything else he owned , which he had acquired in the land of Kena ‘ an , and went off to a country distant from his brother Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Genesis	36	7	For their possessions had become too great for them to live together , and the countryside through which they were traveling couldn ’ t support so much livestock .
CJB	Genesis	36	8	So ‘ Esav lived in the hill-country of Se ‘ ir . ( ‘ Esav is Edom . )
CJB	Genesis	36	9	This is the genealogy of ‘ Esav the father of Edom in the hill-country of Se ‘ ir .
CJB	Genesis	36	10	The names of ‘ Esav ’ s sons were Elifaz , son of ‘ Adah the wife of ‘ Esav , and Re ‘ u ’ el the son of Basmat the wife of ‘ Esav .

CJB	Genesis	37	37	Ya ‘ akov continued living in the land where his father had lived as a foreigner , the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Genesis	37	9	He had another dream which he told his brothers : “ Here , I had another dream , and there were the sun , the moon and eleven stars prostrating themselves before me. ”
CJB	Genesis	37	2	Here is the history of Ya ‘ akov . When Yosef was seventeen years old he used to pasture the flock with his brothers , even though he was still a boy . Once when he was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah , his father ’ s wives , he brought a bad report about them to their father .
CJB	Genesis	37	3	Now Isra ’ el loved Yosef the most of all his children , because he was the son of his old age ; and he made him a long-sleeved robe .
CJB	Genesis	37	4	When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers , they began to hate him and reached the point where they couldn ’ t even talk with him in a civil manner .
CJB	Genesis	37	5	Yosef had a dream which he told his brothers , and that made them hate him all the more .
CJB	Genesis	37	6	He said to them , “ Listen while I tell you about this dream of mine .
CJB	Genesis	37	7	We were tying up bundles of wheat in the field when suddenly my bundle got up by itself and stood upright ; then your bundles came , gathered around mine and prostrated themselves before it. ”
CJB	Genesis	37	8	His brothers retorted , “ Yes , you will certainly be our king . You ’ ll do a great job of bossing us around ! ” And they hated him still more for his dreams and for what he said .
CJB	Genesis	37	10	He told his father too , as well as his brothers , but his father rebuked him : “ What is this dream you have had ? Do you really expect me , your mother and your brothers to come and prostrate ourselves before you on the ground ? ”
CJB	Genesis	37	11	His brothers were jealous of him , but his father kept the matter in mind . ( ii )
CJB	Genesis	37	12	After this , when his brothers had gone to pasture their father ’ s sheep in Sh ’ khem ,
CJB	Genesis	37	13	Isra ’ el asked Yosef , “ Aren ’ t your brothers pasturing the sheep in Sh ’ khem ? Come , I will send you to them. ” He answered , “ Here I am. ”
CJB	Genesis	37	14	He said to him , “ Go now , see whether things are going well with your brothers and with the sheep , and bring word back to me. ” So he sent him away from the Hevron Valley , and he went to Sh ’ khem ,
CJB	Genesis	37	15	where a man found him wandering around in the countryside . The man asked him , “ What are you looking for ? ”
CJB	Genesis	37	16	“ I ’ m looking for my brothers , ” he answered . “ Tell me , please , where are they pasturing the sheep ? ”
CJB	Genesis	37	17	The man said , “ They ’ ve left here ; because I heard them say , ‘ Let ’ s go to Dotan. ’ ” Yosef went after his brothers and found them in Dotan .
CJB	Genesis	37	18	They spotted him in the distance , and before he had arrived where they were , they had already plotted to kill him .
CJB	Genesis	37	19	They said to each other , “ Look , this dreamer is coming !
CJB	Genesis	37	20	So come now , let ’ s kill him and throw him into one of these water cisterns here . Then we ’ ll say some wild animal devoured him . We ’ ll see then what becomes of his dreams ! ”
CJB	Genesis	37	21	But when Re ’ uven heard this , he saved him from being destroyed by them . He said , “ We shouldn ’ t take his life .
CJB	Genesis	37	22	Don ’ t shed blood , ” Re ’ uven added . “ Throw him into this cistern here in the wilds , but don ’ t lay hands on him yourselves. ” He intended to rescue him from them later and restore him to his father . ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	37	23	So it was that when Yosef arrived to be with his brothers , they stripped off his robe , the long-sleeved robe he was wearing ,
CJB	Genesis	37	24	and took him and threw him into the cistern ( the cistern was empty ; without any water in it ) .
CJB	Genesis	37	25	Then they sat down to eat their meal ; but as they looked up , they saw in front of them a caravan of Yishma ‘ elim coming from Gil ‘ ad , their camels loaded with aromatic gum , healing resin and opium , on their way down to Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	37	26	Y ’ hudah said to his brothers , “ What advantage is it to us if we kill our brother and cover up his blood ?
CJB	Genesis	37	27	Come , let ’ s sell him to the Yishma ‘ elim , instead of putting him to death with our own hands . After all , he is our brother , our own flesh. ” His brothers paid attention to him .
CJB	Genesis	37	28	So when the Midyanim , merchants , passed by , they drew and lifted Yosef up out of the cistern and sold him for half a pound of silver shekels to the Yishma ‘ elim , who took Yosef on to Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	37	29	Re ’ uven returned to the cistern , and , upon seeing that Yosef wasn ’ t in it , tore his clothes in mourning .
CJB	Genesis	37	30	He returned to his brothers and said , “ The boy isn ’ t there ! Where can I go now ? ”
CJB	Genesis	37	31	They took Yosef ’ s robe , killed a male goat and dipped the robe in the blood .
CJB	Genesis	37	32	Then they sent the long-sleeved robe and brought it to their father , saying , “ We found this . Do you know if it ’ s your son ’ s robe or not ? ”
CJB	Genesis	37	33	He recognized it and cried , “ It ’ s my son ’ s robe ! Some wild animal has torn Yosef in pieces and eaten him ! ”
CJB	Genesis	37	34	Ya ‘ akov tore his clothes and , putting sackcloth around his waist , mourned his son for many days .
CJB	Genesis	37	35	Though all his sons and daughters tried to comfort him , he refused all consolation , saying , “ No , I will go down to the grave , to my son , mourning. ” And his father wept for him .
CJB	Genesis	37	36	In Egypt the Midyanim sold Yosef to Potifar , one of Pharaoh ’ s officials , a captain of the guard .
CJB	Genesis	38	38	( iv ) It was at this time that Y ’ hudah went off from his brothers and settled near a man named Hirah who was an ‘ Adulami .
CJB	Genesis	38	2	There Y ’ hudah saw one of the daughters of a certain Kena ‘ ani whose name was Shua , and he took her and slept with her .
CJB	Genesis	38	3	She conceived and had a son , whom he named ‘ Er .
CJB	Genesis	38	4	She conceived again and had a son , and she called him Onan .
CJB	Genesis	38	5	Then she conceived yet again and had a son whom she called Shelah ; he was in K ’ ziv when she gave birth to him .
CJB	Genesis	38	6	Y ’ hudah took a wife for ‘ Er his firstborn , and her name was Tamar .
CJB	Genesis	38	7	But ‘ Er , Y ’ hudah ’ s firstborn , was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , so Adonai killed him .
CJB	Genesis	38	8	Y ’ hudah said to Onan , “ Go and sleep with your brother ’ s wife — perform the duty of a husband ’ s brother to her , and preserve your brother ’ s line of descent. ”
CJB	Genesis	38	9	However , Onan knew that the child would not count as his ; so whenever he had intercourse with his brother ’ s wife , he spilled the semen on the ground , so as not to give his brother offspring .
CJB	Genesis	38	10	What he did was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , so he killed him too .
CJB	Genesis	38	11	Then Y ’ hudah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law , “ Stay a widow in your father ’ s house until my son Shelah grows up ” ; for he thought , “ I don ’ t want him to die too , like his brothers. ” So Tamar went and lived at home with her father .
CJB	Genesis	38	12	In due time , Shua ’ s daughter , the wife of Y ’ hudah , died . After Y ’ hudah had been comforted , he went up to be with his sheep-shearers in Timnah , he and his friend Hirah the ‘ Adulami .
CJB	Genesis	38	13	Tamar was told , “ Your father-in-law has gone up to Timnah to shear his sheep. ”
CJB	Genesis	38	14	So she took off her widow ’ s clothes , completely covered her face with her veil , and sat at the entrance to ‘ Einayim , which is on the way to Timnah . For she saw that Shelah had grown up , but she still was not being given to him as his wife .
CJB	Genesis	38	15	When Y ’ hudah saw her , he thought she was a prostitute , because she had covered her face .
CJB	Genesis	38	16	So he went over to her where she was sitting and said , not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law , “ Come , let me sleep with you. ” She answered , “ What will you pay to sleep with me ? ”
CJB	Genesis	38	17	He said , “ I will send you a kid from the flock of goats. ” She said , “ Will you also give me something as a guarantee until you send it ”
CJB	Genesis	38	18	He answered , “ What should I give you as a guarantee ? ” She said , “ Your seal , with its cord , and the staff you ’ re carrying in your hand. ” So he gave them to her , then went and slept with her ; and she conceived by him .
CJB	Genesis	38	19	She got up and went away , took off her veil and put on her widow ’ s clothes .
CJB	Genesis	38	20	Y ’ hudah sent the kid with his friend the ‘ Adulami to receive the guarantee items back from the woman , but he couldn ’ t find her .
CJB	Genesis	38	21	He asked the people near where she had been , “ Where is the prostitute who was on the road at ‘ Einayim ? ” But they answered , “ There hasn ’ t been any prostitute here. ”
CJB	Genesis	38	22	So he returned to Y ’ hudah and said , “ I couldn ’ t find her ; also the people there said , ‘ There hasn ’ t been any prostitute here. ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	38	23	Y ’ hudah said , “ All right , let her keep the things , so that we won ’ t be publicly shamed . I sent the kid , but you didn ’ t find her. ”
CJB	Genesis	38	24	About three months later Y ’ hudah was told , “ Tamar your daughter-in-law has been acting like a whore ; moreover , she is pregnant as a result of her prostitution. ” Y ’ hudah said , “ Bring her out , and let her be burned alive ! ”
CJB	Genesis	38	25	When she was brought out , she sent this message to her father-in-law : “ I am pregnant by the man to whom these things belong . Determine , I beg you , whose these are — the signet , the cords and the staff. ”
CJB	Genesis	38	26	Then Y ’ hudah acknowledged owning them . He said , “ She is more righteous than I , because I didn ’ t let her become the wife of my son Shelah. ” And he never slept with her again .
CJB	Genesis	38	27	When she went into labor , it became evident that she was going to have twins .
CJB	Genesis	38	28	As she was in labor , one of them put out his hand ; and the midwife took his hand and tied a scarlet thread on it , saying , “ This one came out first. ”
CJB	Genesis	38	29	But then he withdrew his hand , and his brother came out ; so she said , “ How did you manage to break out first ? ” Therefore he was named Peretz [ breaking out ] .
CJB	Genesis	38	30	Then out came his brother , with the scarlet thread on his hand , and he was given the name Zerach [ scarlet ] .
CJB	Genesis	39	39	( v ) Yosef was brought down to Egypt , and Potifar , an officer of Pharaoh ’ s and captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the Yishma ‘ elim who had brought him there .
CJB	Genesis	39	2	Adonai was with Yosef , and he became wealthy while he was in the household of his master the Egyptian .
CJB	Genesis	39	3	His master saw how Adonai was with him , that Adonai prospered everything he did .
CJB	Genesis	39	4	Yosef pleased him as he served him , and his master appointed him manager of his household ; he entrusted all his possessions to Yosef .
CJB	Genesis	39	5	From the time he appointed him manager of his household and all his possessions , Adonai blessed the Egyptian ’ s household for Yosef ’ s sake ; Adonai ’ s blessing was on all he owned , whether in the house or in the field .
CJB	Genesis	39	6	So he left all his possessions in Yosef ’ s care ; and because he had him , he paid no attention to his affairs , except for the food he ate . Now Yosef was well-built and handsome as well . ( vi )
CJB	Genesis	39	7	In time , the day came when his master ’ s wife took a look at Yosef and said , “ Sleep with me ! ”
CJB	Genesis	39	8	But he refused , saying to his master ’ s wife , “ Look , because my master has me , he doesn ’ t know what ’ s going on in this house . He has put all his possessions in my charge .
CJB	Genesis	39	9	In this house I am his equal ; he hasn ’ t withheld anything from me except yourself , because you are his wife . How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God ? ”
CJB	Genesis	39	10	But she kept pressing him , day after day . Nevertheless , he didn ’ t listen to her ; he refused to sleep with her or even be with her .
CJB	Genesis	39	11	However , one day , when he went into the house to do his work , and none of the men living in the house was there indoors ,
CJB	Genesis	39	12	she grabbed him by his robe and said , “ Sleep with me ! ” But he fled , leaving his robe in her hand , and got himself outside .
CJB	Genesis	39	13	When she saw that he had left his robe in her hand and had escaped ,
CJB	Genesis	39	14	she called the men of her house and said to them , “ Look at this ! My husband brought in a Hebrew to make fools of us . He came in and wanted to sleep with me , but I yelled out loudly .
CJB	Genesis	39	15	When he heard me yelling like that , he left his robe with me and ran out. ”
CJB	Genesis	39	16	She put the robe aside until his master came home .
CJB	Genesis	39	17	Then she said to him , “ This Hebrew slave you brought us came in to make a fool of me .
CJB	Genesis	39	18	But when I yelled out , he left his robe with me and fled outside. ”
CJB	Genesis	39	19	When his master heard what his wife said as she showed him , “ Here ’ s what your slave did to me , ” he became furious .
CJB	Genesis	39	20	Yosef ’ s master took him and put him in prison , in the place where the king ’ s prisoners were kept ; and there he was in the prison .
CJB	Genesis	39	21	But Adonai was with Yosef , showing him grace and giving him favor in the sight of the prison warden .
CJB	Genesis	39	22	The prison warden made Yosef supervisor of all the prisoners in the prison ; so that whatever they did there , he was in charge of it .
CJB	Genesis	39	23	The prison warden paid no attention to anything Yosef did , because Adonai was with him ; and whatever he did , Adonai prospered .
CJB	Genesis	40	40	( vii ) Some time later it came about that the Egyptian king ’ s cupbearer and baker gave offense to their lord the king of Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	40	2	Pharaoh became angry with his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief baker .
CJB	Genesis	40	3	So he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , in the prison , in the same place where Yosef was kept .
CJB	Genesis	40	4	The captain of the guard charged Yosef to be with them , and he became their attendant while they remained in prison .
CJB	Genesis	40	5	One night the two of them , the king of Egypt ’ s cupbearer and his baker , there in prison , both had dreams , each dream with its own meaning .
CJB	Genesis	40	6	Yosef came in to them in the morning and saw that they looked sad .
CJB	Genesis	40	7	He asked Pharaoh ’ s officers there with him in the prison of his master ’ s house , “ Why are you looking so sad today ? ”
CJB	Genesis	40	8	They said to him , “ We each had a dream , and there ’ s no one around who can interpret it. ” Yosef said to them , “ Don ’ t interpretations belong to God ? Tell it to me , please. ”
CJB	Genesis	40	9	Then the chief cupbearer told Yosef his dream : “ In my dream , there in front of me was a vine ,
CJB	Genesis	40	10	and the vine had three branches . The branches budded , then it suddenly began to blossom , and finally clusters of ripe grapes appeared .
CJB	Genesis	40	11	Pharaoh ’ s cup was in my hand , so I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh ’ s cup , and gave the cup to Pharaoh. ”
CJB	Genesis	40	12	Yosef said to him , “ Here is its interpretation : the three branches are three days .
CJB	Genesis	40	13	Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office : you will be giving Pharaoh his cup as you used to when you were his cupbearer .
CJB	Genesis	40	14	But remember me when it goes well with you ; and show me kindness , please ; and mention me to Pharaoh , so that he will release me from this prison .
CJB	Genesis	40	15	For the truth is that I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews , and here too I have done nothing wrong that would justify putting me in this dungeon. ”
CJB	Genesis	40	16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable , he said to Yosef , “ I too saw in my dream : there were three baskets of white bread on my head .
CJB	Genesis	40	17	In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh , but the birds ate them out of the basket on my head. ”
CJB	Genesis	40	18	Yosef answered , “ Here is its interpretation : the three baskets are three days .
CJB	Genesis	40	19	Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from off of you — he will hang you on a tree , and the birds will eat your flesh off you. ” ( Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	40	20	On the third day , which was Pharaoh ’ s birthday , he gave a party for all his officials , and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his officials .
CJB	Genesis	40	21	He restored the chief cupbearer back to his position , so that he again gave Pharaoh his cup .
CJB	Genesis	40	22	But he hanged the chief baker , as Yosef had interpreted to them .
CJB	Genesis	40	23	Nevertheless , the chief cupbearer didn ’ t remember Yosef , but forgot him . Haftarah Vayeshev : ‘ Amos ( Amos ) 2:6–3:8 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested reading for Parashah Vayeshev : Acts 7:9–16 ( specifically vv . 9–10 )
CJB	Genesis	41	41	Pharaoh said to Yosef , “ Here , I place you in charge of the whole land of Egypt. ”
CJB	Genesis	41	10	Pharaoh was angry with his officials and put me in the prison of the house of the captain of the guard , me and the chief baker .
CJB	Genesis	41	2	and there came up out of the river seven cows , sleek and fat ; and they began feeding in swamp grass .
CJB	Genesis	41	3	After them , there came up out of the river seven more cows , miserable-looking and lean ; and they stood by the other cows at the edge of the river .
CJB	Genesis	41	4	Then the miserable-looking and lean cows ate up the seven sleek , fat cows . At this point Pharaoh woke up .
CJB	Genesis	41	5	But he went to sleep again and dreamt a second time : seven full , ripe ears of grain grew out of a single stalk .
CJB	Genesis	41	6	After them , seven ears , thin and blasted by the east wind , sprang up .
CJB	Genesis	41	7	And the thin ears swallowed up the seven full , ripe ears . Then Pharaoh woke up and realized it had been a dream .
CJB	Genesis	41	8	In the morning he found himself so upset that he summoned all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men . Pharaoh told them his dreams , but no one there could interpret them for him .
CJB	Genesis	41	9	Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh , “ Today reminds me of something wherein I am at fault :
CJB	Genesis	41	11	One night both I and he had dreams , and each man ’ s dream had its own meaning .
CJB	Genesis	41	12	There was with us a young man , a Hebrew , a servant of the captain of the guard ; and we told him our dreams , and he interpreted them for us — he interpreted each man ’ s dream individually .
CJB	Genesis	41	13	And it came about as he interpreted to us — I was restored to my office , and he was hanged. ”
CJB	Genesis	41	14	Then Pharaoh summoned Yosef , and they brought him quickly out of the dungeon . He shaved himself , changed his clothes , and came in to Pharaoh . ( A : ii )
CJB	Genesis	41	15	Pharaoh said to Yosef , “ I had a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it ; but I ’ ve heard it said about you that when you hear a dream , you can interpret it. ”
CJB	Genesis	41	16	Yosef answered Pharaoh , “ It isn ’ t in me . God will give Pharaoh an answer that will set his mind at peace. ” ( S : ii )
CJB	Genesis	41	17	Pharaoh said to Yosef , “ In my dream , I stood at the edge of the river ;
CJB	Genesis	41	18	and there came up out of the river seven cows , fat and sleek ; and they began feeding in the swamp grass .
CJB	Genesis	41	19	After them , there came up out of the river seven more cows , poor , miserable-looking and lean — I ’ ve never seen such bad-looking cows in all the land of Egypt !
CJB	Genesis	41	20	Then the lean and miserable-looking cows ate up the first seven fat cows .
CJB	Genesis	41	21	But after they had eaten them up , one couldn ’ t tell that they had eaten them ; because they were as miserable-looking as before . At this point I woke up .
CJB	Genesis	41	22	But I dreamed again and saw seven full , ripe ears of grain growing out of a single stalk .
CJB	Genesis	41	23	After them , seven ears , thin and blasted by the east wind , sprang up .
CJB	Genesis	41	24	And the thin ears swallowed up the seven ripe ears . I told this to the magicians , but none of them could explain it to me. ”
CJB	Genesis	41	25	Yosef said to Pharaoh , “ The dreams of Pharaoh are the same : God has told Pharaoh what he is about to do .
CJB	Genesis	41	26	The seven good cows are seven years , and the seven good ears of grain are seven years — the dreams are the same .
CJB	Genesis	41	27	Likewise the seven lean and miserable-looking cows that came up after them are seven years , and also the seven empty ears blasted by the east wind — there will be seven years of famine .
CJB	Genesis	41	28	This is what I told Pharaoh : God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do .
CJB	Genesis	41	29	Here it is : there will be seven years of abundance throughout the whole land of Egypt ;
CJB	Genesis	41	30	but afterwards , there will come seven years of famine ; and Egypt will forget all the abundance . The famine will consume the land ,
CJB	Genesis	41	31	and the abundance will not be known in the land because of the famine that will follow , because it will be truly terrible .
CJB	Genesis	41	32	Why was the dream doubled for Pharaoh ? Because the matter has been fixed by God , and God will shortly cause it to happen .
CJB	Genesis	41	33	“ Therefore , Pharaoh should look for a man both discreet and wise to put in charge of the land of Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	41	34	Pharaoh should do this , and he should appoint supervisors over the land to receive a twenty percent tax on the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance .
CJB	Genesis	41	35	They should gather all the food produced during these good years coming up and set aside grain under the supervision of Pharaoh to be used for food in the cities , and they should store it .
CJB	Genesis	41	36	This will be the land ’ s food supply for the seven years of famine that will come over the land of Egypt , so that the land will not perish as a result of the famine. ”
CJB	Genesis	41	37	The proposal seemed good both to Pharaoh and to all his officials .
CJB	Genesis	41	38	Pharaoh said to his officials , “ Can we find anyone else like him ? The Spirit of God lives in him ! ” ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	41	39	So Pharaoh said to Yosef , “ Since God has shown you all this — there is no one as discerning and wise as you —
CJB	Genesis	41	40	you will be in charge of my household ; all my people will be ruled by what you say . Only when I rule from my throne will I be greater than you. ”
CJB	Genesis	41	42	Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Yosef ’ s hand , had him clothed in fine linen with a gold chain around his neck
CJB	Genesis	41	43	and had him ride in his second best chariot ; and they cried before him , “ Bow down ! ” Thus he placed him in charge of the whole land of Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	41	44	Pharaoh said to Yosef , “ I , Pharaoh , decree that without your approval no one is to raise his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt. ”
CJB	Genesis	41	45	Pharaoh called Yosef by the name Tzafnat-Pa ‘ neach and gave him as his wife Osnat the daughter of Poti-Fera priest of On . Then Yosef went out through all the land of Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	41	46	Yosef was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt ; then he left Pharaoh ’ s presence and traveled through all the land of Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	41	47	During the seven years of abundance , the earth brought forth heaps of produce .
CJB	Genesis	41	48	He collected all the food of these seven years in the land of Egypt and stored it in the cities — the food grown in the fields outside each city he stored in that city .
CJB	Genesis	41	49	Yosef stored grain in quantities like the sand on the seashore , so much that they stopped counting , because it was beyond measure .
CJB	Genesis	41	50	Two sons were born to Yosef before the year of famine came ; Osnat the daughter of Poti-Fera priest of On bore them to him .
CJB	Genesis	41	51	Yosef called the firstborn M ’ nasheh [ causing to forget ] , “ Because God has caused me to forget all the troubles I suffered at the hands of my family. ”
CJB	Genesis	41	52	The second he called Efrayim [ fruit ] , “ For God has made me fruitful in the land of my misfortune. ” ( iv )
CJB	Genesis	41	53	The seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt ended ;
CJB	Genesis	41	54	and the seven years of famine began to come , just as Yosef had said . There was famine in all lands , but throughout the land of Egypt there was food .
CJB	Genesis	41	55	When the whole land of Egypt started feeling the famine , the people cried to Pharaoh for food , and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians , “ Go to Yosef , and do what he tells you to do. ”
CJB	Genesis	41	56	The famine was over all the earth , but then Yosef opened all the storehouses and sold food to the Egyptians , since the famine was severe in the land of Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	41	57	Moreover all countries came to Egypt to Yosef to buy grain , because the famine was severe throughout the earth .
CJB	Genesis	42	42	Now Ya ‘ akov saw that there was grain in Egypt ; so Ya ‘ akov said to his sons , “ Why are you staring at each other ?
CJB	Genesis	42	2	Look , ” he said , “ I ’ ve heard that there ’ s grain in Egypt . Go down there and buy some for us from there , so that we can stay alive and not die ! ”
CJB	Genesis	42	3	Thus Yosef ’ s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt ,
CJB	Genesis	42	4	except for Binyamin , Yosef ’ s brother . Ya ‘ akov did not send him with his brothers , because he was afraid something might happen to him .
CJB	Genesis	42	5	The sons of Isra ’ el came to buy along with the others that came , since the famine extended to the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Genesis	42	6	Yosef was governor over the land ; it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Now when Yosef ’ s brothers came and prostrated themselves before him on the ground ,
CJB	Genesis	42	7	Yosef saw his brothers and recognized them ; but he acted toward them as if he were a stranger and spoke harshly with them . He asked them , “ Where are you from ? ” They answered , “ From the land of Kena ‘ an to buy food. ”
CJB	Genesis	42	8	So Yosef recognized his brothers , but they didn ’ t recognize him .
CJB	Genesis	42	9	Remembering the dreams he had had about them , Yosef said to them , “ You are spies ! You ’ ve come to spot our country ’ s weaknesses ! ”
CJB	Genesis	42	10	“ No , my lord , ” they replied , “ your servants have come to buy food .
CJB	Genesis	42	11	We ’ re all the sons of one man , we ’ re upright men ; your servants aren ’ t spies. ”
CJB	Genesis	42	12	“ No , ” he said to them , “ you ’ ve come to spy out our country ’ s weaknesses. ”
CJB	Genesis	42	13	They said , “ We , your servants , are twelve brothers , the sons of one man in the land of Kena ‘ an ; the youngest stayed with our father , and another one is gone. ”
CJB	Genesis	42	14	“ Just as I said , ” replied Yosef , “ you ’ re spies !
CJB	Genesis	42	15	Here ’ s how you can prove you ’ re not lying : as Pharaoh lives , you will not leave here unless your youngest brother comes here .
CJB	Genesis	42	16	Send one of you , and let him bring your brother . Meanwhile , you will be kept in custody . This will prove whether there is any truth in what you say . Otherwise , as Pharaoh lives , you are certainly spies. ”
CJB	Genesis	42	17	Then he put all of them together in prison for three days .
CJB	Genesis	42	18	On the third day , Yosef said to them , “ Do what I say , and stay alive , for I fear God . ( v )
CJB	Genesis	42	19	If you are upright men , let one of your brothers remain incarcerated in the prison you ’ re being kept in , while you go and carry grain back to relieve the famine in your homes .
CJB	Genesis	42	20	But bring your youngest brother to me . In this way your statements will be verified , and you won ’ t die. ” So they did it .
CJB	Genesis	42	21	They said to each other , “ We are in fact guilty concerning our brother . He was in distress and pleaded with us ; we saw it and wouldn ’ t listen . That ’ s why this distress has come upon us now. ”
CJB	Genesis	42	22	Re ’ uven answered them , “ Didn ’ t I tell you , ‘ Don ’ t wrong the boy ’ ? But you wouldn ’ t hear of it . Now comes the reckoning for his blood ! ”
CJB	Genesis	42	23	They had no idea that Yosef understood them , since an interpreter was translating for them .
CJB	Genesis	42	24	Yosef turned away from them and wept ; then he returned and spoke to them . He took Shim ‘ on from among them and put him in prison before their eyes .
CJB	Genesis	42	25	Next he ordered that their containers be filled with grain , that every man ’ s money be put back in his pack and that they be given provisions for the journey . When these things had been done for them ,
CJB	Genesis	42	26	they loaded their grain on their donkeys and departed .
CJB	Genesis	42	27	But at camp that night , as one of them opened his pack to give fodder to his donkey , he noticed his money — there it was , just inside his pack .
CJB	Genesis	42	28	He said to his brothers , “ My money has been restored — there it is , right in my pack ! ” At that , their hearts sank ; they turned , trembling , to one another and said , “ What is this that God has done to us ? ”
CJB	Genesis	42	29	They returned to Ya ‘ akov their father in the land of Kena ‘ an and told him all that had happened to them .
CJB	Genesis	42	30	“ The man , the lord of the land , spoke harshly with us . He took us for spies in his country .
CJB	Genesis	42	31	We said to him , ‘ We are upright men , we ’ re not spies ;
CJB	Genesis	42	32	we are twelve brothers , sons of our father ; one is gone , and the youngest stayed with our father in the land of Kena ‘ an. ’
CJB	Genesis	42	33	But the man , the lord of the land , said to us , ‘ Here is how I will know that you are upright men : leave one of your brothers with me , take grain to relieve the famine in your homes , and go on your way ;
CJB	Genesis	42	34	but bring your youngest brother to me . By this I will know that you aren ’ t spies , but are upright men ; then I will return your brother to you ; and you will do business in the land. ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	42	35	Next , as they emptied their packs , there was each man ’ s bag of money in his pack ; and when they and their father saw their bags of money , they became afraid .
CJB	Genesis	42	36	Ya ‘ akov their father said to them , “ You have robbed me of my children ! Yosef is gone , Shim ‘ on is gone , now you ’ re taking Binyamin away — it all falls on me ! ”
CJB	Genesis	42	37	Re ’ uven said to his father , “ If I don ’ t bring him back to you , you can kill my own two sons ! Put him in my care ; I will return him to you. ”
CJB	Genesis	42	38	But he replied , “ My son will not go down with you . His brother is dead , and he alone is left . If anything were to happen to him while traveling with you , you would bring my gray hair down to Sh ’ ol with grief . ”
CJB	Genesis	43	43	But the famine was severe in the land ;
CJB	Genesis	43	2	so when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said to them , “ Go again , buy us a little food. ”
CJB	Genesis	43	3	Y ’ hudah said to him , “ The man expressly warned us , ‘ You will not see my face unless your brother is with you. ’
CJB	Genesis	43	4	If you will send our brother with us , we will go down and buy you food ;
CJB	Genesis	43	5	but if you will not send him , we will not go down ; for the man said to us , ‘ You will not see my face unless your brother is with you. ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	43	6	Isra ’ el said , “ Why did you bring such trouble my way by telling the man you had another brother ? ”
CJB	Genesis	43	7	They answered , “ The man kept questioning us about ourselves and about our kinsmen . He asked , ‘ Is your father still alive ? ’ ‘ Do you have another brother ? ’ and we answered according to the literal meaning of his questions . How were we to know he would say , ‘ Bring your brother down ’ ? ”
CJB	Genesis	43	8	Y ’ hudah said to Isra ’ el his father , “ Send the boy with me ; and we will make preparations and leave ; so that we may stay alive and not die , both we and you , and also our little ones .
CJB	Genesis	43	9	I myself will guarantee his safety ; you can hold me responsible . If I fail to bring him to you and present him to your face , let me bear the blame forever .
CJB	Genesis	43	10	Except for our lengthy delay , we would have been there again by now. ”
CJB	Genesis	43	11	Their father Isra ’ el answered them , “ If that ’ s how it is , do this : take in your containers some of the land ’ s best products , and bring the man a gift — some healing resin , a little honey , aromatic gum , opium , pistachio nuts and almonds .
CJB	Genesis	43	12	Take twice the amount of money with you ; and return the money that came back with you in your packs — it could have been an oversight .
CJB	Genesis	43	13	Yes , and take your brother too ; and get ready ; and go again to the man .
CJB	Genesis	43	14	May El Shaddai give you favor in the man ’ s sight , so that he will release to you your other brother as well as Binyamin . As for me , if I must lose my children , lose them I will. ”
CJB	Genesis	43	15	The men took that gift , and they took twice the money with them , and Binyamin ; then they prepared , went down to Egypt and stood before Yosef . ( vi )
CJB	Genesis	43	16	When Yosef saw Binyamin with them , he said to his household manager , “ Take the men inside the house , kill the animals and prepare the meat . These men will dine with me at noon. ”
CJB	Genesis	43	17	The man did as Yosef ordered and brought the men into Yosef ’ s house .
CJB	Genesis	43	18	Upon being ushered inside Yosef ’ s house , the men became fearful . They said , “ It ’ s because of the money that was returned in our packs the first time that we have been brought inside — so that he can use it as an excuse to attack us , take us as slaves and seize our donkeys too. ”
CJB	Genesis	43	19	So they approached the manager of Yosef ’ s household and spoke to him at the entrance of the house :
CJB	Genesis	43	20	“ Please , my lord , the first time we indeed came down to buy food ;
CJB	Genesis	43	21	but when we got to camp , we opened our packs , and there inside our packs was each man ’ s money , the full amount . We have brought it back with us ;
CJB	Genesis	43	22	moreover , we have brought down other money to buy food . We have no idea who put our money in our packs. ”
CJB	Genesis	43	23	“ Stop worrying , ” he replied , “ don ’ t be afraid . Your God and the God of your father put treasure in your packs . As for your money — I was the one who received it. ” Then he brought Shim ‘ on out to them .
CJB	Genesis	43	24	The man brought the men into Yosef ’ s house and gave them water , and they washed their feet , and he provided fodder for their donkeys .
CJB	Genesis	43	25	Then they got their gift ready for Yosef ’ s arrival at noon , for they had heard that they were going to eat a meal there .
CJB	Genesis	43	26	When Yosef arrived home , they went in the house and presented him with the gift they had brought with them , then prostrated themselves before him on the ground .
CJB	Genesis	43	27	He asked them how they were and inquired , “ Is your father well , the old man of whom you spoke ? Is he still alive ? ”
CJB	Genesis	43	28	They answered , “ Your servant our father is well ; yes , he is still alive , ” as they bowed in respect .
CJB	Genesis	43	29	He looked up and saw Binyamin his brother , his mother ’ s son , and said , “ Is this your youngest brother , of whom you spoke to me ? ” and added , “ May God be good to you , my son. ” ( vii )
CJB	Genesis	43	30	Then Yosef hurried out , because his feelings toward his brother were so strong that he wanted to cry ; he went into his bedroom and there he wept .
CJB	Genesis	43	31	Then he washed his face and came out , but he controlled himself as he gave the order to serve the meal .
CJB	Genesis	43	32	They served him by himself , the brothers by themselves , and the Egyptians included at the meal by themselves — Egyptians don ’ t eat with Hebrews , because that is abhorrent to them .
CJB	Genesis	43	33	So they sat there facing him , the firstborn in the place of honor , the youngest in last place ; and the men expressed their amazement to each other .
CJB	Genesis	43	34	Each was given his serving there in front of him , but Binyamin ’ s portion was five times as large as any of theirs . So they drank and enjoyed themselves with him .
CJB	Genesis	44	44	Then he ordered the manager of his household , “ Fill the men ’ s packs with food , as much as they can carry , and put each man ’ s money just inside his pack .
CJB	Genesis	44	2	And put my goblet , the silver one , just inside the pack of the youngest , along with his grain money. ” He did what Yosef told him to do .
CJB	Genesis	44	3	At daybreak the men were sent off with their donkeys ;
CJB	Genesis	44	4	but before they were far from the city Yosef said to his manager , “ Up , go after the men ; and when you overtake them , say to them , ‘ Why have you repaid good with evil ?
CJB	Genesis	44	5	Isn ’ t this the goblet my lord drinks from , indeed the one he uses for divination ? What you have done is evil ! ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	44	6	So he caught up with them and said these words to them .
CJB	Genesis	44	7	They replied , “ Why does my lord speak this way ? Heaven forbid that we should do such a thing !
CJB	Genesis	44	8	Why , the money we found inside our packs we brought back to you from the land of Kena ‘ an ! So how would we steal silver or gold from your lord ’ s house ?
CJB	Genesis	44	9	Whichever one of us the goblet is found with , let him be put to death — and the rest of us will be my lord ’ s slaves ! ”
CJB	Genesis	44	10	He replied , “ Fine ; let it be as you have said : whichever one it is found with will be my slave . But the rest of you will be blameless. ”
CJB	Genesis	44	11	: Vayigash ( He approached ) 44:18–47:27
CJB	Genesis	44	12	He searched , starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest ; and the goblet was found in the pack belonging to Binyamin .
CJB	Genesis	44	13	At this , they tore their clothes from grief . Then each man loaded up his donkey and returned to the city . ( A : Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	44	14	Y ’ hudah and his brothers arrived at Yosef ’ s house . He was still there , and they fell down before him on the ground . ( S : Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	44	15	Yosef said to them , “ How could you do such a thing ? Don ’ t you know that a man such as myself can learn the truth by divination ? ”
CJB	Genesis	44	16	Y ’ hudah said , “ There ’ s nothing we can say to my lord ! How can we speak ? There ’ s no way we can clear ourselves ! God has revealed your servants ’ guilt ; so here we are , my lord ’ s slaves — both we and also the one in whose possession the cup was found. ”
CJB	Genesis	44	17	But he replied , “ Heaven forbid that I should act in such a way . The man in whose possession the goblet was found will be my slave ; but as for you , go in peace to your father. ” Haftarah Mikketz : M ’ lakhim Alef (
CJB	Genesis	44	1	Kings ) 3:15–4:1 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested reading for Parashah Mikketz : Acts 7:9–16 ( specifically vv . 11–12 ) Parashah
CJB	Genesis	44	18	Then Y ’ hudah approached Yosef and said , “ Please , my lord ! Let your servant say something to you privately ; and don ’ t be angry with your servant , for you are like Pharaoh himself .
CJB	Genesis	44	19	My lord asked his servants , ‘ Do you have a father ? or a brother ? ’
CJB	Genesis	44	20	We answered my lord , ‘ We have a father who is an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one whose brother is dead ; so that of his mother ’ s children he alone is left ; and his father loves him. ’
CJB	Genesis	44	21	But you said to your servants , ‘ Bring him down to me , so that I can see him. ’
CJB	Genesis	44	22	We answered my lord , ‘ The boy can ’ t leave his father ; if he were to leave his father , his father would die. ’
CJB	Genesis	44	23	You said to your servants , ‘ You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you. ’
CJB	Genesis	44	24	We went up to your servant my father and told him what my lord had said ;
CJB	Genesis	44	25	but when our father said , ‘ Go again , and buy us some food , ’
CJB	Genesis	44	26	we answered , ‘ We can ’ t go down . Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go down , because we can ’ t see the man ’ s face unless our youngest brother is with us. ’
CJB	Genesis	44	27	Then your servant my father said to us , ‘ You know that my wife bore me two sons :
CJB	Genesis	44	28	the one went out from me , and I said , “ Surely he has been torn to pieces , ” and I haven ’ t seen him since .
CJB	Genesis	44	29	Now if you take this one away from me too , and something happens to him , you will bring my gray hair down to Sh ’ ol with grief. ’
CJB	Genesis	44	30	So now if I go to your servant my father , and the boy isn ’ t with us — seeing how his heart is bound up with the boy ’ s heart — ( ii )
CJB	Genesis	44	31	when he sees that the boy isn ’ t with us , he will die ; and your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sh ’ ol with grief .
CJB	Genesis	44	32	For your servant himself guaranteed his safety ; I said , ‘ If I fail to bring him to you , then I will bear the blame before my father forever. ’
CJB	Genesis	44	33	Therefore , I beg you , let your servant stay as a slave to my lord instead of the boy , and let the boy go up with his brothers .
CJB	Genesis	44	34	For how can I go up to my father if the boy isn ’ t with me ? I couldn ’ t bear to see my father so overwhelmed by anguish . ”
CJB	Genesis	45	45	At last Yosef could no longer control his feelings in front of his attendants and cried , “ Get everybody away from me ! ” So no one else was with him when Yosef revealed to his brothers who he was .
CJB	Genesis	45	2	He wept aloud , and the Egyptians heard , and Pharaoh ’ s household heard .
CJB	Genesis	45	3	Yosef said to his brothers , “ I am Yosef ! Is it true that my father is still alive ? ” His brothers couldn ’ t answer him , they were so dumbfounded at seeing him .
CJB	Genesis	45	4	Yosef said to his brothers , “ Please ! Come closer. ” And they came closer . He said , “ I am Yosef , your brother , whom you sold into Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	45	5	But don ’ t be sad that you sold me into slavery here or angry at yourselves , because it was God who sent me ahead of you to preserve life .
CJB	Genesis	45	6	The famine has been over the land for the last two years , and for yet another five years there will be neither plowing nor harvest .
CJB	Genesis	45	7	God sent me ahead of you to ensure that you will have descendants on earth and to save your lives in a great deliverance . ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	45	8	So it was not you who sent me here , but God ; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh , lord of all his household and ruler over the whole land of Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	45	9	Hurry , go up to my father , and tell him , ‘ Here is what your son Yosef says : “ God has made me lord of all Egypt ! Come down to me , don ’ t delay !
CJB	Genesis	45	10	You will live in the land of Goshen and be near me — you , your children , your grandchildren , flocks , herds , everything you own .
CJB	Genesis	45	11	I will provide for you there , so that you won ’ t become poverty-stricken , you , your household and all that you have ; because five years of famine are yet to come. ” ’
CJB	Genesis	45	12	Here ! Your own eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Binyamin , that it is my own mouth speaking to you .
CJB	Genesis	45	13	Tell my father how honored I am in Egypt and everything you have seen , and quickly bring my father down here ! ”
CJB	Genesis	45	14	Then he embraced his brother Binyamin and wept , and Binyamin wept on his neck ,
CJB	Genesis	45	15	and he kissed all his brothers and wept on them . After that , his brothers talked with him .
CJB	Genesis	45	16	The report of this reached Pharaoh ’ s house : “ Yosef ’ s brothers have come ” ; and Pharaoh and his servants were pleased .
CJB	Genesis	45	17	Pharaoh said to Yosef , “ Tell your brothers , ‘ Here is what you are to do . Load up your animals , go to the land of Kena ‘ an ,
CJB	Genesis	45	18	take your father and your families , and come back to me . I will give you good property in Egypt , and you will eat the fat of the land . ( iv )
CJB	Genesis	45	19	“ ‘ Moreover — and this is an order — do this : take wagons from the land of Egypt to carry your little ones and your wives , and bring your father , and come .
CJB	Genesis	45	20	Don ’ t worry about your stuff , because everything good in the land of Egypt is yours. ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	45	21	The sons of Isra ’ el acted accordingly ; and Yosef gave them wagons , as Pharaoh had ordered , and gave them provisions for their journey .
CJB	Genesis	45	22	To each of them he gave a set of new clothes ; but to Binyamin he gave seven-and-a-half pounds of silver and five sets of new clothes .
CJB	Genesis	45	23	Likewise , to his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the finest goods Egypt produced , as well as ten female donkeys loaded with grain , bread and food for his father to eat on the return journey .
CJB	Genesis	45	24	Thus he sent his brothers on their way , and they left ; he said to them , “ Don ’ t quarrel among yourselves while you ’ re traveling ! ”
CJB	Genesis	45	25	So they went up out of Egypt , entered the land of Kena ‘ an and came to Ya ‘ akov their father .
CJB	Genesis	45	26	They told him , “ Yosef is still alive ! He is ruler over the whole land of Egypt ! ” He was stunned at the news ; he couldn ’ t believe them .
CJB	Genesis	45	27	So they reported to him everything Yosef had said to them ; but it was only when he saw the wagons which Yosef had sent to carry him that the spirit of Ya ‘ akov their father began to revive . ( v )
CJB	Genesis	45	28	Isra ’ el said , “ Enough ! My son Yosef is still alive ! I must go and see him before I die . ”
CJB	Genesis	46	46	Isra ’ el took everything he owned with him on his journey . He arrived at Be ’ er-Sheva and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Yitz ’ chak .
CJB	Genesis	46	2	In a vision at night God called to Isra ’ el , “ Ya ‘ akov ! Ya ‘ akov ! ” He answered , “ Here I am. ”
CJB	Genesis	46	3	He said , “ I am God , the God of your father . Don ’ t be afraid to go down to Egypt . It is there that I will make you into a great nation .
CJB	Genesis	46	4	Not only will I go down with you to Egypt ; but I will also bring you back here again , after Yosef has closed your eyes. ”
CJB	Genesis	46	5	So Ya ‘ akov left Be ’ er-Sheva ; the sons of Isra ’ el brought Ya ‘ akov their father , their little ones and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry them .
CJB	Genesis	46	6	They took their cattle and their possessions which they had acquired in the land of Kena ‘ an and arrived in Egypt , Ya ‘ akov and all his descendants with him —
CJB	Genesis	46	7	his sons , grandsons , daughters , granddaughters and all his descendants he brought with him into Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	46	8	These are the names of Isra ’ el ’ s children who came into Egypt , Ya ‘ akov and his sons : Re ’ uven Ya ‘ akov ’ s firstborn ;
CJB	Genesis	46	9	and the sons of Re ’ uven — Hanokh , Pallu , Hetzron and Karmi .
CJB	Genesis	46	10	The sons of Shim ‘ on : Y ’ mu ’ el , Yamin , Ohad , Yakhin , Tzochar and Sha ’ ul the son of a Kena ‘ ani woman .
CJB	Genesis	46	11	The sons of Levi : Gershon , K ’ hat and M ’ rari .
CJB	Genesis	46	12	The sons of Y ’ hudah : ‘ Er , Onan , Shelah , Peretz and Zerach ; but ‘ Er and Onan died in the land of Kena ‘ an . The sons of Peretz were Hetzron and Hamul .
CJB	Genesis	46	13	The sons of Yissakhar : Tola , Puvah , Yov and Shimron .
CJB	Genesis	46	14	The sons of Z ’ vulun : Sered , Elon and Yachle ’ el .
CJB	Genesis	46	15	These were the children of Le ’ ah whom she bore to Ya ‘ akov in Paddan-Aram , with his daughter Dinah . In sum , his sons and daughters numbered thirty-three .
CJB	Genesis	46	16	The sons of Gad : Tzifyon , Haggi , Shuni , Etzbon , ‘ Eri , Arodi and Ar ’ eli .
CJB	Genesis	46	17	The children of Asher : Yimnah , Yishvah , Yishvi , B ’ ri ‘ ah , and their sister Serach . The sons of B ’ ri ‘ ah were Hever and Malki ’ el .
CJB	Genesis	46	18	These were the children of Zilpah , whom Lavan gave to Le ’ ah his daughter ; she bore them to Ya ‘ akov — sixteen people .
CJB	Genesis	46	19	The sons of Rachel Ya ‘ akov ’ s wife : Yosef and Binyamin .
CJB	Genesis	46	20	To Yosef in the land of Egypt were born M ’ nasheh and Efrayim , whom Osnat the daughter of Poti-Fera priest of On bore to him .
CJB	Genesis	46	21	The sons of Binyamin : Bela , Bekher , Ashbel , Gera , Na ‘ aman , Echi , Rosh , Mupim , Hupim and Ard .
CJB	Genesis	46	22	These were the children of Rachel who were born to Ya ‘ akov — in sum , fourteen people .
CJB	Genesis	46	23	The sons of Dan : Hushim .
CJB	Genesis	46	24	The sons of Naftali : Yachtze ’ el , Guni , Yetzer and Shillem .
CJB	Genesis	46	25	These were the sons of Bilhah , whom Lavan gave to Rachel his daughter ; she bore them to Ya ‘ akov — in sum , seven people .
CJB	Genesis	46	26	All the people belonging to Ya ‘ akov coming into Egypt , his direct descendants ( not counting Ya ‘ akov ’ s sons ’ wives ) , totaled sixty-six .
CJB	Genesis	46	27	The sons of Yosef , born to him in Egypt , were two in number . Thus all the people in Ya ‘ akov ’ s family who entered Egypt numbered seventy . ( vi )
CJB	Genesis	46	28	Ya ‘ akov sent Y ’ hudah ahead of him to Yosef , so that the latter might guide him on the road to Goshen ; thus they arrived in the land of Goshen .
CJB	Genesis	46	29	Yosef prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet Isra ’ el his father . He presented himself to him , embraced him and wept on his neck for a long time .
CJB	Genesis	46	30	Then Isra ’ el said to Yosef , “ Now I can die , because I have seen your face and seen that you are still alive. ”
CJB	Genesis	46	31	Yosef said to his brothers and his father ’ s family , “ I ’ m going up to tell Pharaoh . I ’ ll say to him , ‘ My brothers and my father ’ s family , who were in the land of Kena ‘ an , have come to me .
CJB	Genesis	46	32	The men are shepherds and keepers of livestock ; they have brought their flocks , their herds and all their possessions. ’
CJB	Genesis	46	33	Now when Pharaoh summons you and asks , ‘ What is your occupation ? ’
CJB	Genesis	46	34	tell him , ‘ Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth until now , both we and our ancestors. ’ This will ensure that you will live in the land of Goshen — for any shepherd is abhorrent to the Egyptians . ”
CJB	Genesis	47	47	Then Yosef went in and told Pharaoh , “ My father and brothers have come from the land of Kena ‘ an with their flocks , livestock and all their possessions ; right now they are in the land of Goshen. ”
CJB	Genesis	47	2	He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh .
CJB	Genesis	47	3	Pharaoh said to his brothers , “ What is your occupation ? ” They answered Pharaoh , “ Your servants are shepherds , both we and our ancestors , ”
CJB	Genesis	47	4	and added , “ We have come to live in the land , because in the land of Kena ‘ an there is no place to pasture your servant ’ s flocks , the famine is so severe there . Therefore , please , let your servants live in the land of Goshen. ”
CJB	Genesis	47	5	Pharaoh said to Yosef , “ Your father and brothers have come to you ,
CJB	Genesis	47	6	and the land of Egypt lies before you . Have your father and brothers live on the best property in the country — let them live in the land of Goshen . Moreover , if you know that some of them are particularly competent , put them in charge of my livestock. ”
CJB	Genesis	47	7	Yosef then brought in Ya ‘ akov his father and presented him to Pharaoh , and Ya ‘ akov blessed Pharaoh .
CJB	Genesis	47	8	Pharaoh asked Ya ‘ akov , “ How old are you ? ”
CJB	Genesis	47	9	and Ya ‘ akov replied , “ The time of my stay on earth has been
CJB	Genesis	47	130	years ; they have been few and difficult , fewer than the years my ancestors lived. ”
CJB	Genesis	47	10	Then Ya ‘ akov blessed Pharaoh and left his presence . ( vii )
CJB	Genesis	47	11	Yosef found a place for his father and brothers and gave them property in the land of Egypt , in the best region of the country , in the land of Ra ‘ amses , as Pharaoh had ordered .
CJB	Genesis	47	12	: Vayechi ( He lived ) 47:28–50:26
CJB	Genesis	47	13	There was no food anywhere , for the famine was very severe , so that both Egypt and Kena ‘ an grew weak from hunger .
CJB	Genesis	47	14	Yosef collected all the money there was in Egypt and Kena ‘ an in exchange for the grain they bought , and put the money in Pharaoh ’ s treasury .
CJB	Genesis	47	15	When all the money in Egypt had been spent , and likewise in Kena ‘ an , all the Egyptians approached Yosef and said , “ Give us something to eat , even though we have no money ; why should we die before your eyes ? ”
CJB	Genesis	47	16	Yosef replied , “ Give me your livestock . If you don ’ t have money , I will give you food in exchange for your livestock. ”
CJB	Genesis	47	17	So they brought Yosef their livestock ; and Yosef gave them food in exchange for the horses , flocks , cattle and donkeys — all that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock .
CJB	Genesis	47	18	When that year was over , they approached Yosef again and said to him , “ We won ’ t hide from my lord that all our money is spent , and the herds of livestock belong to my lord . We have nothing left , as my lord can see , but our bodies and our land .
CJB	Genesis	47	19	Why should we die before your eyes , both we and our land ? Buy us and our land for food , and we and our land will be enslaved to Pharaoh . But also give us seed to plant , so that we can stay alive and not die , and so that the land won ’ t become barren. ”
CJB	Genesis	47	20	So Yosef acquired all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh , as one by one the Egyptians sold their fields , because the famine weighed on them so severely . Thus the land became the property of Pharaoh .
CJB	Genesis	47	21	As for the people , he reduced them to serfdom city by city , from one end of Egypt ’ s territory to the other .
CJB	Genesis	47	22	Only the priests ’ land did he not acquire , because the priests were entitled to provisions from Pharaoh , and they ate from what Pharaoh provided them ; therefore they did not sell their land .
CJB	Genesis	47	23	Then Yosef said to the people , “ As of today I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh . Here is seed for you to sow the land .
CJB	Genesis	47	24	When harvest time comes , you are to give twenty percent to Pharaoh ; eighty percent will be yours to keep for seed to plant in the fields , as well as for your food and for that of your households and your little ones. ” ( Maftir )
CJB	Genesis	47	25	They replied , “ You have saved our lives ! So if it pleases my lord , we will be Pharaoh ’ s slaves. ”
CJB	Genesis	47	26	Yosef made it a law for the country of Egypt , valid to this day , that Pharaoh should have twenty percent . Only the property belonging to the priests did not become Pharaoh ’ s .
CJB	Genesis	47	27	Isra ’ el lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . They acquired possessions in it and were productive , and their numbers multiplied greatly . Haftarah Vayigash : Yechezk ’ el ( Ezekiel ) 37:15–28 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested reading for Parashah Vayigash : Acts 7:9–16 ( specifically vv . 13–15 ) Parashah
CJB	Genesis	47	28	Ya ‘ akov lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years ; thus Ya ‘ akov lived to be
CJB	Genesis	47	147	years old .
CJB	Genesis	47	29	The time came when Isra ’ el was approaching death ; so he called for his son Yosef and said to him , “ If you truly love me , please put your hand under my thigh and pledge that , out of consideration for me , you will not bury me in Egypt .
CJB	Genesis	47	30	Rather , when I sleep with my fathers , you are to carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried. ” He replied , “ I will do as you have said. ”
CJB	Genesis	47	31	He said , “ Swear it to me , ” and he swore to him . Then Isra ’ el bowed down at the head of his bed .
CJB	Genesis	48	48	Awhile later someone told Yosef that his father was ill . He took with him his two sons , M ’ nasheh and Efrayim .
CJB	Genesis	48	2	Ya ‘ akov was told , “ Here comes your son Yosef. ” Isra ’ el gathered his strength and sat up in bed .
CJB	Genesis	48	3	Ya ‘ akov said to Yosef , “ El Shaddai appeared to me at Luz in the land of Kena ‘ an and blessed me ,
CJB	Genesis	48	4	saying to me , ‘ I will make you fruitful and numerous . I will make of you a group of peoples ; and I will give this land to your descendants to possess forever. ’
CJB	Genesis	48	5	Now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt , are mine ; Efrayim and M ’ nasheh will be as much mine as Re ’ uven and Shim ‘ on are .
CJB	Genesis	48	6	The children born to you after them will be yours , but for purposes of inheritance they are to be counted with their older brothers .
CJB	Genesis	48	7	“ Now as for me , when I came from Paddan , Rachel died suddenly , as we were traveling through the land of Kena ‘ an , while we were still some distance from Efrat ; so I buried her there on the way to Efrat ( also known as Beit-Lechem ) . ”
CJB	Genesis	48	8	Then Isra ’ el noticed Yosef ’ s sons and asked , “ Whose are these ? ”
CJB	Genesis	48	9	Yosef answered his father , “ They are my sons , whom God has given me here. ” Ya ‘ akov replied , “ I want you to bring them here to me , so that I can bless them. ” ( ii )
CJB	Genesis	48	10	Now Isra ’ el ’ s eyes were dim with age , so that he could not see . Yosef brought his sons near to him , and he kissed them and embraced them .
CJB	Genesis	48	11	Isra ’ el said to Yosef , “ I never expected to see even you again , but God has allowed me to see your children too ! ”
CJB	Genesis	48	12	Yosef brought them out from between his legs and prostrated himself on the ground .
CJB	Genesis	48	13	Then Yosef took them both , Efrayim in his right hand toward Isra ’ el ’ s left hand and M ’ nasheh in his left hand toward Isra ’ el ’ s right hand , and brought them near to him .
CJB	Genesis	48	14	But Isra ’ el put out his right hand and laid it on the head of the younger one , Efrayim , and put his left hand on the head of M ’ nasheh — he intentionally crossed his hands , even though M ’ nasheh was the firstborn .
CJB	Genesis	48	15	Then he blessed Yosef : “ The God in whose presence my fathers Avraham and Yitz ’ chak lived , the God who has been my own shepherd all my life long to this day ,
CJB	Genesis	48	16	the angel who has rescued me from all harm , bless these boys . May they remember who I am and what I stand for , and likewise my fathers Avraham and Yitz ’ chak , who they were and what they stood for . And may they grow into teeming multitudes on the earth. ” ( iii )
CJB	Genesis	48	17	When Yosef saw that his father was laying his right hand on Efrayim ’ s head , it displeased him , and he lifted up his father ’ s hand to remove it from Efrayim ’ s head and place it instead on M ’ nasheh ’ s head .
CJB	Genesis	48	18	Yosef said to his father , “ Don ’ t do it that way , my father ; for this one is the firstborn . Put your right hand on his head. ”
CJB	Genesis	48	19	But his father refused and said , “ I know that , my son , I know it . He too will become a people , and he too will be great ; nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he , and his descendants will grow into many nations. ”
CJB	Genesis	48	20	Then he added this blessing on them that day : “ Isra ’ el will speak of you in their own blessings by saying , ‘ May God make you like Efrayim and M ’ nasheh. ’ ” Thus he put Efrayim ahead of M ’ nasheh .
CJB	Genesis	48	21	Isra ’ el then said to Yosef , “ You see that I am dying , but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your ancestors .
CJB	Genesis	48	22	Moreover , I am giving to you a sh ’ khem [ shoulder , ridge , share , city of Sh ’ khem ] more than to your brothers ; I captured it from the Emori with my sword and bow . ”
CJB	Genesis	49	49	( iv ) Then Ya ‘ akov called for his sons and said , “ Gather yourselves together , and I will tell you what will happen to you in the acharit-hayamim .
CJB	Genesis	49	2	Assemble yourselves and listen , sons of Ya ‘ akov ; pay attention to Isra ’ el your father .
CJB	Genesis	49	3	“ Re ’ uven , you are my firstborn , my strength , the firstfruits of my manhood .
CJB	Genesis	49	4	Though superior in vigor and power you are unstable as water , so your superiority will end , because you climbed into your father ’ s bed and defiled it — he climbed onto my concubine ’ s couch !
CJB	Genesis	49	5	“ Shim ‘ on and Levi are brothers , related by weapons of violence .
CJB	Genesis	49	6	Let me not enter their council , let my honor not be connected with their people ; for in their anger they killed men , and at their whim they maimed cattle .
CJB	Genesis	49	7	Cursed be their anger , for it has been fierce ; their fury , for it has been cruel . I will divide them in Ya ‘ akov and scatter them in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Genesis	49	8	“ Y ’ hudah , your brothers will acknowledge you , your hand will be on the neck of your enemies , your father ’ s sons will bow down before you .
CJB	Genesis	49	9	Y ’ hudah is a lion ’ s cub ; my son , you stand over the prey . He crouches down and stretches like a lion ; like a lioness , who dares to provoke him ?
CJB	Genesis	49	10	The scepter will not pass from Y ’ hudah , nor the ruler ’ s staff from between his legs , until he comes to whom [ obedience ] belongs ; [ a ] and it is he whom the peoples will obey .
CJB	Genesis	49	11	Tying his donkey to the vine , his donkey ’ s colt to the choice grapevine , he washes his clothes in wine , his robes in the blood of grapes .
CJB	Genesis	49	12	His eyes will be darker than wine , his teeth whiter than milk .
CJB	Genesis	49	13	“ Z ’ vulun will live at the seashore , with ships anchoring along his coast and his border at Tzidon .
CJB	Genesis	49	14	“ Yissakhar is a strong donkey lying down in the sheep sheds .
CJB	Genesis	49	15	On seeing how good is settled life and how pleasant the country , he will bend his back to the burden , and submit to forced labor .
CJB	Genesis	49	16	“ Dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Genesis	49	17	Dan will be a viper on the road , a horned snake in the path that bites the horse ’ s heels so its rider falls off backward .

CJB	Genesis	49	19	“ Gad [ troop ] — a troop will troop on him , but he will troop on their heel .

CJB	Genesis	49	21	“ Naftali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns . [ b ]
CJB	Genesis	49	22	“ Yosef is a fruitful plant , a fruitful plant by a spring , with branches climbing over the wall .
CJB	Genesis	49	23	The archers attacked him fiercely , shooting at him and pressing him hard ;
CJB	Genesis	49	24	but his bow remained taut ; and his arms were made nimble by the hands of the Mighty One of Ya ‘ akov , from there , from the Shepherd , the Stone of Isra ’ el ,
CJB	Genesis	49	25	by the God of your father , who will help you , by El Shaddai , who will bless you with blessings from heaven above , blessings from the deep , lying below , blessings from the breasts and the womb .
CJB	Genesis	49	26	The blessings of your father are more powerful than the blessings of my parents , extending to the farthest of the everlasting hills ; they will be on the head of Yosef , on the brow of the prince among his brothers . ( vi )
CJB	Genesis	49	27	“ Binyamin is a ravenous wolf , in the morning devouring the prey , in the evening still dividing the spoil. ”
CJB	Genesis	49	28	All these are the twelve tribes of Isra ’ el , and this is how their father spoke to them and blessed them , giving each his own individual blessing .
CJB	Genesis	49	29	Then he charged them as follows : “ I am to be gathered to my people . Bury me with my ancestors in the cave that is in the field of ‘ Efron the Hitti ,
CJB	Genesis	49	30	the cave in the field of Makhpelah , by Mamre , in the land of Kena ‘ an , which Avraham bought together with the field from ‘ Efron the Hitti as a burial-place belonging to him —
CJB	Genesis	49	31	there they buried Avraham and his wife Sarah , there they buried Yitz ’ chak and his wife Rivkah , and there I buried Le ’ ah —
CJB	Genesis	49	32	the field and the cave in it , which was purchased from the sons of Het. ”
CJB	Genesis	49	33	When Ya ‘ akov had finished charging his sons , he drew his legs up into the bed , breathed his last and was gathered to his people . Footnotes - Genesis 49:10 or : until Shiloh comes - Genesis 49:21 or : that says beautiful words .
CJB	Genesis	50	50	Yosef fell on his father ’ s face , wept over him and kissed him .
CJB	Genesis	50	2	Then Yosef ordered the physicians in his service to embalm his father . So the physicians embalmed Isra ’ el .
CJB	Genesis	50	3	Forty days were spent at this , the normal amount of time for embalming . Then the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days .
CJB	Genesis	50	4	When the period of mourning was over , Yosef addressed to the household of Pharaoh : “ I would like to ask a favor . Tell Pharaoh ,
CJB	Genesis	50	5	‘ My father had me swear an oath . He said , “ I am going to die . You are to bury me in my grave , which I dug for myself in the land of Kena ‘ an. ” Therefore , I beg you , let me go up and bury my father ; I will return. ’ ”
CJB	Genesis	50	6	Pharaoh responded , “ Go up and bury your father , as he made you swear. ”
CJB	Genesis	50	7	So Yosef went up to bury his father . With him went all Pharaoh ’ s servants , the leaders of his household and the leaders of the land of Egypt ,
CJB	Genesis	50	8	along with the entire household of Yosef , his brothers and his father ’ s household ; only their little ones , their flocks and their cattle did they leave in the land of Goshen .
CJB	Genesis	50	9	Moreover , there went up with him both chariots and horsemen — it was a very large caravan .
CJB	Genesis	50	10	When they arrived at the threshing-floor in Atad , beyond the Yarden , they raised a loud and bitter lamentation , mourning for his father seven days .
CJB	Genesis	50	11	When the local inhabitants , the Kena ‘ ani , saw the mourning on the floor of Atad they said , “ How bitterly the Egyptians are mourning ! ” This is why the place was given the name Avel-Mitzrayim [ mourning of Egypt ] , there beyond the Yarden .
CJB	Genesis	50	12	His sons did to him as he had ordered them to do —
CJB	Genesis	50	13	they carried him into the land of Kena ‘ an and buried him in the cave in the field of Makhpelah , which Avraham had bought , along with the field , as a burial-place belonging to him , from ‘ Efron the Hitti , by Mamre .
CJB	Genesis	50	14	Then , after burying his father , Yosef returned to Egypt , he , his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father .
CJB	Genesis	50	15	Realizing that their father was dead , Yosef ’ s brothers said , “ Yosef may hate us now and pay us back in full for all the suffering we caused him. ”
CJB	Genesis	50	16	So they sent a message to Yosef which said , “ Your father gave this order before he died :
CJB	Genesis	50	17	‘ Say to Yosef , “ I beg you now , please forgive your brothers ’ crime and wickedness in doing you harm. ” ’ So now , we beg of you , forgive the crime of the servants of the God of your father. ” Yosef wept when they spoke to him ;
CJB	Genesis	50	18	and his brothers too came , prostrated themselves before him and said , “ Here , we are your slaves. ”
CJB	Genesis	50	19	But Yosef said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! Am I in the place of God ?
CJB	Genesis	50	20	You meant to do me harm , but God meant it for good — so that it would come about as it is today , with many people ’ s lives being saved . ( vii )
CJB	Genesis	50	21	So don ’ t be afraid — I will provide for you and your little ones. ” In this way he comforted them , speaking kindly to them .
CJB	Genesis	50	22	Yosef continued living in Egypt , he and his father ’ s household . Yosef lived
CJB	Genesis	50	110	, and they embalmed him and put him in a coffin in Egypt . Haftarah Vayechi : M ’ lakhim Alef (
CJB	Genesis	50	23	Yosef lived to see Efrayim ’ s great-grandchildren , and the children of M ’ nasheh ’ s son Makhir were born on Yosef ’ s knees .
CJB	Genesis	50	24	Yosef said to his brothers , “ I am dying . But God will surely remember you and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov. ”
CJB	Genesis	50	25	Then Yosef took an oath from the sons of Isra ’ el : “ God will surely remember you , and you are to carry my bones up from here. ”
CJB	Genesis	50	26	So Yosef died at the age of
CJB	Genesis	50	1	Peter ) 1:3–9 ; 2:11–17 Hazak , hazak , v ’ nit ’ chazek ! Be strong , be strong , and let us be strengthened !
CJB	Exodus	1	1	These are the names of the sons of Isra ’ el who came into Egypt with Ya ‘ akov ; each man came with his household :
CJB	Exodus	1	13	and worked them relentlessly ,
CJB	Exodus	1	2	Re ’ uven , Shim ‘ on , Levi , Y ’ hudah ,
CJB	Exodus	1	3	Yissakhar , Z ’ vulun , Binyamin ,
CJB	Exodus	1	4	Dan , Naftali , Gad and Asher .
CJB	Exodus	1	5	All told , there were seventy descendants of Ya ‘ akov ; Yosef was already in Egypt .
CJB	Exodus	1	6	Yosef died , as did all his brothers and all that generation .
CJB	Exodus	1	7	The descendants of Isra ’ el were fruitful , increased abundantly , multiplied and grew very powerful ; the land became filled with them .
CJB	Exodus	1	8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt . He knew nothing about Yosef
CJB	Exodus	1	9	but said to his people , “ Look , the descendants of Isra ’ el have become a people too numerous and powerful for us .
CJB	Exodus	1	10	Come , let ’ s use wisdom in dealing with them . Otherwise , they ’ ll continue to multiply ; and in the event of war they might ally themselves with our enemies , fight against us and leave the land altogether. ”
CJB	Exodus	1	11	So they put slavemasters over them to oppress them with forced labor , and they built for Pharaoh the storage cities of Pitom and Ra ‘ amses .
CJB	Exodus	1	12	But the more the Egyptians oppressed them , the more they multiplied and expanded , until the Egyptians came to dread the people of Isra ’ el
CJB	Exodus	1	14	making their lives bitter with hard labor — digging clay , making bricks , all kinds of field work ; and in all this toil they were shown no mercy .
CJB	Exodus	1	15	Moreover , the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives , one of whom was called Shifrah and the other Pu ‘ ah .
CJB	Exodus	1	16	“ When you attend the Hebrew women and see them giving birth , ” he said , “ if it ’ s a boy , kill him ; but if it ’ s a girl , let her live. ”
CJB	Exodus	1	17	However , the midwives were God-fearing women , so they didn ’ t do as the king of Egypt ordered but let the boys live . ( ii )
CJB	Exodus	1	18	The king of Egypt summoned the midwives and demanded of them , “ Why have you done this and let the boys live ? ”
CJB	Exodus	1	19	The midwives answered Pharaoh , “ It ’ s because the Hebrew women aren ’ t like the Egyptian women — they go into labor and give birth before the midwife arrives. ”
CJB	Exodus	1	20	Therefore God prospered the midwives , and the people continued to multiply and grow very powerful .
CJB	Exodus	1	21	Indeed , because the midwives feared God , he made them founders of families .
CJB	Exodus	1	22	Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people : “ Every boy that is born , throw in the river ; but let all the girls live . ”
CJB	Exodus	2	2	When she conceived and had a son , upon seeing what a fine child he was , she hid him for three months .
CJB	Exodus	2	3	When she could no longer hide him , she took a papyrus basket , coated it with clay and tar , put the child in it and placed it among the reeds on the riverbank .
CJB	Exodus	2	4	His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him .
CJB	Exodus	2	5	The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the river while her maids-in-attendance walked along the riverside . Spotting the basket among the reeds , she sent her slave-girl to get it .
CJB	Exodus	2	6	She opened it and looked inside , and there in front of her was a crying baby boy ! Moved with pity , she said , “ This must be one of the Hebrews ’ children. ”
CJB	Exodus	2	7	At this point , his sister said to Pharaoh ’ s daughter , “ Would you like me to go and find you one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you ? ”
CJB	Exodus	2	8	Pharaoh ’ s daughter answered , “ Yes , go. ” So the girl went and called the baby ’ s own mother .
CJB	Exodus	2	9	Pharaoh ’ s daughter told her , “ Take this child away , and nurse it for me , and I will pay you for doing it. ” So the woman took the child and nursed it .
CJB	Exodus	2	10	Then , when the child had grown some , she brought him to Pharaoh ’ s daughter ; and she began to raise him as her son . She called him Moshe [ pull out ] , explaining , “ Because I pulled him out of the water. ” ( iii )
CJB	Exodus	2	11	One day , when Moshe was a grown man , he went out to visit his kinsmen ; and he watched them struggling at forced labor . He saw an Egyptian strike a Hebrew , one of his kinsmen .
CJB	Exodus	2	12	He looked this way and that ; and when he saw that no one was around , he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand .
CJB	Exodus	2	13	The next day , he went out and saw two Hebrew men fighting with each other . To the one in the wrong he said , “ Why are you hitting your companion ? ”
CJB	Exodus	2	14	He retorted , “ Who appointed you ruler and judge over us ? Do you intend to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian ? ” Moshe became frightened . “ Clearly , ” he thought , “ the matter has become known. ”
CJB	Exodus	2	15	When Pharaoh heard of it , he tried to have Moshe put to death . But Moshe fled from Pharaoh to live in the land of Midyan . One day , as he was sitting by a well ,
CJB	Exodus	2	16	the seven daughters of the priest of Midyan came to draw water . They had filled the troughs to water their father ’ s sheep ,
CJB	Exodus	2	17	when the shepherds came and tried to drive them away . But Moshe got up and defended them ; then he watered their sheep .
CJB	Exodus	2	18	When they came to Re ‘ u ’ el their father , he said , “ How come you ’ re back so soon today ? ”
CJB	Exodus	2	19	They answered , “ An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds ; more than that , he drew water for us and watered the sheep. ”
CJB	Exodus	2	20	He asked his daughters , “ Where is he ? Why did you leave the man there ? Invite him to have something to eat. ”
CJB	Exodus	2	21	Moshe was glad to stay on with the man , and he gave Moshe his daughter Tzipporah in marriage .
CJB	Exodus	2	22	She gave birth to a son , and he named him Gershom [ foreigner there ] , for he said , “ I have been a foreigner in a foreign land. ”
CJB	Exodus	2	23	Sometime during those many years the king of Egypt died , but the people of Isra ’ el still groaned under the yoke of slavery , and they cried out , and their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God .
CJB	Exodus	2	24	God heard their groaning , and God remembered his covenant with Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Exodus	2	25	God saw the people of Isra ’ el , and God acknowledged them .
CJB	Exodus	3	3	Moshe said , “ I ’ m going to go over and see this amazing sight and find out why the bush isn ’ t being burned up. ”
CJB	Exodus	3	2	The angel of Adonai appeared to him in a fire blazing from the middle of a bush . He looked and saw that although the bush was flaming with fire , yet the bush was not being burned up .
CJB	Exodus	3	4	When Adonai saw that he had gone over to see , God called to him from the middle of the bush , “ Moshe ! Moshe ! ” He answered , “ Here I am. ”
CJB	Exodus	3	5	He said , “ Don ’ t come any closer ! Take your sandals off your feet , because the place where you are standing is holy ground .
CJB	Exodus	3	6	I am the God of your father , ” he continued , “ the God of Avraham , the God of Yitz ’ chak and the God of Ya ‘ akov. ” Moshe covered his face , because he was afraid to look at God .
CJB	Exodus	3	7	Adonai said , “ I have seen how my people are being oppressed in Egypt and heard their cry for release from their slavemasters , because I know their pain .
CJB	Exodus	3	8	I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that country to a good and spacious land , a land flowing with milk and honey , the place of the Kena ‘ ani , Hitti , Emori , P ’ rizi , Hivi and Y ’ vusi .
CJB	Exodus	3	9	Yes , the cry of the people of Isra ’ el has come to me , and I have seen how terribly the Egyptians oppress them .
CJB	Exodus	3	10	Therefore , now , come ; and I will send you to Pharaoh ; so that you can lead my people , the descendants of Isra ’ el , out of Egypt. ”
CJB	Exodus	3	11	Moshe said to God , “ Who am I , that I should go to Pharaoh and lead the people of Isra ’ el out of Egypt ? ”
CJB	Exodus	3	12	He replied , “ I will surely be with you . Your sign that I have sent you will be that when you have led the people out of Egypt , you will worship God on this mountain. ”
CJB	Exodus	3	13	Moshe said to God , “ Look , when I appear before the people of Isra ’ el and say to them , ‘ The God of your ancestors has sent me to you ’ ; and they ask me , ‘ What is his name ? ’ what am I to tell them ? ”
CJB	Exodus	3	14	God said to Moshe , “ Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh [ I am/will be what I am/will be ] , ” and added , “ Here is what to say to the people of Isra ’ el : ‘ Ehyeh [ I Am or I Will Be ] has sent me to you. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	3	15	God said further to Moshe , “ Say this to the people of Isra ’ el : ‘ Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh [ Adonai ] , the God of your fathers , the God of Avraham , the God of Yitz ’ chak and the God of Ya ‘ akov , has sent me to you. ’ This is my name forever ; this is how I am to be remembered generation after generation . ( v )
CJB	Exodus	3	16	Go , gather the leaders of Isra ’ el together , and say to them , ‘ Adonai , the God of your fathers , the God of Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov , has appeared to me and said , “ I have been paying close attention to you and have seen what is being done to you in Egypt ;
CJB	Exodus	3	17	and I have said that I will lead you up out of the misery of Egypt to the land of the Kena ‘ ani , Hitti , Emori , P ’ rizi , Hivi and Y ’ vusi , to a land flowing with milk and honey. ” ’
CJB	Exodus	3	18	They will heed what you say . Then you will come , you and the leaders of Isra ’ el , before the king of Egypt ; and you will tell him , ‘ Adonai , the God of the Hebrews , has met with us . Now , please , let us go three days ’ journey into the desert ; so that we can sacrifice to Adonai our God. ’
CJB	Exodus	3	19	I know that the king of Egypt will not let you leave unless he is forced to do so .
CJB	Exodus	3	20	But I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will do there . After that , he will let you go .
CJB	Exodus	3	21	Moreover , I will make the Egyptians so well-disposed toward this people that when you go , you won ’ t go empty-handed .
CJB	Exodus	3	22	Rather , all the women will ask their neighbors and house guests for silver and gold jewelry and clothing , with which you will dress your own sons and daughters . In this way you will plunder the Egyptians . ”
CJB	Exodus	4	4	Then Adonai said to Moshe , “ Put your hand out and take it by the tail. ” He reached out with his hand and took hold of it , and it became a staff in his hand .
CJB	Exodus	4	2	Adonai answered him , “ What is that in your hand ? ” and he said , “ A staff. ”
CJB	Exodus	4	3	He said , “ Throw it on the ground ! ” and he threw it on the ground . It turned into a snake , and Moshe recoiled from it .
CJB	Exodus	4	5	“ This is so that they will believe that Adonai , the God of their fathers , the God of Avraham , the God of Yitz ’ chak and the God of Ya ‘ akov , has appeared to you ! ”
CJB	Exodus	4	6	Furthermore Adonai said to him , “ Now put your hand inside your coat. ” He put his hand in his coat ; and when he took it out his hand was leprous , as white as snow .
CJB	Exodus	4	7	Then God said , “ Now put your hand back in your coat. ” He put his hand back in his coat ; and when he took it out , it was as healthy as the rest of his body .
CJB	Exodus	4	8	“ If they won ’ t believe you or heed the evidence of the first sign , they will be convinced by the second .
CJB	Exodus	4	9	But if they aren ’ t persuaded even by both these signs and still won ’ t listen to what you say , then take some water from the river , and pour it on the ground . The water you take from the river will turn into blood on the dry land. ”
CJB	Exodus	4	10	Moshe said to Adonai , “ Oh , Adonai , I ’ m a terrible speaker . I always have been , and I ’ m no better now , even after you ’ ve spoken to your servant ! My words come slowly , my tongue moves slowly. ”
CJB	Exodus	4	11	Adonai answered him , “ Who gives a person a mouth ? Who makes a person dumb or deaf , keen-sighted or blind ? Isn ’ t it I , Adonai ?
CJB	Exodus	4	12	Now , therefore , go ; and I will be with your mouth and will teach you what to say. ”
CJB	Exodus	4	13	But he replied , “ Please , Lord , send someone else — anyone you want ! ”
CJB	Exodus	4	14	At this , Adonai ’ s anger blazed up against Moshe ; he said , “ Don ’ t you have a brother , Aharon the Levi ? I know that he ’ s a good speaker . In fact , here he is now , coming out to meet you ; and he ’ ll be happy to see you .
CJB	Exodus	4	15	You will speak to him and put the words in his mouth ; and I will be with your mouth and his , teaching you both what to do .
CJB	Exodus	4	16	Thus he will be your spokesman to the people , in effect ; for you , he will be a mouth ; and for him , you will be like God .
CJB	Exodus	4	17	Now take this staff in your hand , because you need it to perform the signs. ” ( vi )
CJB	Exodus	4	18	Moshe left , returned to Yitro his father-in-law and said to him , “ I beg you to let me go and return to my kinsmen in Egypt , to see if they are still alive. ” Yitro said to Moshe , “ Go in peace. ”
CJB	Exodus	4	19	Adonai said to Moshe in Midyan , “ Go on back to Egypt , because all the men who wanted to kill you are dead. ”
CJB	Exodus	4	20	So Moshe took his wife and sons , put them on a donkey , and started out for Egypt . Moshe took God ’ s staff in his hand .
CJB	Exodus	4	21	Adonai said to Moshe , “ When you get back to Egypt , make sure that you do before Pharaoh every one of the wonders I have enabled you to do . Nevertheless , I am going to make him hardhearted , and he will refuse to let the people go .
CJB	Exodus	4	22	Then you are to tell Pharaoh : ‘ Adonai says , “ Isra ’ el is my firstborn son .
CJB	Exodus	4	23	I have told you to let my son go in order to worship me , but you have refused to let him go . Well , then , I will kill your firstborn son ! ” ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	4	24	At a lodging-place on the way , Adonai met Moshe and would have killed him ,
CJB	Exodus	4	25	had not Tzipporah taken a flintstone and cut off the foreskin of her son . She threw it at his feet , saying , “ What a bloody bridegroom you are for me ! ”
CJB	Exodus	4	26	But then , God let Moshe be . She added , “ A bloody bridegroom because of the circumcision ! ”
CJB	Exodus	4	27	Adonai said to Aharon , “ Go into the desert to meet Moshe. ” He went , met him at the mountain of God and kissed him .
CJB	Exodus	4	28	Moshe told him everything Adonai had said in sending him , including all the signs he had ordered him to perform .
CJB	Exodus	4	29	Then Moshe and Aharon went and gathered together all the leaders of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Exodus	4	30	Aharon said everything Adonai had told Moshe , who then performed the signs for the people to see .
CJB	Exodus	4	31	The people believed ; when they heard that Adonai had remembered the people of Isra ’ el and seen how they were oppressed , they bowed their heads and worshipped .
CJB	Exodus	5	5	Look ! ” Pharaoh added , “ the population of the land has grown , yet you are trying to have them stop working ! ”
CJB	Exodus	5	2	But Pharaoh replied , “ Who is Adonai , that I should obey when he says to let Isra ’ el go ? I don ’ t know Adonai , and I also won ’ t let Isra ’ el go. ”
CJB	Exodus	5	3	They said , “ The God of the Hebrews has met with us . Please let us go three days ’ journey into the desert , so that we can sacrifice to Adonai our God . Otherwise , he may strike us with a plague or with the sword. ”
CJB	Exodus	5	4	The king of Egypt answered them , “ Moshe and Aharon , what do you mean by taking the people away from their work ? Get back to your labor !
CJB	Exodus	5	6	That same day Pharaoh ordered the slavemasters and the people ’ s foremen ,
CJB	Exodus	5	7	“ You are no longer to provide straw for the bricks the people are making , as you did before . Let them go and gather straw for themselves .
CJB	Exodus	5	8	But you will require them to produce the same quantity of bricks as before , don ’ t reduce it , because they ’ re lazing around . This is why they ’ re crying , ‘ Let us go and sacrifice to our God. ’
CJB	Exodus	5	9	Give these people harder work to do . That will keep them too busy to pay attention to speeches full of lies. ”
CJB	Exodus	5	10	The people ’ s slavemasters went out , their foremen too , and said to the people , “ Here is what Pharaoh says : ‘ I will no longer give you straw .
CJB	Exodus	5	11	You go , yourselves , and get straw wherever you can find it . But your output is not to be reduced. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	5	12	So the people were dispersed throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw .
CJB	Exodus	5	13	The slavemasters kept pressing them . “ Keep working ! Make your daily quota , just as when straw was provided. ”
CJB	Exodus	5	14	The foremen of the people of Isra ’ el , whom Pharaoh ’ s slavemasters had appointed to be over them , were flogged and asked , “ Why haven ’ t you fulfilled your quota of bricks yesterday and today , as you did formerly ? ”
CJB	Exodus	5	15	Then the foremen of the people of Isra ’ el came and complained to Pharaoh : “ Why are you treating your servants this way ?
CJB	Exodus	5	16	No straw is given to your servants , yet they keep telling us to make bricks . And now your servants are being flogged , but the fault lies with your own people. ”
CJB	Exodus	5	17	“ Lazy ! ” he retorted , “ You ’ re just lazy ! That ’ s why you say , ‘ Let us go and sacrifice to Adonai. ’
CJB	Exodus	5	18	Get going now , and get back to work ! No straw will be given to you , and you will still deliver the full amount of bricks. ”
CJB	Exodus	5	19	When they said , “ You are not to reduce your daily production quota of bricks , ” the foremen of the people of Isra ’ el could see that they were in deep trouble .
CJB	Exodus	5	20	As they were leaving Pharaoh , they encountered Moshe and Aharon standing by the road ;
CJB	Exodus	5	21	and they said to them , “ May Adonai look at you and judge accordingly , because you have made us utterly abhorrent in the view of Pharaoh and his servants , and you have put a sword in their hands to kill us ! ” ( Maftir )
CJB	Exodus	5	22	Moshe returned to Adonai and said , “ Adonai , why have you treated this people so terribly ? What has been the value of sending me ?
CJB	Exodus	5	23	For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name , he has dealt terribly with this people ! And you haven ’ t rescued your people at all ! ”
CJB	Exodus	6	6	“ Therefore , say to the people of Isra ’ el : ‘ I am Adonai . I will free you from the forced labor of the Egyptians , rescue you from their oppression , and redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments .
CJB	Exodus	6	14	These were the heads of their families : the sons of Re ’ uven the firstborn of Isra ’ el were Hanokh , Pallu , Hetzron and Karmi . These were the families of Re ’ uven .
CJB	Exodus	6	2	God spoke to Moshe ; he said to him , “ I am Adonai .
CJB	Exodus	6	3	I appeared to Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov as El Shaddai , although I did not make myself known to them by my name , Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh [ Adonai ] .
CJB	Exodus	6	4	Also with them I established my covenant to give them the land of Kena ‘ an , the land where they wandered about and lived as foreigners .
CJB	Exodus	6	5	Moreover , I have heard the groaning of the people of Isra ’ el , whom the Egyptians are keeping in slavery ; and I have remembered my covenant .
CJB	Exodus	6	7	I will take you as my people , and I will be your God . Then you will know that I am Adonai your God , who freed you from the forced labor of the Egyptians .
CJB	Exodus	6	8	I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov — I will give it to you as your inheritance . I am Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	6	9	Moshe said this to the people of Isra ’ el . But they wouldn ’ t listen to him , because they were so discouraged , and their slavery was so cruel .
CJB	Exodus	6	10	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Exodus	6	11	“ Go in ; and tell Pharaoh , king of Egypt , to let the people of Isra ’ el leave his land. ”
CJB	Exodus	6	12	Moshe said to Adonai , “ Look , the people of Isra ’ el haven ’ t listened to me ; so how will Pharaoh listen to me , poor speaker that I am ? ”
CJB	Exodus	6	13	But Adonai spoke to Moshe and Aharon and gave them orders concerning both the people of Isra ’ el and Pharaoh , king of Egypt , to bring the people of Isra ’ el out of the land of Egypt . ( ii )
CJB	Exodus	6	15	The sons of Shim ‘ on were Y ’ mu ’ el , Yamin , Ohad , Yakhin , Tzochar and Sha ’ ul the son of a Kena ‘ ani woman . These were the families of Shim ‘ on .
CJB	Exodus	6	16	These are the names of the sons of Levi with their descendants : Gershon , K ’ hat and M ’ rari . Levi lived to be
CJB	Exodus	6	137	years old .
CJB	Exodus	6	17	The sons of Gershon were Livni and Shim ‘ i , with their families .
CJB	Exodus	6	18	The sons of K ’ hat were ‘ Amram , Yitz ’ har , Hevron and ‘ Uzi ’ el . K ’ hat lived to be
CJB	Exodus	6	133	years old .
CJB	Exodus	6	19	The sons of M ’ rari were Machli and Mushi . These were the families of Levi with their descendants .
CJB	Exodus	6	20	‘ Amram married Yokheved his father ’ s sister , and she bore him Aharon and Moshe . ‘ Amram lived to be

CJB	Exodus	6	25	El ‘ azar the son of Aharon married one of the daughters of Puti ’ el , and she bore him Pinchas . These were the heads of the families of Levi , family by family .
CJB	Exodus	6	26	These are the Aharon and Moshe to whom Adonai said , “ Bring the people of Isra ’ el out of the land of Egypt , division by division , ”
CJB	Exodus	6	27	and who told Pharaoh king of Egypt , to let the people of Isra ’ el leave Egypt . These are the same Moshe and Aharon .
CJB	Exodus	6	28	On the day when Adonai spoke to Moshe in the land of Egypt , ( iii )
CJB	Exodus	6	29	he said , “ I am Adonai . Tell Pharaoh , king of Egypt , everything I say to you. ”
CJB	Exodus	6	30	Moshe answered Adonai , “ Look , I ’ m such a poor speaker that Pharaoh won ’ t listen to me . ”
CJB	Exodus	7	7	Moshe was eighty years old and Aharon eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh . ( iv )
CJB	Exodus	7	2	You are to say everything I order you , and Aharon your brother is to speak to Pharaoh and tell him to let the people of Isra ’ el leave his land .
CJB	Exodus	7	3	But I will make him hardhearted . Even though I will increase my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt ,
CJB	Exodus	7	4	Pharaoh will not listen to you . Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my armies , my people the sons of Isra ’ el , out of the land of Egypt with great acts of judgment .
CJB	Exodus	7	5	Then , when I stretch out my hand over Egypt and bring the people of Isra ’ el out from among them , the Egyptians will know that I am Adonai. ”
CJB	Exodus	7	6	Moshe and Aharon did exactly what Adonai ordered them to do .
CJB	Exodus	7	8	Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon ,
CJB	Exodus	7	9	“ When Pharaoh says to you , ‘ Perform a miracle , ’ tell Aharon to take his staff and throw it down in front of Pharaoh , so that it can become a snake. ”
CJB	Exodus	7	10	Moshe and Aharon went in to Pharaoh and did this , as Adonai had ordered — Aharon threw down his staff in front of Pharaoh and his servants , and it turned into a snake .
CJB	Exodus	7	11	But Pharaoh in turn called for the sages and sorcerers ; and they too , the magicians of Egypt , did the same thing , making use of their secret arts .
CJB	Exodus	7	12	Each one threw his staff down , and they turned into snakes . But Aharon ’ s staff swallowed up theirs .
CJB	Exodus	7	13	Nevertheless , Pharaoh was made hardhearted ; and he didn ’ t listen to them , as Adonai had said would happen .
CJB	Exodus	7	14	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Pharaoh is stubborn . He refuses to let the people go .
CJB	Exodus	7	15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning when he goes out to the water . Stand on the riverbank to confront him , take in your hand the staff which was turned into a snake ,
CJB	Exodus	7	16	and say to him , ‘ Adonai , the God of the Hebrews , sent me to you to say : “ Let my people go , so that they can worship me in the desert. ” But until now you haven ’ t listened ;
CJB	Exodus	7	17	so Adonai says , “ This will let you know that I am Adonai ” : I will take the staff in my hand and strike the water in the river , and it will be turned into blood .
CJB	Exodus	7	18	The fish in the river will die , the river will stink and the Egyptians won ’ t want to drink water from the river. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	7	19	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Say to Aharon , ‘ Take your staff , reach out your hand over the waters of Egypt , over their rivers , canals , ponds and all their reservoirs , so that they can turn into blood . There will be blood throughout the whole land of Egypt , even in the wooden buckets and stone jars. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	7	20	Moshe and Aharon did exactly what Adonai had ordered . He raised the staff and , in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants , struck the water in the river ; and all the water in the river was turned into blood .
CJB	Exodus	7	21	The fish in the river died , and the river stank so badly that the Egyptians couldn ’ t drink its water . There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
CJB	Exodus	7	22	But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts , so that Pharaoh was made hardhearted and didn ’ t listen to them , as Adonai had said would happen .
CJB	Exodus	7	23	Pharaoh just turned and went back to his palace , without taking any of this to heart .
CJB	Exodus	7	24	All the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink , because they couldn ’ t drink the river water .
CJB	Exodus	7	25	Seven days after Adonai had struck the river ,
CJB	Exodus	7	26	( 8:1 ) Adonai said to Moshe , “ Go in to Pharaoh and say to him , ‘ Here is what Adonai says : “ Let my people go , so that they can worship me .
CJB	Exodus	7	27	( 8:2 ) If you refuse to let them go , I will strike all your territory with frogs .
CJB	Exodus	7	28	( 8:3 ) The river will swarm with frogs . They will go up , enter your palace and go into your bedroom , onto your bed . They will enter the houses of your servants and your people and go into your ovens and kneading bowls .
CJB	Exodus	7	29	( 8:4 ) The frogs will climb all over you , your people and your servants . ” ’ ”

Just make sure that Pharaoh stops playing games with the people by preventing them from going and sacrificing to Adonai. ”
CJB	Exodus	8	30	) Moshe left Pharaoh and interceded with Adonai ,
CJB	Exodus	8	31	) and Adonai did what Moshe had asked : he removed the swarms of insects from Pharaoh , his servants and his people — not one remained .
CJB	Exodus	8	32	) But this time , too , Pharaoh made himself stubborn and didn ’ t let the people go .
CJB	Exodus	9	9	They will turn into fine dust over all the land of Egypt and become infected sores on men and animals throughout Egypt. ”
CJB	Exodus	9	2	Corinthians 6:14–7:1
CJB	Exodus	9	3	the hand of Adonai is on your livestock in the field — on the horses , donkeys , camels , cattle and flocks — and will make them suffer a devastating illness .
CJB	Exodus	9	4	But Adonai will distinguish between Egypt ’ s and Isra ’ el ’ s livestock — nothing belonging to the people of Isra ’ el will die. ” ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	9	5	Adonai determined the exact time by saying , “ Tomorrow Adonai will do this in the land. ”
CJB	Exodus	9	6	The following day , Adonai did it — all the livestock of Egypt died ; but not one of the animals belonging to the people of Isra ’ el died .
CJB	Exodus	9	7	Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the people of Isra ’ el had died . Nevertheless , Pharaoh ’ s heart remained stubborn , and he didn ’ t let the people go .
CJB	Exodus	9	8	Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon , “ Take handfuls of ashes from a kiln , and let Moshe throw them in the air before Pharaoh ’ s eyes .
CJB	Exodus	9	10	So they took ashes from a kiln , stood in front of Pharaoh and threw them in the air ; and they became infected sores on men and animals .
CJB	Exodus	9	11	The magicians couldn ’ t even stand in Moshe ’ s presence because of the sores , which were on them as well as on the other Egyptians .
CJB	Exodus	9	12	But Adonai made Pharaoh hardhearted , so that he didn ’ t listen to them — just as Adonai had said to Moshe .
CJB	Exodus	9	13	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Get up early in the morning , stand before Pharaoh , and say to him , ‘ Here is what Adonai says : “ Let my people go , so that they can worship me .
CJB	Exodus	9	14	For this time , I will inflict my plagues on you , yourself , and on your officials and your people ; so that you will realize that I am without equal in all the earth .
CJB	Exodus	9	15	By now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with such severe plagues that you would have been wiped off the earth .
CJB	Exodus	9	16	But it is for this very reason that I have kept you alive — to show you my power , and so that my name may resound throughout the whole earth . ( vii )
CJB	Exodus	9	17	Since you are still setting yourself up against my people and not letting them go ,
CJB	Exodus	9	18	tomorrow , about this time , I will cause a hailstorm so heavy that Egypt has had nothing like it from the day it was founded until now .
CJB	Exodus	9	19	Therefore , send and hurry to bring indoors all your livestock and everything else you have in the field . For hail will fall on every human being and animal left in the field that hasn ’ t been brought home , and they will die. ” ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	9	20	Whoever among Pharaoh ’ s servants feared what Adonai had said had his slaves and livestock escape into the houses ;
CJB	Exodus	9	21	but those who had no regard for what Adonai had said left their slaves and livestock in the field .
CJB	Exodus	9	22	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Reach out your hand toward the sky , so that there will be hail in all the land of Egypt , falling on people , animals and everything growing in the field , throughout the land of Egypt. ”
CJB	Exodus	9	23	Moshe reached out with his staff toward the sky , and Adonai sent thunder and hail , and fire ran down to the earth . Adonai caused it to hail on the land of Egypt —
CJB	Exodus	9	24	it hailed , and fire flashed up with the hail ; it was terrible , worse than any hailstorm in all of Egypt since it became a nation .
CJB	Exodus	9	25	Throughout all the land of Egypt , the hail struck everything in the field , people and animals ; and the hail struck every plant growing in the field and broke every tree there .
CJB	Exodus	9	26	But in the land of Goshen , where the people of Isra ’ el were , there was no hail .
CJB	Exodus	9	27	Pharaoh summoned Moshe and Aharon and said to them , “ This time I have sinned : Adonai is in the right ; I and my people are in the wrong .
CJB	Exodus	9	28	Intercede with Adonai — we can ’ t take any more of this terrible thunder and hail ; and I will let you go , you will stay no longer. ”
CJB	Exodus	9	29	Moshe said to him , “ As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread out my hands to Adonai ; the thunder will end , and there won ’ t be any more hail — so that you can know that the earth belongs to Adonai .
CJB	Exodus	9	30	But you and your servants , I know you still won ’ t fear Adonai , God. ”
CJB	Exodus	9	31	The flax and barley were ruined , because the barley was ripe and the flax in bud .
CJB	Exodus	9	32	But the wheat and buckwheat were not ruined , because they come up later . ( Maftir )
CJB	Exodus	9	33	Moshe went out of the city , away from Pharaoh , and spread out his hands to Adonai . The thunder and hail ended , and the rain stopped pouring down on the earth .
CJB	Exodus	9	34	When Pharaoh saw that the rain , hail and thunder had ended , he sinned still more by making himself hardhearted , he and his servants .
CJB	Exodus	9	35	Pharaoh was made hardhearted , and he didn ’ t let the people of Isra ’ el go , just as Adonai had said through Moshe . Haftarah Va ’ era : Yechezk ’ el ( Ezekiel ) 28:25–29:21 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Va ’ era : Romans 9:14–17 ;
CJB	Exodus	10	10	Pharaoh said to them , “ Adonai certainly will be with you if I ever let you go with your children ! It ’ s clear that you are up to no good .
CJB	Exodus	10	15	They completely covered the ground , so that the ground looked black . They ate every plant growing from the ground and all the fruit of the trees left by the hail . Not one green thing remained , not a tree and not a plant in the field , in all the land of Egypt .
CJB	Exodus	10	2	so that you can tell your son and grandson about what I did to Egypt and about my signs that I demonstrated among them , and so that you will all know that I am Adonai. ”
CJB	Exodus	10	3	Moshe and Aharon went in to Pharaoh and said to him , “ Here is what Adonai , God of the Hebrews , says : ‘ How much longer will you refuse to submit to me ? Let my people go , so that they can worship me .
CJB	Exodus	10	4	Otherwise , if you refuse to let my people go , tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory .
CJB	Exodus	10	5	One won ’ t be able to see the ground , so completely will the locusts cover it . They will eat anything you still have that escaped the hail , including every tree you have growing in the field .
CJB	Exodus	10	6	They will fill your houses and those of your servants and of all the Egyptians . It will be like nothing your fathers or their fathers have ever seen since the day they were born until today. ’ ” Then he turned his back and left .
CJB	Exodus	10	7	Pharaoh ’ s servants said to him , “ How much longer must this fellow be a snare for us ? Let the people go and worship Adonai their God . Don ’ t you understand yet that Egypt is being destroyed ? ”
CJB	Exodus	10	8	So Moshe and Aharon were brought to Pharaoh again , and he said to them , “ Go , worship Adonai your God . But who exactly is going ? ”
CJB	Exodus	10	9	Moshe answered , “ We will go with our young and our old , our sons and our daughters ; and we will go with our flocks and herds ; for we must celebrate a feast to Adonai. ”
CJB	Exodus	10	11	Nothing doing ! Just the men among you may go and worship Adonai . That ’ s what you want , isn ’ t it ? ” And they were driven out of Pharaoh ’ s presence . ( ii )
CJB	Exodus	10	12	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Reach out your hand over the land of Egypt , so that locusts will invade the land and eat every plant that the hail has left. ”
CJB	Exodus	10	13	Moshe reached out with his staff over the land of Egypt , and Adonai caused an east wind to blow on the land all day and all night ; and in the morning the east wind brought the locusts .
CJB	Exodus	10	14	The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and settled throughout Egypt ’ s territory . It was an invasion more severe than there had ever been before or will ever be again .
CJB	Exodus	10	16	Pharaoh hurried to summon Moshe and Aharon and said , “ I have sinned against Adonai your God and against you .
CJB	Exodus	10	17	Now , therefore , please forgive my sin just this once ; and intercede with Adonai your God , so that he will at least take away from me this deadly plague ! ”
CJB	Exodus	10	18	He went out from Pharaoh and interceded with Adonai .
CJB	Exodus	10	19	Adonai reversed the wind and made it blow very strongly from the west . It took up the locusts and drove them into the Sea of Suf ; not one locust remained on Egyptian soil .
CJB	Exodus	10	20	But Adonai made Pharaoh hardhearted , and he didn ’ t let the people of Isra ’ el go .
CJB	Exodus	10	21	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Reach out your hand toward the sky , and there will be darkness over the land of Egypt , darkness so thick it can be felt ! ”
CJB	Exodus	10	22	Moshe reached out his hand toward the sky , and there was a thick darkness in the entire land of Egypt for three days .
CJB	Exodus	10	23	People couldn ’ t see each other , and no one went anywhere for three days . But all the people of Isra ’ el had light in their homes . ( iii )
CJB	Exodus	10	24	Pharaoh summoned Moshe and said , “ Go , worship Adonai ; only leave your flocks and herds behind — your children may go with you. ”
CJB	Exodus	10	25	Moshe answered , “ You must also see to it that we have sacrifices and burnt offerings , so that we can sacrifice to Adonai our God .
CJB	Exodus	10	26	Our livestock will also go with us — not a hoof will be left behind — because we must choose some of them to worship Adonai our God , and we don ’ t know which ones we will need to worship Adonai until we get there. ”
CJB	Exodus	10	27	But Adonai made Pharaoh hardhearted , and he would not let them go .
CJB	Exodus	10	28	Pharaoh said to them , “ Get away from me ! And you had better not see my face again , because the day you see my face , you will die ! ”
CJB	Exodus	10	29	Moshe answered , “ Well spoken ! I will see your face no more . ”
CJB	Exodus	11	11	Adonai said to Moshe , “ I ’ m going to bring still one more plague on Pharaoh and Egypt , and after that he will let you leave here . When he does let you go , he will throw you out completely !
CJB	Exodus	11	2	Now tell the people that every man is to ask his neighbor and every woman her neighbor for gold and silver jewelry. ”
CJB	Exodus	11	3	Adonai made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people . Moreover , Moshe was regarded by Pharaoh ’ s servants and the people as a very great man in the land of Egypt . ( iv )
CJB	Exodus	11	4	Moshe said , “ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ About midnight I will go out into Egypt ,
CJB	Exodus	11	5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the slave-girl at the handmill , and all the firstborn of the livestock .
CJB	Exodus	11	6	There will be a horrendous wailing throughout all the land of Egypt — there has never been another like it , and there never will be again .
CJB	Exodus	11	7	But not even a dog ’ s growl will be heard against any of the people of Isra ’ el , neither against people nor against animals . In this way you will realize that Adonai distinguishes between Egyptians and Isra ’ el .
CJB	Exodus	11	8	All your servants will come down to me , prostrate themselves before me and say , “ Get out ! — you and all the people who follow you ! ” and after that , I will go out ! ’ ” And he went out from Pharaoh in the heat of anger .
CJB	Exodus	11	9	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Pharaoh will not listen to you , so that still more of my wonders will be shown in the land of Egypt. ”
CJB	Exodus	11	10	Moshe and Aharon did all these wonders before Pharaoh , but Adonai had made Pharaoh hardhearted , and he didn ’ t let the people of Isra ’ el leave his land .
CJB	Exodus	12	12	For that night , I will pass through the land of Egypt and kill all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both men and animals ; and I will execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt ; I am Adonai .
CJB	Exodus	12	2	“ You are to begin your calendar with this month ; it will be the first month of the year for you .
CJB	Exodus	12	3	Speak to all the assembly of Isra ’ el and say , ‘ On the tenth day of this month , each man is to take a lamb or kid for his family , one per household —
CJB	Exodus	12	4	except that if the household is too small for a whole lamb or kid , then he and his next-door neighbor should share one , dividing it in proportion to the number of people eating it .
CJB	Exodus	12	5	Your animal must be without defect , a male in its first year , and you may choose it from either the sheep or the goats .
CJB	Exodus	12	6	“ ‘ You are to keep it until the fourteenth day of the month , and then the entire assembly of the community of Isra ’ el will slaughter it at dusk .
CJB	Exodus	12	7	They are to take some of the blood and smear it on the two sides and top of the door-frame at the entrance of the house in which they eat it .
CJB	Exodus	12	8	That night , they are to eat the meat , roasted in the fire ; they are to eat it with matzah and maror .
CJB	Exodus	12	9	Don ’ t eat it raw or boiled , but roasted in the fire , with its head , the lower parts of its legs and its inner organs .
CJB	Exodus	12	10	Let nothing of it remain till morning ; if any of it does remain , burn it up completely .
CJB	Exodus	12	11	“ ‘ Here is how you are to eat it : with your belt fastened , your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand ; and you are to eat it hurriedly . It is Adonai ’ s Pesach [ Passover ] .
CJB	Exodus	12	13	The blood will serve you as a sign marking the houses where you are ; when I see the blood , I will pass over [ a ] you — when I strike the land of Egypt , the death blow will not strike you .
CJB	Exodus	12	14	“ ‘ This will be a day for you to remember and celebrate as a festival to Adonai ; from generation to generation you are to celebrate it by a perpetual regulation .
CJB	Exodus	12	15	“ ‘ For seven days you are to eat matzah — on the first day remove the leaven from your houses . For whoever eats hametz [ leavened bread ] from the first to the seventh day is to be cut off from Isra ’ el .
CJB	Exodus	12	16	On the first and seventh days , you are to have an assembly set aside for God . On these days no work is to be done , except what each must do to prepare his food ; you may do only that .
CJB	Exodus	12	17	You are to observe the festival of matzah , for on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt . Therefore , you are to observe this day from generation to generation by a perpetual regulation .
CJB	Exodus	12	18	From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty-first day , you are to eat matzah .
CJB	Exodus	12	19	During those seven days , no leaven is to be found in your houses . Whoever eats food with hametz in it is to be cut off from the community of Isra ’ el — it doesn ’ t matter whether he is a foreigner or a citizen of the land .
CJB	Exodus	12	20	Eat nothing with hametz in it . Wherever you live , eat matzah. ’ ” ( v )
CJB	Exodus	12	21	Then Moshe called for all the leaders of Isra ’ el and said , “ Select and take lambs for your families , and slaughter the Pesach lamb .
CJB	Exodus	12	22	Take a bunch of hyssop leaves and dip it in the blood which is in the basin , and smear it on the two sides and top of the door-frame . Then , none of you is to go out the door of his house until morning .
CJB	Exodus	12	23	For Adonai will pass through to kill the Egyptians ; but when he sees the blood on the top and on the two sides , Adonai will pass over the door and will not allow the Slaughterer to enter your houses and kill you .
CJB	Exodus	12	24	You are to observe this as a law , you and your descendants forever .
CJB	Exodus	12	25	“ When you come to the land which Adonai will give you , as he has promised , you are to observe this ceremony .
CJB	Exodus	12	26	When your children ask you , ‘ What do you mean by this ceremony ? ’
CJB	Exodus	12	27	say , ‘ It is the sacrifice of Adonai ’ s Pesach [ Passover ] , because [ Adonai ] passed over the houses of the people of Isra ’ el in Egypt , when he killed the Egyptians but spared our houses. ’ ” The people of Isra ’ el bowed their heads and worshipped .
CJB	Exodus	12	28	Then the people of Isra ’ el went and did as Adonai had ordered Moshe and Aharon — that is what they did . ( vi )
CJB	Exodus	12	29	At midnight Adonai killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner in the dungeon , and all the firstborn of livestock .
CJB	Exodus	12	30	Pharaoh got up in the night , he , all his servants and all the Egyptians ; and there was horrendous wailing in Egypt ; for there wasn ’ t a single house without someone dead in it .
CJB	Exodus	12	31	He summoned Moshe and Aharon by night and said , “ Up and leave my people , both you and the people of Isra ’ el ; and go , serve Adonai as you said .
CJB	Exodus	12	32	Take both your flocks and your herds , as you said ; and get out of here ! But bless me , too. ”
CJB	Exodus	12	33	The Egyptians pressed to send the people out of the land quickly , because they said , “ Otherwise we ’ ll all be dead ! ”
CJB	Exodus	12	34	The people took their dough before it had become leavened and wrapped their kneading bowls in their clothes on their shoulders .
CJB	Exodus	12	35	The people of Isra ’ el had done what Moshe had said — they had asked the Egyptians to give them silver and gold jewelry and clothing ;
CJB	Exodus	12	36	and Adonai had made the Egyptians so favorably disposed toward the people that they had let them have whatever they requested . Thus they plundered the Egyptians .
CJB	Exodus	12	37	The people of Isra ’ el traveled from Ra ‘ amses to Sukkot , some six hundred thousand men on foot , not counting children .
CJB	Exodus	12	38	A mixed crowd also went up with them , as well as livestock in large numbers , both flocks and herds .
CJB	Exodus	12	39	They baked matzah loaves from the dough they had brought out of Egypt , since it was unleavened ; because they had been driven out of Egypt without time to prepare supplies for themselves .
CJB	Exodus	12	40	The time the people of Isra ’ el lived in Egypt was
CJB	Exodus	12	430	years to the day , all the divisions of Adonai left the land of Egypt .
CJB	Exodus	12	41	At the end of
CJB	Exodus	12	42	This was a night when Adonai kept vigil to bring them out of the land of Egypt , and this same night continues to be a night when Adonai keeps vigil for all the people of Isra ’ el through all their generations .
CJB	Exodus	12	43	Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon , “ This is the regulation for the Pesach lamb : no foreigner is to eat it .
CJB	Exodus	12	44	But if anyone has a slave he bought for money , when you have circumcised him , he may eat it .
CJB	Exodus	12	45	Neither a traveler nor a hired servant may eat it .
CJB	Exodus	12	46	It is to be eaten in one house . You are not to take any of the meat outside the house , and you are not to break any of its bones .
CJB	Exodus	12	47	The whole community of Isra ’ el is to keep it .
CJB	Exodus	12	48	If a foreigner staying with you wants to observe Adonai ’ s Pesach , all his males must be circumcised . Then he may take part and observe it ; he will be like a citizen of the land . But no uncircumcised person is to eat it .
CJB	Exodus	12	49	The same teaching is to apply equally to the citizen and to the foreigner living among you. ”
CJB	Exodus	12	50	All the people of Isra ’ el did just as Adonai had ordered Moshe and Aharon .
CJB	Exodus	12	51	On that very day , Adonai brought the people of Isra ’ el out of the land of Egypt by their divisions . Footnotes - Exodus 12:13 Hebrew : pasach
CJB	Exodus	13	13	Every firstborn from a donkey , you are to redeem with a lamb ; but if you choose not to redeem it , you must break its neck . But from people , you are to redeem every firstborn son . ( Maftir )
CJB	Exodus	13	2	“ Set aside for me all the firstborn . Whatever is first from the womb among the people of Isra ’ el , both of humans and of animals , belongs to me. ”
CJB	Exodus	13	3	Moshe said to the people , “ Remember this day , on which you left Egypt , the abode of slavery ; because Adonai , by the strength of his hand , has brought you out of this place . Do not eat hametz .
CJB	Exodus	13	4	You are leaving today , in the month of Aviv .
CJB	Exodus	13	5	When Adonai brings you into the land of the Kena ‘ ani , Hitti , Emori , Hivi and Y ’ vusi , which he swore to your ancestors to give you , a land flowing with milk and honey , you are to observe this ceremony in this month .
CJB	Exodus	13	6	For seven days you are to eat matzah , and the seventh day is to be a festival for Adonai .
CJB	Exodus	13	7	Matzah is to be eaten throughout the seven days ; neither hametz nor leavening agents are to be seen with you throughout your territory .
CJB	Exodus	13	8	On that day you are to tell your son , ‘ It is because of what Adonai did for me when I left Egypt. ’
CJB	Exodus	13	9	“ Moreover , it will serve you as a sign on your hand and as a reminder between your eyes , so that Adonai ’ s Torah may be on your lips ; because with a strong hand Adonai brought you out of Egypt .
CJB	Exodus	13	10	Therefore you are to observe this regulation at its proper time , year after year .
CJB	Exodus	13	11	When Adonai brings you into the land of the Kena ‘ ani , as he swore to you and your ancestors , and gives it to you ,
CJB	Exodus	13	12	you are to set apart for Adonai everything that is first from the womb . Every firstborn male animal will belong to Adonai .
CJB	Exodus	13	14	When , at some future time , your son asks you , ‘ What is this ? ’ then say to him , ‘ With a strong hand Adonai brought us out of Egypt , out of the abode of slavery .
CJB	Exodus	13	15	When Pharaoh was unwilling to let us go , Adonai killed all the firstborn males in the land of Egypt , both the firstborn of humans and the firstborn of animals . This is why I sacrifice to Adonai any male that is first from the womb of an animal , but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem. ’
CJB	Exodus	13	16	: B ’ shallach ( After he had let go ) 13:17–17:16
CJB	Exodus	13	17	After Pharaoh had let the people go , God did not guide them to the highway that goes through the land of the P ’ lishtim , because it was close by — God thought that the people , upon seeing war , might change their minds and return to Egypt .
CJB	Exodus	13	18	Rather , God led the people by a roundabout route , through the desert by the Sea of Suf . The people of Isra ’ el went up from the land of Egypt fully armed .
CJB	Exodus	13	19	Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him , for Yosef had made the people of Isra ’ el swear an oath when he said , “ God will certainly remember you ; and you are to carry my bones up with you , away from here. ”
CJB	Exodus	13	20	They traveled from Sukkot and set up camp in Etam , at the edge of the desert .
CJB	Exodus	13	21	Adonai went ahead of them in a column of cloud during the daytime to lead them on their way , and at night in a column of fire to give them light ; thus they could travel both by day and by night .
CJB	Exodus	13	22	Neither the column of cloud by day nor the column of fire at night went away from in front of the people .
CJB	Exodus	14	14	Adonai will do battle for you . Just calm yourselves down ! ” ( A : iii )
CJB	Exodus	14	2	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el to turn around and set up camp in front of Pi-Hachirot , between Migdol and the sea , in front of Ba ‘ al-Tz ’ fon ; camp opposite it , by the sea .
CJB	Exodus	14	3	Then Pharaoh will say that the people of Isra ’ el are wandering aimlessly in the countryside , the desert has closed in on them .
CJB	Exodus	14	4	I will make Pharaoh so hardhearted that he will pursue them ; thus I will win glory for myself at the expense of Pharaoh and all his army , and the Egyptians will realize at last that I am Adonai. ” The people did as ordered .
CJB	Exodus	14	5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled , Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people . They said , “ What have we done , letting Isra ’ el stop being our slaves ? ”
CJB	Exodus	14	6	So he prepared his chariots and took his people with him —
CJB	Exodus	14	7	he took
CJB	Exodus	14	600	first-quality chariots , as well as all the other chariots in Egypt , along with their commanders .
CJB	Exodus	14	8	Adonai made Pharaoh hardhearted , and he pursued the people of Isra ’ el , as they left boldly . ( ii )
CJB	Exodus	14	9	The Egyptians went after them , all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh , with his cavalry and army , and overtook them as they were encamped by the sea , by Pi-Hachirot , in front of Ba ‘ al-Tz ’ fon .
CJB	Exodus	14	10	As Pharaoh approached , the people of Isra ’ el looked up and saw the Egyptians right there , coming after them . In great fear the people of Isra ’ el cried out to Adonai
CJB	Exodus	14	11	and said to Moshe , “ Was it because there weren ’ t enough graves in Egypt that you brought us out to die in the desert ? Why have you done this to us , bringing us out of Egypt ?
CJB	Exodus	14	12	Didn ’ t we tell you in Egypt to let us alone , we ’ ll just go on being slaves for the Egyptians ? It would be better for us to be the Egyptians ’ slaves than to die in the desert ! ”
CJB	Exodus	14	13	Moshe answered the people , “ Stop being so fearful ! Remain steady , and you will see how Adonai is going to save you . He will do it today — today you have seen the Egyptians , but you will never see them again !
CJB	Exodus	14	15	Adonai asked Moshe , “ Why are you crying to me ? Tell the people of Isra ’ el to go forward !
CJB	Exodus	14	16	Lift your staff , reach out with your hand over the sea , and divide it in two . The people of Isra ’ el will advance into the sea on dry ground .
CJB	Exodus	14	17	As for me , I will make the Egyptians hardhearted ; and they will march in after them ; thus I will win glory for myself at the expense of Pharaoh and all his army , chariots and cavalry .
CJB	Exodus	14	18	Then the Egyptians will realize that I am Adonai , when I have won myself glory at the expense of Pharaoh , his chariots and his cavalry. ”
CJB	Exodus	14	19	Next , the angel of God , who was going ahead of the camp of Isra ’ el , moved away and went behind them ; and the column of cloud moved away from in front of them and stood behind them .
CJB	Exodus	14	20	It stationed itself between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Isra ’ el — there was cloud and darkness here , but light by night there ; so that the one did not come near the other all night long .
CJB	Exodus	14	21	Moshe reached his hand out over the sea , and Adonai caused the sea to go back before a strong east wind all night . He made the sea become dry land , and its water was divided in two .
CJB	Exodus	14	22	Then the people of Isra ’ el went into the sea on the dry ground , with the water walled up for them on their right and on their left .
CJB	Exodus	14	23	The Egyptians continued their pursuit , going after them into the sea — all Pharaoh ’ s horses , chariots and cavalry .
CJB	Exodus	14	24	Just before dawn , Adonai looked out on the Egyptian army through the column of fire and cloud and threw them into a panic .
CJB	Exodus	14	25	He caused the wheels of their chariots to break off , so that they could move only with difficulty . The Egyptians said , “ Adonai is fighting for Isra ’ el against the Egyptians ! Let ’ s get away from them ! ” ( A : iv , S : iii )
CJB	Exodus	14	26	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Reach your hand out over the sea , and the water will return and cover the Egyptians with their chariots and cavalry. ”
CJB	Exodus	14	27	Moshe reached his hand out over the sea , and by dawn the sea had returned to its former depth . The Egyptians tried to flee , but Adonai swept them into the sea .
CJB	Exodus	14	28	The water came back and covered all the chariots and cavalry of Pharaoh ’ s army who had followed them into the sea — not even one of them was left .
CJB	Exodus	14	29	But the people of Isra ’ el walked on dry ground in the sea , with the water walled up for them on their right and on their left .
CJB	Exodus	14	30	On that day , Adonai saved Isra ’ el from the Egyptians ; Isra ’ el saw the Egyptians dead on the shore .
CJB	Exodus	14	31	When Isra ’ el saw the mighty deed that Adonai had performed against the Egyptians , the people feared Adonai , and they believed in Adonai and in his servant Moshe .
CJB	Exodus	15	15	then the chiefs of Edom are dismayed ; trepidation seizes the heads of Mo ’ av ; all those living in Kena ‘ an are melted away .
CJB	Exodus	15	2	Yah is my strength and my song , and he has become my salvation . This is my God : I will glorify him ; my father ’ s God : I will exalt him .
CJB	Exodus	15	3	Adonai is a warrior ; Adonai is his name .
CJB	Exodus	15	4	Pharaoh ’ s chariots and his army he hurled into the sea . His elite commanders were drowned in the Sea of Suf .
CJB	Exodus	15	5	The deep waters covered them ; they sank to the depths like a stone .
CJB	Exodus	15	6	Your right hand , Adonai , is sublimely powerful ; your right hand , Adonai , shatters the foe .
CJB	Exodus	15	7	By your great majesty you bring down your enemies ; you send out your wrath to consume them like stubble .
CJB	Exodus	15	8	With a blast from your nostrils the waters piled up — the waters stood up like a wall , the depths of the sea became firm ground .
CJB	Exodus	15	9	The enemy said , ‘ I will pursue and overtake , divide the spoil and gorge myself on them . I will draw my sword ; my hand will destroy them. ’
CJB	Exodus	15	10	You blew with your wind , the sea covered them , they sank like lead in the mighty waters .
CJB	Exodus	15	11	Who is like you , Adonai , among the mighty ? Who is like you , sublime in holiness , awesome in praises , working wonders ?
CJB	Exodus	15	12	You reached out with your right hand : the earth swallowed them .
CJB	Exodus	15	13	In your love , you led the people you redeemed ; in your strength , you guided them to your holy abode .
CJB	Exodus	15	14	The peoples have heard , and they tremble ; anguish takes hold of those living in P ’ leshet ;
CJB	Exodus	15	16	Terror and dread fall on them ; by the might of your arm they are still as stone until your people pass over , Adonai , till the people you purchased pass over .
CJB	Exodus	15	17	You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain which is your heritage , the place , Adonai , that you made your abode , the sanctuary , Adonai , which your hands established .
CJB	Exodus	15	18	Adonai will reign forever and ever .
CJB	Exodus	15	19	For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and with his cavalry into the sea , but Adonai brought the sea waters back upon them , while the people of Isra ’ el walked on dry land in the midst of the sea ! ”
CJB	Exodus	15	20	Also Miryam the prophet , sister of Aharon , took a tambourine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tambourines , dancing ,
CJB	Exodus	15	21	as Miryam sang to them : “ Sing to Adonai , for he is highly exalted ! The horse and its rider he threw in the sea ! ”
CJB	Exodus	15	22	Moshe led Isra ’ el onward from the Sea of Suf . They went out into the Shur Desert ; but after traveling three days in the desert , they had found no water .
CJB	Exodus	15	23	They arrived at Marah but couldn ’ t drink the water there , because it was bitter . This is why they called it Marah [ bitterness ] .
CJB	Exodus	15	24	The people grumbled against Moshe and asked , “ What are we to drink ? ”
CJB	Exodus	15	25	Moshe cried to Adonai ; and Adonai showed him a certain piece of wood , which , when he threw it into the water , made the water taste good . There Adonai made laws and rules of life for them , and there he tested them .
CJB	Exodus	15	26	He said , “ If you will listen intently to the voice of Adonai your God , do what he considers right , pay attention to his mitzvot and observe his laws , I will not afflict you with any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians ; because I am Adonai your healer. ” ( A : v , S : iv )
CJB	Exodus	15	27	They came to Eilim , where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees , and camped there by the water .
CJB	Exodus	16	16	Here is what Adonai has ordered : each man is to gather according to his appetite — each is to take an ‘ omer [ two quarts ] per person for everyone in his tent. ”
CJB	Exodus	16	2	There in the desert the whole community of the people of Isra ’ el grumbled against Moshe and Aharon .
CJB	Exodus	16	3	The people of Isra ’ el said to them , “ We wish Adonai had used his own hand to kill us off in Egypt ! There we used to sit around the pots with the meat boiling , and we had as much food as we wanted . But you have taken us out into this desert to let this whole assembly starve to death ! ”
CJB	Exodus	16	4	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Here , I will cause bread to rain down from heaven for you . The people are to go out and gather a day ’ s ration every day . By this I will test whether they will observe my Torah or not .
CJB	Exodus	16	5	On the sixth day , when they prepare what they have brought in , it will turn out to be twice as much as they gather on the other days. ”
CJB	Exodus	16	6	Moshe and Aharon said to all the people of Isra ’ el , “ This evening , you will realize that it has been Adonai who brought you out of Egypt ;
CJB	Exodus	16	7	and in the morning , you will see Adonai ’ s glory . For he has listened to your grumblings against Adonai — what are we that you should grumble against us ? ”
CJB	Exodus	16	8	Moshe added , “ What I have said will happen when Adonai gives you meat to eat this evening and your fill of bread tomorrow morning . Adonai has listened to your complaints and grumblings against him — what are we ? Your grumblings are not against us but against Adonai. ”
CJB	Exodus	16	9	Moshe said to Aharon , “ Say to the whole community of Isra ’ el , ‘ Come close , into the presence of Adonai , for he has heard your grumblings. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	16	10	As Aharon spoke to the whole community of the people of Isra ’ el , they looked toward the desert ; and there before them the glory of Adonai appeared in the cloud ; ( A : vi , S : v )
CJB	Exodus	16	11	and Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Exodus	16	12	“ I have heard the grumblings of the people of Isra ’ el . Say to them : ‘ At dusk you will be eating meat , and in the morning you will have your fill of bread . Then you will realize that I am Adonai your God. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	16	13	That evening , quails came up and covered the camp ; while in the morning there was a layer of dew all around the camp .
CJB	Exodus	16	14	When the dew had evaporated , there on the surface of the desert was a fine flaky substance , as fine as frost on the ground .
CJB	Exodus	16	15	When the people of Isra ’ el saw it , they asked each other , “ Man hu ? [ What is it ? ] ” because they didn ’ t know what it was . Moshe answered them , “ It is the bread which Adonai has given you to eat .
CJB	Exodus	16	17	The people of Isra ’ el did this . Some gathered more , some less ;
CJB	Exodus	16	18	but when they put it in an ‘ omer-measure , whoever had gathered much had no excess ; and whoever had gathered little had no shortage ; nevertheless each person had gathered according to his appetite .
CJB	Exodus	16	19	Moshe told them , “ No one is to leave any of it till morning. ”
CJB	Exodus	16	20	But they didn ’ t pay attention to Moshe , and some kept the leftovers until morning . It bred worms and rotted , which made Moshe angry at them .
CJB	Exodus	16	21	So they gathered it morning after morning , each person according to his appetite ; but as the sun grew hot , it melted .
CJB	Exodus	16	22	On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two ‘ omers per person ; and all the community leaders came and reported to Moshe .
CJB	Exodus	16	23	He told them , “ This is what Adonai has said : ‘ Tomorrow is a holy Shabbat for Adonai . Bake what you want to bake ; boil what you want to boil ; and whatever is left over , set aside and keep for the morning. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	16	24	They set it aside till morning , as Moshe had ordered ; and it didn ’ t rot or have worms .
CJB	Exodus	16	25	Moshe said , “ Today , eat that ; because today is a Shabbat for Adonai — today you won ’ t find it in the field .
CJB	Exodus	16	26	Gather it six days , but the seventh day is the Shabbat — on that day there won ’ t be any. ”
CJB	Exodus	16	27	However , on the seventh day , some of the people went out to gather and found none .
CJB	Exodus	16	28	Adonai said to Moshe , “ How long will you refuse to observe my mitzvot and teachings ?
CJB	Exodus	16	29	Look , Adonai has given you the Shabbat . This is why he is providing bread for two days on the sixth day . Each of you , stay where you are ; no one is to leave his place on the seventh day. ” ( S : vi )
CJB	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day .
CJB	Exodus	16	31	The people called the food man . It was like coriander seed , white ; and it tasted like honey cakes .
CJB	Exodus	16	32	Moshe said , “ Here is what Adonai has ordered : ‘ Let two quarts of man be kept through all your generations , so that they will be able to see the bread which I fed you in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	16	33	Moshe said to Aharon , “ Take a jar , put in it two quarts of man , and set it aside before Adonai to be kept through all your generations. ”
CJB	Exodus	16	34	Just as Adonai ordered Moshe , Aharon set it aside before the testimony to be kept .
CJB	Exodus	16	35	The people of Isra ’ el ate man for forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . They ate man until they arrived at the borders of the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Exodus	16	36	( An ‘ omer is one-tenth of an eifah [ which is a bushel dry-measure ] . )
CJB	Exodus	17	17	( vii ) The whole community of the people of Isra ’ el left the Seen Desert , traveling in stages , as Adonai had ordered , and camped at Refidim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
CJB	Exodus	17	2	Corinthians 8:1–15 ; Revelation 15:1–4
CJB	Exodus	17	3	However , the people were thirsty for water there and grumbled against Moshe , “ For what did you bring us up from Egypt ? To kill us , our children and our livestock with thirst ? ”
CJB	Exodus	17	4	Moshe cried out to Adonai , “ What am I to do with these people ? They ’ re ready to stone me ! ”
CJB	Exodus	17	5	Adonai answered Moshe , “ Go on ahead of the people , and bring with you the leaders of Isra ’ el . Take your staff in your hand , the one you used to strike the river ; and go .
CJB	Exodus	17	6	I will stand in front of you there on the rock in Horev . You are to strike the rock , and water will come out of it , so the people can drink. ” Moshe did this in the sight of the leaders of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Exodus	17	7	The place was named Massah [ testing ] and M ’ rivah [ quarreling ] because of the quarreling of the people of Isra ’ el and because they tested Adonai by asking , “ Is Adonai with us or not ? ”
CJB	Exodus	17	8	Then ‘ Amalek came and fought with Isra ’ el at Refidim .
CJB	Exodus	17	9	Moshe said to Y ’ hoshua , “ Choose men for us , go out , and fight with ‘ Amalek . Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with God ’ s staff in my hand. ”
CJB	Exodus	17	10	Y ’ hoshua did as Moshe had told him and fought with ‘ Amalek . Then Moshe , Aharon and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
CJB	Exodus	17	11	When Moshe raised his hand , Isra ’ el prevailed ; but when he let it down , ‘ Amalek prevailed .
CJB	Exodus	17	12	However , Moshe ’ s hands grew heavy ; so they took a stone and put it under him , and he sat on it . Aharon and Hur held up his hands , the one on the one side and the other on the other ; so that his hands stayed steady until sunset .
CJB	Exodus	17	13	Thus Y ’ hoshua defeated ‘ Amalek , putting their people to the sword . ( Maftir )
CJB	Exodus	17	14	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Write this in a book to be remembered , and tell it to Y ’ hoshua : I will completely blot out any memory of ‘ Amalek from under heaven. ”
CJB	Exodus	17	15	Moshe built an altar , called it Adonai Nissi [ Adonai is my banner/miracle ] ,
CJB	Exodus	17	16	and said , “ Because their hand was against the throne of Yah , Adonai will fight ‘ Amalek generation after generation. ” Haftarah B ’ shallach : Shof ’ tim ( Judges ) 4:4–5:31 ( A ) ; 5:1–31 ( S ) B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah B ’ shallach : Luke 2:22–24 ; Yochanan ( John ) 6:25–35 ; 19:31–37 ;
CJB	Exodus	17	1	Corinthians 10:1–13 ;
CJB	Exodus	18	18	You will certainly wear yourself out — and not only yourself , but these people here with you as well . It ’ s too much for you — you can ’ t do it alone , by yourself .
CJB	Exodus	18	17	Moshe ’ s father-in-law said to him , “ What you are doing isn ’ t good .
CJB	Exodus	18	26	As a general rule , they settled the people ’ s disputes — the difficult cases they brought to Moshe , but every simple matter they decided themselves .
CJB	Exodus	18	2	After Moshe had sent away his wife Tzipporah and her two sons , Yitro Moshe ’ s father-in-law had taken them back .
CJB	Exodus	18	3	The name of the one son was Gershom , for Moshe had said , “ I have been a foreigner in a foreign land. ”
CJB	Exodus	18	4	The name of the other was Eli ‘ ezer [ my God helps ] , “ because the God of my father helped me by rescuing me from Pharaoh ’ s sword. ”
CJB	Exodus	18	5	Yitro Moshe ’ s father-in-law brought Moshe ’ s sons and wife to him in the desert where he was encamped , at the mountain of God .
CJB	Exodus	18	6	He sent word to Moshe , “ I , your father-in-law Yitro , am coming to you with your wife and her two sons. ”
CJB	Exodus	18	7	Moshe went out to meet his father-in-law , prostrated himself and kissed him . Then , after inquiring of each other ’ s welfare , they entered the tent .
CJB	Exodus	18	8	Moshe told his father-in-law all that Adonai had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Isra ’ el ’ s sake , all the hardships they had suffered while traveling and how Adonai had rescued them .
CJB	Exodus	18	9	Yitro rejoiced over all the good that Adonai had done for Isra ’ el by rescuing them from the Egyptians .
CJB	Exodus	18	10	Yitro said , “ Blessed be Adonai , who has rescued you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh , who has rescued the people from the harsh hand of the Egyptians .
CJB	Exodus	18	11	Now I know that Adonai is greater than all other gods , because he rescued those who were treated so arrogantly. ”
CJB	Exodus	18	12	Yitro Moshe ’ s father-in-law brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God , and Aharon came with all the leaders of Isra ’ el to share the meal before God with Moshe ’ s father-in-law . ( ii )
CJB	Exodus	18	13	The following day Moshe sat to settle disputes for the people , while the people stood around Moshe from morning till evening .
CJB	Exodus	18	14	When Moshe ’ s father-in-law saw all that he was doing to the people , he said , “ What is this that you are doing to the people ? Why do you sit there alone , with all the people standing around you from morning till evening ? ”
CJB	Exodus	18	15	Moshe answered his father-in-law , “ It ’ s because the people come to me seeking God ’ s guidance .
CJB	Exodus	18	16	Whenever they have a dispute , it comes to me ; I judge between one person and another , and I explain to them God ’ s laws and teachings. ”
CJB	Exodus	18	19	So listen now to what I have to say . I will give you some advice , and God will be with you . You should represent the people before God , and you should bring their cases to God .
CJB	Exodus	18	20	You should also teach them the laws and the teachings , and show them how to live their lives and what work they should do .
CJB	Exodus	18	21	But you should choose from among all the people competent men who are God-fearing , honest and incorruptible to be their leaders , in charge of thousands , hundreds , fifties and tens .
CJB	Exodus	18	22	Normally , they will settle the people ’ s disputes . They should bring you the difficult cases ; but ordinary matters they should decide themselves . In this way , they will make it easier for you and share the load with you .
CJB	Exodus	18	23	If you do this — and God is directing you to do it — you will be able to endure ; and all these people too will arrive at their destination peacefully. ” ( iii )
CJB	Exodus	18	24	Moshe paid attention to his father-in-law ’ s counsel and did everything he said .
CJB	Exodus	18	25	Moshe chose competent men from all Isra ’ el and made them heads over the people , in charge of thousands , hundreds , fifties and tens .
CJB	Exodus	18	27	Then Moshe let his father-in-law leave , and he went off to his own country .
CJB	Exodus	19	19	As the sound of the shofar grew louder and louder , Moshe spoke ; and God answered him with a voice . ( A : vi , S : vii )
CJB	Exodus	19	2	After setting out from Refidim and arriving at the Sinai Desert , they set up camp in the desert ; there in front of the mountain , Isra ’ el set up camp .
CJB	Exodus	19	3	Moshe went up to God , and Adonai called to him from the mountain : “ Here is what you are to say to the household of Ya ‘ akov , to tell the people of Isra ’ el :
CJB	Exodus	19	4	‘ You have seen what I did to the Egyptians , and how I carried you on eagles ’ wings and brought you to myself .
CJB	Exodus	19	5	Now if you will pay careful attention to what I say and keep my covenant , then you will be my own treasure from among all the peoples , for all the earth is mine ;
CJB	Exodus	19	6	and you will be a kingdom of cohanim for me , a nation set apart. ’ These are the words you are to speak to the people of Isra ’ el. ” ( v )
CJB	Exodus	19	7	Moshe came , summoned the leaders of the people and presented them with all these words which Adonai had ordered him to say .
CJB	Exodus	19	8	All the people answered as one , “ Everything Adonai has said , we will do. ” Moshe reported the words of the people to Adonai .
CJB	Exodus	19	9	Adonai said to Moshe , “ See , I am coming to you in a thick cloud , so that the people will be able to hear when I speak with you and also to trust in you forever. ” Moshe had told Adonai what the people had said ;
CJB	Exodus	19	10	so Adonai said to Moshe , “ Go to the people ; today and tomorrow separate them for me by having them wash their clothing ;
CJB	Exodus	19	11	and prepare for the third day . For on the third day , Adonai will come down on Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people .
CJB	Exodus	19	12	You are to set limits for the people all around ; and say , ‘ Be careful not to go up on the mountain or even touch its base ; whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death .
CJB	Exodus	19	13	No hand is to touch him ; for he must be stoned or shot by arrows ; neither animal nor human will be allowed to live. ’ When the shofar sounds , they may go up on the mountain. ” ( S : vi )
CJB	Exodus	19	14	Moshe went down from the mountain to the people and separated the people for God , and they washed their clothing .
CJB	Exodus	19	15	He said to the people , “ Prepare for the third day ; don ’ t approach a woman. ”
CJB	Exodus	19	16	On the morning of the third day , there was thunder , lightning and a thick cloud on the mountain . Then a shofar blast sounded so loudly that all the people in the camp trembled .
CJB	Exodus	19	17	Moshe brought the people out of the camp to meet God ; they stood near the base of the mountain .
CJB	Exodus	19	18	Mount Sinai was enveloped in smoke , because Adonai descended onto it in fire — its smoke went up like the smoke from a furnace , and the whole mountain shook violently .
CJB	Exodus	19	20	Adonai came down onto Mount Sinai , to the top of the mountain ; then Adonai called Moshe to the top of the mountain ; and Moshe went up .
CJB	Exodus	19	21	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Go down and warn the people not to force their way through to Adonai to see him ; if they do , many of them will perish .
CJB	Exodus	19	22	Even the cohanim , who are allowed to approach Adonai , must keep themselves holy ; otherwise , Adonai may break out against them. ”
CJB	Exodus	19	23	Moshe said to Adonai , “ The people can ’ t come up to Mount Sinai , because you ordered us to set limits around the mountain and separate it. ”
CJB	Exodus	19	24	But Adonai answered him , “ Go , get down ! Then come back up , you and Aharon with you . But don ’ t let the cohanim and the people force their way through to come up to Adonai , or he will break out against them. ”
CJB	Exodus	19	25	So Moshe went down to the people and told them .

CJB	Exodus	32	32	Now , if you will just forgive their sin ! But if you won ’ t , then , I beg you , blot me out of your book which you have written ! ”
CJB	Exodus	32	2	Aharon said to them , “ Have your wives , sons and daughters strip off their gold earrings ; and bring them to me. ”
CJB	Exodus	32	3	The people stripped off their gold earrings and brought them to Aharon .
CJB	Exodus	32	4	He received what they gave him , melted it down , and made it into the shape of a calf . They said , “ Isra ’ el ! Here is your god , who brought you up from the land of Egypt ! ”
CJB	Exodus	32	5	On seeing this , Aharon built an altar in front of it and proclaimed , “ Tomorrow is to be a feast for Adonai. ”
CJB	Exodus	32	6	Early the next morning they got up and offered burnt offerings and presented peace offerings . Afterwards , the people sat down to eat and drink ; then they got up to indulge in revelry .
CJB	Exodus	32	7	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Go down ! Hurry ! Your people , whom you brought up from the land of Egypt , have become corrupt !
CJB	Exodus	32	8	So quickly they have turned aside from the way I ordered them to follow ! They have cast a metal statue of a calf , worshipped it , sacrificed to it and said , ‘ Isra ’ el ! Here is your god , who brought you up from the land of Egypt ! ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	32	9	Adonai continued speaking to Moshe : “ I have been watching these people ; and you can see how stiffnecked they are .
CJB	Exodus	32	10	Now leave me alone , so that my anger can blaze against them , and I can put an end to them ! I will make a great nation out of you instead. ”
CJB	Exodus	32	11	Moshe pleaded with Adonai his God . He said , “ Adonai , why must your anger blaze against your own people , whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a strong hand ?
CJB	Exodus	32	12	Why let the Egyptians say , ‘ It was with evil intentions that he led them out , to slaughter them in the hills and wipe them off the face of the earth ’ ? Turn from your fierce anger ! Relent ! Don ’ t bring such disaster on your people !
CJB	Exodus	32	13	Remember Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Isra ’ el , your servants , to whom you swore by your very self . You promised them , ‘ I will make your descendants as many as the stars in the sky ; and I will give all this land I have spoken about to your descendants ; and they will possess it forever. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	32	14	Adonai then changed his mind about the disaster he had planned for his people .
CJB	Exodus	32	15	Moshe turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand , tablets inscribed on both sides , on the front and on the back .
CJB	Exodus	32	16	The tablets were the work of God ; and the writing was the writing of God , engraved on the tablets .
CJB	Exodus	32	17	When Y ’ hoshua heard the noise of the people shouting he said to Moshe , “ It sounds like war in the camp ! ”
CJB	Exodus	32	18	He answered , “ That is neither the clamor of victory nor the wailings of defeat ; what I hear is the sound of people singing. ”
CJB	Exodus	32	19	But the moment Moshe got near the camp , when he saw the calf and the dancing , his own anger blazed up . He threw down the tablets he had been holding and shattered them at the base of the mountain .
CJB	Exodus	32	20	Seizing the calf they had made , he melted it in the fire and ground it to powder , which he scattered on the water . Then he made the people of Isra ’ el drink it .
CJB	Exodus	32	21	Moshe said to Aharon , “ What did these people do to you to make you lead them into such a terrible sin ? ”
CJB	Exodus	32	22	Aharon replied , “ My lord shouldn ’ t be so angry . You know what these people are like , that they are determined to do evil .
CJB	Exodus	32	23	So they said to me , ‘ Make us gods to go ahead of us ; because this Moshe , the man that brought us up from the land of Egypt — we don ’ t know what has become of him. ’
CJB	Exodus	32	24	I answered them , ‘ Anyone with gold , strip it off ! ’ So they gave it to me . I threw it in the fire , and out came this calf ! ”
CJB	Exodus	32	25	When Moshe saw that the people had gotten out of control — because Aharon had allowed them to get out of control , to the derision of their enemies —
CJB	Exodus	32	26	Moshe stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted , “ Whoever is for Adonai , come to me ! ” All the descendants of Levi rallied around him .
CJB	Exodus	32	27	He told them , “ Here is what Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ Each of you , put his sword on his side ; and go up and down the camp , from gate to gate ; and every man is to kill his own kinsman , his own friend and his own neighbor ! ”
CJB	Exodus	32	28	The sons of Levi did what Moshe said , and that day three thousand of the people died .
CJB	Exodus	32	29	Moshe said , “ You have consecrated yourselves today to Adonai , because every one of you has been against his own son and against his own kinsman , in order to bring a blessing on yourselves today. ”
CJB	Exodus	32	30	The next day Moshe said to the people , “ You have committed a terrible sin . Now I will go up to Adonai ; maybe I will be able to atone for your sin. ”
CJB	Exodus	32	31	Moshe went back to Adonai and said , “ Please ! These people have committed a terrible sin : they have made themselves a god out of gold .
CJB	Exodus	32	33	Adonai answered Moshe , “ Those who have sinned against me are the ones I will blot out of my book .
CJB	Exodus	32	34	Now go and lead the people to the place I told you about ; my angel will go ahead of you . Nevertheless , the time for punishment will come ; and then I will punish them for their sin. ”
CJB	Exodus	32	35	Adonai struck the people with a plague because they had made the calf , the one Aharon made .
CJB	Exodus	33	33	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Leave , you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt ; and move on from here toward the land of which I swore to Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov , ‘ I will give it to your descendants. ’
CJB	Exodus	33	2	I will send an angel ahead of you ; and I will drive out the Kena ‘ ani , Emori , Hitti , P ’ rizi , Hivi and Y ’ vusi .
CJB	Exodus	33	3	You will go to a land flowing with milk and honey ; but I myself will not go with you , because you are such a stiffnecked people that I might destroy you on the way. ”
CJB	Exodus	33	4	When the people heard this bad news , they went into mourning ; and no one wore his ornaments .
CJB	Exodus	33	5	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ You are a stiffnecked people ! If I were to go up with you for even one moment , I would exterminate you ! Now , keep your ornaments off ; then I will decide what to do to you. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	33	6	So from Mount Horev onward , the people of Isra ’ el stripped themselves of their ornaments .
CJB	Exodus	33	7	Moshe would take the tent and pitch it outside the camp , far away from the camp . He called it the tent of meeting . Everyone who wanted to consult Adonai would go out to the tent of meeting , outside the camp .
CJB	Exodus	33	8	Whenever Moshe went out to the tent , all the people would get up and stand , each man at his tent door , and look at Moshe until he had gone into the tent .
CJB	Exodus	33	9	Whenever Moshe entered the tent , the column of cloud would descend and station itself at the entrance to the tent ; and Adonai would speak with Moshe .
CJB	Exodus	33	10	When all the people saw the column of cloud stationed at the entrance to the tent , they would get up and prostrate themselves , each man at his tent door .
CJB	Exodus	33	11	Adonai would speak to Moshe face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . Then he would return to the camp ; but the young man who was his assistant , Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun , never left the inside of the tent . ( iii )
CJB	Exodus	33	12	Moshe said to Adonai , “ Look , you say to me , ‘ Make these people move on ! ’ But you haven ’ t let me know whom you will be sending with me . Nevertheless you have said , ‘ I know you by name , ’ and also , ‘ You have found favor in my sight. ’
CJB	Exodus	33	13	Now , please , if it is really the case that I have found favor in your sight , show me your ways ; so that I will understand you and continue finding favor in your sight . Moreover , keep on seeing this nation as your people. ”
CJB	Exodus	33	14	He answered , “ Set your mind at rest — my presence will go with you , after all. ”
CJB	Exodus	33	15	Moshe replied , “ If your presence doesn ’ t go with us , don ’ t make us go on from here .
CJB	Exodus	33	16	For how else is it to be known that I have found favor in your sight , I and your people , other than by your going with us ? That is what distinguishes us , me and your people , from all the other peoples on earth. ” ( iv )
CJB	Exodus	33	17	Adonai said to Moshe , “ I will also do what you have asked me to do , because you have found favor in my sight , and I know you by name. ”
CJB	Exodus	33	18	But Moshe said , “ I beg you to show me your glory ! ”
CJB	Exodus	33	19	He replied , “ I will cause all my goodness to pass before you , and in your presence I will pronounce the name of Adonai . Moreover , I show favor to whomever I will , and I display mercy to whomever I will .
CJB	Exodus	33	20	But my face , ” he continued , “ you can not see , because a human being can not look at me and remain alive .
CJB	Exodus	33	21	Here , ” he said , “ is a place near me ; stand on the rock .
CJB	Exodus	33	22	When my glory passes by , I will put you inside a crevice in the rock and cover you with my hand , until I have passed by .
CJB	Exodus	33	23	Then I will remove my hand , and you will see my back , but my face is not to be seen . ”
CJB	Exodus	34	34	But when he went in before Adonai for him to speak , he would take the veil off until he came out ; then , when he came out , he would tell the people of Isra ’ el what he had been ordered .
CJB	Exodus	34	2	Corinthians 3:1–18
CJB	Exodus	34	3	No one is to come up with you , and no one is to be seen anywhere on the mountain ; don ’ t even let the flocks or herds feed in front of this mountain. ”
CJB	Exodus	34	4	Moshe cut two stone tablets like the first . Then he got up early in the morning and , with the two stone tablets in his hands , ascended Mount Sinai , as Adonai had ordered him to do .
CJB	Exodus	34	5	Adonai descended in the cloud , stood with him there and pronounced the name of Adonai .
CJB	Exodus	34	6	Adonai passed before him and proclaimed : “ YUD-HEH-VAV-HEH ! ! ! Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh [ Adonai ] is God , merciful and compassionate , slow to anger , rich in grace and truth ;
CJB	Exodus	34	7	showing grace to the thousandth generation , forgiving offenses , crimes and sins ; yet not exonerating the guilty , but causing the negative effects of the parents ’ offenses to be experienced by their children and grandchildren , and even by the third and fourth generations. ”
CJB	Exodus	34	8	At once Moshe bowed his head to the ground , prostrated himself
CJB	Exodus	34	9	and said , “ If I have now found favor in your view , Adonai , then please let Adonai go with us , even though they are a stiffnecked people ; and pardon our offenses and our sin ; and take us as your possession. ” ( vi )
CJB	Exodus	34	10	He said , “ Here , I am making a covenant ; in front of all your people I will do wonders such as have not been created anywhere on earth or in any nation . All the people around you will see the work of Adonai . What I am going to do through you will be awesome !
CJB	Exodus	34	11	Observe what I am ordering you to do today . Here ! I am driving out ahead of you the Emori , Kena ‘ ani , Hitti , P ’ rizi , Hivi and Y ’ vusi .
CJB	Exodus	34	12	Be careful not to make a covenant with the people living in the land where you are going , so that they won ’ t become a snare within your own borders .
CJB	Exodus	34	13	Rather , you are to demolish their altars , smash their standing-stones and cut down their sacred poles ;
CJB	Exodus	34	14	because you are not to bow down to any other god ; since Adonai — whose very name is Jealous — is a jealous God .
CJB	Exodus	34	15	Do not make a covenant with the people living in the land . It will cause you to go astray after their gods and sacrifice to their gods . Then they will invite you to join them in eating their sacrifices ,
CJB	Exodus	34	16	and you will take their daughters as wives for your sons . Their daughters will prostitute themselves to their own gods and make your sons do the same !
CJB	Exodus	34	17	“ Do not cast metal gods for yourselves .
CJB	Exodus	34	18	“ Keep the festival of matzah by eating matzah , as I ordered you , for seven days during the month of Aviv ; for it was in the month of Aviv that you came out from Egypt .
CJB	Exodus	34	19	“ Everything that is first from the womb is mine . Of all your livestock , you are to set aside for me the males , the firstborn of cattle and flock .
CJB	Exodus	34	20	The firstborn of a donkey you must redeem with a lamb ; if you won ’ t redeem it , break its neck . All the firstborn of your sons you are to redeem , and no one is to appear before me empty-handed .
CJB	Exodus	34	21	“ Six days you will work , but on the seventh day you are to rest — even in plowing time and harvest season you are to rest .
CJB	Exodus	34	22	“ Observe the festival of Shavu ‘ ot with the first-gathered produce of the wheat harvest , and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year .
CJB	Exodus	34	23	Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Lord , Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Exodus	34	24	For I am going to expel nations ahead of you and expand your territory , and no one will even covet your land when you go up to appear before Adonai your God three times a year .
CJB	Exodus	34	25	You are not to offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread , and the sacrifice of the feast of Pesach is not to be left until morning .
CJB	Exodus	34	26	You are to bring the best firstfruits of your land into the house of Adonai your God . “ You are not to boil a young goat in its mother ’ s milk. ” ( vii )
CJB	Exodus	34	27	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Write these words down , because they are the terms of the covenant I have made with you and with Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Exodus	34	28	Moshe was there with Adonai forty days and forty nights , during which time he neither ate food nor drank water . [ Adonai ] wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant , the Ten Words .
CJB	Exodus	34	29	When Moshe came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand , he didn ’ t realize that the skin of his face was sending out rays of light as a result of his talking with [ Adonai ] .
CJB	Exodus	34	30	When Aharon and the people of Isra ’ el saw Moshe , the skin of his face was shining ; and they were afraid to approach him .
CJB	Exodus	34	31	But Moshe called to them ; then Aharon and all the community leaders came back to him , and Moshe spoke to them .
CJB	Exodus	34	32	Afterwards , all the people of Isra ’ el came near ; and he passed on to them all the orders that Adonai had told him on Mount Sinai . ( Maftir )
CJB	Exodus	34	33	Once Moshe had finished speaking with them , he put a veil on his face .
CJB	Exodus	34	35	But when the people of Isra ’ el saw Moshe ’ s face , that the skin of Moshe ’ s face shone , he would put the veil back over his face until he went in again to speak with [ Adonai ] . Haftarah Ki Tissa : M ’ lakhim Alef (
CJB	Exodus	34	1	Corinthians 10:1–13 ;
CJB	Exodus	35	35	He has filled them with the skill needed for every kind of work , whether done by an artisan , a designer , an embroiderer using blue , purple and scarlet yarn , and fine linen , or a weaver — they have the skill for every kind of work and design .
CJB	Exodus	35	22	Both men and women came , as many as had willing hearts ; they brought nose-rings , earrings , signet-rings , belts , all kinds of gold jewelry — everyone bringing an offering of gold to Adonai .
CJB	Exodus	35	23	Everyone who had blue , purple or scarlet yarn ; fine linen ; tanned ram skins or fine leather brought them .
CJB	Exodus	35	2	On six days work is to be done , but the seventh day is to be a holy day for you , a Shabbat of complete rest in honor of Adonai . Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death .
CJB	Exodus	35	3	You are not to kindle a fire in any of your homes on Shabbat. ”
CJB	Exodus	35	4	Moshe said to the whole community of the people of Isra ’ el , “ Here is what Adonai has ordered :
CJB	Exodus	35	5	‘ Take up a collection for Adonai from among yourselves — anyone whose heart makes him willing is to bring the offering for Adonai : gold , silver and bronze ;
CJB	Exodus	35	6	blue , purple and scarlet yarn ; fine linen , goat ’ s hair ,
CJB	Exodus	35	7	tanned ram skins and fine leather ; acacia-wood ;
CJB	Exodus	35	8	oil for the light , spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense ;
CJB	Exodus	35	9	onyx stones and stones to be set , for the ritual vest and the breastplate .
CJB	Exodus	35	10	“ ‘ Then let all the craftsmen among you come and make everything Adonai has ordered :
CJB	Exodus	35	11	the tabernacle with its tent , covering , fasteners , planks , crossbars , posts and sockets ;
CJB	Exodus	35	12	the ark with its poles , ark-cover and the curtain to screen it ;
CJB	Exodus	35	13	the table with its poles , all its utensils and the showbread ;
CJB	Exodus	35	14	the menorah for the light , with its utensils and lamps , and the oil for the light ;
CJB	Exodus	35	15	the incense altar with its poles ; the anointing oil ; the fragrant incense ; the screen for the entranceway at the entrance to the tabernacle ;
CJB	Exodus	35	16	the altar for burnt offerings , with its poles and all its utensils ; the basin with its base ;
CJB	Exodus	35	17	the tapestries for the courtyard , with their posts and sockets ; the screen for the gateway of the courtyard ;
CJB	Exodus	35	18	the tent pegs for the tabernacle ; the tent pegs for the courtyard , with their ropes ;
CJB	Exodus	35	19	the garments for officiating , for serving in the Holy Place ; and the holy garments for Aharon the cohen and the garments for his sons , so that they can serve in the office of cohen. ’ ”
CJB	Exodus	35	20	Then the whole community of the people of Isra ’ el withdrew from Moshe ’ s presence ; ( LY : ii )
CJB	Exodus	35	21	and they came , everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit made him willing , and brought Adonai ’ s offering for the work on the tent of meeting , for the service in it and for the holy garments .
CJB	Exodus	35	24	Everyone contributing silver or bronze brought his offering for Adonai , and everyone who had acacia-wood suitable for any of the work brought it .
CJB	Exodus	35	25	All the women who were skilled at spinning got to work and brought what they had spun , the blue , purple and scarlet yarn and the fine linen .
CJB	Exodus	35	26	Likewise the women whose heart stirred them to use their skill spun the goat ’ s hair .
CJB	Exodus	35	27	The leaders brought the onyx stones and the stones to be set , for the ritual vest and the breasplate ;
CJB	Exodus	35	28	the spices ; and the oil for the light , for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense .
CJB	Exodus	35	29	Thus every man and woman of the people of Isra ’ el whose heart impelled him to contribute to any of the work Adonai had ordered through Moshe brought it to Adonai as a voluntary offering . ( RY : ii , LY : iii )
CJB	Exodus	35	30	Moshe said to the people of Isra ’ el , “ See , Adonai has singled out B ’ tzal ’ el the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Exodus	35	31	He has filled him with the Spirit of God — with wisdom , understanding and knowledge concerning every kind of artisanry .
CJB	Exodus	35	32	He is a master of design in gold , silver , bronze ,
CJB	Exodus	35	33	cutting precious stones to be set , woodcarving and every other craft .
CJB	Exodus	35	34	[ Adonai ] has also given him and Oholi ’ av the son of Achisamakh , of the tribe of Dan , the ability to teach others .
CJB	Exodus	36	36	He made for it four posts of acacia-wood and overlaid them with gold , and gold hooks ; and cast for them four silver sockets .
CJB	Exodus	36	2	Moshe summoned B ’ tzal ’ el , Oholi ’ av and every craftsman to whom Adonai had given wisdom , everyone whose heart stirred him , to come and take part in the work .
CJB	Exodus	36	3	They received from Moshe all the offering which the people of Isra ’ el had brought for the work of building the sanctuary . But they still kept bringing voluntary offerings every morning ,
CJB	Exodus	36	4	until all the craftsmen doing the work for the sanctuary left the work they were involved with
CJB	Exodus	36	5	to tell Moshe , “ The people are bringing far more than is needed to do the work Adonai has ordered done. ”
CJB	Exodus	36	6	So Moshe gave an order which was proclaimed throughout the camp : “ Neither men nor women are to make any further efforts for the sanctuary offering. ” In this way , the people were restrained from making additional contributions .
CJB	Exodus	36	7	For what they had already was not only sufficient for doing all the work , but too much ! ( LY : iv )
CJB	Exodus	36	8	All the skilled men among them who did the work made the tabernacle , using ten sheets of finely woven linen and of blue , purple and scarlet yarn . He made them with k ’ ruvim worked in that had been crafted by a skilled artisan .
CJB	Exodus	36	9	Each sheet was forty-two feet long and six feet wide ; all the sheets were the same size .
CJB	Exodus	36	10	He joined five sheets one to another , and the other five sheets he joined one to another .
CJB	Exodus	36	11	He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost sheet in the first set and did the same on the edge of the outermost sheet in the second set .
CJB	Exodus	36	12	He made fifty loops on the one sheet , and he made fifty loops on the edge of the sheet in the second set ; the loops were opposite one another .
CJB	Exodus	36	13	He made fifty fasteners of gold and coupled the sheets to each other with the fasteners , so that the tabernacle formed a single unit .
CJB	Exodus	36	14	He made sheets of goat ’ s hair to be used as a tent covering the tabernacle ; he made eleven sheets .
CJB	Exodus	36	15	Each sheet was forty-five feet long and six feet wide ; all eleven sheets were the same size .
CJB	Exodus	36	16	He joined five sheets together and six sheets together .
CJB	Exodus	36	17	He made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost sheet in the first set and fifty loops on the outermost sheet in the second set .
CJB	Exodus	36	18	He made fifty fasteners of bronze to join the tent together , so that it would be a single unit .
CJB	Exodus	36	19	He made a covering for the tent of tanned ram skins and an outer covering of fine leather . ( LY : v )
CJB	Exodus	36	20	He made the upright planks of acacia-wood for the tabernacle .
CJB	Exodus	36	21	Each plank was fifteen feet long and two-and-a-quarter feet wide .
CJB	Exodus	36	22	There were two projections on each plank , and the planks were joined one to another . This is how he made all the planks for the tabernacle .
CJB	Exodus	36	23	He made the planks for the tabernacle as follows : twenty planks for the south side , facing southward .
CJB	Exodus	36	24	He made forty silver sockets under the twenty planks , two sockets under one plank for its two projections and two sockets under another plank for its two projections .
CJB	Exodus	36	25	For the second side of the tabernacle , to the north , he made twenty planks
CJB	Exodus	36	26	and their forty silver sockets , two sockets under one plank and two under another .
CJB	Exodus	36	27	For the rear part of the tabernacle , toward the west , he made six planks .
CJB	Exodus	36	28	For the corners of the tabernacle in the rear he made two planks ,
CJB	Exodus	36	29	double from the bottom all the way to the top but joined at a single ring . He did the same with both of them at the two corners .
CJB	Exodus	36	30	Thus there were eight planks with their silver sockets , sixteen sockets , two sockets under each plank .
CJB	Exodus	36	31	He made crossbars of acacia-wood , five for the planks of the one side of the tabernacle ,
CJB	Exodus	36	32	five crossbars for the planks of the other side of the tabernacle , and five crossbars for the planks at the side of the tabernacle at the rear toward the west .
CJB	Exodus	36	33	He made the middle crossbar so that it extended from one end of the planks to the other , halfway up .
CJB	Exodus	36	34	He overlaid the planks with gold , made gold rings for them through which the crossbars could pass and overlaid the crossbars with gold .
CJB	Exodus	36	35	He made the curtain of blue , purple and scarlet yarn and finely woven linen . He made them with k ’ ruvim worked in that had been crafted by a skilled artisan .
CJB	Exodus	36	37	For the entrance to the tent he made a screen of blue , purple and scarlet yarn and finely woven linen , in colors , the work of a weaver ;
CJB	Exodus	36	38	with its five posts and their hooks . He overlaid their capitals and their attached rings for hanging with gold , while their five sockets were of bronze .
CJB	Exodus	37	37	B ’ tzal ’ el made the ark of acacia-wood three-and-three-quarters feet long , two-and-a-quarter feet wide and two-and-a-quarter feet high .
CJB	Exodus	37	2	He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside and put a molding of gold for it around the top .
CJB	Exodus	37	3	He cast four gold rings for it at its four feet , two rings on each side .
CJB	Exodus	37	4	He made poles of acacia-wood and overlaid them with gold .
CJB	Exodus	37	5	He put the carrying-poles for the ark in the rings on the sides of the ark .
CJB	Exodus	37	6	He made a cover for the ark of pure gold , three-and-three-quarters feet long and two-and-a-quarter feet wide .
CJB	Exodus	37	7	He made two k ’ ruvim of gold ; he made them of hammered work for the two ends of the ark-cover —
CJB	Exodus	37	8	one keruv for one end and one keruv for the other end ; he made the k ’ ruvim of one piece with the ark-cover at its two ends .
CJB	Exodus	37	9	The k ’ ruvim had their wings spread out above , so that their wings covered the ark ; their faces were toward each other and toward the ark-cover .
CJB	Exodus	37	10	He made the table of acacia-wood , three feet long , eighteen inches wide and eighteen inches high .
CJB	Exodus	37	11	He overlaid it with pure gold and put a molding of gold around the top of it .
CJB	Exodus	37	12	He made around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a molding of gold around the rim .
CJB	Exodus	37	13	He cast for it four gold rings and attached the rings to the four corners , near its four legs .
CJB	Exodus	37	14	The rings to hold the carrying-poles for the table were placed close to the rim .
CJB	Exodus	37	15	He made the carrying-poles for the table of acacia-wood and overlaid them with gold .
CJB	Exodus	37	16	He made the utensils to be put on the table — its dishes , pans , bowls and pitchers — of pure gold . ( RY : iii , LY : vi )
CJB	Exodus	37	17	He made the menorah of pure gold . He made it of hammered work ; its base , shaft , cups , rings of outer leaves and flowers were a single unit .
CJB	Exodus	37	18	There were six branches extending from its sides , three branches of the menorah on one side of it and three on the other .
CJB	Exodus	37	19	On one branch were three cups shaped like almond blossoms , a ring of outer leaves and petals ; likewise on the opposite branch three cups shaped like almond blossoms , a ring of outer leaves and petals ; and similarly for all six branches extending from the menorah .
CJB	Exodus	37	20	On the central shaft of the menorah were four cups shaped like almond blossoms , each with its ring of outer leaves and petals .
CJB	Exodus	37	21	Where each pair of branches joined the central shaft was a ring of outer leaves of one piece with the pair of branches — thus for all six branches .
CJB	Exodus	37	22	Their rings of outer leaves and their branches were of one piece with the shaft . Thus the whole menorah was one piece of hammered work made of pure gold .

CJB	Exodus	39	21	Then they bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the vest with a blue cord , so that it could be on the vest ’ s decorated belt , and so that the breastplate would not swing loose from the vest — as Adonai had ordered Moshe . ( RY : vi , LY : iii )
CJB	Exodus	39	22	He made the robe for the ritual vest ; it was woven entirely of blue ,
CJB	Exodus	39	23	with its opening in the middle , like that of a coat of mail , and with a border around the opening , so that it wouldn ’ t tear .
CJB	Exodus	39	24	On the bottom hem they made pomegranates of blue , purple and scarlet , and woven linen ;
CJB	Exodus	39	25	and they made bells of pure gold , and put the bells between the pomegranates all the way around the hem of the robe — between the pomegranates ,
CJB	Exodus	39	26	that is , bell , pomegranate , bell , pomegranate , all the way around the hem of the robe for service — as Adonai had ordered Moshe .

CJB	Exodus	39	30	They made the ornament for the holy turban of pure gold ; wrote on it the words , “ Set apart for Adonai , ” like the engraving on a seal ;
CJB	Exodus	39	31	and tied a blue cord on it to fasten it to the front of the turban — as Adonai had ordered Moshe .

CJB	Exodus	40	14	Bring his sons , put tunics on them ,
CJB	Exodus	40	15	and anoint them as you anointed their father , so that they can serve me in the office of cohen . Their anointing will signify that the office of cohen is theirs through all their generations. ”
CJB	Exodus	40	16	Moshe did this — he acted in accordance with everything Adonai had ordered him to do . ( LY : vi )
CJB	Exodus	40	17	On the first day of the first month of the second year , the tabernacle was set up .
CJB	Exodus	40	18	Moshe erected the tabernacle , put its sockets in place , put up its planks , put in its crossbars and set up its posts .

CJB	Exodus	40	20	He took and put the testimony inside the ark , put the poles on the ark , and set the ark-cover above , on the ark .
CJB	Exodus	40	21	Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle , set up the curtain as a screen and concealed the ark for the testimony , as Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Exodus	40	22	He put the table in the tent of meeting on the side of the tabernacle facing north , outside the curtain .

CJB	Exodus	40	24	He put the menorah in the tent of meeting across from the table , on the side of the tabernacle facing south .

CJB	Exodus	40	33	Finally , he erected the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar and set up the screen for the entrance to the courtyard . ( Maftir )

CJB	Exodus	40	35	Moshe was unable to enter the tent of meeting , because the cloud remained on it , and the glory of Adonai filled the tabernacle .
CJB	Exodus	40	36	Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the people of Isra ’ el continued with all their travels .
CJB	Exodus	40	37	But if the cloud was not taken up , then they did not travel onward until the day when it was taken up .

CJB	Leviticus	5	14	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	5	15	“ If anyone acts improperly and inadvertently sins in regard to the holy things of Adonai , he is to bring as his guilt offering for Adonai a ram without defect from the flock or its equivalent in silver shekels ( using the sanctuary shekel as the standard ) , according to your appraisal of its value ; it is a guilt offering .
CJB	Leviticus	5	16	In addition , he is to make restitution for whatever he did wrong in regard to the holy thing ; moreover , he is to add to that one-fifth and give it to the cohen . Then the cohen will make atonement with the ram of the guilt offering , and he will be forgiven .
CJB	Leviticus	5	17	“ If someone sins by doing something against any of the mitzvot of Adonai concerning things which should not be done , he is guilty , even if he is unaware of it ; and he bears the consequences of his wrongdoing .

CJB	Leviticus	5	19	It is a guilt offering — he is certainly guilty before Adonai. ”
CJB	Leviticus	5	20	( 6:1 ) Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	5	21	( 6:2 ) “ If someone sins and acts perversely against Adonai by dealing falsely with his neighbor in regard to a deposit or security entrusted to him , by stealing from him , by extorting him ,
CJB	Leviticus	5	22	( 6:3 ) or by dealing falsely in regard to a lost object he has found , or by swearing to a lie — if a person commits any of these sins ,
CJB	Leviticus	5	23	( 6:4 ) then , if he sinned and is guilty , he is to restore whatever it was he stole or obtained by extortion , or whatever was deposited with him , or the lost object which he found , ( Maftir )
CJB	Leviticus	5	24	( 6:5 ) or anything about which he has sworn falsely . He is to restore it in full plus an additional one-fifth ; he must return it to the person who owns it , on the day when he presents his guilt offering .
CJB	Leviticus	5	25	( 6:6 ) He is to bring as his guilt offering to Adonai a ram without defect from the flock , or its equivalent according to your appraisal , to the cohen ; it is a guilt offering .
CJB	Leviticus	5	26	( 6:7 ) Thus the cohen will make atonement for him before Adonai , and he will be forgiven in regard to whatever it was he did that made him guilty .

CJB	Leviticus	7	15	The meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for giving thanks is to be eaten on the day of his offering ; he is not to leave any of it until morning .
CJB	Leviticus	7	16	But if the sacrifice connected with his offering is for a vow or is a voluntary offering , then , while it is to be eaten on the day he offers his sacrifice , what remains of it may be eaten the next day .
CJB	Leviticus	7	17	However , what remains of the meat of the sacrifice on the third day is to be burned up completely .
CJB	Leviticus	7	18	If any of the meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day , the sacrifice will neither be accepted nor credited to the person offering it ; rather , it will have become a disgusting thing , and whoever eats it will bear the consequences of his wrongdoing .
CJB	Leviticus	7	19	Meat which touches something unclean is not to be eaten but burned up completely . As for the meat , everyone who is clean may eat it ;
CJB	Leviticus	7	20	but a person in a state of uncleanness who eats any meat from the sacrifice of peace offerings made to Adonai will be cut off from his people .

CJB	Leviticus	7	31	The cohen is to make the fat go up in smoke on the altar , but the breast will belong to Aharon and his descendants .
CJB	Leviticus	7	32	You are to give the right thigh from your sacrifices of peace offerings to the cohen as a contribution .
CJB	Leviticus	7	33	The descendant of Aharon who offers the blood of the peace offerings is to have the right thigh as his share .
CJB	Leviticus	7	34	For the breast that has been waved and the thigh that has been contributed I have taken from the people of Isra ’ el out of their sacrifices of peace offerings and given them to Aharon the cohen and to his descendants as their share forever from the people of Isra ’ el. ’ ”

CJB	Leviticus	8	9	He set the turban on his head , and on the front of the turban he affixed the gold plate , the holy ornament , as Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Leviticus	8	10	Then Moshe took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it , thus consecrating them .
CJB	Leviticus	8	11	He sprinkled some on the altar seven times , anointing the altar with all its utensils and the basin with its base , to consecrate them .
CJB	Leviticus	8	12	He poured some of the anointing oil on Aharon ’ s head and anointed him , to consecrate him .
CJB	Leviticus	8	13	Moshe brought Aharon ’ s sons , clothed them with tunics , wrapped sashes on them and put headgear on them , as Adonai had ordered Moshe . ( v )
CJB	Leviticus	8	14	Then the young bull for the sin offering was brought , and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering .
CJB	Leviticus	8	15	After it had been slaughtered , Moshe took the blood and put it on the horns of the altar all the way around with his finger , thus purifying the altar . The remaining blood he poured out at the base of the altar and consecrated it , to make atonement for it .
CJB	Leviticus	8	16	Moshe took all the fat on the inner organs , the covering of the liver , the two kidneys and their fat , and made it go up in smoke on the altar .
CJB	Leviticus	8	17	But the bull , its hide , its flesh and its dung were taken outside the camp and burned up completely , as Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Leviticus	8	18	Next , the ram for the burnt offering was presented . Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram ;

CJB	Leviticus	8	21	When the inner organs and the lower parts of the legs had been washed with water , Moshe made the entire ram go up in smoke on the altar ; it was a burnt offering giving a fragrant aroma , an offering made by fire to Adonai — as Adonai had ordered Moshe . ( vi )

CJB	Leviticus	9	5	They brought what Moshe had ordered before the tent of meeting , and the whole community approached and stood before Adonai .

CJB	Leviticus	9	7	Moshe told Aharon , “ Approach the altar , offer your sin offering and burnt offering , and make atonement for yourself and the people . Then present the offering of the people and make atonement for them , as Adonai ordered. ”
CJB	Leviticus	9	8	So Aharon approached the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself .
CJB	Leviticus	9	10	But the fat , the kidneys and the covering of the liver of the sin offering he made go up in smoke on the altar , as Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Leviticus	9	11	The meat and the skin were burned up completely outside the camp .
CJB	Leviticus	9	12	Next he slaughtered the burnt offering ; Aharon ’ s sons brought him the blood , and he splashed it against all sides of the altar .
CJB	Leviticus	9	13	They brought him the burnt offering , piece by piece , and the head ; and he made them go up in smoke on the altar .
CJB	Leviticus	9	14	He washed the inner organs and the lower parts of the legs and made them go up in smoke on top of the burnt offering on the altar .
CJB	Leviticus	9	15	Then the people ’ s offering was presented . He took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people , slaughtered it and offered it for sin , like the earlier sin offering .
CJB	Leviticus	9	16	The burnt offering was presented , and he offered it in the prescribed manner . ( ii )
CJB	Leviticus	9	17	The grain offering was presented ; he took a handful of it and made it go up in smoke on the altar , in addition to the morning ’ s burnt offering .
CJB	Leviticus	9	18	He slaughtered the ox and the ram , the people ’ s sacrifice as peace offerings ; Aharon ’ s sons brought him the blood , which he splashed against all sides of the altar ,
CJB	Leviticus	9	19	and the fat of the ox and of the ram — the fat tail , the fat which covers the inner organs , the kidneys and the covering of the liver .
CJB	Leviticus	9	20	They put the fat on the breasts , and he made the fat go up in smoke on the altar .
CJB	Leviticus	9	21	The breasts and right thigh Aharon waved as a wave offering before Adonai , as Moshe had ordered .
CJB	Leviticus	9	22	Aharon raised his hands toward the people , blessed them and came down from offering the sin offering , the burnt offering and the peace offerings .
CJB	Leviticus	9	23	Moshe and Aharon entered the tent of meeting , came out and blessed the people . Then the glory of Adonai appeared to all the people ! ( iii )
CJB	Leviticus	9	24	Fire came forth from the presence of Adonai , consuming the burnt offering and the fat on the altar . When all the people saw it , they shouted and fell on their faces .
CJB	Leviticus	10	10	so that you will distinguish between the holy and the common , and between the unclean and the clean ;
CJB	Leviticus	10	2	At this , fire came forth from the presence of Adonai and consumed them , so that they died in the presence of Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	10	3	Moshe said to Aharon , “ This is what Adonai said : ‘ Through those who are near me I will be consecrated , and before all the people I will be glorified. ’ ” Aharon kept silent .
CJB	Leviticus	10	4	Moshe called Misha ’ el and Eltzafan , sons of ‘ Uzi ’ el Aharon ’ s uncle , and told them , “ Come here , and carry your cousins away from in front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp. ”
CJB	Leviticus	10	5	They approached and carried them in their tunics out of the camp , as Moshe had said .
CJB	Leviticus	10	6	Then Moshe told Aharon and his sons El ‘ azar and Itamar , “ Don ’ t unbind your hair or tear your clothes in mourning , so that you won ’ t die and so that Adonai won ’ t be angry with the entire community . Rather , let your kinsmen — the whole house of Isra ’ el — mourn , because of the destruction Adonai brought about with his fire .
CJB	Leviticus	10	7	Moreover , don ’ t leave the entrance to the tent of meeting , or you will die , because Adonai ’ s anointing oil is on you. ”
CJB	Leviticus	10	8	Adonai said to Aharon ,
CJB	Leviticus	10	9	“ Don ’ t drink any wine or other intoxicating liquor , neither you nor your sons with you , when you enter the tent of meeting , so that you will not die . This is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations ,
CJB	Leviticus	10	11	and so that you will teach the people of Isra ’ el all the laws Adonai has told them through Moshe. ” ( iv )
CJB	Leviticus	10	12	Moshe said to Aharon and to El ‘ azar and Itamar , his remaining sons , “ Take the grain offering left from the offerings for Adonai made by fire , and eat it without leaven next to the altar , because it is especially holy .
CJB	Leviticus	10	13	Eat it in a holy place , because it is your and your sons ’ share of the offerings for Adonai made by fire ; for this is what I have been ordered .
CJB	Leviticus	10	14	The breast that was waved and the thigh that was raised you are to eat in a clean place — you , your sons and your daughters with you ; for these are given as your and your children ’ s share of the sacrifices of the peace offerings presented by the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Leviticus	10	15	They are to bring the raised thigh and the waved breast , along with the offerings of fat made by fire , and wave it as a wave offering before Adonai ; then it will belong to you and your descendants with you as your perpetual share , as Adonai has ordered. ” ( v )
CJB	Leviticus	10	16	Then Moshe carefully investigated what had happened to the goat of the sin offering and discovered that it had been burned up . He became angry with El ‘ azar and Itamar , the remaining sons of Aharon , and asked ,
CJB	Leviticus	10	17	“ Why didn ’ t you eat the sin offering in the area of the sanctuary , since it is especially holy ? He gave it to you to take away the guilt of the community , to make atonement for them before Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	10	18	Look ! Its blood wasn ’ t brought into the sanctuary ! You should have eaten it there in the sanctuary , as I ordered. ”
CJB	Leviticus	10	19	Aharon answered Moshe , “ Even though they offered their sin offering and burnt offering today , things like these have happened to me ! If I had eaten the sin offering today , would it have pleased Adonai ? ”
CJB	Leviticus	10	20	On hearing this reply , Moshe was satisfied .
CJB	Leviticus	11	11	Yes , these will be detestable for you — you are not to eat their meat , and you are to detest their carcasses .
CJB	Leviticus	11	2	Corinthians 6:14–7:1 ; Galatians 2:11–16 ;
CJB	Leviticus	11	3	any that has a separate hoof which is completely divided and chews the cud — these animals you may eat . 4-6 But you are not to eat those that only chew the cud or only have a separate hoof . For example , the camel , the coney and the hare are unclean for you , because they chew the cud but don ’ t have a separate hoof ;
CJB	Leviticus	11	7	while the pig is unclean for you , because , although it has a separate and completely divided hoof , it doesn ’ t chew the cud .
CJB	Leviticus	11	8	You are not to eat meat from these or touch their carcasses ; they are unclean for you .
CJB	Leviticus	11	9	“ ‘ Of all the things that live in the water , you may eat these : anything in the water that has fins and scales , whether in seas or in rivers — these you may eat .
CJB	Leviticus	11	10	But everything in the seas and rivers without both fins and scales , of all the small water-creatures and of all the living creatures in the water , is a detestable thing for you .
CJB	Leviticus	11	12	Whatever lacks fins and scales in the water is a detestable thing for you .

CJB	Leviticus	11	22	Specifically , of these you may eat the various kinds of locusts , grasshoppers , katydids and crickets .

CJB	Leviticus	21	2	except for his close relatives — his mother , father , son , daughter and brother ;
CJB	Leviticus	21	3	he may also make himself unclean for his virgin sister who has never married and is therefore dependent on him .
CJB	Leviticus	21	4	He may not make himself unclean , because he is a leader among his people ; doing so would profane him .
CJB	Leviticus	21	5	Cohanim are not to make bald spots on their heads , mar the edges of their beards or cut gashes in their flesh .
CJB	Leviticus	21	6	Rather , they are to be holy for their God and not profane the name of their God . For they are the ones who present Adonai with offerings made by fire , the bread of their God ; therefore they must be holy .
CJB	Leviticus	21	7	“ ‘ A cohen is not to marry a woman who is a prostitute , who has been profaned or who has been divorced ; because he is holy for his God .
CJB	Leviticus	21	8	Rather , you are to set him apart as holy , because he offers the bread of your God ; he is to be holy for you , because I , Adonai , who makes you holy , am holy .
CJB	Leviticus	21	9	The daughter of a cohen who profanes herself by prostitution profanes her father ; she is to be put to death by fire .

CJB	Leviticus	21	16	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	21	17	“ Tell Aharon , ‘ None of your descendants who has a defect may approach to offer the bread of his God .
CJB	Leviticus	21	18	No one with a defect may approach — no one blind , lame , with a mutilated face or a limb too long ,
CJB	Leviticus	21	19	a broken foot or a broken arm ,
CJB	Leviticus	21	20	a hunched back , stunted growth , a cataract in his eye , festering or running sores , or damaged testicles —
CJB	Leviticus	21	22	He may eat the bread of his God , both the especially holy and the holy ;
CJB	Leviticus	21	23	only he is not to go in to the curtain or approach the altar , because he has a defect — so that he will not profane my holy places , because I am Adonai , who makes them holy. ’ ”
CJB	Leviticus	21	24	Moshe said these things to Aharon , his sons and all the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Leviticus	22	22	If it is blind , injured , mutilated , has an abnormal growth or has festering or running sores , you are not to offer it to Adonai or make such an offering by fire on the altar to Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	22	2	“ Tell Aharon and his sons to separate themselves from the holy things of the people of Isra ’ el which they set apart as holy for me , so that they will not profane my holy name ; I am Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	22	3	Tell them , ‘ Any descendant of yours through all your generations who approaches the holy things that the people of Isra ’ el consecrate to Adonai and is unclean will be cut off from before me ; I am Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	22	4	“ ‘ Any descendant of Aharon with tzara ‘ at or a discharge is not to eat the holy things until he is clean . Anyone who has touched a person made unclean by a dead body , or who has had a seminal emission ,
CJB	Leviticus	22	5	or who has touched a reptile or insect that can make him unclean , or a man who is unclean for any reason and who can transmit to him his uncleanness —
CJB	Leviticus	22	6	the person who touches any of these will be unclean until evening and is not to eat the holy things unless he bathes his body in water .
CJB	Leviticus	22	7	After sunset he will be clean ; and afterwards , he may eat the holy things ; because they are his food .
CJB	Leviticus	22	8	But he is not to eat anything that dies naturally or is torn to death by wild animals and thereby make himself unclean ; I am Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	22	9	The cohanim must observe this charge of mine ; otherwise , if they profane it , they will bear the consequences of their sin for doing so and die in it ; I am Adonai , who makes them holy .
CJB	Leviticus	22	10	“ ‘ No one who is not a cohen may eat anything holy , nor may a tenant or employee of a cohen eat anything holy .
CJB	Leviticus	22	11	But if a cohen acquires a slave , either through purchase or through his being born in his household , he may share his food .
CJB	Leviticus	22	12	If the daughter of a cohen is married to a man who is not a cohen , she is not to have a share of the food set aside from the holy things .
CJB	Leviticus	22	13	But if the daughter of a cohen is a widow or divorcee and has no child , and she is sent back to her father ’ s house as when she was young , she may share in her father ’ s food ; but no one not a cohen is to share in it .
CJB	Leviticus	22	14	If a person eats holy food by mistake , he must add one-fifth to it and give the holy food to the cohen .
CJB	Leviticus	22	15	They are not to profane the holy things of the people of Isra ’ el that they have set apart for Adonai
CJB	Leviticus	22	16	and thus cause them to bear guilt requiring a guilt offering , by eating their holy things ; because I am Adonai , who makes them holy. ’ ” ( iii )
CJB	Leviticus	22	17	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	22	18	“ Speak to Aharon and his sons and to the entire people of Isra ’ el ; tell them : ‘ When anyone , whether a member of the house of Isra ’ el or a foreigner living in Isra ’ el , brings his offering , either in connection with a vow or as a voluntary offering , and brings it to Adonai as a burnt offering ,
CJB	Leviticus	22	19	in order for you to be accepted , you must bring a male without defect from the cattle , the sheep or the goats .
CJB	Leviticus	22	20	You are not to bring anything with a defect , because it will not be accepted from you .
CJB	Leviticus	22	21	Whoever brings a sacrifice of peace offerings to Adonai in fulfillment of a vow or as a voluntary offering , whether it come from the herd or from the flock , it must be unblemished and without defect in order to be accepted .
CJB	Leviticus	22	23	If a bull or lamb has a limb which is too long or short , you may offer it as a voluntary offering ; but for a vow it will not be accepted .
CJB	Leviticus	22	24	An animal with bruised , crushed , torn or cut genitals you are not to offer to Adonai . You are not to do these things in your land ,
CJB	Leviticus	22	25	and you are not to receive any of these from a foreigner for you to offer as bread for your God , because their deformity is a defect in them — they will not be accepted from you. ’ ”
CJB	Leviticus	22	26	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	22	27	“ When a bull , sheep or goat is born , it is to stay with its mother for seven days ; but from the eighth day on , it may be accepted for an offering made by fire to Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	22	28	However , no animal is to be slaughtered together with its young on the same day , neither cow nor ewe .
CJB	Leviticus	22	29	“ When you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Adonai , you must do it in a way such that you will be accepted .
CJB	Leviticus	22	30	It must be eaten on the same day it is offered ; leave none of it till morning ; I am Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	22	31	“ You are to keep my mitzvot and obey them ; I am Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	22	32	You are not to profane my holy name ; on the contrary , I am to be regarded as holy among the people of Isra ’ el ; I am Adonai , who makes you holy ,
CJB	Leviticus	22	33	who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God ; I am Adonai . ”
CJB	Leviticus	23	23	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	23	2	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el : ‘ The designated times of Adonai which you are to proclaim as holy convocations are my designated times .

CJB	Leviticus	23	8	Bring an offering made by fire to Adonai for seven days . On the seventh day is a holy convocation ; do not do any kind of ordinary work. ’ ”
CJB	Leviticus	23	9	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	23	10	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ After you enter the land I am giving you and harvest its ripe crops , you are to bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the cohen .
CJB	Leviticus	23	11	He is to wave the sheaf before Adonai , so that you will be accepted ; the cohen is to wave it on the day after the Shabbat .
CJB	Leviticus	23	12	On the day that you wave the sheaf , you are to offer a male lamb without defect , in its first year , as a burnt offering for Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	23	13	Its grain offering is to be one gallon of fine flour mixed with olive oil , an offering made by fire to Adonai as a fragrant aroma ; its drink offering is to be of wine , one quart .
CJB	Leviticus	23	14	You are not to eat bread , dried grain or fresh grain until the day you bring the offering for your God ; this is a permanent regulation through all your generations , no matter where you live .
CJB	Leviticus	23	15	“ ‘ From the day after the day of rest — that is , from the day you bring the sheaf for waving — you are to count seven full weeks ,
CJB	Leviticus	23	16	until the day after the seventh week ; you are to count fifty days ; and then you are to present a new grain offering to Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	23	17	You must bring bread from your homes for waving — two loaves made with one gallon of fine flour , baked with leaven — as firstfruits for Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	23	18	Along with the bread , present seven lambs without defect one year old , one young bull and two rams ; these will be a burnt offering for Adonai , with their grain and drink offerings , an offering made by fire as a fragrant aroma for Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	23	19	Offer one male goat as a sin offering and two male lambs one year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings .
CJB	Leviticus	23	20	The cohen will wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before Adonai , with the two lambs ; these will be holy for Adonai for the cohen .
CJB	Leviticus	23	21	On the same day , you are to call a holy convocation ; do not do any kind of ordinary work ; this is a permanent regulation through all your generations , no matter where you live .
CJB	Leviticus	23	22	“ ‘ When you harvest the ripe crops produced in your land , don ’ t harvest all the way to the corners of your field , and don ’ t gather the ears of grain left by the harvesters ; leave them for the poor and the foreigner ; I am Adonai your God. ’ ” ( v )
CJB	Leviticus	23	24	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ In the seventh month , the first of the month is to be for you a day of complete rest for remembering , a holy convocation announced with blasts on the shofar .
CJB	Leviticus	23	25	Do not do any kind of ordinary work , and bring an offering made by fire to Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	Leviticus	23	26	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	23	27	“ The tenth day of this seventh month is Yom-Kippur ; you are to have a holy convocation , you are to deny yourselves , and you are to bring an offering made by fire to Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	23	28	You are not to do any kind of work on that day , because it is Yom-Kippur , to make atonement for you before Adonai your God .
CJB	Leviticus	23	29	Anyone who does not deny himself on that day is to be cut off from his people ;
CJB	Leviticus	23	30	and anyone who does any kind of work on that day , I will destroy from among his people .
CJB	Leviticus	23	31	You are not to do any kind of work ; it is a permanent regulation through all your generations , no matter where you live .
CJB	Leviticus	23	32	It will be for you a Shabbat of complete rest , and you are to deny yourselves ; you are to rest on your Shabbat from evening the ninth day of the month until the following evening. ” ( vi )
CJB	Leviticus	23	33	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	23	34	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of Sukkot for seven days to Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	23	35	On the first day there is to be a holy convocation ; do not do any kind of ordinary work .
CJB	Leviticus	23	36	For seven days you are to bring an offering made by fire to Adonai ; on the eighth day you are to have a holy convocation and bring an offering made by fire to Adonai ; it is a day of public assembly ; do not do any kind of ordinary work .
CJB	Leviticus	23	37	“ ‘ These are the designated times of Adonai that you are to proclaim as holy convocations and bring an offering made by fire to Adonai — a burnt offering , a grain offering , a sacrifice and drink offerings , each on its own day —
CJB	Leviticus	23	38	besides the Shabbats of Adonai , your gifts , all your vows and all your voluntary offerings that you give to Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	23	39	“ ‘ But on the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when you have gathered the produce of the land , you are to observe the festival of Adonai seven days ; the first day is to be a complete rest and the eighth day is to be a complete rest .
CJB	Leviticus	23	40	On the first day you are to take choice fruit , palm fronds , thick branches and river-willows , and celebrate in the presence of Adonai your God for seven days .
CJB	Leviticus	23	41	You are to observe it as a feast to Adonai seven days in the year ; it is a permanent regulation , generation after generation ; keep it in the seventh month .
CJB	Leviticus	23	42	You are to live in sukkot for seven days ; every citizen of Isra ’ el is to live in a sukkah ,
CJB	Leviticus	23	43	so that generation after generation of you will know that I made the people of Isra ’ el live in sukkot when I brought them out of the land of Egypt ; I am Adonai your God. ’ ”
CJB	Leviticus	23	44	Thus Moshe announced to the people of Isra ’ el the designated times of Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	24	24	( vii ) Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	24	2	“ Order the people of Isra ’ el to bring you pure oil from crushed olives for the light , to keep lamps burning always .
CJB	Leviticus	24	3	Outside the curtain of the testimony in the tent of meeting , Aharon is to arrange for the light to be kept burning always from evening until morning before Adonai ; this is to be a permanent regulation through all your generations .
CJB	Leviticus	24	4	He is always to keep in order the lamps on the pure menorah before Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	24	5	“ You are to take fine flour and use it to bake twelve loaves , one gallon per loaf .
CJB	Leviticus	24	6	Arrange them in two rows , six in a row , on the pure table before Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	24	7	Put frankincense with each row to be an offering made by fire to Adonai in place of the bread and as a reminder of it .
CJB	Leviticus	24	8	Regularly , every Shabbat , he is to arrange them before Adonai ; they are from the people of Isra ’ el , as a covenant forever .
CJB	Leviticus	24	9	They will belong to Aharon and his sons ; and they are to eat them in a holy place ; because for him they are , of the offerings for Adonai made by fire , especially holy . This is a permanent law. ”
CJB	Leviticus	24	10	There was a man who was the son of a woman of Isra ’ el and an Egyptian father . He went out among the people of Isra ’ el , and this son of a woman of Isra ’ el had a fight in the camp with a man of Isra ’ el ,
CJB	Leviticus	24	11	in the course of which the son of the woman of Isra ’ el uttered the Name [ Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh ] in a curse . So they brought him to Moshe . ( His mother ’ s name was Shlomit the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan . )
CJB	Leviticus	24	12	They put him under guard until Adonai would tell them what to do .
CJB	Leviticus	24	13	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Leviticus	24	14	“ Take the man who cursed outside the camp , have everyone who heard him lay their hands on his head , and have the entire community stone him .
CJB	Leviticus	24	15	Then tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ Whoever curses his God will bear the consequences of his sin ;
CJB	Leviticus	24	16	and whoever blasphemes the name of Adonai must be put to death ; the entire community must stone him . The foreigner as well as the citizen is to be put to death if he blasphemes the Name .
CJB	Leviticus	24	17	“ ‘ Anyone who strikes another person and kills him must be put to death .
CJB	Leviticus	24	18	Anyone who strikes an animal and kills it is to make restitution , life for life .
CJB	Leviticus	24	19	If someone injures his neighbor , what he did is to be done to him —
CJB	Leviticus	24	20	break for break , eye for eye , tooth for tooth — whatever injury he has caused the other person is to be rendered to him in return . ( Maftir )
CJB	Leviticus	24	21	He who kills an animal is to make restitution , but he who kills another person is to be put to death .
CJB	Leviticus	24	22	You are to apply the same standard of judgment to the foreigner as to the citizen , because I am Adonai your God. ”
CJB	Leviticus	24	23	So Moshe spoke to the people of Isra ’ el , and they took the man who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him to death . Thus the people of Isra ’ el did as Adonai had ordered Moshe .

CJB	Leviticus	25	25	That is , if one of you becomes poor and sells some of his property , his next-of-kin can come and buy back what his relative sold .
CJB	Leviticus	25	32	“ ‘ Concerning the cities of the L ’ vi ’ im and the houses in the cities they possess , the L ’ vi ’ im are to have a permanent right of redemption .
CJB	Leviticus	25	33	If someone purchases a house from one of the L ’ vi ’ im , then the house he sold in the city where he owns property will still revert to him in the yovel ; because the houses in the cities of the L ’ vi ’ im are their tribe ’ s possession among the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Leviticus	25	2	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ When you enter the land I am giving you , the land itself is to observe a Shabbat rest for Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	25	3	Six years you will sow your field ; six years you will prune your grapevines and gather their produce .
CJB	Leviticus	25	4	But in the seventh year is to be a Shabbat of complete rest for the land , a Shabbat for Adonai ; you will neither sow your field nor prune your grapevines .
CJB	Leviticus	25	5	You are not to harvest what grows by itself from the seeds left by your previous harvest , and you are not to gather the grapes of your untended vine ; it is to be a year of complete rest for the land .
CJB	Leviticus	25	6	But what the land produces during the year of Shabbat will be food for all of you — you , your servant , your maid , your employee , anyone living near you ,
CJB	Leviticus	25	7	your livestock and the wild animals on your land ; everything the land produces may be used for food .
CJB	Leviticus	25	8	“ ‘ You are to count seven Shabbats of years , seven times seven years , that is , forty-nine years .
CJB	Leviticus	25	9	Then , on the tenth day of the seventh month , on Yom-Kippur , you are to sound a blast on the shofar ; you are to sound the shofar all through your land ;
CJB	Leviticus	25	10	and you are to consecrate the fiftieth year , proclaiming freedom throughout the land to all its inhabitants . It will be a yovel for you ; you will return everyone to the land he owns , and everyone is to return to his family .
CJB	Leviticus	25	11	That fiftieth year will be a yovel for you ; in that year you are not to sow , harvest what grows by itself or gather the grapes of untended vines ;
CJB	Leviticus	25	12	because it is a yovel . It will be holy for you ; whatever the fields produce will be food for all of you .
CJB	Leviticus	25	13	In this year of yovel , every one of you is to return to the land he owns . ( LY : ii )
CJB	Leviticus	25	14	“ ‘ If you sell anything to your neighbor or buy anything from him , neither of you is to exploit the other .
CJB	Leviticus	25	15	Rather , you are to take into account the number of years after the yovel when you buy land from your neighbor , and he is to sell to you according to the number of years crops will be raised .
CJB	Leviticus	25	16	If the number of years remaining is large , you will raise the price ; if few years remain , you will lower it ; because what he is really selling you is the number of crops to be produced .
CJB	Leviticus	25	17	Thus you are not to take advantage of each other , but you are to fear your God ; for I am Adonai your God .
CJB	Leviticus	25	18	“ ‘ Rather , you are to keep my regulations and rulings and act accordingly . If you do , you will live securely in the land . ( RY : ii , LY : iii )
CJB	Leviticus	25	19	The land will yield its produce , you will eat until you have enough , and you will live there securely .
CJB	Leviticus	25	20	“ ‘ If you ask , “ If we aren ’ t allowed to sow seed or harvest what our land produces , what are we going to eat the seventh year ? ”
CJB	Leviticus	25	21	then I will order my blessing on you during the sixth year , so that the land brings forth enough produce for all three years .
CJB	Leviticus	25	22	The eighth year you will sow seed but eat the the old , stored produce until the ninth year ; that is , until the produce of the eighth year comes in , you will eat the old , stored food .
CJB	Leviticus	25	23	“ ‘ The land is not to be sold in perpetuity , because the land belongs to me — you are only foreigners and temporary residents with me .
CJB	Leviticus	25	24	Therefore , when you sell your property , you must include the right of redemption . ( LY : iv )
CJB	Leviticus	25	26	If the seller has no one to redeem it but becomes rich enough to redeem it himself ,
CJB	Leviticus	25	27	he will calculate the number of years the land was sold for , refund the excess to its buyer , and return to his property .
CJB	Leviticus	25	28	If he hasn ’ t sufficient means to get it back himself , then what he sold will remain in the hands of the buyer until the year of yovel ; in the yovel the buyer will vacate it and the seller return to his property . ( RY : iii , LY : v )
CJB	Leviticus	25	29	“ ‘ If someone sells a dwelling in a walled city , he has one year after the date of sale in which to redeem it . For a full year he will have the right of redemption ;
CJB	Leviticus	25	30	but if he has not redeemed the dwelling in the walled city within the year , then title in perpetuity passes to the buyer through all his generations ; it will not revert in the yovel .
CJB	Leviticus	25	31	However , houses in villages not surrounded by walls are to be dealt with like the fields in the countryside — they may be redeemed [ before the yovel ] , and they revert in the yovel .
CJB	Leviticus	25	34	The fields in the open land around their cities may not be sold , because that is their permanent possession .
CJB	Leviticus	25	35	“ ‘ If a member of your people has become poor , so that he can ’ t support himself among you , you are to assist him as you would a foreigner or a temporary resident , so that he can continue living with you .

CJB	Leviticus	25	39	“ ‘ If a member of your people has become poor among you and sells himself to you , do not make him do the work of a slave .
CJB	Leviticus	25	40	Rather , you are to treat him like an employee or a tenant ; he will work for you until the year of yovel .
CJB	Leviticus	25	41	Then he will leave you , he and his children with him , and return to his own family and regain possession of his ancestral land .
CJB	Leviticus	25	42	For they are my slaves , whom I brought out of the land of Egypt ; therefore they are not to be sold as slaves .

CJB	Leviticus	25	51	If many years remain , according to them will he refund the amount for his redemption from the amount he was bought for .
CJB	Leviticus	25	52	If there remain only a few years until the year of yovel , then he will calculate with him ; according to his years will he refund the amount for his redemption .
CJB	Leviticus	25	53	He will be like a worker hired year by year . You will see to it that he is not treated harshly .

CJB	Leviticus	25	55	For to me the people of Isra ’ el are slaves ; they are my slaves whom I brought out of the land of Egypt ; I am Adonai your God .
CJB	Leviticus	26	26	I will cut off your supply of bread , so that ten women will bake your bread in one oven and dole out your bread by weight , and you will eat but not be satisfied .

CJB	Leviticus	26	33	You I will disperse among the nations , and I will draw out the sword in pursuit after you ; your land will be a desolation and your cities a wasteland .
CJB	Leviticus	26	32	I will desolate the land , so that your enemies living in it will be astounded by it .
CJB	Leviticus	26	3	“ ‘ If you live by my regulations , observe my mitzvot and obey them ;
CJB	Leviticus	26	4	then I will provide the rain you need in its season , the land will yield its produce , and the trees in the field will yield their fruit .
CJB	Leviticus	26	5	Your threshing time will extend until the grape harvest , and your grape harvesting will extend until the time for sowing seed . You will eat as much food as you want and live securely in your land . ( LY : ii )

CJB	Leviticus	26	7	You will pursue your enemies , and they will fall before your sword .
CJB	Leviticus	26	8	Five of you will chase a hundred , and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand — your enemies will fall before your sword .
CJB	Leviticus	26	9	“ ‘ I will turn toward you , make you productive , increase your numbers and uphold my covenant with you . ( RY : v , LY : iii )
CJB	Leviticus	26	10	You will eat all you want from last year ’ s harvest and throw out what remains of the old to make room for the new .
CJB	Leviticus	26	11	I will put my tabernacle among you , and I will not reject you ,
CJB	Leviticus	26	12	but I will walk among you and be your God , and you will be my people .
CJB	Leviticus	26	13	I am Adonai your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , so that you would not be their slaves . I have broken the bars of your yoke , so that you can walk upright .
CJB	Leviticus	26	14	“ ‘ But if you will not listen to me and obey all these mitzvot ,
CJB	Leviticus	26	15	if you loathe my regulations and reject my rulings , in order not to obey all my mitzvot but cancel my covenant ;
CJB	Leviticus	26	16	then I , for my part , will do this to you : I will bring terror upon you — wasting disease and chronic fever to dim your sight and sap your strength . You will sow your seed for nothing , because your enemies will eat the crops .
CJB	Leviticus	26	17	I will set my face against you — your enemies will defeat you , those who hate you will hound you , and you will flee when no one is pursuing you .
CJB	Leviticus	26	18	If these things don ’ t make you listen to me , then I will discipline you seven times over for your sins .
CJB	Leviticus	26	19	I will break the pride you have in your own power . I will make your sky like iron , your soil like bronze —
CJB	Leviticus	26	20	you will spend your strength in vain , because the land will not yield its produce or the trees in the field their fruit .
CJB	Leviticus	26	21	“ ‘ Yes , if you go against me and don ’ t listen to me , I will increase your calamities sevenfold , according to your sins .
CJB	Leviticus	26	22	I will send wild animals among you ; they will rob you of your children , destroy your livestock and reduce your numbers , until your roads are deserted .
CJB	Leviticus	26	23	“ ‘ If , in spite of all this , you refuse my correction and still go against me ;
CJB	Leviticus	26	24	then I too will go against you ; and I , yes I , will strike you seven times over for your sins .
CJB	Leviticus	26	25	I will bring a sword against you which will execute the vengeance of the covenant . You will be huddled inside your cities , I will send sickness among you , and you will be handed over to the power of the enemy .
CJB	Leviticus	26	27	“ ‘ And if , for all this , you still will not listen to me , but go against me ;
CJB	Leviticus	26	28	then I will go against you furiously , and I also will chastise you yet seven times more for your sins .
CJB	Leviticus	26	29	You will eat the flesh of your own sons , you will eat the flesh of your own daughters .
CJB	Leviticus	26	30	I will destroy your high places , cut down your pillars for sun-worship , and throw your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols ; and I will detest you .
CJB	Leviticus	26	31	I will lay waste to your cities and make your sanctuaries desolate , so as not to smell your fragrant aromas .
CJB	Leviticus	26	34	Then , at last , the land will be paid its Shabbats . As long as it lies desolate and you are in the lands of your enemies , the land will rest and be repaid its Shabbats .
CJB	Leviticus	26	35	Yes , as long as it lies desolate it will have rest , the rest it did not have during your Shabbats , when you lived there .
CJB	Leviticus	26	36	As for those of you who are left , I will fill their hearts with anxiety in the lands of their enemies . The sound of a driven leaf will frighten them , so that they will flee as one flees from the sword and fall when no one is pursuing .
CJB	Leviticus	26	37	Yes , with no one pursuing they will stumble over each other as if fleeing the sword — you will have no power to stand before your enemies .
CJB	Leviticus	26	38	And among the nations you will perish ; the land of your enemies will devour you .
CJB	Leviticus	26	39	Those of you who remain will pine away in the lands of your enemies from guilt over your misdeeds and those of your ancestors .
CJB	Leviticus	26	40	Then they will confess their misdeeds and those of their ancestors which they committed against me in their rebellion ; they will admit that they went against me .
CJB	Leviticus	26	41	At that time I will be going against them , bringing them into the lands of their enemies . But if their uncircumcised hearts will grow humble , and they are paid the punishment for their misdeeds ;
CJB	Leviticus	26	42	then I will remember my covenant with Ya ‘ akov , also my covenant with Yitz ’ chak and my covenant with Avraham ; and I will remember the land .
CJB	Leviticus	26	43	For the land will lie abandoned without them , and it will be paid its Shabbats while it lies desolate without them ; and they will be paid the punishment for their misdeeds , because they rejected my rulings and loathed my regulations .
CJB	Leviticus	26	44	Yet , in spite of all that , I will not reject them when they are in the lands of their enemies , nor will I loathe them to the point of utterly destroying them and thus break my covenant with them , because I am Adonai their God .
CJB	Leviticus	26	45	Rather , for their sakes , I will remember the covenant of their ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt — with the nations watching — so that I might be their God ; I am Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	Leviticus	26	46	These are the laws , rulings and teachings that Adonai himself gave to the people of Isra ’ el on Mount Sinai through Moshe .
CJB	Leviticus	27	27	But if it is an unclean animal , he may redeem it at the price at which you value it and add one-fifth ; or if he does not redeem it , it is to be sold at the price at which you value it .
CJB	Leviticus	27	2	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ If someone makes a clearly defined vow to Adonai to give him an amount equal to the value of a human being ,
CJB	Leviticus	27	3	the value you are to assign to a man between the ages of twenty and sixty years is to be fifty shekels of silver [ one-and-a-quarter pounds ] , with the sanctuary shekel being the standard ,
CJB	Leviticus	27	4	if a woman , thirty shekels .
CJB	Leviticus	27	5	If it is a child five to twenty years old , assign a value of twenty shekels for a boy and ten for a girl ;
CJB	Leviticus	27	6	if a baby one month to five years of age , five shekels for a boy and three for a girl ;
CJB	Leviticus	27	7	if a person past sixty , fifteen shekels for a man and ten for a woman .
CJB	Leviticus	27	8	If the person is too poor to be evaluated , set him before the cohen , who will assign him a value in keeping with the means of the person who made the vow .
CJB	Leviticus	27	9	“ ‘ If the vow is for the value of an animal of the kind used when people bring an offering to Adonai , all that a person gives of such animals to Adonai will be holy .
CJB	Leviticus	27	10	He is not to exchange or replace it by substituting a good animal for a bad one or vice versa ; if he does make such a substitution , both the original animal and the one replacing it will be holy .
CJB	Leviticus	27	11	If the animal is an unclean one , such as may not be used in an offering to Adonai , he must set it before the cohen ;
CJB	Leviticus	27	12	and the cohen is to set a value on it in relation to its good and bad points ; the value set by you the cohen will stand .
CJB	Leviticus	27	13	But if the person making the vow wishes to redeem the animal , he must add one-fifth to your valuation .
CJB	Leviticus	27	14	“ ‘ When a person consecrates his house to be holy for Adonai , the cohen is to set a value on it in relation to its good and bad points ; the value set by the cohen will stand .
CJB	Leviticus	27	15	If the consecrator wishes to redeem his house , he must add one-fifth to the value you have set on it ; and it will revert to him . ( RY : vii , LY : v )
CJB	Leviticus	27	16	“ ‘ If a person consecrates to Adonai part of a field belonging to his tribe ’ s possession , you are to value it according to its production , with five bushels of barley being valued at fifty shekels of silver [ one-and-a-quarter pounds ] .
CJB	Leviticus	27	17	If he consecrates his field during the year of yovel , this valuation will stand .
CJB	Leviticus	27	18	But if he consecrates his field after the yovel , then the cohen is to calculate the price according to the years remaining till the next yovel , with a corresponding reduction from your valuation .
CJB	Leviticus	27	19	If the one consecrating the field wishes to redeem it , he must add one-fifth to your valuation , and the field will be set aside to revert to him .
CJB	Leviticus	27	20	If the seller does not wish to redeem the field , or if [ the treasurer for the cohanim ] has already sold the field to someone else , it can no longer be redeemed .
CJB	Leviticus	27	21	But when the purchaser has to vacate the field in the yovel , it will become holy to Adonai , like a field unconditionally consecrated ; it will belong to the cohanim . ( LY : vi )
CJB	Leviticus	27	22	“ ‘ If he consecrates to Adonai a field which he has bought , a field which is not part of his tribe ’ s possession ,
CJB	Leviticus	27	23	then the cohen is to calculate its value according to the years remaining until the year of yovel ; and the man will on that same day pay this amount ; since it is holy to Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	27	24	In the year of yovel the field will revert to the person from whom it was bought , that is , to the person to whose tribal possession it belongs .
CJB	Leviticus	27	25	“ ‘ All your valuations are to be according to the sanctuary shekel [ two-fifths of an ounce ] , twenty gerahs to the shekel .
CJB	Leviticus	27	26	“ ‘ However , the firstborn among animals , since it is already born as a firstborn for Adonai , no one can consecrate — neither ox nor sheep — since it belongs to Adonai already .
CJB	Leviticus	27	28	However , nothing consecrated unconditionally which a person may consecrate to Adonai out of all he owns — person , animal or field he possesses — is to be sold or redeemed ; because everything consecrated unconditionally is especially holy to Adonai . ( LY : vii )
CJB	Leviticus	27	29	No person who has been sentenced to die , and thus unconditionally consecrated , can be redeemed ; he must be put to death .
CJB	Leviticus	27	30	“ ‘ All the tenth given from the land , whether from planted seed or fruit from trees , belongs to Adonai ; it is holy to Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	27	31	If someone wants to redeem any of his tenth , he must add to it one-fifth . ( Maftir )
CJB	Leviticus	27	32	“ ‘ All the tenth from the herd or the flock , whatever passes under the shepherd ’ s crook , the tenth one will be holy to Adonai .
CJB	Leviticus	27	33	The owner is not to inquire whether the animal is good or bad , and he can not exchange it ; if he does exchange it , both it and the one he substituted for it will be holy ; it can not be redeemed. ’ ”
CJB	Leviticus	27	34	These are the mitzvot which Adonai gave to Moshe for the people of Isra ’ el on Mount Sinai . Haftarah B ’ chukkotai : Yirmeyahu ( Jeremiah ) 16:19–17:14 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah B ’ chukkotai : Yochanan ( John ) 14:15–21 ; 15:10–12 ;

CJB	Numbers	1	1	Adonai spoke to Moshe in the Sinai Desert , in the tent of meeting , on the first day of the second month of the second year after they had left the land of Egypt . He said ,
CJB	Numbers	1	34	: B ’ midbar ( In the desert ) 1:1–4:20
CJB	Numbers	1	2	“ Take a census of the entire assembly of the people of Isra ’ el , by clans and families . Record the names of all the men
CJB	Numbers	1	3	twenty years old and over who are subject to military service in Isra ’ el . You and Aharon are to enumerate them company by company .
CJB	Numbers	1	4	Take with you from each tribe someone who is head of a clan .
CJB	Numbers	1	5	These are the men to take with you : From Re ’ uven , Elitzur the son of Sh ’ de ’ ur ;
CJB	Numbers	1	6	From Shim ‘ on , Shlumi ’ el the son of Tzurishaddai ;
CJB	Numbers	1	7	From Y ’ hudah , Nachshon the son of ‘ Amminadav ;
CJB	Numbers	1	8	From Yissakhar , N ’ tan ’ el the son of Tzu ‘ ar ;
CJB	Numbers	1	9	From Z ’ vulun , Eli ’ av the son of Helon .
CJB	Numbers	1	10	Of the children of Yosef : From Efrayim , Elishama the son of ‘ Ammihud ; From M ’ nasheh , Gamli ’ el the son of P ’ dahtzur .
CJB	Numbers	1	11	From Binyamin , Avidan the son of Gid ‘ oni ;
CJB	Numbers	1	12	From Dan , Achi ‘ ezer the son of ‘ Ammishaddai ;
CJB	Numbers	1	13	From Asher , Pag ‘ i ’ el the son of ‘ Okhran ;
CJB	Numbers	1	14	From Gad , Elyasaf the son of De ‘ u ’ el ;
CJB	Numbers	1	15	From Naftali , Achira the son of ‘ Enan. ”
CJB	Numbers	1	16	These were the ones called from the assembly , the chiefs of their fathers ’ clans and heads of thousands in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	1	17	So Moshe and Aharon took these men who had been designated by name ;
CJB	Numbers	1	18	and , on the first day of the second month , they gathered the whole assembly to state their genealogies by families and clans and recorded the names of all those twenty years old and over , as well as their total numbers .
CJB	Numbers	1	19	Moshe counted them in the Sinai Desert , just as Adonai had ordered him . ( ii )
CJB	Numbers	1	20	The men twenty years old and over who were subject to military service were recorded by name , family and clan , starting with the descendants of Re ’ uven , Isra ’ el ’ s firstborn . Here are the totals : |21 Descendants of Re ’ uven||46,500| |22-23 Descendants of Shim ‘ on||59,300| |24-25 Descendants of Gad||45,650| |26-27 Descendants of Y ’ hudah||74,600| |28-29 Descendants of Yissakhar||54,400| |30-31 Descendants of Z ’ vulun||57,400| |32-33 Descendants of Efrayim||40,500| |34-35 Descendants of M ’ nasheh||32,200| |36-37 Descendants of Binyamin||35,400| |38-39 Descendants of Dan||62,700| |40-41 Descendants of Asher||41,500| |42-43 Descendants of Naftali||53,400|
CJB	Numbers	1	44	Moshe , Aharon and the twelve leaders of Isra ’ el , each from a clan ,
CJB	Numbers	1	45	counted the people of Isra ’ el by their clans , those twenty years old and over , eligible for military service in Isra ’ el ;
CJB	Numbers	1	46	and the grand total came to 603,550 .
CJB	Numbers	1	47	But those who were L ’ vi ’ im , according to the clan of their fathers , were not counted in this census ;
CJB	Numbers	1	48	because Adonai had told Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	1	49	“ Do not include the clan of Levi when you take the census of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	1	50	Instead , give the L ’ vi ’ im charge over the tabernacle of the testimony , its equipment and everything else connected with it . They are to carry the tabernacle and all its equipment , serve in it and set up their camp around it .
CJB	Numbers	1	51	When the tabernacle is to be moved onward , it is the L ’ vi ’ im who are to take it down and set it up in the new location ; anyone else who involves himself is to be put to death .
CJB	Numbers	1	52	The rest of Isra ’ el are to set up camp , company by company , each man with his own banner .
CJB	Numbers	1	53	But the L ’ vi ’ im are to camp around the tabernacle of the testimony , so that no anger will come upon the assembly of the people of Isra ’ el . The L ’ vi ’ im are to be in charge of the tabernacle of the testimony. ”
CJB	Numbers	1	54	This is what the people of Isra ’ el did — they did everything that Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	2	2	“ The people of Isra ’ el are to set up camp by clans , each man with his own banner and under his clan ’ s symbol ; they are to camp around the tent of meeting , but at a distance . 3-9 “ Those camping on the east side toward the sunrise are to be under the banner of the camp of Y ’ hudah ; they are to camp according to companies ; by tribe and leader they are as follows : |Tribe||Chief||Number| |Y ’ hudah||Nachshon the son of ‘ Amminadav||74,600| |Yissakhar||N ’ tan ’ el the son of Tzu ‘ ar||54,400| |Z ’ vulun||Eli ’ av the son of Helon||57,400| |Total||186,400| “ This group is to set out first . 10-16 “ Those camping on the south are to be under the banner of the camp of Re ’ uven ; they are to camp according to companies ; by tribe and leader they are as follows : |Tribe||Chief||Number| |Re ’ uven||Elitzur the son of Sh ’ de ’ ur||46,500| |Shim ‘ on||Shlumi ’ el the son of Tzurishaddai||59,300| |Gad||Elyasaf the son of Re ‘ u ’ el||45,650| |Total||151,450| “ This group is to set out second .
CJB	Numbers	2	17	“ Then the tent of meeting , with the camp of the L ’ vi ’ im , will set out , with the other camps in front and behind . They will go in the same order as their camps are set up — each man will go forward in his position , under his banner . 18-24 “ Those camping on the west are to be under the banner of the camp of Efrayim ; they are to camp according to companies ; by tribe and leader they are as follows : |Tribe||Chief||Number| |Efrayim||Elishama the son of ‘ Ammihud||40,500| |M ’ nasheh||Gamli ’ el the son of P ’ dahtzur||32,200| |Binyamin||Avidan the son of Gid ‘ oni||35,400| |Total||108,100| “ This group is to set out third . 25-31 “ Those camping on the north are to be under the banner of the camp of Dan ; they are to camp according to companies ; by tribe and leader they are as follows : |Tribe||Chief||Number| |Dan||Achi ‘ ezer the son of ‘ Ammishaddai||62,700| |Asher||Pag ‘ i ’ el the son of ‘ Okhran||41,500| |Naftali||Achira the son of ‘ Enan||53,400| |Total||157,600| “ This group is to set out last with their banners. ”
CJB	Numbers	2	32	These are the ones counted from the people of Isra ’ el by clans ; the total number recorded in the camps , company by company , was 603,550 .
CJB	Numbers	2	33	But , as Adonai ordered Moshe , the L ’ vi ’ im were not counted with the rest of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	2	34	The people of Isra ’ el did everything Adonai had ordered Moshe : they set up camp under their banners , and they set out , each according to his family and clan .
CJB	Numbers	3	3	These were the names of the sons of Aharon the cohen , whom he anointed and ordained as cohanim .
CJB	Numbers	3	2	The names of the sons of Aharon are : Nadav the firstborn , Avihu , El ‘ azar and Itamar .
CJB	Numbers	3	4	But Nadav and Avihu died in the presence of Adonai when they offered unauthorized fire before Adonai in the Sinai Desert , and they had no children ; El ‘ azar and Itamar served as cohanim in the presence of Aharon their father .
CJB	Numbers	3	5	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	3	6	“ Summon the tribe of Levi , and assign them to Aharon the cohen , so that they can help him .
CJB	Numbers	3	7	They are to carry out his duties and the duties of the whole community before the tent of meeting in performing the service of the tabernacle .
CJB	Numbers	3	8	They are to be in charge of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting and to carry out all the duties of the people of Isra ’ el connected with the service of the tabernacle .
CJB	Numbers	3	9	Assign the L ’ vi ’ im to Aharon and his sons ; their one responsibility in regard to the people of Isra ’ el is to serve him .
CJB	Numbers	3	10	You are to appoint Aharon and his sons to carry out the duties of cohanim ; anyone else who involves himself is to be put to death. ”
CJB	Numbers	3	11	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	3	12	“ I have taken the L ’ vi ’ im from among the people of Isra ’ el in lieu of every firstborn male that is first from the womb among the people of Isra ’ el ; the L ’ vi ’ im are to be mine .
CJB	Numbers	3	13	All the firstborn males belong to me , because on the day that I killed all the firstborn males in the land of Egypt , I separated for myself all the firstborn males in Isra ’ el , both human and animal . They are mine ; I am Adonai. ” ( v )
CJB	Numbers	3	14	Adonai said to Moshe in the Sinai Desert ,
CJB	Numbers	3	15	“ Take a census of the tribe of Levi by clans and families . Count every male a month old or over. ”
CJB	Numbers	3	16	Moshe counted them in the manner Adonai had said , as he had been ordered .
CJB	Numbers	3	17	The names of the sons of Levi were Gershon , K ’ hat and M ’ rari .
CJB	Numbers	3	18	The names of the sons of Gershon were Livni and Shim ‘ i ; they fathered their respective clans ;
CJB	Numbers	3	19	likewise the sons of K ’ hat — ‘ Amram , Yitz ’ har , Hevron and ‘ Uzi ’ el —
CJB	Numbers	3	20	and the sons of M ’ rari — Machli and Mushi . These fathered the clans of the L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	Numbers	3	21	Gershon fathered the clans of Livni and Shim ‘ i ; these were the Gershon clans .
CJB	Numbers	3	22	Of them , 7,500 males a month old and over were counted .
CJB	Numbers	3	23	The Gershon clans were to camp behind the tabernacle , toward the west .
CJB	Numbers	3	24	The chief of the Gershon clan was Elyasaf , the son of La ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	3	25	In connection with the tent of meeting , the descendants of Gershon were to be in charge of the following : the tabernacle itself , its inner and outer coverings , the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting ,
CJB	Numbers	3	26	the curtains surrounding the courtyard , the screen for the entrance of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and the altar , all the fixtures and ropes for these items , and their maintenance .
CJB	Numbers	3	27	K ’ hat fathered the clans of ‘ Amram , Yitz ’ har , Hevron and ‘ Uzi ’ el ; these were the K ’ hat clans .
CJB	Numbers	3	28	Of them , 8,600 males a month old and over were counted ; they were in charge of the Holy Place .
CJB	Numbers	3	29	The K ’ hat clans were to camp next to the tabernacle , toward the south .
CJB	Numbers	3	30	The chief of the K ’ hat clan was Elitzafan the son of ‘ Uzi ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	3	31	They were responsible for the ark , the table , the menorah , the altars , the utensils the cohanim use when they serve in the Holy Place , the curtain , and everything involved with the maintenance of these things .
CJB	Numbers	3	32	El ‘ azar the son of Aharon the cohen was first among the chiefs of the L ’ vi ’ im and supervised those in charge of the Holy Place .
CJB	Numbers	3	33	M ’ rari fathered the clans of Machli and Mushi ; these were the M ’ rari clans .
CJB	Numbers	3	34	Of them , 6,200 males a month old and over were counted .
CJB	Numbers	3	35	The chief of the M ’ rari clan was Tzuri ’ el the son of Avichayil . They were to camp next to the tabernacle , toward the north .
CJB	Numbers	3	36	The M ’ rari clans were assigned responsibility for the frames of the tabernacle , along with its crossbars , posts , sockets and fittings , together with their maintenance ;
CJB	Numbers	3	37	also the posts of the surrounding courtyard , with their sockets , pegs and ropes .
CJB	Numbers	3	38	Those who were to camp in front of the tabernacle on the east , in front of the tent of meeting toward the sunrise , were Moshe , Aharon and his sons who were in charge of the Holy Place . They carried out their responsibility on behalf of the people of Isra ’ el , and anyone else who involved himself was to be put to death .
CJB	Numbers	3	39	The total number of L ’ vi ’ im whom Moshe and Aharon counted by their clans , all the males a month old and over , was 22,000 . ( vi )
CJB	Numbers	3	40	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Register all the firstborn males of the people of Isra ’ el a month old and over , and determine how many there are .
CJB	Numbers	3	41	Then you are to take the L ’ vi ’ im for me , Adonai , in place of all the firstborn among the people of Isra ’ el , and the cattle of the L ’ vi ’ im in place of the firstborn of the cattle belonging to the people of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Numbers	3	42	Moshe counted , as Adonai had ordered him , all the firstborn among the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	3	43	The total number of firstborn males registered , a month old and over , of those who were counted , was 22,273 .
CJB	Numbers	3	44	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	3	45	“ Take the L ’ vi ’ im in place of all the firstborn among the people of Isra ’ el , and the cattle of the L ’ vi ’ im in place of their cattle ; the L ’ vi ’ im are to belong to me , Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	3	46	Since there were
CJB	Numbers	3	273	more firstborn males from Isra ’ el than male L ’ vi ’ im , in order to redeem them ,
CJB	Numbers	3	47	you are to take five shekels [ two ounces ] for each of these ( use the sanctuary shekel , which is equal to twenty gerahs ) .
CJB	Numbers	3	48	Give the redemption money for these extra people to Aharon and his sons. ”
CJB	Numbers	3	49	Moshe took the redemption money from those who were over and above those redeemed by the L ’ vi ’ im ;
CJB	Numbers	3	50	the amount of money he took from the firstborn of the people of Isra ’ el was 1,365 shekels , using the sanctuary shekel .
CJB	Numbers	3	51	Moshe gave the redemption-money to Aharon and his sons , in keeping with what Adonai had said , as Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	4	4	“ Here is how the descendants of K ’ hat are to serve in the tent of meeting and deal with the especially holy things :
CJB	Numbers	4	2	“ Take a census of the descendants of K ’ hat , who are among the descendants of Levi , by clans and families ,
CJB	Numbers	4	3	all those from thirty to fifty years old ; these will enter the corps doing the work in the tent of meeting .
CJB	Numbers	4	5	when the time comes to break camp , Aharon is to go in with his sons , take down the curtain which serves as a screen , and cover the ark of the testimony with it .
CJB	Numbers	4	6	On that they are to place a covering of fine leather , and on top of that spread an all-blue cloth . Then they are to insert the carrying-poles .
CJB	Numbers	4	7	On the table of showbread they are to spread a blue cloth and place on it the dishes , incense pans , offering bowls and pitchers . The perpetual bread is to remain on the table .
CJB	Numbers	4	8	They are to spread on these things a scarlet cloth , cover them with a covering of fine leather and insert the poles .
CJB	Numbers	4	9	They are to take a blue cloth and cover the menorah for the light , its lamps , its tongs , its trays and the jars used to add oil to it .
CJB	Numbers	4	10	They are to wrap it and all its accessories in fine leather and place them on a carrying-frame .
CJB	Numbers	4	11	On the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth , cover it with a covering of fine leather and insert its carrying-poles .
CJB	Numbers	4	12	They are to take all the utensils they use when serving in the sanctuary and put them in a blue cloth , cover them with fine leather and place them on a carrying-frame .
CJB	Numbers	4	13	After removing the greasy ashes from the altar , they are to spread a purple cloth over it
CJB	Numbers	4	14	and place on it all the utensils required for their altar service — the fire pans , meat-hooks , shovels , basins and other utensils for the altar . Then they are to spread over it a fine leather covering and insert its carrying-poles .
CJB	Numbers	4	15	When Aharon and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy utensils , when the camp is about to move forward , then the descendants of K ’ hat are to come and carry them . But they are not to touch the holy things , so that they won ’ t die . These things are the responsibility of the descendants of K ’ hat in the tent of meeting .
CJB	Numbers	4	16	“ El ‘ azar the son of Aharon the cohen is to be responsible for the oil for the light , the fragrant incense , the continuing grain offering and the anointing oil . He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it , including the sanctuary and its furnishings. ” ( Maftir )
CJB	Numbers	4	17	Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon ,
CJB	Numbers	4	18	“ Do not cut off the clan of K ’ hat from among the L ’ vi ’ im ;
CJB	Numbers	4	19	rather , do this for them , so that they will live and not die : when they approach the especially holy things , Aharon and his sons are to go in — and you are to assign each one his task ;

CJB	Numbers	4	1	Corinthians 12:12–31 Parashah
CJB	Numbers	4	35	all those between thirty and fifty years old who were part of the corps serving in the tent of meeting .
CJB	Numbers	4	21	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	4	22	“ Take a census of the descendants of Gershon also , by clans and families ;
CJB	Numbers	4	23	count all those between thirty and fifty years old , all who will enter the corps doing the work of serving in the tent of meeting .
CJB	Numbers	4	24	“ The Gershon families are to be responsible for serving and for transporting loads .
CJB	Numbers	4	25	They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle , the tent of meeting , its covering , the fine leather covering above it , the screen for the entrance to the tent of meeting ,
CJB	Numbers	4	26	the tapestries for the courtyard , and the screen for the entrance to the courtyard by the tabernacle and around the altar , along with the ropes and all the utensils they need for their service ; and they are to do the work connected with these things .
CJB	Numbers	4	27	Aharon and his sons are to supervise all the work of the Gershon clan in transporting loads and serving , and to assign them who is to carry what .
CJB	Numbers	4	28	This is how the Gershon families are to serve in the tent of meeting , and they are to be under the direction of Itamar the son of Aharon the cohen .
CJB	Numbers	4	29	“ As for the descendants of M ’ rari , take a census by clans and families
CJB	Numbers	4	30	of all those between thirty and fifty years old , all who will be in the corps doing the work of serving in the tent of meeting .
CJB	Numbers	4	31	“ Their service for the tent of meeting will be to carry the frames , crossbars , posts and sockets of the tabernacle ;
CJB	Numbers	4	32	also the posts for the surrounding courtyard , with their sockets , tent pegs , ropes and other accessories , and everything having to do with their service . You are to assign particular loads to specific persons by name .
CJB	Numbers	4	33	This is how the M ’ rari families are to serve in the tent of meeting , directed by Itamar the son of Aharon the cohen. ” ( S : ii )
CJB	Numbers	4	34	Moshe , Aharon and the community leaders took a census of the descendants of K ’ hat by their clans and families ,
CJB	Numbers	4	36	Registered by their families , they numbered 2,750 .
CJB	Numbers	4	37	These are the ones counted from the K ’ hat families of all those serving in the tent of meeting , whom Moshe and Aharon enumerated , in keeping with the order given by Adonai through Moshe . ( A : ii )

CJB	Numbers	4	47	all those between thirty and fifty years old who were part of those working to serve and working to carry loads in the tent of meeting ,
CJB	Numbers	4	48	yielded a total of 8,580 persons .
CJB	Numbers	4	49	According to Adonai ’ s order they were appointed by Moshe , each one to his specific service or work . They were also enumerated , as Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	5	5	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	5	2	“ Order the people of Isra ’ el to expel from the camp everyone with tzara ‘ at , everyone with a discharge and whoever is unclean because of touching a corpse .
CJB	Numbers	5	3	Both male and female you must expel ; put them outside the camp ; so that they won ’ t defile their camp , where I live among you. ”
CJB	Numbers	5	4	The people of Isra ’ el did this and put them outside the camp — the people of Isra ’ el did what Adonai had said to Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	5	6	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ When a man or woman commits any kind of sin against another person and thus breaks faith with Adonai , he incurs guilt .
CJB	Numbers	5	7	He must confess the sin which he has committed ; and he must make full restitution for his guilt , add twenty percent and give it to the victim of his sin .
CJB	Numbers	5	8	But if the person has no relative to whom restitution can be made for the guilt , then what is given in restitution for guilt will belong to Adonai , that is , to the cohen — in addition to the ram of atonement through which atonement is made for him .
CJB	Numbers	5	9	“ ‘ Every contribution which the people of Isra ’ el consecrate and present to the cohen will belong to him .
CJB	Numbers	5	10	Anything an individual consecrates will be his own [ to allocate among the cohanim ] , but what a person gives to the cohen will belong to him. ’ ” ( A : iv )
CJB	Numbers	5	11	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	5	12	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ If a man ’ s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him ;
CJB	Numbers	5	13	that is , if another man goes to bed with her without her husband ’ s knowledge , so that she becomes impure secretly , and there is no witness against her , and she was not caught in the act ;
CJB	Numbers	5	14	then , if a spirit of jealousy comes over him , and he is jealous of his wife , and she has become impure — or , for that matter , if the spirit of jealousy comes over him , and he is jealous of his wife , and she has not become impure —
CJB	Numbers	5	15	he is to bring his wife to the cohen , along with the offering for her , two quarts of barley flour on which he has not poured olive oil or put frankincense , because it is a grain offering for jealousy , a grain offering for remembering , for recalling guilt to mind .
CJB	Numbers	5	16	The cohen will bring her forward and place her before Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	5	17	The cohen will put holy water in a clay pot , and then the cohen will take some of the dust on the floor of the tabernacle and put it in the water .
CJB	Numbers	5	18	The cohen will place the woman before Adonai , unbind the woman ’ s hair and put the grain offering for remembering in her hands , the grain offering for jealousy ; while the cohen has in his hand the water of embitterment and cursing .
CJB	Numbers	5	19	The cohen will make her swear by saying to her , “ If no man has gone to bed with you , if you have not gone astray to make yourself unclean while under your husband ’ s authority , then be free from this water of embitterment and cursing .
CJB	Numbers	5	20	But if you have in fact gone astray while under your husband ’ s authority and become unclean , because some man other than your husband has gone to bed with you . . . ”
CJB	Numbers	5	21	then the cohen is to make the woman swear with an oath that includes a curse ; the cohen will say to the woman , “ . . .may Adonai make you an object of cursing and condemnation among your people by making your private parts shrivel and your abdomen swell up !
CJB	Numbers	5	22	May this water that causes the curse go into your inner parts and make your abdomen swell and your private parts shrivel up ! ” — and the woman is to respond , “ Amen ! Amen ! ”
CJB	Numbers	5	23	The cohen is to write these curses on a scroll , wash them off into the water of embitterment
CJB	Numbers	5	24	and make the woman drink the water of embitterment and cursing — the water of cursing will enter her and become bitter .
CJB	Numbers	5	25	Then the cohen is to remove the grain offering for jealousy from the woman ’ s hand , wave the grain offering before Adonai and bring it to the altar .
CJB	Numbers	5	26	The cohen is to take a handful of the grain offering as its reminder portion and make it go up in smoke on the altar ; afterwards , he is to make the woman drink the water .
CJB	Numbers	5	27	When he has made her drink the water , then , if she is unclean and has been unfaithful to her husband , the water that causes the curse will enter her and become bitter , so that her abdomen swells and her private parts shrivel up ; and the woman will become an object of cursing among her people .
CJB	Numbers	5	28	But if the woman is not unclean but clean , then she will be innocent and will have children .
CJB	Numbers	5	29	This is the law for jealousy : when either a wife under her husband ’ s authority goes astray and becomes unclean ,
CJB	Numbers	5	30	or the spirit of jealousy comes over a husband and he becomes jealous of his wife , then he is to place the woman before Adonai , and the cohen is to deal with her in accordance with all of this law .
CJB	Numbers	5	31	The husband will be clear of guilt , but the wife will bear the consequences of her guilt . ’ ”
CJB	Numbers	6	6	“ ‘ Throughout the period for which he has consecrated himself to Adonai , he is not to approach a corpse .
CJB	Numbers	6	2	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ When either a man or a woman makes a special kind of vow , the vow of a nazir , consecrating himself to Adonai ;
CJB	Numbers	6	3	he is to abstain from wine and other intoxicating liquor , he is not to drink vinegar from either source , he is not to drink grape juice , and he is not to eat grapes or raisins .
CJB	Numbers	6	4	As long as he remains a nazir he is to eat nothing derived from the grapevine , not even the grape-skins or the seeds .
CJB	Numbers	6	5	“ ‘ Throughout the period of his vow as a nazir , he is not to shave his head . Until the end of the time for which he has consecrated himself to Adonai he is to be holy : he is to let the hair on his head grow long .
CJB	Numbers	6	7	He is not to make himself unclean for his father , mother , brother or sister when they die , since his consecration to God is on his head .
CJB	Numbers	6	8	Throughout the time of his being a nazir he is holy for Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	6	9	“ ‘ If someone next to him dies very suddenly , so that he defiles his consecrated head , then he is to shave his head on the day of his purification ; he is to shave it on the seventh day .
CJB	Numbers	6	10	On the eighth day he is to bring two doves or two young pigeons to the cohen at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
CJB	Numbers	6	11	The cohen is to prepare one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering and thus make atonement for him , inasmuch as he sinned because of the dead person . That same day he is to re-consecrate his head ;
CJB	Numbers	6	12	he is to consecrate to Adonai the full period of his being a nazir by bringing a male lamb in its first year as a guilt offering . The previous days will not be counted , because his consecration became defiled .
CJB	Numbers	6	13	“ ‘ This is the law for the nazir when his period of consecration is over : he is to be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting ,
CJB	Numbers	6	14	where he will present his offering to Adonai — one male lamb in its first year without defect as a burnt offering , one female lamb in its first year without defect as a sin offering , one ram without defect as peace offerings ,
CJB	Numbers	6	15	a basket of matzah , loaves made of fine flour mixed with olive oil , unleavened wafers spread with olive oil , their grain offering and their drink offerings .
CJB	Numbers	6	16	The cohen is to bring them before Adonai , offer his sin offering , his burnt offering ,
CJB	Numbers	6	17	and his ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings to Adonai , with the basket of matzah . The cohen will also offer the grain offering and drink offering that go with the peace offering .
CJB	Numbers	6	18	The nazir will shave his consecrated head at the entrance to the tent of meeting , take the hair removed from his consecrated head and put it on the fire under the sacrifice of peace offerings .
CJB	Numbers	6	19	When the ram has been boiled , the cohen is to take its shoulder , one loaf of matzah from the basket and one unleavened wafer , and place them in the hands of the nazir , after he has shaved his consecrated head .
CJB	Numbers	6	20	The cohen is to wave them as a wave offering before Adonai ; this is set aside for the cohen , along with the breast for waving and the raised-up thigh . Following that , the nazir may drink wine .
CJB	Numbers	6	21	“ ‘ This is the law for the nazir who makes a vow and for his offering to Adonai for his being a nazir — in addition to anything more for which he has sufficient means . In keeping with whatever vow he makes , he must do it according to the law for the nazir. ’ ”
CJB	Numbers	6	22	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	6	23	“ Speak to Aharon and his sons , and tell them that this is how you are to bless the people of Isra ’ el : you are to say to them ,
CJB	Numbers	6	24	‘ Y ’ varekh ’ kha Adonai v ’ yishmerekha . [ May Adonai bless you and keep you . ]
CJB	Numbers	6	25	Ya ’ er Adonai panav eleikha vichunekka . [ May Adonai make his face shine on you and show you his favor . ]
CJB	Numbers	6	26	Yissa Adonai panav eleikha v ’ yasem l ’ kha shalom . [ May Adonai lift up his face toward you and give you peace . ] ’
CJB	Numbers	6	27	“ In this way they are to put my name on the people of Isra ’ el , so that I will bless them . ”
CJB	Numbers	7	7	He gave two wagons and four oxen to the descendants of Gershon , in keeping with the needs of their duties .
CJB	Numbers	7	2	the leaders of Isra ’ el , who were heads of their father ’ s clans , made an offering . These were the tribal leaders in charge of those counted in the census .
CJB	Numbers	7	3	They brought their offering before Adonai , six covered wagons and twelve oxen — a wagon for every two leaders and for each an ox — and presented them in front of the tabernacle .
CJB	Numbers	7	4	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	7	5	“ Receive these from them ; they are to be used for the service in the tent of meeting . Give them to the L ’ vi ’ im , to each as needed for his duties. ”
CJB	Numbers	7	6	So Moshe took the wagons and oxen and gave them to the L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	Numbers	7	8	Four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the descendants of M ’ rari , in keeping with the needs of their duties , directed by Itamar the son of Aharon the cohen .
CJB	Numbers	7	9	But to the descendants of K ’ hat he gave none , because their duties involved the holy articles , which they carried on their own shoulders .
CJB	Numbers	7	10	The leaders brought the offering for dedicating the altar on the day it was anointed . The leaders brought their offering before the altar ,
CJB	Numbers	7	11	and Adonai said to Moshe , “ They are to present their offerings to dedicate the altar , each leader on his own day. ” ( S : v )

CJB	Numbers	8	3	Aharon did this : he lit its lamps so as to give light in front of the menorah , as Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	8	4	Here is how the menorah was made : it was hammered gold from its base to its flowers , hammered work , following the pattern Adonai had shown Moshe . This is how he made the menorah .
CJB	Numbers	8	5	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	8	6	“ Take the L ’ vi ’ im from among the people of Isra ’ el and cleanse them .
CJB	Numbers	8	7	Here is how you are to cleanse them : sprinkle the purification water on them , have them shave their whole body with a razor , and have them wash their clothes and cleanse themselves .
CJB	Numbers	8	9	You are to present the L ’ vi ’ im in front of the tent of meeting , and assemble the entire community of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	8	10	You will present the L ’ vi ’ im before Adonai , the people of Isra ’ el will lay their hands on the L ’ vi ’ im ,
CJB	Numbers	8	11	and Aharon will offer the L ’ vi ’ im before Adonai as a wave offering from the people of Isra ’ el , so that they may do Adonai ’ s service .
CJB	Numbers	8	12	The L ’ vi ’ im will lay their hands on the heads of the bulls ; the one you will offer as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to Adonai to make atonement for the L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	Numbers	8	13	You are to place the L ’ vi ’ im before Aharon and his sons , and offer them as a wave offering to Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	8	14	In this way you will separate the L ’ vi ’ im from the people of Isra ’ el , and the L ’ vi ’ im will belong to me . ( ii )
CJB	Numbers	8	15	“ After that , the L ’ vi ’ im will enter and do the service of the tent of meeting . You will cleanse them and offer them as a wave offering ,
CJB	Numbers	8	16	because they are entirely given to me from among the people of Isra ’ el ; I have taken them for myself in place of all those who come first out of the womb , that is , the firstborn males of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	8	17	For all the firstborn among the people of Isra ’ el are mine , both humans and animals ; on the day I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , I set them apart for myself .
CJB	Numbers	8	18	But I have taken the L ’ vi ’ im in place of all the firstborn among the people of Isra ’ el ,
CJB	Numbers	8	19	and I have given the L ’ vi ’ im to Aharon and his sons from among the people of Isra ’ el to do the service of the people of Isra ’ el in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the people of Isra ’ el , so that no plague will fall on the people of Isra ’ el in consequence of their coming too close to the sanctuary. ”
CJB	Numbers	8	20	This is what Moshe , Aharon and all the community of the people of Isra ’ el did to the L ’ vi ’ im . The people of Isra ’ el acted in accordance with everything that Adonai had ordered Moshe in regard to the L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	Numbers	8	21	The L ’ vi ’ im purified themselves and washed their clothes . Then Aharon offered them as a holy gift before Adonai and made atonement for them in order to cleanse them .
CJB	Numbers	8	22	After that , the L ’ vi ’ im came to do their service in the tent of meeting in front of Aharon and his sons ; they acted in accordance with Adonai ’ s orders to Moshe in regard to the L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	Numbers	8	23	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	8	24	“ Here are instructions concerning the L ’ vi ’ im : when they reach the age of twenty-five , they are to begin performing their duties serving in the tent of meeting ;
CJB	Numbers	8	25	and when they reach the age of fifty , they are to stop performing this work and not serve any longer .
CJB	Numbers	8	26	They will assist their brothers who are performing their duties in the tent of meeting , but they themselves will not do any of the work . This is what you are to do with the L ’ vi ’ im in regard to their duties . ”
CJB	Numbers	9	9	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	9	2	“ Let the people of Isra ’ el observe Pesach at its designated time .
CJB	Numbers	9	3	On the fourteenth day of this month , at dusk , you are to observe it — at its designated time . You are to observe it according to all its regulations and rules. ”
CJB	Numbers	9	4	Moshe told the people of Isra ’ el to observe Pesach .
CJB	Numbers	9	5	So they observed Pesach at dusk on the fourteenth day of the month in the Sinai Desert ; the people of Isra ’ el acted in accordance with all that Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	9	6	But there were certain people who had become unclean because of someone ’ s corpse , so that they could not observe Pesach on that day . So they came before Moshe and Aharon that day
CJB	Numbers	9	7	and said to him , “ We are unclean because of someone ’ s corpse ; but why must we be kept from bringing the offering for Adonai at the time designated for the people of Isra ’ el ? ”
CJB	Numbers	9	8	Moshe answered them , “ Wait , so that I can hear what Adonai will order concerning you. ”
CJB	Numbers	9	10	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ If any of you now or in future generations is unclean because of a corpse , or if he is on a trip abroad , nevertheless he is to observe Pesach .
CJB	Numbers	9	11	But he will observe it in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk . They are to eat it with matzah and maror ,
CJB	Numbers	9	12	they are to leave none of it until morning , and they are not to break any of its bones — they are to observe it according to all the regulations of Pesach .
CJB	Numbers	9	13	But the person who is clean and not on a trip who fails to observe Pesach will be cut off from his people ; because he did not bring the offering for Adonai at its designated time , that person will bear the consequences of his sin .
CJB	Numbers	9	14	If a foreigner is staying with you and wants to observe Pesach for Adonai , he is to do it according to the regulations and rules of Pesach — you are to have the same law for the foreigner as for the citizen of the land. ’ ” ( iv )
CJB	Numbers	9	15	On the day the tabernacle was put up , the cloud covered the tabernacle , that is , the tent of the testimony ; and in the evening , over the tabernacle was what appeared to be fire , which remained until morning .
CJB	Numbers	9	16	So the cloud always covered it , and it looked like fire at night .
CJB	Numbers	9	17	Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tent , the people of Isra ’ el continued their travels ; and they camped wherever the cloud stopped .
CJB	Numbers	9	18	At the order of Adonai , the people of Isra ’ el traveled ; at the order of Adonai , they camped ; and as long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle , they stayed in camp .
CJB	Numbers	9	19	Even when the cloud remained on the tabernacle for a long time , the people of Isra ’ el did what Adonai had charged them to do and did not travel .
CJB	Numbers	9	20	Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle ; according to Adonai ’ s order , they remained in camp ; and according to Adonai ’ s order , they traveled .
CJB	Numbers	9	21	Sometimes the cloud was there only from evening until morning ; so that when the cloud was taken up in the morning , they traveled . Or even if it continued up both day and night , when the cloud was up , they traveled .
CJB	Numbers	9	22	Whether it was two days , a month or a year that the cloud remained over the tabernacle , staying on it , the people of Isra ’ el remained in camp and did not travel ; but as soon as it was taken up , they traveled .
CJB	Numbers	9	23	At Adonai ’ s order , they camped ; and at Adonai ’ s order , they traveled — they did what Adonai had charged them to do through Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	10	10	“ Also on your days of rejoicing , at your designated times and on Rosh-Hodesh , you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings ; these will be your reminder before your God . I am Adonai your God. ” ( v )
CJB	Numbers	10	2	“ Make two trumpets ; make them of hammered silver . Use them for summoning the community and for sounding the call to break camp and move on .
CJB	Numbers	10	3	When they are sounded , the entire community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
CJB	Numbers	10	4	If only one is sounded , then just the leaders , the heads of the clans of Isra ’ el , are to assemble before you .
CJB	Numbers	10	5	“ When you sound an alarm , the camps to the east will commence traveling .
CJB	Numbers	10	6	When you sound a second alarm , the camps to the south will set out ; they will sound alarms to announce when to travel .
CJB	Numbers	10	7	However , when the community is to be assembled , you are to sound ; but don ’ t sound an alarm .
CJB	Numbers	10	8	It will be the sons of Aharon , the cohanim , who are to sound the trumpets ; this will be a permanent regulation for you through all your generations .
CJB	Numbers	10	9	“ When you go to war in your land against an adversary who is oppressing you , you are to sound an alarm with the trumpets ; then you will be remembered before Adonai your God , and you will be saved from your enemies .
CJB	Numbers	10	11	On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year , the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony ;
CJB	Numbers	10	12	and the people of Isra ’ el moved out in stages from the Sinai Desert . The cloud stopped in the Pa ’ ran Desert .
CJB	Numbers	10	13	So they set out on their first journey , in keeping with Adonai ’ s order through Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	10	14	In the lead was the banner of the camp of the descendants of Y ’ hudah , whose companies moved forward ; over his company was Nachshon the son of ‘ Amminadav .
CJB	Numbers	10	15	Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of Yissakhar was N ’ tan ’ el the son of Tzu ‘ ar .
CJB	Numbers	10	16	Over the company of the descendants of Z ’ vulun was Eli ’ av the son of Helon .
CJB	Numbers	10	17	Then the tabernacle was taken down ; and the descendants of Gershon and the descendants of M ’ rari set out , carrying the tabernacle .
CJB	Numbers	10	18	Next , the banner of the camp of Re ’ uven moved forward by companies ; over his company was Elitzur the son of Sh ’ de ’ ur .
CJB	Numbers	10	19	Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of Shim ‘ on was Shlumi ’ el the son of Tzurishaddai .
CJB	Numbers	10	20	Over the company of the descendants of Gad was Elyasaf the son of De ‘ u ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	10	21	Then the descendants of K ’ hat set out , carrying the sanctuary , so that [ at the next camp ] the tabernacle could be set up before they arrived .
CJB	Numbers	10	22	The banner of the camp of the descendants of Efrayim moved forward by companies ; over his company was Elishama the son of ‘ Ammihud .
CJB	Numbers	10	23	Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of M ’ nasheh was Gamli ’ el the son of P ’ dahtzur .
CJB	Numbers	10	24	Over the company of the descendants of Binyamin was Avidan the son of Gid ‘ oni .
CJB	Numbers	10	25	The banner of the camp of the descendants of Dan , forming the rearguard for all the camps , moved forward by companies ; over his company was Achi ‘ ezer the son of ‘ Ammishaddai .
CJB	Numbers	10	26	Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of Asher was Pag ‘ i ’ el the son of ‘ Okhran .
CJB	Numbers	10	27	Over the company of the descendants of Naftali was Achira the son of ‘ Enan .
CJB	Numbers	10	28	This is how the people of Isra ’ el traveled by companies ; thus they moved forward . ( S : vi )
CJB	Numbers	10	29	Moshe said to Hovav the son of Re ‘ u ’ el the Midyani , Moshe ’ s father-in-law , “ We are traveling to the place about which Adonai said , ‘ I will give it to you. ’ Come with us , and we will treat you well , because Adonai has promised good things to Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Numbers	10	30	But he replied , “ I will not go ; I would rather go back to my own country and my own kinsmen. ”
CJB	Numbers	10	31	Moshe continued , “ Please don ’ t leave us , because you know that we have to camp in the desert , and you can serve as our eyes .
CJB	Numbers	10	32	If you do go with us , then whatever good Adonai does for us , we will do the same for you. ”
CJB	Numbers	10	33	So they set out from Adonai ’ s mountain and traveled for three days . Ahead of them on this three-day journey went the ark of Adonai ’ s covenant , searching for a new place to stop .
CJB	Numbers	10	34	The cloud of Adonai was over them during the day as they set out from the camp . ( A : vi )
CJB	Numbers	10	35	When the ark moved forward , Moshe said , “ Arise , Adonai ! May your enemies be scattered ! Let those who hate you flee before you ! ”
CJB	Numbers	10	36	When it stopped , he said , “ Return , Adonai of the many , many thousands of Isra ’ el ! ”
CJB	Numbers	11	11	Moshe asked Adonai , “ Why are you treating your servant so badly ? Why haven ’ t I found favor in your sight , so that you put the burden of this entire people on me ?
CJB	Numbers	11	2	Then the people cried to Moshe , Moshe prayed to Adonai , and the fire abated .
CJB	Numbers	11	3	That place was called Tav ‘ erah [ burning ] because Adonai ’ s fire broke out against them .
CJB	Numbers	11	4	Next , the mixed crowd that was with them grew greedy for an easier life ; while the people of Isra ’ el , for their part , also renewed their weeping and said , “ If only we had meat to eat !
CJB	Numbers	11	5	We remember the fish we used to eat in Egypt — it cost us nothing ! — and the cucumbers , the melons , the leeks , the onions , the garlic !
CJB	Numbers	11	6	But now we ’ re withering away , we have nothing to look at but this man. ”
CJB	Numbers	11	7	The man , by the way , was like coriander seed and white like gum resin .
CJB	Numbers	11	8	The people would go around gathering it and would grind it up in mills or pound it to paste with mortar and pestle . Then they would cook it in pots and make it into loaves that tasted like cakes baked with olive oil .
CJB	Numbers	11	9	When the dew settled on the camp during the night , the man came with it .
CJB	Numbers	11	10	Moshe heard the people crying , family after family , each person at the entrance to his tent ; the anger of Adonai flared up violently ; and Moshe too was displeased .
CJB	Numbers	11	12	Did I conceive this people ? Was I their father , so that you tell me , ‘ Carry them in your arms , like a nurse carrying a baby , to the land you swore to their ancestors ? ’
CJB	Numbers	11	13	Where am I going to get meat to give to this entire people ? — because they keep bothering me with their crying and saying , ‘ Give us meat to eat ! ’
CJB	Numbers	11	14	I can ’ t carry this entire people by myself alone — it ’ s too much for me !
CJB	Numbers	11	15	If you are going to treat me this way , then just kill me outright ! — please , if you have any mercy toward me ! — and don ’ t let me go on being this miserable ! ”
CJB	Numbers	11	16	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Bring me seventy of the leaders of Isra ’ el , people you recognize as leaders of the people and officers of theirs . Bring them to the tent of meeting , and have them stand there with you .
CJB	Numbers	11	17	I will come down and speak with you there , and I will take some of the Spirit which rests on you and put it on them . Then they will carry the burden of the people along with you , so that you won ’ t carry it yourself alone .
CJB	Numbers	11	18	“ Tell the people , ‘ Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow , and you will eat meat ; because you cried in the ears of Adonai , “ If only we had meat to eat ! We had the good life in Egypt ! ” All right , Adonai is going to give you meat , and you will eat it .
CJB	Numbers	11	19	You won ’ t eat it just one day , or two days , or five , or ten , or twenty days ,
CJB	Numbers	11	20	but a whole month ! — until it comes out of your nose and you hate it ! — because you have rejected Adonai , who is here with you , and distressed him with your crying and asking , “ Why did we ever leave Egypt ? ” ’ ”
CJB	Numbers	11	21	But Moshe said , “ Here I am with six hundred thousand men on foot , and yet you say , ‘ I will give them meat to eat for a whole month ! ’
CJB	Numbers	11	22	If whole flocks and herds were slaughtered for them , would it be enough ? If all the fish in the sea were collected for them , would even that be enough ? ”
CJB	Numbers	11	23	Adonai answered Moshe , “ Has Adonai ’ s arm grown short ? Now you will see whether what I said will happen or not ! ”
CJB	Numbers	11	24	Moshe went out and told the people what Adonai had said . Then he collected seventy of the leaders of the people and placed them all around the tent .
CJB	Numbers	11	25	Adonai came down in the cloud , spoke to him , took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy leaders . When the Spirit came to rest on them , they prophesied — then but not afterwards .
CJB	Numbers	11	26	There were two men who stayed in the camp , one named Eldad and the other Medad , and the Spirit came to rest on them . They were among those listed to go out to the tent , but they hadn ’ t done so , and they prophesied in the camp .
CJB	Numbers	11	27	A young man ran and told Moshe , “ Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp ! ”
CJB	Numbers	11	28	Y ’ hoshua , the son of Nun , who from his youth up had been Moshe ’ s assistant , answered , “ My lord , Moshe , stop them ! ”
CJB	Numbers	11	29	But Moshe replied , “ Are you so zealous to protect me ? I wish all of Adonai ’ s people were prophets ! I wish Adonai would put his Spirit on all of them ! ” ( vii )
CJB	Numbers	11	30	Moshe and the leaders of Isra ’ el went back into the camp ;
CJB	Numbers	11	31	and Adonai sent out a wind which brought quails from across the sea and let them fall near the camp , about a day ’ s trip away on each side of the camp and all around it , covering the ground to a depth of three feet .
CJB	Numbers	11	32	The people stayed up all that day , all night and all the next day gathering the quails — the person gathering the least collected ten heaps ; then they spread them out for themselves all around the camp .
CJB	Numbers	11	33	But while the meat was still in their mouth , before they had chewed it up , the anger of Adonai flared up against the people , and Adonai struck the people with a terrible plague .
CJB	Numbers	11	34	Therefore that place was named Kivrot-HaTa ’ avah [ graves of greed ] , because there they buried the people who were so greedy .
CJB	Numbers	11	35	From Kivrot-HaTa ’ avah the people traveled to Hatzerot , and they stayed at Hatzerot .
CJB	Numbers	12	12	Please don ’ t let her be like a stillborn baby , with its body half eaten away when it comes out of its mother ’ s womb ! ”
CJB	Numbers	12	2	They said , “ Is it true that Adonai has spoken only with Moshe ? Hasn ’ t he spoken with us too ? ” Adonai heard them .
CJB	Numbers	12	3	Now this man Moshe was very humble , more so than anyone on earth .
CJB	Numbers	12	4	Suddenly Adonai told Moshe , Aharon and Miryam , “ Come out , you three , to the tent of meeting. ” The three of them went out .
CJB	Numbers	12	5	Adonai came down in a column of cloud and stood at the entrance to the tent . He summoned Aharon and Miryam , and they both went forward .
CJB	Numbers	12	6	He said , “ Listen to what I say : when there is a prophet among you , I , Adonai , make myself known to him in a vision , I speak with him in a dream .
CJB	Numbers	12	7	But it isn ’ t that way with my servant Moshe . He is the only one who is faithful in my entire household .
CJB	Numbers	12	8	With him I speak face to face and clearly , not in riddles ; he sees the image of Adonai . So why weren ’ t you afraid to criticize my servant Moshe ? ”
CJB	Numbers	12	9	The anger of Adonai flared up against them , and he left .
CJB	Numbers	12	10	But when the cloud was removed from above the tent , Miryam had tzara ‘ at , as white as snow . Aharon looked at Miryam , and she was as white as snow .
CJB	Numbers	12	11	Aharon said to Moshe , “ Oh , my lord , please don ’ t punish us for this sin we committed so foolishly .
CJB	Numbers	12	13	Moshe cried to Adonai , “ Oh God , I beg you , please , heal her ! ” ( Maftir )
CJB	Numbers	12	14	Adonai answered Moshe , “ If her father had merely spit in her face , wouldn ’ t she hide herself in shame for seven days ? So let her be shut out of the camp for seven days ; after that , she can be brought back in. ”
CJB	Numbers	12	15	Miryam was shut out of the camp seven days , and the people did not travel until she was brought back in .
CJB	Numbers	12	16	Afterwards , the people went on from Hatzerot and camped in the Pa ’ ran Desert . Haftarah B ’ ha ‘ alotkha : Z ’ kharyah ( Zechariah ) 2:14 – 4:7 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah B ’ ha ‘ alotkha : Yochanan ( John ) 19:31–37 ; Messianic Jews ( Hebrews ) 3:1–6
CJB	Numbers	13	13	from the tribe of Asher , S ’ tur the son of Mikha ’ el ;
CJB	Numbers	13	37	: Shlach L ’ kha ( Send on your behalf ) 13:1–15:41
CJB	Numbers	13	2	“ Send men on your behalf to reconnoiter the land of Kena ‘ an , which I am giving to the people of Isra ’ el . From each ancestral tribe send someone who is a leader in his tribe. ”
CJB	Numbers	13	3	Moshe dispatched them from the Pa ’ ran Desert as Adonai had ordered ; all of them were leading men among the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	13	4	Here are their names : from the tribe of Re ’ uven , Shamua the son of Zakur ;
CJB	Numbers	13	5	from the tribe of Shim ‘ on , Shafat the son of Hori ;
CJB	Numbers	13	6	from the tribe of Y ’ hudah , Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh ;
CJB	Numbers	13	7	from the tribe of Yissakhar , Yig ’ al the son of Yosef ;
CJB	Numbers	13	8	from the tribe of Efrayim , Hoshea the son of Nun ;
CJB	Numbers	13	9	from the tribe of Binyamin , Palti the son of Rafu ;
CJB	Numbers	13	10	from the tribe of Z ’ vulun , Gadi ’ el the son of Sodi ;
CJB	Numbers	13	11	from the tribe of Yosef , that is , from the tribe of M ’ nasheh , Gadi the son of Susi ;
CJB	Numbers	13	12	from the tribe of Dan , ‘ Ammi ’ el the son of G ’ malli ;
CJB	Numbers	13	14	from the tribe of Naftali , Nachbi the son of Vofsi ; and
CJB	Numbers	13	15	from the tribe of Gad , Ge ’ u ’ el the son of Makhi .
CJB	Numbers	13	16	These are the names of the men Moshe sent out to reconnoiter the land . Moshe gave to Hoshea the son of Nun the name Y ’ hoshua .
CJB	Numbers	13	17	Moshe sent them to reconnoiter the land of Kena ‘ an , instructing them , “ Go on up to the Negev and into the hills ,
CJB	Numbers	13	18	and see what the land is like . Notice the people living there , whether they are strong or weak , few or many ;
CJB	Numbers	13	19	and what kind of country they live in , whether it is good or bad ; and what kind of cities they live in , open or fortified .
CJB	Numbers	13	20	See whether the land is fertile or unproductive and whether there is wood in it or not . Finally , be bold enough to bring back some of the fruit of the land. ” When they left it was the season for the first grapes to ripen . ( ii )
CJB	Numbers	13	21	They went up and reconnoitered the land from the Tzin Desert to Rechov near the entrance to Hamat .
CJB	Numbers	13	22	They went up into the Negev and arrived at Hevron ; Achiman , Sheshai and Talmai , the ‘ Anakim , lived there . ( Hevron was built seven years before Tzo ‘ an in Egypt . )
CJB	Numbers	13	23	They came to the Eshkol Valley ; and there they cut off a branch bearing one cluster of grapes , which they carried on a pole between two of them ; they also took pomegranates and figs .
CJB	Numbers	13	24	That place was called the Valley of Eshkol [ cluster ] , because of the cluster which the people of Isra ’ el cut down there .
CJB	Numbers	13	25	Forty days later , they returned from reconnoitering the land
CJB	Numbers	13	26	and went to Moshe , Aharon and the entire community of the people of Isra ’ el at Kadesh in the Pa ’ ran Desert , where they brought back word to them and to the entire community and showed them the fruit of the land .
CJB	Numbers	13	27	What they told him was this : “ We entered the land where you sent us , and indeed it does flow with milk and honey — here is its fruit !
CJB	Numbers	13	28	However the people living in the land are fierce , and the cities are fortified and very large . Moreover , we saw the ‘ Anakim there .
CJB	Numbers	13	29	‘ Amalek lives in the area of the Negev ; the Hitti , the Y ’ vusi and the Emori live in the hills ; and the Kena ‘ ani live by the sea and alongside the Yarden. ”
CJB	Numbers	13	30	Kalev silenced the people around Moshe and said , “ We ought to go up immediately and take possession of it ; there is no question that we can conquer it. ”
CJB	Numbers	13	31	But the men who had gone with him said , “ We can ’ t attack those people , because they are stronger than we are ” ;
CJB	Numbers	13	32	and they spread a negative report about the land they had reconnoitered for the people of Isra ’ el by saying , “ The land we passed through in order to spy it out is a land that devours its inhabitants . All the people we saw there were giant !
CJB	Numbers	13	33	We saw the N ’ filim , the descendants of ‘ Anak , who was from the N ’ filim ; to ourselves we looked like grasshoppers by comparison , and we looked that way to them too ! ”
CJB	Numbers	14	14	they will tell the people living in this land . They have heard that you , Adonai , are with this people ; that you , Adonai , are seen face to face ; that your cloud stands over them ; that you go ahead of them in a column of cloud by day and a column of fire by night .
CJB	Numbers	14	2	Moreover , all the people of Isra ’ el began grumbling against Moshe and Aharon ; the whole community told them , “ We wish we had died in the land of Egypt ! or that we had died here in the desert !
CJB	Numbers	14	3	Why is Adonai bringing us to this land , where we will die by the sword ? Our wives and our little ones will be taken as booty ! Wouldn ’ t it be better for us to return to Egypt ? ”
CJB	Numbers	14	4	And they said to each other , “ Let ’ s appoint a leader and return to Egypt ! ”
CJB	Numbers	14	5	Moshe and Aharon fell on their faces before the entire assembled community of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	14	6	Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun and Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh , from the detachment that had reconnoitered the land , tore their clothes
CJB	Numbers	14	7	and said to the whole community of Isra ’ el , “ The land we passed through in order to spy it out is an outstandingly good land ! ( iii )
CJB	Numbers	14	8	If Adonai is pleased with us , then he will bring us into this land and give it to us — a land flowing with milk and honey .
CJB	Numbers	14	9	Just don ’ t rebel against Adonai . And don ’ t be afraid of the people living in the land — we ’ ll eat them up ! Their defense has been taken away from them , and Adonai is with us ! Don ’ t be afraid of them ! ”
CJB	Numbers	14	10	But just as the whole community were saying they should be stoned to death , the glory of Adonai appeared in the tent of meeting to all the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	14	11	Adonai said to Moshe , “ How much longer is this people going to treat me with contempt ? How much longer will they not trust me , especially considering all the signs I have performed among them ?
CJB	Numbers	14	12	I am going to strike them with sickness , destroy them and make from you a nation greater and stronger than they are ! ”
CJB	Numbers	14	13	However , Moshe replied to Adonai , “ When the Egyptians hear about this — [ and they will , ] because it was from among them that you , by your strength , brought this people up —
CJB	Numbers	14	15	If you kill off this people at a single stroke , then the nations that have heard of your reputation will say
CJB	Numbers	14	16	that the reason Adonai slaughtered this people in the desert is that he wasn ’ t able to bring them into the land which he swore to give them .
CJB	Numbers	14	17	So now , please , let Adonai ’ s power be as great as when you said ,
CJB	Numbers	14	18	‘ Adonai is slow to anger , rich in grace , forgiving offenses and crimes ; yet not exonerating the guilty , but causing the negative effects of the parents ’ offenses to be experienced by their children and even by the third and fourth generations. ’
CJB	Numbers	14	19	Please ! Forgive the offense of this people according to the greatness of your grace , just as you have borne with this people from Egypt until now. ”
CJB	Numbers	14	20	Adonai answered , “ I have forgiven , as you have asked .
CJB	Numbers	14	21	But as sure as I live , and that the whole earth is filled with the glory of Adonai ,
CJB	Numbers	14	22	none of the people who saw my glory and the signs I did in Egypt and in the desert , yet tested me these ten times and did not listen to my voice ,
CJB	Numbers	14	23	will see the land I swore to their ancestors ! None of those who treated me with contempt will see it .
CJB	Numbers	14	24	But my servant Kalev , because he had a different Spirit with him and has fully followed me — him I will bring into the land he entered , and it will belong to his descendants .
CJB	Numbers	14	25	“ Now , since the ‘ Amaleki and the Kena ‘ ani are living in the valley , tomorrow turn around and get yourselves into the desert along the way to the Sea of Suf. ” ( iv )
CJB	Numbers	14	26	Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon ,
CJB	Numbers	14	27	“ How long am I to put up with this evil community who keep grumbling about me ? I have heard the complaints of the people of Isra ’ el , which they continue to raise against me .
CJB	Numbers	14	28	Tell them this : ‘ As surely as I live , Adonai swears , as surely as you have spoken in my ears , I will do this to you :
CJB	Numbers	14	29	your carcasses will fall in this desert ! Every single one of you who were included in the census over the age of twenty , you who have complained against me ,
CJB	Numbers	14	30	will certainly not enter the land about which I raised my hand to swear that I would have you live in it — except for Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh and Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun .
CJB	Numbers	14	31	But your little ones , who you said would be taken as booty — them I will bring in . They will know the land you have rejected .
CJB	Numbers	14	32	But you , your carcasses will fall in this desert ;
CJB	Numbers	14	33	and your children will wander about in the desert for forty years bearing the consequences of your prostitutions until the desert eats up your carcasses .
CJB	Numbers	14	34	It will be a year for every day you spent reconnoitering the land that you will bear the consequences of your offenses — forty days , forty years . Then you will know what it means to oppose me !
CJB	Numbers	14	35	I , Adonai , have spoken. ’ I will certainly do this to this whole evil community who have assembled together against me — they will be destroyed in this desert and die there. ”
CJB	Numbers	14	36	The men whom Moshe had sent to reconnoiter the land and who , when they returned , made the entire community complain against him by giving an unfavorable report about the land —
CJB	Numbers	14	37	those men who gave the unfavorable report about the land died by the plague in the presence of Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	14	38	Of the men who went to reconnoiter the land , only Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun and Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh remained alive .
CJB	Numbers	14	39	When Moshe told these things to all the people of Isra ’ el , the people felt great remorse .
CJB	Numbers	14	40	They arose early the next morning , came up to the top of the mountain and said , “ Here we are , and we did sin , but now we ’ ll go up to the place Adonai promised. ”
CJB	Numbers	14	41	Moshe answered , “ Why are you opposing what Adonai said ? You won ’ t succeed !
CJB	Numbers	14	42	Don ’ t go up there , because Adonai isn ’ t with you . If you do , your enemies will defeat you .
CJB	Numbers	14	43	The ‘ Amalekim and the Kena ‘ anim are there ahead of you , and you will be struck down by the sword . The reason will be that you have turned away from following Adonai , so that Adonai won ’ t be with you. ”
CJB	Numbers	14	44	But they were presumptuous and went on up toward the high parts of the hill-country , even though the ark for the covenant of Adonai — and Moshe — stayed in the camp .
CJB	Numbers	14	45	So the ‘ Amalekim and the Kena ‘ anim living in that hill-country descended , struck them down and beat them back all the way to Hormah .
CJB	Numbers	15	15	For this community there will be the same law for you as for the foreigner living with you ; this is a permanent regulation through all your generations ; the foreigner is to be treated the same way before Adonai as yourselves .
CJB	Numbers	15	2	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ When you have come into the land where you are going to live , which I am giving to you ,
CJB	Numbers	15	3	and want to make an offering by fire to Adonai — a burnt offering or sacrifice to fulfill a special vow , or to be a voluntary offering , or at your designated times , to make a fragrant aroma for Adonai — then , whether it is comes from the herd or from the flock ,
CJB	Numbers	15	4	the person bringing the offering is to present Adonai with a grain offering consisting of two quarts of fine flour mixed with one quart of olive oil ,
CJB	Numbers	15	5	and one quart of wine for the drink offering . This is what you are to prepare with the burnt offering or for each lamb sacrificed .
CJB	Numbers	15	6	“ ‘ For a ram , prepare one gallon of fine flour mixed with one-and-one-third quarts of olive oil ;
CJB	Numbers	15	7	while for the drink offering , you are to present one-and-one-third quarts of wine as a fragrant aroma for Adonai . ( v )
CJB	Numbers	15	8	“ ‘ When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering , as a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow or as peace offerings for Adonai ,
CJB	Numbers	15	9	there is to be presented with the bull a grain offering of one-and-a-half gallons of fine flour mixed with two quarts of olive oil .
CJB	Numbers	15	10	For the drink offering , present two quarts of wine for an offering made by fire , a fragant aroma for Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	15	11	“ ‘ Do it this way for each bull , ram , male lamb or kid .
CJB	Numbers	15	12	For as many animals as you prepare , do this for each one , regardless of how many animals there are .
CJB	Numbers	15	13	“ ‘ Every citizen is to do these things in this way when presenting an offering made by fire as a fragrant aroma for Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	15	14	If a foreigner stays with you — or whoever may be with you , through all your generations — and he wants to bring an offering made by fire as a fragrant aroma for Adonai , he is to do the same as you .
CJB	Numbers	15	16	The same Torah and standard of judgment will apply to both you and the foreigner living with you. ’ ” ( vi )
CJB	Numbers	15	17	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	15	18	“ Speak to the people of Isra ’ el ; tell them , ‘ When you enter the land where I am bringing you
CJB	Numbers	15	19	and eat bread produced in the land , you are to set aside a portion as a gift for Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	15	20	Set aside from your first dough a cake as a gift ; set it aside as you would set aside a portion of the grain from the threshing-floor .
CJB	Numbers	15	21	From your first dough you will give Adonai a portion as a gift through all your generations .
CJB	Numbers	15	22	“ ‘ If by mistake you fail to observe all these mitzvot that Adonai has spoken to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	15	23	yes , everything that Adonai has ordered you to do through Moshe , from the day Adonai gave the order and onward through all your generations ,
CJB	Numbers	15	24	then , if it was done by mistake by the community and was not known to them , the whole community is to offer one young bull for a burnt offering as a fragrant aroma to Adonai , with its grain and drink offerings , in keeping with the rule , and one male goat as a sin offering .
CJB	Numbers	15	25	The cohen is to make atonement for the whole community of the people of Isra ’ el ; and they will be forgiven ; because it was a mistake ; and they have brought their offering , an offering made by fire , to Adonai , and their sin offering before Adonai for their mistake .
CJB	Numbers	15	26	The whole community of the people of Isra ’ el will be forgiven , likewise the foreigner staying with them ; because for all the people it was a mistake . ( vii )
CJB	Numbers	15	27	“ ‘ If an individual sins by mistake , he is to offer a female goat in its first year as a sin offering .
CJB	Numbers	15	28	The cohen will make atonement before Adonai for the person who makes a mistake by sinning inadvertently ; he will make atonement for him , and he will be forgiven —
CJB	Numbers	15	29	no matter whether he is a citizen of Isra ’ el or a foreigner living with them . You are to have one law for whoever it is that does something wrong by mistake .
CJB	Numbers	15	30	“ ‘ But an individual who does something wrong intentionally , whether a citizen or a foreigner , is blaspheming Adonai . That person will be cut off from his people .
CJB	Numbers	15	31	Because he has had contempt for the word of Adonai and has disobeyed his command , that person will be cut off completely ; his offense will remain with him. ’ ”
CJB	Numbers	15	32	While the people of Isra ’ el were in the desert , they found a man gathering wood on Shabbat .
CJB	Numbers	15	33	Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moshe , Aharon and the whole congregation .
CJB	Numbers	15	34	They kept him in custody , because it had not yet been decided what to do to him .
CJB	Numbers	15	35	Then Adonai said to Moshe , “ This man must be put to death ; the entire community is to stone him to death outside the camp. ”
CJB	Numbers	15	36	So the whole community brought him outside the camp and threw stones at him until he died , as Adonai had ordered Moshe . ( Maftir )
CJB	Numbers	15	37	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	15	38	“ Speak to the people of Isra ’ el , instructing them to make , through all their generations , tzitziyot on the corners of their garments , and to put with the tzitzit on each corner a blue thread .
CJB	Numbers	15	39	It is to be a tzitzit for you to look at and thereby remember all of Adonai ’ s mitzvot and obey them , so that you won ’ t go around wherever your own heart and eyes lead you to prostitute yourselves ;
CJB	Numbers	15	40	but it will help you remember and obey all my mitzvot and be holy for your God .
CJB	Numbers	15	41	I am Adonai your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt in order to be your God . I am Adonai your God. ” Haftarah Shlach L ’ kha : Y ’ hoshua ( Joshua ) 2:1–24 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested reading for Parashah Shlach L ’ kha : Messianic Jews ( Hebrews ) 3:7–19
CJB	Numbers	16	16	Moshe said to Korach , “ You and your group , be there before Adonai tomorrow — you , they and Aharon .
CJB	Numbers	16	38	: Korach ( Korah ) 16:1–18:32
CJB	Numbers	16	2	rebelled against Moshe . Siding with them were
CJB	Numbers	16	250	men who had offered the incense .
CJB	Numbers	16	3	They assembled themselves against Moshe and Aharon and said to them , “ You take too much on yourselves ! After all , the entire community is holy , every one of them , and Adonai is among them . So why do you lift yourselves up above Adonai ’ s assembly ? ”
CJB	Numbers	16	4	When Moshe heard this he fell on his face .
CJB	Numbers	16	5	Then he said to Korach and his whole group , “ In the morning , Adonai will show who are his and who is the holy person he will allow to approach him . Yes , he will bring whomever he chooses near to himself .
CJB	Numbers	16	6	Do this : take censers , Korach and all your group ;
CJB	Numbers	16	7	put fire in them ; and put incense in them before Adonai tomorrow . The one whom Adonai chooses will be the one who is holy ! It is you , you sons of Levi , who are taking too much on yourselves ! ”
CJB	Numbers	16	8	Then Moshe said to Korach , “ Listen here , you sons of Levi !
CJB	Numbers	16	9	Is it for you a mere trifle that the God of Isra ’ el has separated you from the community of Isra ’ el to bring you close to himself , so that you can do the work in the tabernacle of Adonai and stand before the community serving them ?
CJB	Numbers	16	10	He has brought you close and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you . Now you want the office of cohen too !
CJB	Numbers	16	11	That ’ s why you and your group have gathered together against Adonai ! After all , what is Aharon that you complain against him ? ”
CJB	Numbers	16	12	Then Moshe sent to summon Datan and Aviram , the sons of Eli ’ av . But they replied , “ We won ’ t come up !
CJB	Numbers	16	13	Is it such a mere trifle , bringing us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert , that now you arrogate to yourself the role of dictator over us ? ( ii )
CJB	Numbers	16	14	You haven ’ t at all brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey , and you haven ’ t put us in possession of fields and vineyards . Do you think you can gouge out these men ’ s eyes and blind them ? We won ’ t come up ! ”
CJB	Numbers	16	15	Moshe was very angry and said to Adonai , “ Don ’ t accept their grain offering ! I haven ’ t taken one donkey from them , I ’ ve done nothing wrong to any of them. ”
CJB	Numbers	16	17	Each of you take his fire pan and put incense in it ; every one of you , bring before Adonai his fire pan ,
CJB	Numbers	16	18	Each man took his fire pan , put fire in it , laid incense on it and stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting with Moshe and Aharon .
CJB	Numbers	16	19	Korach assembled all the group who were against them at the entrance to the tent of meeting . Then the glory of Adonai appeared to the whole assembly . ( iii )
CJB	Numbers	16	20	Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon ,
CJB	Numbers	16	21	“ Separate yourselves from this assembly ; I ’ m going to destroy them right now ! ”
CJB	Numbers	16	22	They fell on their faces and said , “ Oh God , God of the spirits of all humankind , if one person sins , are you going to be angry with the entire assembly ? ”
CJB	Numbers	16	23	Adonai answered Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	16	24	“ Tell the assembly to move away from the homes of Korach , Datan and Aviram. ”
CJB	Numbers	16	25	Moshe got up and went to Datan and Aviram , and the leaders of Isra ’ el followed him .
CJB	Numbers	16	26	There he said to the assembly , “ Leave the tents of these wicked men ! Don ’ t touch anything that belongs to them , or you may be swept away in all their sins. ”
CJB	Numbers	16	27	So they moved away from all around the area where Korach , Datan and Aviram lived . Then Datan and Aviram came out and stood at the entrance to their tents with their wives , sons and little ones .
CJB	Numbers	16	28	Moshe said , “ Here is how you will know that Adonai has sent me to do all these things and that I haven ’ t done them out of my own ambition :
CJB	Numbers	16	29	if these men die a natural death like other people , only sharing the fate common to all humanity , then Adonai has not sent me .
CJB	Numbers	16	30	But if Adonai does something new — if the ground opens up and swallows them with everything they own , and they go down alive to Sh ’ ol — then you will understand that these men have had contempt for Adonai. ”
CJB	Numbers	16	31	The moment he finished speaking , the ground under them split apart —
CJB	Numbers	16	32	the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their households , all the people who had sided with Korach and everything they owned .
CJB	Numbers	16	33	So they and everything they owned went down alive into Sh ’ ol , the earth closed over them and their existence in the community ceased .
CJB	Numbers	16	34	All Isra ’ el around them fled at their shrieks , shouting , “ The earth might swallow us too ! ”
CJB	Numbers	16	35	Then fire came out from Adonai and destroyed the
CJB	Numbers	17	17	(
CJB	Numbers	17	2	) “ Speak to the people of Isra ’ el , and take from them staffs , one for each ancestral tribe from each leader of a tribe , twelve staffs . Write each man ’ s name on his staff ;
CJB	Numbers	17	3	) and write Aharon ’ s name on the staff of Levi , for each tribe ’ s leader is to have one staff .
CJB	Numbers	17	4	) Put them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony , where I meet with you .
CJB	Numbers	17	5	) The staff of the man I am going to choose will sprout buds — in this way I will put a stop to the complaints the people of Isra ’ el keep making against you. ”
CJB	Numbers	17	6	) Moshe spoke to the people of Isra ’ el , and all their leaders gave him staffs , one for each leader , according to their ancestral tribes , twelve staffs . Aharon ’ s staff was among their staffs .
CJB	Numbers	17	7	) Moshe put the staffs before Adonai in the tent of the testimony .
CJB	Numbers	17	8	) The next day Moshe went into the tent of the testimony , and there he saw that Aharon ’ s staff for the house of Levi had budded — it had sprouted not only buds but flowers and ripe almonds as well .
CJB	Numbers	17	9	) Moshe brought out all the staffs from before Adonai to all the people of Isra ’ el , and they looked , and each man took back his staff . ( vi )
CJB	Numbers	17	10	) Adonai said to Moshe , “ Return Aharon ’ s staff to its place in front of the testimony . It is to be kept there as a sign to the rebels , so that they will stop grumbling against me and thus not die. ”
CJB	Numbers	17	11	) Moshe did this ; he did as Adonai had ordered him .
CJB	Numbers	17	12	) But the people of Isra ’ el said to Moshe , “ Oh no ! We ’ re dead men ! Lost ! We ’ re all lost !
CJB	Numbers	17	13	) Whenever anyone approaches the tabernacle of Adonai , he dies ! Will we all perish ? ”
CJB	Numbers	17	14	( 16:49 ) Those dying from the plague numbered 14,700 — besides those who died in the Korach incident .
CJB	Numbers	17	15	( 16:50 ) Aharon returned to Moshe at the entrance to the tent of meeting , and the plague was stopped . ( v )

CJB	Numbers	18	10	You are to eat it in an especially holy place ; every male may eat it ; it will be set apart for you .
CJB	Numbers	18	11	“ Also yours is the contribution the people of Isra ’ el give in the form of wave offerings . I have given these to you , your sons and your daughters with you ; this is a perpetual law . Everyone in your family who is clean may eat it .

CJB	Numbers	18	16	The sum to be paid for redeeming anyone a month old or over is to be five shekels of silver [ two ounces ] , as you value it , using the sanctuary shekel ( this is the same as twenty gerahs ) .

CJB	Numbers	19	20	The person who remains unclean and does not purify himself will be cut off from the community because he has defiled the sanctuary of Adonai . The water for purification has not been sprinkled on him ; he is unclean .
CJB	Numbers	19	21	This is to be a permanent regulation for them . The person who sprinkles the water for purification is to wash his clothes . Whoever touches the water for purification will be unclean until evening .
CJB	Numbers	19	22	Anything the unclean person touches will be unclean , and anyone who touches him will be unclean until evening . ”
CJB	Numbers	20	20	But he said , “ You are not to pass through ” ; and Edom came out against them with many people and much force .
CJB	Numbers	20	2	Because the community had no water , they assembled themselves against Moshe and Aharon .
CJB	Numbers	20	3	The people quarreled with Moshe and said , “ We wish we had died when our brothers died before Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	20	4	Why did you bring Adonai ’ s community into this desert ? To die there , we and our livestock ?
CJB	Numbers	20	5	Why did you make us leave Egypt ? To bring us to this terrible place without seed , figs , grapevines , pomegranates or even water to drink ? ”
CJB	Numbers	20	6	Moshe and Aharon left the assembly , went to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces ; and the glory of Adonai appeared to them . ( RY : ii , LY : iii )
CJB	Numbers	20	7	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	20	8	“ Take the staff , assemble the community , you and Aharon your brother ; and before their eyes , tell the rock to produce its water . You will bring them water out of the rock and thus enable the community and their livestock to drink. ”
CJB	Numbers	20	9	Moshe took the staff from the presence of Adonai , as he had ordered him .
CJB	Numbers	20	10	But after Moshe and Aharon had assembled the community in front of the rock , he said to them , “ Listen here , you rebels ! Are we supposed to bring you water from this rock ? ”
CJB	Numbers	20	11	Then Moshe raised his hand and hit the rock twice with his staff . Water flowed out in abundance , and the community and their livestock drank .
CJB	Numbers	20	12	But Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon , “ Because you did not trust in me , so as to cause me to be regarded as holy by the people of Isra ’ el , you will not bring this community into the land I have given them. ”
CJB	Numbers	20	13	This is M ’ rivah Spring [ Disputation Spring ] , where the people of Isra ’ el disputed with Adonai , and he was caused to be regarded as holy by them . ( LY : iv )
CJB	Numbers	20	14	Moshe sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom : “ This is what your brother Isra ’ el says : you know all the troubles we have gone through —
CJB	Numbers	20	15	that our ancestors went down into Egypt , we lived in Egypt a long time , and the Egyptians treated us and our ancestors badly .
CJB	Numbers	20	16	But when we cried out to Adonai , he heard us , sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt . Now here we are in Kadesh , a city at the edge of your territory .
CJB	Numbers	20	17	Please let us pass through your land . We will not go through fields or vineyards , and we won ’ t drink any water from the wells . We will go along the King ’ s Highway , not turning aside either to the right or to the left until we have left your territory. ”
CJB	Numbers	20	18	But Edom answered , “ You are not to pass through my land ; if you do , I will come out against you with the sword. ”
CJB	Numbers	20	19	The people of Isra ’ el replied , “ We will keep to the highway ; if we do drink the water , either we or our livestock , we will pay for it . Just let us pass through on foot — it ’ s nothing. ”
CJB	Numbers	20	21	Thus Edom refused to allow Isra ’ el passage through its territory , so Isra ’ el turned away . ( RY : iii , LY : v )
CJB	Numbers	20	22	They traveled on from Kadesh ; and the people of Isra ’ el , the whole community , arrived at Mount Hor .
CJB	Numbers	20	23	At Mount Hor , by the border of the land of Edom , Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon ,
CJB	Numbers	20	24	“ Aharon is about to be gathered to his people , because he is not to enter the land I have given to the people of Isra ’ el , inasmuch as you rebelled against what I said at the M ’ rivah Spring .
CJB	Numbers	20	25	Take Aharon and El ‘ azar his son , bring them up to Mount Hor ,
CJB	Numbers	20	26	remove the garments from Aharon and put them on El ‘ azar his son . Aharon will be gathered to his people — he will die there. ”
CJB	Numbers	20	27	Moshe did as Adonai had ordered . They went up onto Mount Hor before the eyes of the whole community .
CJB	Numbers	20	28	Moshe removed the garments from Aharon , and put them on El ‘ azar his son , and Aharon died there on the top of the mountain . Then Moshe and El ‘ azar came down the mountain .
CJB	Numbers	20	29	When the entire community saw that Aharon was dead , they mourned Aharon thirty days , the whole house of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	21	21	Isra ’ el sent messengers to Sichon , king of the Emori , with this message :
CJB	Numbers	21	2	Isra ’ el made a vow to Adonai , “ If you will hand this people over to me , I will completely destroy their cities. ”
CJB	Numbers	21	3	Adonai listened to what Isra ’ el said and handed over the Kena ‘ anim , so they completely destroyed them and their cities and named the place Hormah [ complete destruction ] .
CJB	Numbers	21	4	Then they traveled from Mount Hor on the road toward the Sea of Suf in order to go around the land of Edom ; but the people ’ s tempers grew short because of the detour .
CJB	Numbers	21	5	The people spoke against God and against Moshe : “ Why did you bring us up out of Egypt ? To die in the desert ? There ’ s no real food , there ’ s no water , and we ’ re sick of this miserable stuff we ’ re eating ! ” ( LY : vi )
CJB	Numbers	21	6	In response , Adonai sent poisonous snakes among the people ; they bit the people , and many of Isra ’ el ’ s people died .
CJB	Numbers	21	7	The people came to Moshe and said , “ We sinned by speaking against Adonai and against you . Pray to Adonai that he rid us of these snakes. ” Moshe prayed for the people ,
CJB	Numbers	21	8	and Adonai answered Moshe : “ Make a poisonous snake and put it on a pole . When anyone who has been bitten sees it , he will live. ”
CJB	Numbers	21	9	Moshe made a bronze snake and put it on the pole ; if a snake had bitten someone , then , when he looked toward the bronze snake , he stayed alive .
CJB	Numbers	21	10	The people of Isra ’ el traveled on and camped at Ovot .
CJB	Numbers	21	11	From Ovot they traveled and camped at ‘ Iyei-Ha ‘ avarim , in the desert fronting Mo ’ av on the east .
CJB	Numbers	21	12	From there they traveled and camped in Vadi Zered .
CJB	Numbers	21	13	From there they traveled and camped on the other side of the Arnon , in the desert ; this river comes out of the territory of the Emori ; for the Arnon is the boundary between Mo ’ av and the Emori .
CJB	Numbers	21	14	This is why it says , in the Book of the Wars of Adonai , “ . . . Vahev at Sufah , the vadis of Arnon ,
CJB	Numbers	21	15	and the slope of the vadis extending as far as the site of ‘ Ar , which lie next to the territory of Mo ’ av. ”
CJB	Numbers	21	16	From there they went on to Be ’ er [ well ] ; that is the well about which Adonai said to Moshe , “ Assemble the people , and I will give them water. ”
CJB	Numbers	21	17	Then Isra ’ el sang this song : “ Spring up , oh well ! Sing to the well
CJB	Numbers	21	18	sunk by the princes , dug by the people ’ s leaders with the scepter , with their staffs ! ” From the desert they went to Mattanah ,
CJB	Numbers	21	19	from Mattanah to Nachali ’ el , from Nachali ’ el to Bamot ,
CJB	Numbers	21	20	and from Bamot to the valley by the plain of Mo ’ av at the start of the Pisgah range , where it overlooks the desert . ( RY : iv , LY : vii )
CJB	Numbers	21	22	“ Let me pass through your land . We won ’ t turn aside into fields or vineyards , and we won ’ t drink any water from the wells . We will go along the King ’ s Highway until we have left your territory. ”
CJB	Numbers	21	23	But Sichon would not allow Isra ’ el to pass through his territory . Instead , Sichon mustered all his people and went out into the desert to fight Isra ’ el . On reaching Yachatz , he fought Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	21	24	Isra ’ el defeated him by force of arms and took control of his land from the Arnon to the Yabok River , but only as far as the people of ‘ Amon , because the territory of the people of ‘ Amon was well defended .
CJB	Numbers	21	25	Isra ’ el took all these cities — Isra ’ el lived in all the cities of the Emori , in Heshbon and all its surrounding towns .
CJB	Numbers	21	26	Heshbon was the city of Sichon , the king of the Emori , who had fought against the former king of Mo ’ av and conquered all his land up to the Arnon .
CJB	Numbers	21	27	This is why the storytellers say , “ Come to Heshbon ! Let it be rebuilt ! Let Sichon ’ s city be restored !
CJB	Numbers	21	28	“ For fire burst out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sichon . It consumed ‘ Ar of Mo ’ av , the lords of Arnon ’ s high places .
CJB	Numbers	21	29	“ Woe to you , Mo ’ av ! You are destroyed , people of K ’ mosh ! He let his sons be fugitives and his daughters captives of Sichon , king of the Emori .
CJB	Numbers	21	30	“ We shot them down ; Heshbon is destroyed , all the way to Divon . We even laid waste to Nofach , which extends as far as Meidva. ”
CJB	Numbers	21	31	Thus Isra ’ el lived in the land of the Emori .
CJB	Numbers	21	32	Moshe sent men to reconnoiter Ya ‘ zer ; they captured its towns and drove out the Emori who were there .
CJB	Numbers	21	33	Then they turned and went up along the road to Bashan ; and ‘ Og , the king of Bashan , marched out against them , he with all his people , to fight at Edre ‘ i . ( LY : Maftir )
CJB	Numbers	21	34	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Don ’ t be afraid of him , for I have handed him over to you with all his people and his land . You will treat him just as you did Sichon , king of the Emori , who lived at Heshbon. ”
CJB	Numbers	21	35	So they struck him down , with his sons and all his people , until there was no one left alive ; and then they took control of his land .
CJB	Numbers	22	22	But God ’ s anger flared up because he went , and the angel of Adonai stationed himself on the path to bar his way . He was riding on his donkey , and his two servants were with him .
CJB	Numbers	22	40	Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep , then sent to Bil ‘ am and the princes with him .
CJB	Numbers	22	39	Bil ‘ am went with Balak . When they arrived at Kiryat-Hutzot ,
CJB	Numbers	22	2	Now Balak the son of Tzippor saw all that Isra ’ el had done to the Emori .
CJB	Numbers	22	3	Mo ’ av was very afraid of the people , because there were so many of them ; Mo ’ av was overcome with dread because of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	22	4	So Mo ’ av said to the leaders of Midyan , “ This horde will lick up everything around us , the way an ox licks up grass in the field. ” Balak the son of Tzippor was king of Mo ’ av at that time .
CJB	Numbers	22	5	He sent messengers to Bil ‘ am the son of B ‘ or , at P ’ tor by the [ Euphrates ] River in his native land , to tell him , “ Listen , a people has come out of Egypt , spread over all the land and settled down next to me .
CJB	Numbers	22	6	Therefore , please come , and curse this people for me , because they are stronger than I am . Maybe I will be able to strike them down and drive them out of the land , for I know that whomever you bless is in fact blessed , and whomever you curse is in fact cursed. ”
CJB	Numbers	22	7	The leaders of Mo ’ av and Midyan left , taking with them the payment for divining , came to Bil ‘ am and spoke to him the words of Balak .
CJB	Numbers	22	8	He said to them , “ Stay here tonight , and I will bring you back whatever answer Adonai tells me. ” So the princes of Mo ’ av stayed with Bil ‘ am .
CJB	Numbers	22	9	God came to Bil ‘ am and said , “ Who are these men with you ? ”
CJB	Numbers	22	10	Bil ‘ am said to God , “ Balak the son of Tzippor , king of Mo ’ av , has sent me this message :
CJB	Numbers	22	11	‘ The people who came out of Egypt have spread over the land ; now , come and curse them for me ; maybe I will be able to fight against them and drive them out. ’ ”
CJB	Numbers	22	12	God answered Bil ‘ am , “ You are not to go with them ; you are not to curse the people , because they are blessed. ” ( RY : v ; LY : ii )
CJB	Numbers	22	13	Bil ‘ am got up in the morning and said to the princes of Balak , “ Return to your own land , because Adonai refuses to give me permission to go with you. ”
CJB	Numbers	22	14	The princes of Mo ’ av got up , returned to Balak and said , “ Bil ‘ am refuses to come with us. ”
CJB	Numbers	22	15	Balak again sent princes , more of them and of higher status than the first group .
CJB	Numbers	22	16	They went to Bil ‘ am and said to him , “ Here is what Balak the son of Tzippor says : ‘ Please don ’ t let anything keep you from coming to me .
CJB	Numbers	22	17	I will reward you very well , and whatever you say to me I will do . So please come , and curse this people for me. ’ ”
CJB	Numbers	22	18	Bil ‘ am answered the servants of Balak , “ Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold , I can not go beyond the word of Adonai my God to do anything , great or small .
CJB	Numbers	22	19	Now , please , you too , stay here tonight ; so that I may find out what else Adonai will say to me. ”
CJB	Numbers	22	20	God came to Bil ‘ am during the night and said to him , “ If the men have come to summon you , get up and go with them ; but do only what I tell you. ” ( LY : iii )
CJB	Numbers	22	21	So Bil ‘ am got up in the morning , saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Mo ’ av .
CJB	Numbers	22	23	The donkey saw the angel of Adonai standing on the road , drawn sword in hand ; so the donkey turned off the road into the field ; and Bil ‘ am had to beat the donkey to get it back on the road .
CJB	Numbers	22	24	Then the angel of Adonai stood on the road where it became narrow as it passed among the vineyards and had stone walls on both sides .
CJB	Numbers	22	25	The donkey saw the angel of Adonai and pushed up against the wall , crushing Bil ‘ am ’ s foot against the wall . So he beat it again .
CJB	Numbers	22	26	The angel of Adonai moved ahead and stood in a place so tight that there was no room to turn either right or left .
CJB	Numbers	22	27	Again the donkey saw the angel of Adonai and lay down under Bil ‘ am , which made him so angry that he hit the donkey with his stick .
CJB	Numbers	22	28	But Adonai enabled the donkey to speak , and it said to Bil ‘ am , “ What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times ? ”
CJB	Numbers	22	29	Bil ‘ am said to the donkey , “ It ’ s because you ’ ve been making a fool of me ! I wish I had a sword in my hand ; I would kill you on the spot ! ”
CJB	Numbers	22	30	The donkey said to Bil ‘ am , “ I ’ m your donkey , right ? You ’ ve ridden me all your life , right ? Have I ever treated you like this before ? ” “ No , ” he admitted .
CJB	Numbers	22	31	Then Adonai opened Bil ‘ am ’ s eyes , so that he could see the angel of Adonai standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand , and he bowed his head and fell on his face .
CJB	Numbers	22	32	The angel of Adonai said to him , “ Why did you hit your donkey three times like that ? I have come out here to bar your way , because you are rushing to oppose me .
CJB	Numbers	22	33	The donkey saw me and turned aside these three times ; and indeed , if she hadn ’ t turned away from me , I would have killed you by now and saved it alive ! ”
CJB	Numbers	22	34	Bil ‘ am said to the angel of Adonai , “ I have sinned . I didn ’ t know that you were standing on the road to block me . Now , therefore , if what I am doing displeases you , I will go back. ”
CJB	Numbers	22	35	But the angel of Adonai said to Bil ‘ am , “ No , go on with the men ; but you are to say only what I tell you to say. ” So Bil ‘ am went along with the princes of Balak .
CJB	Numbers	22	36	When Balak heard that Bil ‘ am had come , he went out to meet him in the city of Mo ’ av at the Arnon border , in the farthest reaches of the territory .
CJB	Numbers	22	37	Balak said to Bil ‘ am , “ I sent more than once to summon you ! Why didn ’ t you come to me ? Did you think I couldn ’ t pay you enough ? ”
CJB	Numbers	22	38	Bil ‘ am replied to Balak , “ Here , I ’ ve come to you ! But I have no power of my own to say anything . The word that God puts in my mouth is what I will say. ” ( RY : vi , LY : iv )
CJB	Numbers	22	41	In the morning Balak took Bil ‘ am and brought him up to the high places of Ba ‘ al ; from there he could see a portion of the people .
CJB	Numbers	23	23	thus one can ’ t put a spell on Ya ‘ akov , no magic will work against Isra ’ el . It can now be said of Ya ‘ akov and Isra ’ el , ‘ What is this that God has done ? ! ’
CJB	Numbers	23	2	Balak did as Bil ‘ am said ; then Balak and Bil ‘ am offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
CJB	Numbers	23	3	Bil ‘ am said to Balak , “ Stand by your burnt offering while I go off ; maybe Adonai will come and meet me ; and whatever he shows me I will tell you. ” He went off to a bare hill .
CJB	Numbers	23	4	God met Bil ‘ am , who said to him , “ I prepared the seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. ”
CJB	Numbers	23	5	Then Adonai put a word in Bil ‘ am ’ s mouth and said , “ Go on back to Balak , and speak as I tell you. ”
CJB	Numbers	23	6	He went back to him , and there , standing by his burnt offering , he with all the princes of Mo ’ av ,
CJB	Numbers	23	7	he made his pronouncement : “ Balak , the king of Mo ’ av , brings me from Aram , from the eastern hills , saying , ‘ Come , curse Ya ‘ akov for me ; come and denounce Isra ’ el. ’
CJB	Numbers	23	8	“ How am I to curse those whom God has not cursed ? How am I to denounce those whom Adonai has not denounced ?
CJB	Numbers	23	9	“ From the top of the rocks I see them , from the hills I behold them — yes , a people that will dwell alone and not think itself one of the nations .
CJB	Numbers	23	10	“ Who has counted the dust of Ya ‘ akov or numbered the ashes of Isra ’ el ? May I die as the righteous die ! May my end be like theirs ! ”
CJB	Numbers	23	11	Balak said to Bil ‘ am , “ What have you done to me ? ! To curse my enemies is why I brought you ; and , here , you have totally blessed them ! ”
CJB	Numbers	23	12	He answered , “ Mustn ’ t I take care to say just what Adonai puts in my mouth ? ” ( LY : v )
CJB	Numbers	23	13	Balak said to him , “ All right , come with me to another place where you can see them . You will see only some of them , not all ; but you can curse them for me from there. ”
CJB	Numbers	23	14	He took him through the field of Tzofim to the top of the Pisgah Range , built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
CJB	Numbers	23	15	Bil ‘ am said to Balak , “ Stand here by your burnt offering , while I go over there for a meeting. ”
CJB	Numbers	23	16	Adonai met Bil ‘ am , put a word in his mouth and said , “ Go on back to Balak , and speak as I tell you. ”
CJB	Numbers	23	17	He came to him and stood by his burnt offering , with all the princes of Mo ’ av . Balak asked him , “ What did Adonai say ? ”
CJB	Numbers	23	18	Then Bil ‘ am made his pronouncement : “ Get up , Balak , and listen ! Turn your ears to me , son of Tzippor !
CJB	Numbers	23	19	“ God is not a human who lies or a mortal who changes his mind . When he says something , he will do it ; when he makes a promise , he will fulfill it .
CJB	Numbers	23	20	Look , I am ordered to bless ; when he blesses , I can ’ t reverse it .
CJB	Numbers	23	21	“ No one has seen guilt in Ya ‘ akov , or perceived perversity in Isra ’ el ; Adonai their God is with them and acclaimed as king among them .
CJB	Numbers	23	22	“ God , who brought them out of Egypt , gives them the strength of a wild ox ;
CJB	Numbers	23	24	“ Here is a people rising up like a lioness ; like a lion he rears himself up — he will not lie down till he eats up the prey and drinks the blood of the slain. ”
CJB	Numbers	23	25	Balak said to Bil ‘ am , “ Obviously , you won ’ t curse them . But at least don ’ t bless them ! ”
CJB	Numbers	23	26	However , Bil ‘ am answered Balak , “ Didn ’ t I warn you that I must do everything Adonai says ? ” ( RY : vii , LY : vi )
CJB	Numbers	23	27	Balak said to Bil ‘ am , “ Come , I will take you now to another place ; maybe it will please God for you to curse them for me from there. ”
CJB	Numbers	23	28	Balak took Bil ‘ am to the top of P ‘ or , overlooking the desert .
CJB	Numbers	23	29	Bil ‘ am said to Balak , “ Build me seven altars here , and prepare me seven bulls and seven rams. ”
CJB	Numbers	23	30	Balak did as Bil ‘ am said and offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
CJB	Numbers	24	24	But ships will come from the coast of Kittim to subdue Ashur and subdue ‘ Ever , but they too will come to destruction. ”
CJB	Numbers	24	2	Bil ‘ am raised his eyes and saw Isra ’ el encamped tribe by tribe . Then the Spirit of God came upon him ,
CJB	Numbers	24	3	and he made his pronouncement : “ This is the speech of Bil ‘ am , son of B ‘ or ; the speech of the man whose eyes have been opened ;
CJB	Numbers	24	4	the speech of him who hears God ’ s words ; who sees what Shaddai sees , who has fallen , yet has open eyes :
CJB	Numbers	24	5	“ How lovely are your tents , Ya ‘ akov ; your encampments , Isra ’ el !
CJB	Numbers	24	6	They spread out like valleys , like gardens by the riverside , like succulent aloes planted by Adonai , like cedar trees next to the water .
CJB	Numbers	24	7	“ Water will flow from their branches , their seed will have water aplenty . Their king will be higher than Agag and his kingdom lifted high .
CJB	Numbers	24	8	God , who brought them out of Egypt , gives them the strength of a wild ox . They will devour the nations opposing them , break their bones , pierce them with their arrows .
CJB	Numbers	24	9	“ When they lie down they crouch like a lion , or like a lioness — who dares to rouse it ? Blessed be all who bless you ! Cursed be all who curse you ! ”
CJB	Numbers	24	10	Balak blazed with fury against Bil ‘ am . He struck his hands together and said to Bil ‘ am , “ I summoned you to curse my enemies . But here , you have done nothing but bless them — three times already !
CJB	Numbers	24	11	Now you had better escape to your own place ! I had planned to reward you very well , but now Adonai has deprived you of payment. ”
CJB	Numbers	24	12	Bil ‘ am answered Balak , “ Didn ’ t I tell the messengers you sent me
CJB	Numbers	24	13	that even if Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold , I could not of my own accord go beyond the word of Adonai to do either good or bad ? that what Adonai said is what I would say ? ( LY : vii )
CJB	Numbers	24	14	But now that I am going back to my own people , come , I will warn you what this people will do to your people in the acharit-hayamim .
CJB	Numbers	24	15	So he made his pronouncement : “ This is the speech of Bil ‘ am , son of B ‘ or ; the speech of the man whose eyes have been opened ;
CJB	Numbers	24	16	the speech of him who hears God ’ s words ; who knows what ‘ Elyon knows , who sees what Shaddai sees , who has fallen , yet has open eyes :
CJB	Numbers	24	17	“ I see him , but not now ; I behold him , but not soon — a star will step forth from Ya ‘ akov , a scepter will arise from Isra ’ el , to crush the corners of Mo ’ av and destroy all descendants of Shet .
CJB	Numbers	24	18	His enemies will be his possessions — Edom and Se ‘ ir , possessions . Isra ’ el will do valiantly ,
CJB	Numbers	24	19	From Ya ‘ akov will come someone who will rule , and he will destroy what is left of the city. ”
CJB	Numbers	24	20	He saw ‘ Amalek and made this pronouncement : “ First among nations was ‘ Amalek , but destruction will be its end. ”
CJB	Numbers	24	21	He saw the Keini and made this pronouncement : “ Though your dwelling is firm , your nest set on rock ,
CJB	Numbers	24	22	Kayin will be wasted while captive to Ashur. ”
CJB	Numbers	24	23	Finally , he made this pronouncement : “ Oh no ! Who can live when God does this ?
CJB	Numbers	24	25	Then Bil ‘ am got up , left and returned to his home ; and Balak too went his way .
CJB	Numbers	25	25	Isra ’ el stayed at Sheetim , and there the people began whoring with the women of Mo ’ av .
CJB	Numbers	25	2	Peter ) 2:1–22 ; Y ’ hudah ( Jude )
CJB	Numbers	25	3	With Isra ’ el thus joined to Ba ‘ al-P ‘ or , the anger of Adonai blazed up against Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	25	4	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Take all the chiefs of the people , and hang them facing the sun before Adonai , so that the raging fury of Adonai will turn away from Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Numbers	25	5	Moshe said to the judges of Isra ’ el , “ Each of you is to put to death those in his tribe who have joined themselves to Ba ‘ al-P ‘ or. ”
CJB	Numbers	25	6	Just then , in the sight of Moshe and the whole community of Isra ’ el , as they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting , a man from Isra ’ el came by , bringing to his family a woman from Midyan . ( Maftir )
CJB	Numbers	25	7	) – 6:8 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Balak :
CJB	Numbers	25	8	and pursued the man from Isra ’ el right into the inner part of the tent , where he thrust his spear through both of them — the man from Isra ’ el and the woman through her stomach . Thus was the plague among the people of Isra ’ el stopped ;
CJB	Numbers	25	9	nevertheless , 24,000 died in the plague . Haftarah Balak : Mikhah ( Micah ) 5:6 (
CJB	Numbers	25	11	“ Pinchas the son of El ‘ azar , the son of Aharon the cohen , has deflected my anger from the people of Isra ’ el by being as zealous as I am , so that I didn ’ t destroy them in my own zeal .
CJB	Numbers	25	41	: Pinchas ( Phinehas ) 25:10 –30:1 ( 29:40 )
CJB	Numbers	25	10	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	25	12	Therefore say , ‘ I am giving him my covenant of shalom ,
CJB	Numbers	25	13	making a covenant with him and his descendants after him that the office of cohen will be theirs forever. ’ This is because he was zealous on behalf of his God and made atonement for the people of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Numbers	25	14	The name of the man from Isra ’ el who was killed , put to death with the woman from Midyan , was Zimri the son of Salu , leader of one of the clans from the tribe of Shim ‘ on .
CJB	Numbers	25	15	The name of the woman from Midyan who was killed was Kozbi the daughter of Tzur , and he was head of the people in one of the clans of Midyan .
CJB	Numbers	25	16	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	25	17	“ Treat the Midyanim as enemies and attack them ;

CJB	Numbers	26	52	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	26	53	“ The land is to be parceled out among these as a possession to be inherited , according to the number of names .
CJB	Numbers	26	54	To those families with more persons you are to give a greater inheritance , and to those with fewer you are to give a smaller inheritance — each family ’ s inheritance is to be given according to the number counted in it .
CJB	Numbers	26	55	However , the land is to be awarded by lot . They will inherit according to the names of the tribes of their ancestors ,
CJB	Numbers	26	56	but the inheritance is to be parceled out by lot between the families with more and those with fewer. ”

CJB	Numbers	26	62	Those males one month old or more counted of the Levi were 23,000 . These were not included in the census of the people of Isra ’ el , because no land for inheritance was given to them among the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	26	63	These are the ones counted by Moshe and El ‘ azar the cohen , who took a census of the people of Isra ’ el in the plains of Mo ’ av by the Yarden across from Yericho .
CJB	Numbers	26	64	But there was not a man among them who had also been included in the census of Moshe and Aharon the cohen when they enumerated the people of Isra ’ el in the Sinai Desert ;
CJB	Numbers	26	65	because Adonai had said of them , “ They will surely die in the desert. ” So there was not left even one of them , except Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh and Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun .
CJB	Numbers	27	27	Then the daughters of Tz ’ lof ’ chad the son of Hefer , the son of Gil ‘ ad , the son of Machir , the son of M ’ nasheh , of the families of M ’ nasheh , the son of Yosef , approached . These were the names of his daughters : Machlah , No ‘ ah , Hoglah , Milkah and Tirtzah .

CJB	Numbers	27	4	Why should the name of our father be eliminated from his family just because he didn ’ t have a son ? Give us property to possess along with the brothers of our father. ”
CJB	Numbers	27	5	Moshe brought their cause before Adonai . ( iv )
CJB	Numbers	27	6	Adonai answered Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	27	7	“ The daughters of Tz ’ lof ’ chad are right in what they say . You must give them property to be inherited along with that of their father ’ s brothers ; have what their father would have inherited pass to them .
CJB	Numbers	27	8	Moreover , say to the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ If a man dies and does not have a son , you are to have his inheritance pass to his daughter .
CJB	Numbers	27	9	If he doesn ’ t have a daughter , give his inheritance to his brothers .
CJB	Numbers	27	10	If he has no brothers , give his inheritance to his father ’ s brothers .
CJB	Numbers	27	11	If his father doesn ’ t have brothers , give his inheritance to the closest relative in his family , and he will possess it . This will be the standard for judgment to be used by the people of Isra ’ el , as Adonai ordered Moshe. ’ ”
CJB	Numbers	27	12	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Climb this mountain in the ‘ Avarim Range , and look out at the land which I have given the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	27	13	After you have seen it , you too will be gathered to your people , just as Aharon your brother was gathered ;
CJB	Numbers	27	14	because in the Tzin Desert , when the community was disputing with me , you rebelled against my order to uphold my holiness by means of the water , with them looking on. ” ( This was M ’ rivat-Kadesh Spring , in the Tzin Desert . )
CJB	Numbers	27	15	Moshe said to Adonai ,
CJB	Numbers	27	16	“ Let Adonai , God of the spirits of all human beings , appoint a man to be over the community ,
CJB	Numbers	27	17	to go out and come in ahead of them , to lead them out and bring them in , so that Adonai ’ s community will not be like sheep without a shepherd. ”
CJB	Numbers	27	18	Adonai said to Moshe , “ Take Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun , a spiritual man , and lay your hand on him .
CJB	Numbers	27	19	Put him in front of El ‘ azar the cohen and the whole community , and commission him in their sight .
CJB	Numbers	27	20	Delegate to him some of your authority , so that the entire community of Isra ’ el will obey him .
CJB	Numbers	27	21	He is to present himself to El ‘ azar the cohen , who is to find out by means of the urim what Adonai ’ s will is for Y ’ hoshua ’ s decisions . Then , at his word they will go out , and at his word they will come in , both he and all the people of Isra ’ el with him , the whole community. ”
CJB	Numbers	27	22	Moshe did as Adonai had ordered him . He took Y ’ hoshua , put him before El ‘ azar the cohen and the whole community ,
CJB	Numbers	27	23	laid his hands on him , and commissioned him , as Adonai had said through Moshe .

CJB	Numbers	30	30	( 29:40 ) Moshe told the people of Isra ’ el everything , just as Adonai had ordered Moshe . Haftarah Pinchas : M ’ lakhim Alef (
CJB	Numbers	30	1	) Then Moshe spoke to the heads of the tribes of the people of Isra ’ el . He said , “ Here is what Adonai has ordered :
CJB	Numbers	30	39	; 19:14 ; Acts 2:1–21 ; 12:3–4 ; 20:5–6 ,
CJB	Numbers	30	16	) These are the laws which Adonai ordered Moshe between a man and his wife , and between a father and his daughter , if she is a minor living in her father ’ s house .
CJB	Numbers	30	8	) But if her husband expresses his disapproval on the day he hears it , he will void the vow which is on her and the obligation to which she has bound herself ; and Adonai will forgive her .
CJB	Numbers	30	42	: Mattot ( Tribes ) 30:2 (
CJB	Numbers	30	43	, in leap years read separately ]
CJB	Numbers	30	2	) when a man makes a vow to Adonai or formally obligates himself by swearing an oath , he is not to break his word but is to do everything he said he would do .
CJB	Numbers	30	3	) “ When a woman makes a vow to Adonai , formally obligating herself , while she is a minor living in her father ’ s house ;
CJB	Numbers	30	4	) then , if her father has heard what she vowed or obligated herself to do and holds his peace , then all her vows remain binding — every obligation she has bound herself to will stand .
CJB	Numbers	30	5	) But if on the day her father hears it , he expresses his disapproval , then none of her vows or obligations she has bound herself to will stand ; and Adonai will forgive her , because her father expressed his disapproval .
CJB	Numbers	30	6	) “ If , having made vows or rashly committed herself to an obligation , she gets married ;
CJB	Numbers	30	7	) and her husband hears but holds his peace with her on the day he learns of it , then her vows and obligations she has bound herself to will stand .
CJB	Numbers	30	9	) “ The vow of a widow , however , or of a divorcee , including everything to which she has obligated herself , will stand against her .
CJB	Numbers	30	10	) “ If a woman vowed in her husband ’ s house or obligated herself with an oath ;
CJB	Numbers	30	11	) and her husband heard it but held his peace with her and did not express disapproval , then all her vows and obligations will stand .
CJB	Numbers	30	12	) But if her husband makes them null and void on the day he hears them , then whatever she said , vows or binding obligation , will not stand ; her husband has voided them ; and Adonai will forgive her .
CJB	Numbers	30	13	) Her husband may let every vow and every binding obligation stand , or he may void it .
CJB	Numbers	30	14	) But if her husband entirely holds his peace with her day after day , then he confirms all her vows and obligations ; he must let them stand , because he held his peace with her on the day he heard them .
CJB	Numbers	30	15	) If he makes them null and void after he has heard them , then he will bear the consequent guilt. ”

CJB	Numbers	31	11	They took all the booty , all the people and animals they had captured ,
CJB	Numbers	31	12	and brought the captives , booty and spoil to Moshe , El ‘ azar the cohen and the community of Isra ’ el in the camp on the plains of Mo ’ av by the Yarden across from Yericho . ( RY : ii , LY : iii )
CJB	Numbers	31	13	Moshe , El ‘ azar the cohen and all the community leaders went to meet them outside the camp .
CJB	Numbers	31	14	But Moshe was angry with the army officers , the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds coming in from the battlefield .
CJB	Numbers	31	15	Moshe asked them , “ You let the women live ?
CJB	Numbers	31	16	Why , these are the ones who — because of Bil ‘ am ’ s advice — caused the people of Isra ’ el to rebel , breaking faith with Adonai in the P ‘ or incident , so that the plague broke out among Adonai ’ s community !
CJB	Numbers	31	17	Now kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has ever slept with a man .
CJB	Numbers	31	18	But the young girls who have never slept with a man , keep alive for yourselves .
CJB	Numbers	31	19	Pitch your tents outside the camp for seven days . Whoever has killed a person or touched the corpse of someone slain , purify yourselves on the third and seventh days , you and your captives .
CJB	Numbers	31	20	Also purify every garment , whether of skin or goat ’ s hair , and everything made of wood. ”
CJB	Numbers	31	21	El ‘ azar the cohen said to the soldiers who had gone to the front , “ This is the regulation from the Torah which Adonai has ordered Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	31	22	Even though gold , silver , brass , iron , tin and lead
CJB	Numbers	31	23	can all withstand fire , so that you are indeed to purify everything made of these materials by having them pass through fire ; nevertheless they must also be purified with the water for purification . Everything that can ’ t withstand fire you are to have go through the water .
CJB	Numbers	31	24	On the seventh day you are to wash your clothes , and you will be clean ; after that you may enter the camp. ” ( LY : iv )
CJB	Numbers	31	25	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	31	26	“ Take all the booty , both people and animals , you , El ‘ azar the cohen and the leaders of clans in the community ;
CJB	Numbers	31	27	and divide the booty into two parts : half for the experienced soldiers who went out to battle , and half for the rest of the community .
CJB	Numbers	31	28	From the portion of the soldiers who went out to battle , levy a tax for Adonai consisting of one-five-hundredth of the persons , cattle , donkeys and sheep ;
CJB	Numbers	31	29	take it from their half and give it to El ‘ azar the cohen as a portion set apart for Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	31	30	From the half that goes to the people of Isra ’ el , you are to take one-fiftieth of the persons , and of the cattle , donkeys and sheep , that is , of all the livestock ; and give them to the L ’ vi ’ im taking care of the tabernacle of Adonai. ”
CJB	Numbers	31	32	The booty , over and above the portion which the soldiers took , came to 675,000 sheep ,
CJB	Numbers	31	33	72,000 cattle ,
CJB	Numbers	31	34	61,000 donkeys ,
CJB	Numbers	31	35	and 32,000 persons in all , consisting of the women who had never slept with a man .
CJB	Numbers	31	36	The half which was the portion of the soldiers who went out to fight , numbered 337,500 sheep ,
CJB	Numbers	31	37	of which Adonai ’ s tribute was
CJB	Numbers	31	675	;
CJB	Numbers	31	38	36,000 cattle , of which Adonai ’ s tribute was seventy-two ;
CJB	Numbers	31	39	30,500 donkeys , of which Adonai ’ s tribute was sixty-one ;
CJB	Numbers	31	40	and 16,000 persons , of whom Adonai ’ s tribute was thirty-two persons .
CJB	Numbers	31	41	Moshe gave the tribute set apart for Adonai to El ‘ azar the cohen , as Adonai had ordered Moshe . ( LY : v )
CJB	Numbers	31	42	From the half that went to people of Isra ’ el , which Moshe separated from that of the men who had gone to fight —
CJB	Numbers	31	43	now the community ’ s half consisted of 337,500 sheep ,
CJB	Numbers	31	44	36,000 cattle ,
CJB	Numbers	31	45	30,500 donkeys
CJB	Numbers	31	46	and 16,000 persons —
CJB	Numbers	31	47	from the people of Isra ’ el ’ s half , Moshe took one-fiftieth of the persons and animals and gave them to the L ’ vi ’ im taking care of the tabernacle of Adonai , as Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	31	48	The officers in charge of the thousands who fought , the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds , approached Moshe
CJB	Numbers	31	49	and said to him , “ Your servants have counted all the soldiers under our command , and not one of us is missing .
CJB	Numbers	31	50	We have brought an offering for Adonai , what every man has obtained in the way of gold jewelry — armlets , bracelets , signet rings , earrings and belts — to make atonement for ourselves before Adonai. ”
CJB	Numbers	31	51	Moshe and El ‘ azar the cohen accepted their gold , all the jewelry .
CJB	Numbers	31	52	All the gold in this gift which the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds set apart for Adonai weighed
CJB	Numbers	31	420	pounds .
CJB	Numbers	31	53	For the soldiers had taken booty , every man for himself .
CJB	Numbers	31	54	Moshe and El ‘ azar the cohen took the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a reminder for the people of Isra ’ el before Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	32	32	We will cross over into the land of Kena ‘ an armed before Adonai , and the land we will possess for inheritance will be on this side of the Yarden. ”
CJB	Numbers	32	2	the descendants of Gad and of Re ’ uven came and spoke to Moshe , El ‘ azar the cohen and the community leaders . They said ,
CJB	Numbers	32	3	“ ‘ Atarot , Divon , Ya ‘ zer , Nimrah , Heshbon , El ‘ aleh , S ’ vam , N ’ vo and Be ‘ on ,
CJB	Numbers	32	4	the country that Adonai conquered before the community of Isra ’ el , is livestock country ; and your servants have livestock .
CJB	Numbers	32	5	If you regard us favorably , ” they went on , “ let this land be given to your servants as their possession ; and don ’ t have us cross the Yarden. ”
CJB	Numbers	32	6	Moshe answered the descendants of Gad and of Re ’ uven : “ Are your brothers to go to war while you stay here ?
CJB	Numbers	32	7	Besides , why are you trying to discourage the people of Isra ’ el from crossing into the land Adonai gave them ?
CJB	Numbers	32	8	This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the land .
CJB	Numbers	32	9	For when they went up to the Eshkol Valley and saw the land , they disheartened the people of Isra ’ el , so that they wouldn ’ t enter the land Adonai had given them .
CJB	Numbers	32	10	Adonai ’ s anger blazed up on that day ; and he swore ,
CJB	Numbers	32	11	‘ None of the people aged twenty or more who came out of Egypt will see the land I swore to Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov ; because they haven ’ t followed me unreservedly —
CJB	Numbers	32	12	except Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh the K ’ nizi and Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun , because they have followed Adonai unreservedly. ’
CJB	Numbers	32	13	Thus Adonai ’ s anger blazed against Isra ’ el , so that he made them wander here and there in the desert forty years , until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of Adonai had died out .
CJB	Numbers	32	14	Now you , another brood of sinners , have arisen in your fathers ’ place to increase still more the fierce anger of Adonai toward Isra ’ el !
CJB	Numbers	32	15	For if you turn away from him , he will leave them in the desert again , and thus you will cause the destruction of all these people ! ”
CJB	Numbers	32	16	But they came up to him and said , “ Here we will build enclosures for our livestock and cities for our little ones ,
CJB	Numbers	32	17	but we ourselves will be armed and ready for action to march at the head of the people of Isra ’ el , until we have brought them to their place . Our little ones will stay in the fortified cities here because of the people now living in the land .
CJB	Numbers	32	18	However , we will not return to our own homes until every man in Isra ’ el has taken possession of his land for inheritance .
CJB	Numbers	32	19	We will not have an inheritance with them on the other side of the Yarden , westward ; because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Yarden , eastward. ” ( RY : iv , LY : vii )
CJB	Numbers	32	20	Moshe said to them , “ If you will do this — if you will arm yourselves to go before Adonai to the war ,
CJB	Numbers	32	21	and if every one of your soldiers will cross the Yarden before Adonai , until he has driven out his enemies ahead of him ,
CJB	Numbers	32	22	and if the land has been conquered before Adonai , and only after that do you return — then you will be clear before Adonai and before Isra ’ el , and this land here will be yours to possess before Adonai .
CJB	Numbers	32	23	But if you will not do this , then you have sinned against Adonai , and you must understand that your sin will find you out .
CJB	Numbers	32	24	Build cities for your little ones and enclosures for your sheep ; then do what you said you would do. ”
CJB	Numbers	32	25	The descendants of Gad and the descendants of Re ’ uven said to Moshe , “ Your servants will do as my lord orders .
CJB	Numbers	32	26	Our little ones , wives , flocks and all our livestock will be there in the cities of Gil ‘ ad ;
CJB	Numbers	32	27	but your servants will cross over , every man armed for war , before Adonai to do battle , as my lord says. ”
CJB	Numbers	32	28	So Moshe gave orders concerning them to El ‘ azar the cohen , Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun and the clan leaders of the tribes of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	32	29	Moshe said to them , “ If the descendants of Gad and of Re ’ uven cross over the Yarden with you , every man armed for battle , before Adonai ; and if the land is conquered before you , then you are to give them the land of Gil ‘ ad as theirs to possess .
CJB	Numbers	32	30	But if they do not cross with you armed , they are to possess land along with you in Kena ‘ an. ”
CJB	Numbers	32	31	The descendants of Gad and of Re ’ uven answered , “ We will do as Adonai has said to your servants .
CJB	Numbers	32	33	So Moshe gave the descendants of Gad and of Re ’ uven , and also to the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh the son of Yosef , the kingdom of Sichon king of the Emori and the kingdom of ‘ Og king of Bashan — the country and its cities within its borders , along with their surrounding towns .
CJB	Numbers	32	34	The descendants of Gad built Divon , ‘ Atarot , ‘ Aro ‘ er ,
CJB	Numbers	32	35	‘ Atrot-Shofan , Ya ‘ zer , Yogbehah ,
CJB	Numbers	32	36	Beit-Nimrah and Beit-Haran — fortified cities ; and also enclosures for sheep .
CJB	Numbers	32	37	The descendants of Re ’ uven built Heshbon , El ‘ aleh , Kiryatayim ,
CJB	Numbers	32	38	N ’ vo , Ba ‘ al-M ‘ on ( these names have been changed ) and Sivmah ; they renamed the cities they built . ( LY : Maftir )
CJB	Numbers	32	39	The descendants of Machir the son of M ’ nasheh went to Gil ‘ ad and conquered it , dispossessing the Emori who were there .
CJB	Numbers	32	40	Moshe gave Gil ‘ ad to Machir the son of M ’ nasheh , and he lived in it .
CJB	Numbers	32	41	Ya ’ ir the son of M ’ nasheh went and captured its villages and called them Havot-Ya ’ ir [ villages of Ya ’ ir ] .
CJB	Numbers	32	42	Novach went and captured K ’ nat with its villages and named it Novach after himself . Haftarah Mattot : Yirmeyahu ( Jeremiah ) 1:1–2:3 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested reading for Parashah Mattot : Mattityahu ( Matthew ) 5:33–37

CJB	Numbers	33	42	They moved on from Tzalmonah and camped at Punon .
CJB	Numbers	33	2	Moshe recorded each of the stages of their journey by order of Adonai ; here are the starting-points of each stage :
CJB	Numbers	33	3	They began their journey from Ram ’ ses in the first month . On the fifteenth day of the first month , the morning after the Pesach , the people of Isra ’ el left proudly in view of all the Egyptians ;
CJB	Numbers	33	4	while the Egyptians were burying those among them whom Adonai had killed , all their firstborn ; Adonai had also executed judgment on their gods .
CJB	Numbers	33	5	The people of Isra ’ el moved on from Ram ’ ses and camped at Sukkot .
CJB	Numbers	33	6	They moved on from Sukkot and camped at Etam , by the edge of the desert .
CJB	Numbers	33	7	They moved on from Etam and turned back to Pi-Hachirot , in front of Ba ‘ al-Tz ’ fon , and camped before Migdol .
CJB	Numbers	33	8	They moved on from P ’ nei-Hachirot , passed through the sea to the desert , continued three days ’ journey into the Etam Desert and camped at Marah .
CJB	Numbers	33	9	They moved on from Marah and came to Eilim ; in Eilim were twelve springs and seventy palm trees , so they camped there .
CJB	Numbers	33	10	They moved on from Eilim and camped by the Sea of Suf . ( LY : ii )
CJB	Numbers	33	11	They moved on from the Sea of Suf and camped in the Seen Desert .

CJB	Numbers	33	32	They moved on from B ’ nei-Ya ‘ akan and camped at Hor-HaGidgad .
CJB	Numbers	33	34	They moved on from Yotvatah and camped at Avronah .
CJB	Numbers	33	35	They moved on from Avronah and camped at ‘ Etzyon-Gever .
CJB	Numbers	33	36	They moved on from ‘ Etzyon-Gever and camped in the Tzin Desert , that is , Kadesh .
CJB	Numbers	33	37	They moved on from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor , at the border of the land of Edom .
CJB	Numbers	33	38	At Adonai ’ s order Aharon the cohen went up on Mount Hor , and he died there on the first day of the fifth month of the fortieth year after the people of Isra ’ el had left the land of Egypt .
CJB	Numbers	33	39	Aharon was
CJB	Numbers	33	123	years old when he died on Mount Hor .
CJB	Numbers	33	40	The Kena ‘ ani king of ‘ Arad , who lived in the Negev in the land of Kena ‘ an , had heard that the people of Isra ’ el were coming ;
CJB	Numbers	33	41	so they moved on from Mount Hor and camped at Tzalmonah .
CJB	Numbers	33	44	They moved on from Ovot and camped ‘ Iyei-Ha ‘ Avarim , at the border of Mo ’ av .

CJB	Numbers	33	48	They moved on from the ‘ Avarim Range and camped in the plains of Mo ’ av by the Yarden , across from Yericho .
CJB	Numbers	33	49	Their camp by the Yarden extended from Beit-HaYeshimot all the way to Avel-HaSheetim in the plains of Mo ’ av . ( RY : v ; LY : iii )
CJB	Numbers	33	50	Adonai spoke to Moshe in the plains of Mo ’ av by the Yarden , across from Yericho . He said
CJB	Numbers	33	51	to tell the people of Isra ’ el , “ When you cross the Yarden into the land of Kena ‘ an ,
CJB	Numbers	33	52	you are to expel all the people living in the land from in front of you . Destroy all their stone figures , destroy all their metal statues and demolish all their high places .
CJB	Numbers	33	53	Drive out the inhabitants of the land , and live in it , for I have given the land to you to possess .
CJB	Numbers	33	54	You will inherit the land by lot according to your families . You are to give more land to the larger families and less to the smaller ones . Wherever the lot falls to any particular person , that will be his property . You will inherit according to the tribes of your ancestors .
CJB	Numbers	33	55	But if you don ’ t drive out the inhabitants of the land from in front of you , then those you allow to remain will become like thorns in your eyes and stings in your sides — they will harass you in the land where you are living .
CJB	Numbers	33	56	And in this event , I will do to you what I intended to do to them . ”
CJB	Numbers	34	34	Adonai told Moshe
CJB	Numbers	34	2	to give this order to the people of Isra ’ el : “ When you enter the land of Kena ‘ an , it will become your land to pass on as an inheritance , the land of Kena ‘ an as defined by these borders .
CJB	Numbers	34	3	“ Your southern portion will extend from the Tzin Desert close to the border of Edom . The eastern terminus of your southern border is at the end of the Dead Sea .
CJB	Numbers	34	4	From there your border turns , goes south of the ‘ Akrabbim Ascent and passes on to Tzin . From there it goes south of Kadesh-Barnea , on to Hatzar-Adar , and on to ‘ Atzmon .
CJB	Numbers	34	5	Then the border turns and goes from ‘ Atzmon to the Vadi of Egypt and along it to the Sea .
CJB	Numbers	34	6	“ Your western border will be the Great Sea .
CJB	Numbers	34	7	“ Your northern border will be as follows : from the Great Sea mark a line to Mount Hor ,
CJB	Numbers	34	8	and from Mount Hor mark a line to the entrance of Hamat . The border goes out to Tz ’ dad .
CJB	Numbers	34	9	Then the border goes to Zifron and finally to Hatzar- ‘ Einan ; this is your northern border .
CJB	Numbers	34	10	“ For the eastern border mark your line from Hatzar- ‘ Enan to Sh ’ fam .
CJB	Numbers	34	11	Then the border goes down from Sh ’ fam to Rivlah , on the east side of ‘ Ayin , then down until it hits the slope east of Lake Kinneret .
CJB	Numbers	34	12	From there it goes down the Yarden River till it flows into the Dead Sea . These will be the borders of your land. ”
CJB	Numbers	34	13	Moshe gave this order to the people of Isra ’ el : “ This is the land in which you will receive inheritances by lot , which Adonai has ordered to give to the nine tribes and the half-tribe .
CJB	Numbers	34	14	The tribe of the descendants of Re ’ uven have already received their land for inheritance according to their clans , and so have the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh .
CJB	Numbers	34	15	These two-and-a-half tribes have received their inheritance on this side of the Yarden , across from Yericho and eastward , toward the sunrise. ” ( RY : vi ; LY : iv )
CJB	Numbers	34	16	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	34	17	“ These are the names of the men who will take possession of the land for you : El ‘ azar the cohen and Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun .
CJB	Numbers	34	18	Also appoint one leader from each tribe to take possession of the land .
CJB	Numbers	34	19	The names of these men are : from the tribe of Y ’ hudah , Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh ;
CJB	Numbers	34	20	from the tribe of the descendants of Shim ‘ on , Sh ’ mu ’ el the son of ‘ Ammihud ;
CJB	Numbers	34	21	from the tribe of Binyamin , Elidad the son of Kislon ;
CJB	Numbers	34	22	from the tribe of the descendants of Dan , a leader , Buki the son of Yogli ;
CJB	Numbers	34	23	from the descendants of Yosef : from the tribe of the descendants of M ’ nasheh , a leader , Hani ’ el the son of Efod ;
CJB	Numbers	34	24	from the tribe of the descendants of Efrayim , a leader , K ’ mu ’ el the son of Shiftan ;
CJB	Numbers	34	25	from the tribe of the descendants of Z ’ vulun , a leader , Elitzafan the son of Parnakh ;
CJB	Numbers	34	26	from the tribe of the descendants of Yissakhar , a leader , Palti ’ el the son of ‘ Azan ;
CJB	Numbers	34	27	from the tribe of the descendants of Asher , a leader , Achihud the son of Shlomi ;
CJB	Numbers	34	28	from the tribe of the descendants of Naftali , a leader , P ’ dah ’ el the son of ‘ Ammihud. ”
CJB	Numbers	34	29	These are the ones whom Adonai ordered to divide the inheritance among the people of Isra ’ el in the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Numbers	35	35	( LY : v ) In the plains of Mo ’ av by the Yarden , across from Yericho , Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	35	2	“ Order the people of Isra ’ el to give to the L ’ vi ’ im cities to live in from the heritage they will possess , and you are also to give the L ’ vi ’ im some of the open land surrounding the cities .
CJB	Numbers	35	3	They are to have the cities to live in , while their open land will be for their livestock , for growing crops and for all their animals .
CJB	Numbers	35	4	The open land around the cities you give to the L ’ vi ’ im is to commence at a line drawn around the city wall 1,500 feet outside it and is to extend outward from there .
CJB	Numbers	35	5	Measure 3,000 feet outward from the city wall to the east , south , west and north , with the city in the center . The space between the 1,500-foot line and the 3,000-foot line will be their open land around the cities .
CJB	Numbers	35	6	The cities you give to the L ’ vi ’ im are to be the six cities of refuge to which you permit the person who kills someone to flee to ; plus an additional forty-two cities .
CJB	Numbers	35	7	Thus you will give the L ’ vi ’ im forty-eight cities , with their surrounding open land .
CJB	Numbers	35	8	As to the cities you will give from those the people of Isra ’ el possess , from the many you will take many , and from the few you will take few — each tribe will contribute from its cities to the L ’ vi ’ im in accordance with the size of its inheritance. ” ( RY : vii , LY : vi )
CJB	Numbers	35	9	Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Numbers	35	10	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ When you cross the Yarden into the land of Kena ‘ an ,
CJB	Numbers	35	11	you are to designate for yourselves cities that will be cities of refuge for you , to which anyone who kills someone by mistake can flee .
CJB	Numbers	35	12	These cities are to be a refuge for you from the dead person ’ s next-of-kin , who might otherwise avenge his kinsman ’ s death by slaying the killer prior to his standing trial before the community .
CJB	Numbers	35	13	In regard to the cities you are to give , there are to be six cities of refuge for you .
CJB	Numbers	35	14	You are to give three cities east of the Yarden and three cities in the land of Kena ‘ an ; they will be cities of refuge .
CJB	Numbers	35	15	These six cities will serve as refuge for the people of Isra ’ el , as well as for the foreigner and resident alien with them ; so that anyone who kills someone by mistake may flee there .
CJB	Numbers	35	16	“ ‘ However , if he hits him with an iron implement and thus causes his death , he is a murderer ; the murderer must be put to death .
CJB	Numbers	35	17	Or if he hits him with a stone in his hand big enough to kill someone , and he dies , he is a murderer ; the murderer must be put to death .
CJB	Numbers	35	18	Or if he hits him with a wood utensil in his hand capable of killing someone , and he dies , he is a murderer ; the murderer must be put to death .
CJB	Numbers	35	19	The next-of-kin avenger is to put the murderer to death himself — upon meeting him , he is to put him to death .
CJB	Numbers	35	20	Likewise , if he shoves him out of hatred ; or intentionally throws something at him , causing his death ;
CJB	Numbers	35	21	or out of hostility strikes him with his hand , so that he dies ; then the one who struck him must be put to death ; he is a murderer ; and the next-of-kin avenger is to put the murderer to death upon meeting him .
CJB	Numbers	35	22	“ ‘ But suppose he shoves him suddenly , but without hostility ; or he throws something at him unintentionally ;
CJB	Numbers	35	23	or , without seeing him , being his enemy or seeking to harm him , he throws a stone big enough to cause death ; and the person dies .
CJB	Numbers	35	24	Then the community is to judge between the one who struck him and the next-of-kin avenger in accordance with these rules ;
CJB	Numbers	35	25	and the community is to save the killer from the next-of-kin avenger . The community is to return him to the city of refuge to which he fled , and he is to live there until the cohen hagadol , who was anointed with the holy oil , dies .
CJB	Numbers	35	26	But if the killer ever goes beyond the limits of the city of refuge he fled to ,
CJB	Numbers	35	27	and the next-of-kin avenger finds him outside the limits of his city of refuge , and the avenger kills the killer , he will not be guilty of the man ’ s blood ;
CJB	Numbers	35	28	because he must stay in his city of refuge until the death of the cohen hagadol . But after the death of the cohen hagadol the killer may return to the land he owns .
CJB	Numbers	35	29	These things shall constitute your standard for judgment through all your generations , wherever you live .
CJB	Numbers	35	30	“ ‘ If anyone kills someone , the murderer is to be put to death upon the testimony of witnesses ; but the testimony of only one witness will not suffice to cause a person to be put to death .
CJB	Numbers	35	31	Also , you are not to accept a ransom in lieu of the life of a murderer condemned to death ; rather , he must be put to death .
CJB	Numbers	35	32	Likewise , you are not to accept for someone who has fled to his city of refuge a ransom that would allow him to return to his land before the death of the cohen .
CJB	Numbers	35	33	In this way you will not defile the land in which you are living . For blood defiles the land , and in this land no atonement can be made for the blood shed in it except the blood of him who shed it .
CJB	Numbers	35	34	No , you are not to defile the land in which you live and in which I live ; for I , Adonai , live among the people of Isra ’ el . ’ ”
CJB	Numbers	36	36	( LY : vii ) The leaders of the clans of the family of the descendants of Gil ‘ ad , the son of Machir , the son of M ’ nasheh , of the families of the descendants of Yosef , approached and addressed Moshe and the leaders , the heads of the clans of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Numbers	36	2	They said , “ Adonai ordered my lord to give by lot the land to be inherited by the people of Isra ’ el , and my lord was ordered by Adonai to give the inheritance of our kinsman Tz ’ lof ’ chad to his daughters .
CJB	Numbers	36	3	But if they get married to anyone belonging to another of the tribes of the people of Isra ’ el , then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our ancestors and be added to the inheritance of the tribe they will then belong to ; thus it will be taken away from the sum total of our inheritance .
CJB	Numbers	36	4	And when the yovel of the people of Isra ’ el comes , their inheritance will be added to the land possessed by the tribe they will then belong to and be subtracted from the inheritance belonging to the tribe of our ancestors. ”
CJB	Numbers	36	5	Moshe gave this order to the people of Isra ’ el , in keeping with the word of Adonai : “ The tribe of the descendants of Yosef is right in what it says .
CJB	Numbers	36	6	Here is what Adonai has ordered concerning the daughters of Tz ’ lof ’ chad : ‘ Let them be married to whomever they think best , but they must marry only into a family from their father ’ s tribe .
CJB	Numbers	36	7	In this way no inheritance of the people of Isra ’ el will move from one tribe to another ; for each of the people of Isra ’ el is to hold on to the land for inheritance belonging to his father ’ s tribe .
CJB	Numbers	36	8	Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of Isra ’ el is to become the wife of someone from the family of her father ’ s tribe , so that every one of the people of Isra ’ el will stay in possession of his ancestors ’ inheritance .
CJB	Numbers	36	9	Thus no inheritance will move from one tribe to another , for each of the tribes of the people of Isra ’ el will hold on to its own inheritance. ” ( Maftir )
CJB	Numbers	36	10	The daughters of Tz ’ lof ’ chad did as Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Numbers	36	11	Machlah , Tirtzah , Hoglah , Milkah and No ‘ ah all got married to sons of their father ’ s brothers .
CJB	Numbers	36	12	They were married into the families of the descendants of M ’ nasheh the son of Yosef , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father ’ s family .
CJB	Numbers	36	13	These are the mitzvot and rulings which Adonai gave through Moshe to the people of Isra ’ el in the plains of Mo ’ av by the Yarden , across from Yericho . Haftarah Masa ‘ ei : Yirmeyahu ( Jeremiah ) 2:4–28 ; 3:4 ( A ) ; 2:4–28 ; 4:1–2 ( S ) B ’ rit Hadashah suggested reading for Parashah Mattot : Ya ‘ akov ( James ) 4:1–12 Hazak , hazak , v ’ nit ’ chazek ! Be strong , be strong , and let us be strengthened !
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the words Moshe spoke to all Isra ’ el on the far side of the Yarden River , in the desert , in the ‘ Aravah , across from Suf , between Pa ’ ran and Tofel , Lavan , Hatzerot and Di-Zahav .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	44	where the Emori living in that hill-country came out against you like bees , defeated you in Se ‘ ir and chased you back all the way to Hormah .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	2	It is eleven days ’ journey from Horev to Kadesh-Barnea by way of Mount Se ‘ ir .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	3	On the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year , Moshe spoke to the people of Isra ’ el , reviewing everything Adonai had ordered him to tell them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	4	This was after he had defeated Sichon , king of the Emori , who lived in Heshbon , and ‘ Og , king of Bashan , who lived in ‘ Ashtarot , at Edre ‘ i .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	5	There , beyond the Yarden , in the land of Mo ’ av , Moshe took it upon himself to expound this Torah and said :
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	6	“ Adonai spoke to us in Horev . He said , ‘ You have lived long enough by this mountain .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	7	Turn , get moving and go to the hill-country of the Emori and all the places near there in the ‘ Aravah , the hill-country , the Sh ’ felah , the Negev and by the seashore — the land of the Kena ‘ ani , and the L ’ vanon , as far as the great river , the Euphrates River .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	8	I have set the land before you ! Go in , and take possession of the land Adonai swore to give to your ancestors Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov , and their descendants after them. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	9	“ At that time I told you , ‘ You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	10	Adonai your God has multiplied your numbers , so that there are as many of you today as there are stars in the sky .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	11	May Adonai , the God of your ancestors , increase you yet a thousandfold and bless you , as he has promised you ! ( ii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	12	But you are burdensome , bothersome and quarrelsome ! How can I bear it by myself alone ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	13	Pick for yourselves from each of your tribes men who are wise , understanding and knowledgeable ; and I will make them heads over you. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	14	“ You answered me , ‘ What you have said would be a good thing for us to do. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I took the heads of your tribes , men wise and knowledgable , and made them heads over you — leaders in charge of thousands , of hundreds , of fifties and of tens , and officers , tribe by tribe .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	16	At that time I commissioned your judges , ‘ Hear the cases that arise between your brothers ; and judge fairly between a man and his brother , and the foreigner who is with him .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	17	You are not to show favoritism when judging , but give equal attention to the small and to the great . No matter how a person presents himself , don ’ t be afraid of him ; because the decision is God ’ s . The case that is too hard for you , bring to me and I will hear it. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	18	I also gave you orders at that time concerning all the things you were to do .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	19	“ So we left Horev and went through all that vast and fearsome desert which you saw on the way to the hill-country of the Emori , as Adonai our God ordered us ; and we arrived at Kadesh-Barnea .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	20	There I said to you , ‘ You have come to the hill-country of the Emori , which Adonai our God is giving to us .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	21	Look ! Adonai your God has placed the land before you . Go up , take possession , as Adonai , the God of your ancestors , has told you . Don ’ t be afraid , don ’ t be dismayed. ’ ( iii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	22	“ You approached me , every one of you , and said , ‘ Let ’ s send men ahead of us to explore the country for us and bring back word concerning what route we should use in going up and what the cities we will encounter are like. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	23	The idea seemed good to me , so I took twelve of your men , one from each tribe ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	24	and they set out , went up into the hills , came to the Eshkol Valley and reconnoitered it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	25	They took some of the produce of the land and brought it down to us ; they also brought back word to us — ‘ The land Adonai our God is giving to us is good. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	26	“ But you would not go up . Instead you rebelled against the order of Adonai your God ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	27	and in your tents you complained , ‘ It ’ s because Adonai hated us that he has brought us out of the land of Egypt , only to hand us over to the Emori to destroy us .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	28	What sort of place is it that we ’ re heading for ? Our brothers made our courage fail when they said , “ The people are bigger and taller than we are ; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky ; and finally , we have seen ‘ Anakim there. ” ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	29	“ I answered you , ‘ Don ’ t be fearful , don ’ t be afraid of them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	30	Adonai your God , who is going ahead of you , will fight on your behalf , just as he accomplished all those things for you in Egypt before your eyes ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	31	and likewise in the desert , where you saw how Adonai your God carried you , like a man carries his child , along the entire way you traveled until you arrived at this place .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	32	Yet in this matter you don ’ t trust Adonai your God ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	33	even though he went ahead of you , seeking out places for you to pitch your tents and showing you which way to go , by fire at night and by a cloud during the day. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	34	“ Adonai heard what you were saying , became angry and swore ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	35	‘ Not a single one of these people , this whole evil generation , will see the good land I swore to give to your ancestors ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	36	except Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh — he will see it ; I will give him and his descendants the land he walked on , because he has fully followed Adonai. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	37	“ Also , because of you Adonai was angry with me and said , ‘ You too will not go in there .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	38	Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun , your assistant — he will go in there . So encourage him , because he will enable Isra ’ el to take possession of it . ( iv )
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	39	Moreover , your little ones , who you said would be taken as booty , and your children who don ’ t yet know good from bad — they will go in there ; I will give it to them , and they will have possession of it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	40	But as for yourselves , turn around and head into the desert by the road to the Sea of Suf. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	41	“ Then you answered me , ‘ We have sinned against Adonai . Now we will go up and fight , in accordance with everything Adonai our God ordered us. ’ And every man among you put on his arms , considering it an easy matter to go up into the hill-country .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	42	But Adonai said to me , ‘ Tell them , “ Don ’ t go up , and don ’ t fight , because I am not there with you ; if you do , your enemies will defeat you. ” ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	43	So I told you , but you wouldn ’ t listen . Instead , you rebelled against Adonai ’ s order , took matters into your own hands and went up into the hill-country ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	45	You returned and cried before Adonai , but Adonai neither listened to what you said nor paid you any attention .
CJB	Deuteronomy	1	46	This is why you had to stay in Kadesh as long as you did .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	2	Finally Adonai said to me ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	3	‘ You have been going around this mountain long enough ! Head north ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	4	and give this order to the people : “ You are to pass through the territory of your kinsmen the descendants of ‘ Esav who live in Se ‘ ir . They will be afraid of you , so be very cautious ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	5	and don ’ t get into disputes with them ; for I am not going to give you any of their land , no , not even enough for one foot to stand on ; inasmuch as I have given Mount Se ‘ ir to ‘ Esav as his possession .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	6	Pay them money for the food you eat , and pay them money for the water you drink .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	7	For Adonai your God has blessed you in everything your hands have produced . He knows that you have been traveling through this vast desert ; these forty years Adonai your God has been with you ; and you have lacked nothing. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	8	“ So we went on past our kinsmen the descendants of ‘ Esav living in Se ‘ ir , left the road through the ‘ Aravah from Eilat and ‘ Etzyon-Gever , and turned to pass along the road through the desert of Mo ’ av .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	9	Adonai said to me , ‘ Don ’ t be hostile toward Mo ’ av or fight with them , because I will not give you any of their land to possess , since I have already given ‘ Ar to the descendants of Lot as their territory. ’ ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	10	( The Emim used to live there , a great and numerous people as tall as the ‘ Anakim .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	11	They are also considered Refa ’ im , as are the ‘ Anakim , but the Mo ’ avim call them Emim .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	12	In Se ‘ ir the Horim used to live , but the descendants of ‘ Esav dispossessed and destroyed them , settling in their place . Isra ’ el did similarly in the land it came to possess , which Adonai gave to them . )
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	13	“ ‘ Now get going , and cross Vadi Zered ! ’ “ So we crossed Vadi Zered .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	14	The time between our leaving Kadesh-Barnea and our crossing Vadi Zered was thirty-eight years — until the whole generation of men capable of bearing arms had been eliminated from the camp , as Adonai had sworn they would be .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	15	Moreover , Adonai ’ s hand was against them to root them out of the camp until the last of them was gone .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	16	When all the men who were able to bear arms had died and were no longer part of the people ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	17	Adonai said to me ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	18	‘ Today you are to cross the border of Mo ’ av at ‘ Ar .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	19	When you approach the descendants of ‘ Amon , don ’ t bother them or fight with them , for I will not give you any of the territory of the people of ‘ Amon to possess , since I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their territory. ’ ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	20	( This too is considered a land of the Refa ’ im : Refa ’ im , whom the Emori call Zamzumim , used to live there .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	21	They were a large , numerous people , as tall as the ‘ Anakim ; but Adonai destroyed them as the people of ‘ Amon advanced and settled in their place —
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	22	just as he destroyed the Horim as descendants of ‘ Esav advanced into Se ‘ ir and settled in their place , where they live to this day .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	23	It was the same with the ‘ Avim , who lived in villages as far away as ‘ Azah — the Kaftorim , coming from Kaftor , destroyed them and settled in their place . )
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	24	“ ‘ Get up , get moving , and cross the Arnon Valley ! Here , I have put in your hands Sichon the Emori , king of Heshbon , and his land ; commence the conquest , begin the battle !
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	25	Today I will start putting the fear and dread of you into all the peoples under heaven , so that the mere mention of your name will make them quake and tremble before you. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	26	“ I sent envoys from the K ’ demot Desert to Sichon king of Heshbon with a peaceable message ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	27	‘ Let me pass through your land . I will keep to the road , turning neither right nor left .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	28	You will sell me food to eat for money and give me water to drink for money . I only want to pass through .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	29	Do as the people of ‘ Esav living in Se ‘ ir and the Mo ’ avim living in ‘ Ar did with me , until I cross the Yarden into the land Adonai our God is giving us. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	30	“ But Sichon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through his territory , because Adonai your God had hardened his spirit and made him stubborn , so that he could hand him over to you , as is the case today . ( vi )
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	31	Adonai said to me , ‘ See , I have begun handing over Sichon and his territory before you ; start taking possession of his land. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	32	Then Sichon came out against us , he and all his people , to fight at Yahatz ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	33	and Adonai our God handed him over to us , so that we defeated him , his sons and all his people .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	34	At that time we captured all his cities and completely destroyed every city — men , women , little ones — we left none of them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	35	As booty for ourselves we took only the cattle , along with the spoil from the cities we had captured .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	36	From ‘ Aro ‘ er , on the edge of the Arnon Valley , and from the city in the valley , all the way to Gil ‘ ad , there was not one city too well fortified for us to capture — Adonai our God gave all of them to us .
CJB	Deuteronomy	2	37	The only land you didn ’ t approach was that of the descendants of ‘ Amon — the region around the Yabok River , the cities in the hills and wherever else Adonai our God forbade us to go .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	3	So Adonai our God also handed over to us ‘ Og the king of Bashan with all his people , and we defeated him until he had no one left .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	2	Adonai said to me , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid of him ; for I have handed him , all his people and his territory over to you ; you will do to him as you did to Sichon king of the Emori , who lived at Heshbon. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	4	At that time we captured all his cities ; there was not one city of theirs that we didn ’ t capture . There were sixty cities , all the region of Argov , the kingdom of ‘ Og in Bashan ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	5	all of them fortified cities with high walls , gates and bars — in addition to a great number of unwalled towns .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	6	We completely destroyed them , as we did with Sichon king of Heshbon , annihilating every city —men , women and little ones .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	7	But we took all the livestock , along with the spoil from the cities , as booty for ourselves .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	8	“ At that time we captured the territory of the two kings of the Emori east of the Yarden between the Arnon Valley and Mount Hermon , ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	9	the Hermon which the Tzidonim call Siryon and the Emori call S ’ nir ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	10	“ all the cities of the plain , all Gil ‘ ad and all Bashan , as far as Salkhah and Edre ‘ i , cities of the kingdom of ‘ Og in Bashan. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	11	‘ Og king of Bashan was the last survivor of the Refa ’ im . His bed was made of iron ; it is still in Rabbah with the people of ‘ Amon . It was nine cubits long and four cubits wide , using the normal cubit [ thirteen-and-a-half by six feet ] .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	12	“ Of this land that we took possession of then , I assigned to the Re ’ uveni and the Gadi the territory extending from ‘ Aro ‘ er along the Arnon Valley together with half the hill-country of Gil ‘ ad , including its cities .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	13	The rest of Gil ‘ ad and all Bashan , the kingdom of ‘ Og , I gave to the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh. ” The whole region of Argov together with all of Bashan form what is called the land of Refa ’ im .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	14	Ya ’ ir the son of M ’ nasheh took all the region of Argov , as far as the border with the G ’ shuri and the Ma ‘ akhati ; he named this whole area , including Bashan , after himself — it remains Havot-Ya ’ ir to this day . ( vii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	15	“ I gave Gil ‘ ad to Machir ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	16	and to the Re ’ uveni and the Gadi I gave the territory from Gil ‘ ad to the Arnon Valley , with the middle of the valley as the border , as far as the Yabok River , which is the border with the people of ‘ Amon ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	17	the ‘ Aravah too , the Yarden being its border , from Kinneret to the Sea of the ‘ Aravah , the Dead Sea , at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah to the east .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	18	“ At that time I gave you this order : ‘ Adonai your God has given you this land to possess . But all of you who are fit to fight must cross over , armed , ahead of your brothers the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	19	Your wives , your little ones and your livestock — I know you have much livestock — will stay in your cities which I have given you , ( Maftir )
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	20	until Adonai allows your brothers to rest , as he has allowed you ; and they too take possession of the land Adonai your God is giving them on the west side of the Yarden . At that point you will return , each man to his own possession which I have given you. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	21	“ Also at that time I gave this order to Y ’ hoshua : ‘ Your eyes have seen everything that Adonai your God has done to these two kings . Adonai will do the same to all the kingdoms you encounter when you cross over .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	22	Don ’ t be afraid of them , because Adonai your God will fight on your behalf. ’ Haftarah D ’ varim : Yesha ‘ yahu ( Isaiah ) 1:1–27 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah D ’ varim : Yochanan ( John ) 15:1–11 ; Messianic Jews ( Hebrews ) 3:7–4:11 Parashah
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	45	: Va ’ etchanan ( I pleaded ) 3:23–7:11
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	23	“ Then I pleaded with Adonai ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	24	‘ Adonai Elohim , you have begun to reveal your greatness to your servant , and your strong hand — for what other god is there in heaven or on earth that can do the works and mighty deeds that you do ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	25	Please ! Let me go across and see the good land on the other side of the Yarden , that wonderful hill-country and the L ’ vanon ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	26	But Adonai was angry with me on account of you , and he didn ’ t listen to me . Adonai said to me , ‘ Enough from you ! Don ’ t say another word to me about this matter !
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	27	Climb up to the top of Pisgah and look out to the west , north , south and east . Look with your eyes — but you will not go across this Yarden .
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	28	However , commission Y ’ hoshua , encourage him and strengthen him ; for he will lead this people across and enable them to inherit the land that you will see. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	3	29	So we stayed in the valley across from Beit-P ‘ or .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	4	but you who stuck with Adonai your God are still alive today , every one of you . ( ii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	2	In order to obey the mitzvot of Adonai your God which I am giving you , do not add to what I am saying , and do not subtract from it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	3	You saw with your own eyes what Adonai did at Ba ‘ al-P ‘ or , that Adonai destroyed from among you all the men who followed Ba ‘ al-P ‘ or ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	5	Look , I have taught you laws and rulings , just as Adonai my God ordered me , so that you can behave accordingly in the land where you are going in order to take possession of it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	6	Therefore , observe them ; and follow them ; for then all peoples will see you as having wisdom and understanding . When they hear of all these laws , they will say , ‘ This great nation is surely a wise and understanding people. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	7	For what great nation is there that has God as close to them as Adonai our God is , whenever we call on him ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	8	What great nation is there that has laws and rulings as just as this entire Torah which I am setting before you today ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	9	Only be careful , and watch yourselves diligently as long as you live , so that you won ’ t forget what you saw with your own eyes , so that these things won ’ t vanish from your hearts . Rather , make them known to your children and grandchildren —
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	10	the day you stood before Adonai your God at Horev , when Adonai said to me , ‘ Gather the people to me , and I will make them hear my very words , so that they will learn to hold me in awe as long as they live on earth , and so that they will teach their children. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	11	You approached and stood at the foot of the mountain ; and the mountain blazed with fire to the heart of heaven , with darkness , clouds and thick mist .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	12	Then Adonai spoke to you out of the fire ! You heard the sound of words but saw no shape , there was only a voice .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	13	He proclaimed his covenant to you , which he ordered you to obey , the Ten Words ; and he wrote them on two stone tablets .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	14	At that time Adonai ordered me to teach you laws and rulings , so that you would live by them in the land you are entering in order to take possession of it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	15	“ Therefore , watch out for yourselves ! Since you did not see a shape of any kind on the day Adonai spoke to you in Horev from the fire ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	16	do not become corrupt and make yourselves a carved image having the shape of any figure — not a representation of a human being , male or female ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	17	or a representation of any animal on earth , or a representation of any bird that flies in the air ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	18	or a representation of anything that creeps along on the ground , or a representation of any fish in the water below the shoreline .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	19	For the same reason , do not look up at the sky , at the sun , moon , stars and everything in the sky , and be drawn away to worship and serve them ; Adonai your God has allotted these to all the peoples under the entire sky .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	20	No , you Adonai has taken and brought out of the smelting furnace , out of Egypt , to be a people of inheritance for him , as you are today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	21	“ But Adonai was angry with me on account of you and swore that I would not cross the Yarden and go into that good land , which Adonai your God is giving you to inherit .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	22	Rather , I must die in this land and not cross the Yarden ; but you are to cross and take possession of that good land .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	23	Watch out for yourselves , so that you won ’ t forget the covenant of Adonai your God , which he made with you , and make yourself a carved image , a representation of anything forbidden to you by Adonai your God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	24	For Adonai your God is a consuming fire , a jealous God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	25	“ When you have had children and grandchildren , lived a long time in the land , become corrupt and made a carved image , a representation of something , and thus done what is evil in the sight of Adonai your God and provoked him ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	26	I call on the sky and the earth to witness against you today that you will quickly disappear from the land that you are crossing the Yarden to possess . You will not prolong your days there but will be completely destroyed .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	27	Adonai will scatter you among the peoples ; and among the nations to which Adonai will lead you away , you will be left few in number .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	28	There you will serve gods which are the product of human hands , made of wood and stone , which can ’ t see , hear , eat or smell .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	29	However , from there you will seek Adonai your God ; and you will find him if you search after him with all your heart and being .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	30	In your distress , when all these things have come upon you , in the acharit-hayamim , you will return to Adonai your God and listen to what he says ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	31	for Adonai your God is a merciful God . He will not fail you , destroy you , or forget the covenant with your ancestors which he swore to them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	32	“ Indeed , inquire about the past , before you were born : since the day God created human beings on the earth , from one end of heaven to the other , has there ever been anything as wonderful as this ? Has anyone heard anything like it ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	33	Did any other people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of a fire , as you have heard , and stay alive ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	34	Or has God ever tried to go and take for himself a nation from the very bowels of another nation , by means of ordeals , signs , wonders , war , a mighty hand , an outstretched arm and great terrors — like all that Adonai your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	35	This was shown to you , so that you would know that Adonai is God , and there is no other beside him .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	36	From heaven he caused you to hear his voice , in order to instruct you ; and on earth he caused you to see his great fire ; and you heard his very words coming out from the fire .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	37	Because he loved your ancestors , chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt with his presence and great power ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	38	in order to drive out ahead of you nations greater and stronger than you , so that he could bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance , as is the case today ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	39	know today , and establish it in your heart , that Adonai is God in heaven above and on earth below — there is no other .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	40	Therefore , you are to keep his laws and mitzvot which I am giving you today , so that it will go well with you and with your children after you , and so that you will prolong your days in the land Adonai your God is giving you forever. ” ( A : iii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	41	Then Moshe separated three cities on the east side of the Yarden , toward the sunrise ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	42	to which a killer might flee , that is , someone who kills by mistake a person whom he did not previously hate , and upon fleeing to one of these cities might live there .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	43	The cities were Betzer in the desert , in the flatland , for the Re ’ uveni ; Ramot in Gil ‘ ad for the Gadi ; and Golan in Bashan for the M ’ nashi .
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	44	This is the Torah which Moshe placed before the people of Isra ’ el —
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	45	these are the instructions , laws and rulings which Moshe presented to the people of Isra ’ el after they had come out of Egypt —
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	46	beyond the Yarden River , in the valley across from Beit-P ‘ or , in the land of Sichon king of the Emori , who lived at Heshbon , whom Moshe and the people of Isra ’ el defeated when they came out of Egypt ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	47	and they took possession of his land and the land of ‘ Og king of Bashan , the two kings of the Emori , who were beyond the Yarden toward the sunrise ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	48	from ‘ Aro ‘ er on the edge of the Arnon Valley to Mount Si ’ on , ” that is , Mount Hermon ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	4	49	“ with all the ‘ Aravah beyond the Yarden eastward , all the way to the Dead Sea at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah .
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	5	At that time I stood between Adonai and you in order to tell you what Adonai was saying ; because , on account of the fire , you were afraid and wouldn ’ t go up onto the mountain . He said , א
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	2	Adonai our God made a covenant with us at Horev .
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	3	Adonai did not make this covenant with our fathers , but with us — with us , who are all of us here alive today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	4	Adonai spoke with you face to face from the fire on the mountain .
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	6	“ ‘ I am Adonai your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , where you lived as slaves . ב
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	7	“ ‘ You are to have no other gods before me .
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	8	You are not to make for yourselves a carved image or any kind of representation of anything in heaven above , on the earth beneath or in the water below the shoreline —
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	9	you are not to bow down to them or serve them ; for I , Adonai your God , am a jealous God , punishing the children for the sins of the parents , also the third and fourth generation of those who hate me ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	10	but displaying grace to the thousandth generation of those who love me and obey my mitzvot . ג
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	11	“ ‘ You are not to misuse the name of Adonai your God , because Adonai will not leave unpunished someone who misuses his name . ד
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	12	“ ‘ Observe the day of Shabbat , to set it apart as holy , as Adonai your God ordered you to do .
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	13	You have six days to labor and do all your work ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	14	but the seventh day is a Shabbat for Adonai your God . On it you are not to do any kind of work — not you , your son or your daughter , not your male or female slave , not your ox , your donkey or any of your other livestock , and not the foreigner staying with you inside the gates to your property — so that your male and female servants can rest just as you do .
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	15	You are to remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt , and Adonai your God brought you out from there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm . Therefore Adonai your God has ordered you to keep the day of Shabbat . ה
CJB	Deuteronomy	5	16	“ ‘ Honor your father and mother , as Adonai your God ordered you to do , so that you will live long and have things go well with you in the land Adonai your God is giving you . ו

CJB	Deuteronomy	6	6	These words , which I am ordering you today , are to be on your heart ;

CJB	Deuteronomy	6	4	“ Sh ’ ma , Yisra ’ el ! Adonai Eloheinu , Adonai echad [ Hear , Isra ’ el ! Adonai our God , Adonai is one ] ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	5	and you are to love Adonai your God with all your heart , all your being and all your resources .

CJB	Deuteronomy	6	8	Tie them on your hand as a sign , put them at the front of a headband around your forehead ,

CJB	Deuteronomy	6	11	houses full of all sorts of good things , which you didn ’ t fill ; water cisterns dug out , which you didn ’ t dig ; vineyards and olive trees , which you didn ’ t plant — and you have eaten your fill ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	12	then be careful not to forget Adonai , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , where you lived as slaves .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	13	You are to fear Adonai your God , serve him and swear by his name .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	14	You are not to follow other gods , chosen from the gods of the peoples around you ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	15	because Adonai , your God , who is here with you , is a jealous God . If you do , the anger of Adonai your God will flare up against you and he will destroy you from the face of the earth .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	16	Do not put Adonai your God to the test , as you tested him at Massah [ testing ] .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	17	Observe diligently the mitzvot of Adonai your God , and his instructions and laws which he has given you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	18	You are to do what is right and good in the sight of Adonai , so that things will go well with you , and you will enter and possess the good land Adonai swore to your ancestors ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	19	expelling all your enemies ahead of you , as Adonai said .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	20	“ Some day your child will ask you , ‘ What is the meaning of the instructions , laws and rulings which Adonai our God has laid down for you ? ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	21	Then you will tell your child , ‘ We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt , and Adonai brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	22	Adonai worked great and terrible signs and wonders against Egypt , Pharaoh and all his household , before our very eyes .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	23	He brought us out from there in order to bring us to the land he had sworn to our ancestors that he would give us .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	24	Adonai ordered us to observe all these laws , to fear Adonai our God , always for our own good , so that he might keep us alive , as we are today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	6	25	It will be righteousness for us if we are careful to obey all these mitzvot before Adonai our God , just as he ordered us to do . ’ ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	7	Adonai didn ’ t set his heart on you or choose you because you numbered more than any other people — on the contrary , you were the fewest of all peoples .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	2	When he does this , when Adonai your God hands them over ahead of you , and you defeat them , you are to destroy them completely ! Do not make any covenant with them . Show them no mercy .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	3	Don ’ t intermarry with them — don ’ t give your daughter to his son , and don ’ t take his daughter for your son .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	4	For he will turn your children away from following me in order to serve other gods . If this happens , the anger of Adonai will flare up against you , and he will quickly destroy you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	5	No , treat them this way : break down their altars , smash their standing-stones to pieces , cut down their sacred poles and burn up their carved images completely .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	6	For you are a people set apart as holy for Adonai your God . Adonai your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his own unique treasure .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	8	Rather , it was because Adonai loved you , and because he wanted to keep the oath which he had sworn to your ancestors , that Adonai brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from a life of slavery under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt . ( Maftir )
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	9	From this you can know that Adonai your God is indeed God , the faithful God , who keeps his covenant and extends grace to those who love him and observe his mitzvot , to a thousand generations .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	10	But he repays those who hate him to their face and destroys them . He will not be slow to deal with someone who hates him ; he will repay him to his face .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	11	Therefore , you are to keep the mitzvot , laws and rulings which I am giving you today , and obey them . Haftarah Va ’ etchanan : Yesha ‘ yahu ( Isaiah ) 40:1–26 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Va ’ etchanan : Mattityahu ( Matthew ) 4:1–11 ; 22:33–40 ; Mark 12:28–34 ; Luke 4:1–13 ; 10:25–37 ; Acts 13:13–43 ; Romans 3:27–31 ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	1	Timothy 2:4–6 ; Ya ‘ akov ( James ) 2:14–26 ; and all the readings for Parashah
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	17	If you think to yourselves , ‘ These nations outnumber us ; how can we dispossess them ? ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	46	: ‘ Ekev ( Because ) 7:12–11:25
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	12	“ Because you are listening to these rulings , keeping and obeying them , Adonai your God will keep with you the covenant and mercy that he swore to your ancestors .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	13	He will love you , bless you and increase your numbers ; he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground — your grain , wine , olive oil and the young of your cattle and sheep — in the land he swore to your ancestors that he would give you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	14	You will be blessed more than all other peoples ; there will not be a sterile male or female among you , and the same with your livestock .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	15	Adonai will remove all illness from you — he will not afflict you with any of Egypt ’ s dreadful diseases , which you have known ; instead , he will lay them on those who hate you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	16	You are to devour all the peoples that Adonai your God hands over to you — show them no pity , and do not serve their gods , because that will become a trap for you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	18	nevertheless , you are not to be afraid of them ; you are to remember well what Adonai your God did to Pharaoh and all of Egypt —
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	19	the great ordeals which you yourself saw , and the signs , wonders , strong hand and outstretched arm by which Adonai your God brought you out . Adonai will do the same to all the peoples of whom you are afraid .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	20	Moreover , Adonai your God will send the hornet among them until those who are left and those who hide themselves perish ahead of you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	21	You are not to be frightened of them , because Adonai your God is there with you , a God great and fearsome .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	22	Adonai your God will expel those nations ahead of you little by little ; you can ’ t put an end to them all at once , or the wild animals will become too numerous for you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	23	Nevertheless , Adonai your God will give them over to you , sending one disaster after another upon them until they have been destroyed .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	24	He will hand their kings over to you , and you will wipe out their name from under heaven ; none of them will be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	25	You are to burn up completely the carved statues of their gods . Don ’ t be greedy for the silver or gold on them ; don ’ t take it with you , or you will be trapped by it ; for it is abhorrent to Adonai your God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	7	26	Don ’ t bring something abhorrent into your house , or you will share in the curse that is on it ; instead , you are to detest it completely , loathe it utterly ; for it is set apart for destruction .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	8	It is a land of wheat and barley , grapevines , fig trees and pomegranates ; a land of olive oil and honey ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	2	You are to remember everything of the way in which Adonai led you these forty years in the desert , humbling and testing you in order to know what was in your heart — whether you would obey his mitzvot or not .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	3	He humbled you , allowing you to become hungry , and then fed you with man , which neither you nor your ancestors had ever known , to make you understand that a person does not live on food alone but on everything that comes from the mouth of Adonai .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	4	During these forty years the clothing you were wearing didn ’ t grow old , and your feet didn ’ t swell up .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	5	Think deeply about it : Adonai was disciplining you , just as a man disciplines his child .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	6	So obey the mitzvot of Adonai your God , living as he directs and fearing him .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	7	For Adonai your God is bringing you into a good land , a land with streams , springs and water welling up from the depths in valleys and on hillsides .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	9	a land where you will eat food in abundance and lack nothing in it ; a land where the stones contain iron and the hills can be mined for copper .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	10	So you will eat and be satisfied , and you will bless Adonai your God for the good land he has given you . ( ii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	11	“ Be careful not to forget Adonai your God by not obeying his mitzvot , rulings and regulations that I am giving you today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	12	Otherwise , after you have eaten and are satisfied , built fine houses and lived in them ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	13	and increased your herds , flocks , silver , gold and everything else you own ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	14	you will become proud-hearted . Forgetting Adonai your God — who brought you out of the land of Egypt , where you lived as slaves ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	15	who led you through the vast and fearsome desert , with its poisonous snakes , scorpions and waterless , thirsty ground ; who brought water out of flint rock for you ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	16	who fed you in the desert with man , unknown to your ancestors ; all the while humbling and testing you in order to do you good in the end —
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	17	you will think to yourself , ‘ My own power and the strength of my own hand have gotten me this wealth. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	18	No , you are to remember Adonai your God , because it is he who is giving you the power to get wealth , in order to confirm his covenant , which he swore to your ancestors , as is happening even today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	19	If you forget Adonai your God , follow other gods and serve and worship them , I am warning you in advance today that you will certainly perish .
CJB	Deuteronomy	8	20	You will perish just like the nations that Adonai is causing to perish ahead of you , because you will not have heeded the voice of Adonai your God . ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	9	I had gone up the mountain to receive the stone tablets , the tablets on which was written the covenant Adonai had made with you . I stayed on the mountain forty days and nights without eating food or drinking water .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	2	a people great and tall , the ‘ Anakim , whom you know about and of whom you have heard it said , ‘ Who can stand before the descendants of ‘ Anak ? ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	3	Therefore understand today that Adonai your God will himself cross ahead of you as a devouring fire ; he will destroy them and bring them down before you . Thus will you drive them out and cause them to perish quickly , as Adonai has said to you . ( iii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	4	“ Don ’ t think to yourself , after your God has pushed them out ahead of you , ‘ It is to reward my righteousness that Adonai has brought me in to take possession of this land. ’ No , it is because these nations have been so wicked that Adonai is driving them out ahead of you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	5	It is not because of your righteousness , or because your heart is so upright , that you go in to take possession of their land ; but to punish the wickedness of these nations that Adonai your God is driving them out ahead of you , and also to confirm the word which Adonai swore to your ancestors , Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	6	Therefore , understand that it is not for your righteousness that Adonai your God is giving you this good land to possess . “ For you are a stiffnecked people !
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	7	Remember , don ’ t forget , how you made Adonai your God angry in the desert . From the day you left the land of Egypt till you arrived at this place , you have been rebelling against Adonai .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	8	Also in Horev you made Adonai angry — Adonai was angry enough with you to destroy you !
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	10	Then Adonai gave me the two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God ; and on them was written every word Adonai had said to you from the fire on the mountain the day of the assembly .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	11	Yes , after forty days and nights Adonai gave me the two stone tablets , the tablets of the covenant .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	12	Then Adonai said to me , ‘ Get up , and hurry down from here , because your people , whom you led out of Egypt , have become corrupt . So quickly have they turned aside from the way I ordered them to follow ! They have made themselves a metal image ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	13	Moreover , Adonai said to me , ‘ I have seen this people , and what a stiffnecked people they are !
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	14	Let me alone , so that I can put an end to them and blot out their name from under heaven ! I will make out of you a nation bigger and stronger than they. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	15	I came down from the mountain . The mountain was blazing fire , and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	16	I looked , and there , you had sinned against Adonai your God ! You had made yourselves a metal calf , you had turned aside quickly from the way Adonai had ordered you to follow .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	17	I seized the two tablets , threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	18	Then I fell down before Adonai , as I had the first time , for forty days and nights , during which time I neither ate food nor drank water , all because of the sin you committed by doing what was evil in the sight of Adonai and thus provoking him .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	19	I was terrified that because of how angry Adonai was at you , of how heatedly displeased he was , that he would destroy you . But Adonai listened to me that time too .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	20	In addition , Adonai was very angry with Aharon and would have destroyed him ; but I prayed for Aharon also at the same time .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	21	I took your sin , the calf you had made , and burned it up in the fire , beat it to pieces , and ground it up still smaller , until it was as fine as dust ; then I threw its dust into the stream coming down from the mountain .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	22	“ Again at Tav ‘ erah , Massah and Kivrot-HaTa ’ avah you made Adonai angry ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	23	and when Adonai sent you off from Kadesh-Barnea by saying , ‘ Go up and take possession of the land I have given you , ’ you rebelled against the order of Adonai your God — you neither trusted him nor heeded what he said .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	24	You have been rebelling against Adonai from the day I first knew you !
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	25	“ So I fell down before Adonai for those forty days and nights ; and I lay there ; because Adonai had said he would destroy you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	26	I prayed to Adonai ; I said , ‘ Adonai Elohim ! Don ’ t destroy your people , your inheritance ! You redeemed them through your greatness , you brought them out of Egypt with a strong hand !
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	27	Remember your servants Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov ! Don ’ t focus on the stubbornness of this people , or on their wickedness or on their sin .
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	28	Otherwise , the land you brought us out of will say , “ It is because Adonai wasn ’ t able to bring them into the land he promised them and because he hated them that he has brought them out to kill them in the desert. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	9	29	But in fact they are your people , your inheritance , whom you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm . ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	10	“ I stayed on the mountain forty days and nights , as previously ; and Adonai listened to me that time too — Adonai would not destroy you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	2	I will inscribe on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets , which you broke ; and you are to put them in the ark. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	3	So I made an ark of acacia-wood and cut two stone tablets like the first , then climbed the mountain with the two tablets in my hand .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	4	He inscribed the tablets with the same inscription as before , the Ten Words which Adonai proclaimed to you from the fire on the mountain the day of the assembly ; and Adonai gave them to me .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	5	I turned , came down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made ; and there they remain ; as Adonai ordered me .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	6	“ The people of Isra ’ el traveled from the wells of B ’ nei-Ya ‘ akan to Moserah , where Aharon died and was buried ; and El ‘ azar his son took his place , serving in the office of cohen .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	7	From there they traveled to Gudgod , and from Gudgod to Yotvatah , a region with running streams .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	8	At that time Adonai set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark for the covenant of Adonai and to stand before Adonai to serve him and to bless in his name , as they still do today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	9	This is why Levi has no share or inheritance with his brothers ; Adonai is his inheritance , as Adonai your God had said to him .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	11	Then Adonai said to me , ‘ Get up , and go on your way at the head of the people , so that they can enter and take possession of the land I swore to their ancestors that I would give them. ’ ( v )
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	12	“ So now , Isra ’ el , all that Adonai your God asks from you is to fear Adonai your God , follow all his ways , love him and serve Adonai your God with all your heart and all your being ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	13	to obey , for your own good , the mitzvot and regulations of Adonai which I am giving you today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	14	See , the sky , the heaven beyond the sky , the earth and everything on it all belong to Adonai your God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	15	Only Adonai took enough pleasure in your ancestors to love them and choose their descendants after them — yourselves — above all peoples , as he still does today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	16	Therefore , circumcise the foreskin of your heart ; and don ’ t be stiffnecked any longer !
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	17	For Adonai your God is God of gods and Lord of lords , the great , mighty and awesome God , who has no favorites and accepts no bribes .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	18	He secures justice for the orphan and the widow ; he loves the foreigner , giving him food and clothing .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	19	Therefore you are to love the foreigner , since you were foreigners in the land of Egypt .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	20	You are to fear Adonai your God , serve him , cling to him and swear by his name .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	21	He is your praise , and he is your God , who has done for you these great and awesome things , which you have seen with your own eyes .
CJB	Deuteronomy	10	22	Your ancestors went down into Egypt with only seventy people , but now Adonai your God has made your numbers as many as the stars in the sky !
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	11	But the land you are crossing over to take possession of is a land of hills and valleys , which soaks up water when rain falls from the sky .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	2	Today it is you I am addressing — not your children , who haven ’ t known or experienced the discipline of Adonai your God , his greatness , his strong hand , his outstretched arm ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	3	his signs and his actions which he did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to his entire country .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	4	They didn ’ t experience what he did to Egypt ’ s army , horses and chariots — how Adonai overwhelmed them with the water of the Sea of Suf as they were pursuing you , so that they remain destroyed to this day .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	5	They didn ’ t experience what he kept doing for you in the desert until you arrived at this place ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	6	or what he did to Datan and Aviram , the sons of Eli ’ av the descendant of Re ’ uven — how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up , along with their households , tents and every living thing in their company , there in front of all Isra ’ el .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	7	But you have seen with your own eyes all these great deeds of Adonai .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	8	Therefore , you are to keep every mitzvah I am giving you today ; so that you will be strong enough to go in and take possession of the land you are crossing over to conquer ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	9	and so that you will live long in the land Adonai swore to give to your ancestors and their descendants , a land flowing with milk and honey . ( vi )
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	10	“ For the land you are entering in order to take possession of it isn ’ t like the land of Egypt . There you would sow your seed and had to use your feet to operate its irrigation system , as in a vegetable garden .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	12	It is a land Adonai your God cares for . The eyes of Adonai your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year to the end of the year .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	13	“ So if you listen carefully to my mitzvot which I am giving you today , to love Adonai your God and serve him with all your heart and all your being ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	14	then , [ says Adonai , ] ‘ I will give your land its rain at the right seasons , including the early fall rains and the late spring rains ; so that you can gather in your wheat , new wine and olive oil ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	15	and I will give your fields grass for your livestock ; with the result that you will eat and be satisfied. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	16	But be careful not to let yourselves be seduced , so that you turn aside , serving other gods and worshipping them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	17	If you do , the anger of Adonai will blaze up against you . He will shut up the sky , so that there will be no rain . The ground will not yield its produce , and you will quickly pass away from the good land Adonai is giving you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	18	Therefore , you are to store up these words of mine in your heart and in all your being ; tie them on your hand as a sign ; put them at the front of a headband around your forehead ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	19	teach them carefully to your children , talking about them when you sit at home , when you are traveling on the road , when you lie down and when you get up ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	20	and write them on the door-frames of your house and on your gates —
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	21	so that you and your children will live long on the land Adonai swore to your ancestors that he would give them for as long as there is sky above the earth . ( vii & Maftir )
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	22	“ For if you will take care to obey all these mitzvot I am giving you , to do them , to love Adonai your God , to follow all his ways and to cling to him ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	23	then Adonai will expel all these nations ahead of you ; and you will dispossess nations bigger and stronger than you are .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	24	Wherever the sole of your foot steps will be yours ; your territory will extend from the desert to the L ’ vanon and from the River , the Euphrates River , to the Western Sea .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	25	No one will be able to withstand you ; Adonai your God will place the fear and dread of you on all the land you step on , as he told you .

CJB	Deuteronomy	11	26	“ See , I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse —
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	27	the blessing , if you listen to the mitzvot of Adonai your God that I am giving you today ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	28	and the curse , if you don ’ t listen to the mitzvot of Adonai your God , but turn aside from the way I am ordering you today and follow other gods that you have not known .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	29	“ When Adonai your God brings you into the land you are entering in order to take possession of it , you are to put the blessing on Mount G ’ rizim and the curse on Mount ‘ Eival .

CJB	Deuteronomy	11	31	For you are to cross the Yarden to enter and take possession of the land Adonai your God is giving you ; you are to own it and live in it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	11	32	And you are to take care to follow all the laws and rulings I am setting before you today .

CJB	Deuteronomy	12	2	You must destroy all the places where the nations you are dispossessing served their gods , whether on high mountains , on hills , or under some leafy tree .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	3	Break down their altars , smash their standing-stones to pieces , burn up their sacred poles completely and cut down the carved images of their gods . Exterminate their name from that place .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	4	“ But you are not to treat Adonai your God this way .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	5	Rather , you are to come to the place where Adonai your God will put his name . He will choose it from all your tribes ; and you will seek out that place , which is where he will live , and go there .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	6	You will bring there your burnt offerings , your sacrifices , your tenths [ that you set aside for Adonai ] , the offerings that you give , the offerings you have vowed , your voluntary offerings , and the firstborn of your cattle and sheep .

CJB	Deuteronomy	12	8	You will not do things the way we do them here today , where everyone does whatever in his own opinion seems right ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	9	because you haven ’ t yet arrived at the rest and inheritance which Adonai your God is giving you .

CJB	Deuteronomy	12	11	then you will bring all that I am ordering you to the place Adonai your God chooses to have his name live — your burnt offerings , sacrifices , tenths , the offering from your hand , and all your best possessions that you dedicate to Adonai ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	13	“ Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings just anywhere you see ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	14	but do it in the place Adonai will choose in one of your tribal territories ; there is where you are to offer your burnt offerings and do everything I order you to do .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	15	However , you may slaughter and eat meat wherever you live and whenever you want , in keeping with the degree to which Adonai your God has blessed you . The unclean and the clean may eat it , as if it were gazelle or deer .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	16	But don ’ t eat the blood ; pour it out on the ground like water .

CJB	Deuteronomy	12	18	No , you are to eat these in the presence of Adonai your God in the place Adonai your God will choose — you and your sons , daughters , male and female slaves , and the Levi who is your guest ; and you are to rejoice before Adonai your God in everything you undertake to do .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	19	As long as you are living on your property , take care not to abandon the Levi .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	20	“ When Adonai your God expands your territory , as he has promised you , and you say , ‘ I want to eat meat , ’ simply because you want to eat meat , then you may eat meat , as much as you want .

CJB	Deuteronomy	12	22	Eat it as you would gazelle or deer ; the unclean and clean alike may eat it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	23	Just take care not to eat the blood , for the blood is the life , and you are not to eat the life with the meat .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	24	Don ’ t eat it , but pour it out on the ground like water .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	25	Do not eat it , so that things will go well with you and with your children after you , as you do what Adonai sees as right .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	26	Only the things set aside for God which you have , and the vows you have vowed to make , you must take and go to the place which Adonai will choose .
CJB	Deuteronomy	12	27	There you will offer your burnt offerings , the meat and the blood , on the altar of Adonai your God . The blood of your sacrifices is to be poured out on the altar of Adonai your God , and you will eat the meat .

CJB	Deuteronomy	12	31	You must not do this to Adonai your God ! For they have done to their gods all the abominations that Adonai hates ! They even burn up their sons and daughters in the fire for their gods !

CJB	Deuteronomy	13	1	) “ If a prophet or someone who gets messages while dreaming arises among you and he gives you a sign or wonder ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	13	3	) you are not to listen to what that prophet or dreamer says . For Adonai your God is testing you , in order to find out whether you really do love Adonai your God with all your heart and being .
CJB	Deuteronomy	13	4	) You are to follow Adonai your God , fear him , obey his mitzvot , listen to what he says , serve him and cling to him ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	13	5	) and that prophet or dreamer is to be put to death ; because he urged rebellion against Adonai your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from a life of slavery ; in order to seduce you away from the path Adonai your God ordered you to follow . This is how you are to rid your community of this wickedness .
CJB	Deuteronomy	13	6	) “ If your brother the son of your mother , or your son , or your daughter , or your wife whom you love , or your friend who means as much to you as yourself , secretly tries to entice you to go and serve other gods , which you haven ’ t known , neither you nor your ancestors —

CJB	Deuteronomy	13	8	) you are not to consent , and you are not to listen to him ; and you must not pity him or spare him ; and you may not conceal him .
CJB	Deuteronomy	13	9	) Rather , you must kill him ! Your own hand must be the first one on him in putting him to death , and afterwards the hands of all the people .
CJB	Deuteronomy	13	10	) You are to stone him to death ; because he has tried to draw you away from Adonai your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of a life of slavery .
CJB	Deuteronomy	13	11	) Then all Isra ’ el will hear about it and be afraid , so that they will stop doing such wickedness as this among themselves .

CJB	Deuteronomy	13	14	) then you are to investigate the matter , inquiring and searching diligently . If the rumor is true , if it is confirmed that such detestable things are being done among you ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	13	15	) you must put the inhabitants of that city to death with the sword , destroying it completely with the sword , everything in it , including its livestock .
CJB	Deuteronomy	13	16	) Heap all its spoils in an open space , and burn the city with its spoils to the ground for Adonai your God ; it will remain a tel forever and not be built again —

CJB	Deuteronomy	14	6	Any animal that has a separate hoof that is completely divided and also chews the cud , these animals you may eat .
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	7	But you are not to eat those that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof . For example , the camel , the hare and the coney are unclean for you because they chew the cud but don ’ t have a separate hoof ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	8	while the pig is unclean for you because , although it has a separate hoof , it doesn ’ t chew the cud . You are not to eat meat from these or touch their carcasses .
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	9	“ Of all that lives in the water , you may eat these : anything in the water that has fins and scales , these you may eat .

CJB	Deuteronomy	14	21	“ You are not to eat any animal that dies naturally ; although you may let a stranger staying with you eat it , or sell it to a foreigner ; because you are a holy people for Adonai your God . “ You are not to boil a young animal in its mother ’ s milk . ( v )
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	22	“ Every year you must take one tenth of everything your seed produces in the field ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	23	and eat it in the presence of Adonai your God . In the place where he chooses to have his name live you will eat the tenth of your grain , new wine and olive oil , and the firstborn of your cattle and sheep , so that you will learn to fear Adonai your God always .
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	24	But if the distance is too great for you , so that you are unable to transport it , because the place where Adonai chooses to put his name is too far away from you ; then , when Adonai your God prospers you ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	25	you are to convert it into money , take the money with you , go to the place which Adonai your God will choose ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	26	and exchange the money for anything you want — cattle , sheep , wine , other intoxicating liquor , or anything you please — and you are to eat there in the presence of Adonai your God , and enjoy yourselves , you and your household .
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	27	“ But don ’ t neglect the Levi staying with you , because he has no share or inheritance like yours .
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	28	At the end of every three years you are to take all the tenths of your produce from that year and store it in your towns .
CJB	Deuteronomy	14	29	Then the Levi , because he has no share or inheritance like yours , along with the foreigner , the orphan and the widow living in your towns , will come , eat and be satisfied — so that Adonai your God will bless you in everything your hands produce .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	15	Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt , and Adonai your God redeemed you ; that is why I am giving you this order today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	2	Here is how the sh ’ mittah is to be done : every creditor is to give up what he has loaned to his fellow member of the community — he is not to force his neighbor or relative to repay it , because Adonai ’ s time of remission has been proclaimed .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	3	You may demand that a foreigner repay his debt , but you are to release your claim on whatever your brother owes you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	4	In spite of this , there will be no one needy among you ; because Adonai will certainly bless you in the land which Adonai your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess —
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	5	if only you will listen carefully to what Adonai your God says and take care to obey all these mitzvot I am giving you today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	6	Yes , Adonai your God will bless you , as he promised you — you will lend money to many nations without having to borrow , and you will rule over many nations without their ruling over you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	7	“ If someone among you is needy , one of your brothers , in any of your towns in your land which Adonai your God is giving you , you are not to harden your heart or shut your hand from giving to your needy brother .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	8	No , you must open your hand to him and lend him enough to meet his need and enable him to obtain what he wants .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	9	Guard yourself against allowing your heart to entertain the mean-spirited thought that because the seventh year , the year of sh ’ mittah is at hand , you would be stingy toward your needy brother and not give him anything ; for then he may cry out to Adonai against you , and it will be your sin .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	10	Rather , you must give to him ; and you are not to be grudging when you give to him . If you do this , Adonai your God will bless you in all your work , in everything you undertake —
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	11	for there will always be poor people in the land . That is why I am giving you this order , ‘ You must open your hand to your poor and needy brother in your land. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	12	“ If your kinsman , a Hebrew man or woman , is sold to you , he is to serve you for six years ; but in the seventh year , you are to set him free .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	13	Moreover , when you set him free , don ’ t let him leave empty-handed ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	14	but supply him generously from your flock , threshing-floor and winepress ; from what Adonai your God has blessed you with , you are to give to him .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	16	But if he says to you , ‘ I don ’ t want to leave you , ’ because he loves you and your household , and because his life with you is a good one ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	17	then take an awl , and pierce his ear through , right into the door ; and he will be your slave forever . Do the same with your female slave .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	18	Don ’ t resent it when you set him free , since during his six years of service he has been worth twice as much as a hired employee . Then Adonai your God will bless you in everything you do . ( vii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	19	“ All the firstborn males in your herd of cattle and in your flock you are to set aside for Adonai your God ; you are not to do any work with a firstborn from your herd or shear a firstborn sheep .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	20	Each year you and your household are to eat it in the presence of Adonai your God in the place which Adonai will choose .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	21	But if it has a defect , is lame or blind , or has some other kind of fault , you are not to sacrifice it to Adonai your God ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	22	rather , eat it on your own property ; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it , like the gazelle or the deer .
CJB	Deuteronomy	15	23	Just don ’ t eat its blood , but pour it out on the ground like water .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	16	“ Three times a year all your men are to appear in the presence of Adonai your God in the place which he will choose — at the festival of matzah , at the festival of Shavu ‘ ot and at the festival of Sukkot . They are not to show up before Adonai empty-handed ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	2	You are to sacrifice the Pesach offering from flock and herd to Adonai your God in the place where Adonai will choose to have his name live .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	3	You are not to eat any hametz with it ; for seven days you are to eat with it matzah , the bread of affliction ; for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste . Thus you will remember the day you left the land of Egypt as long as you live .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	4	No leaven is to be seen with you anywhere in your territory for seven days . None of the meat from your sacrifice on the first day in the evening is to remain all night until morning .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	5	You may not sacrifice the Pesach offering in just any of the towns that Adonai your God is giving you ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	6	but at the place where Adonai your God will choose to have his name live — there is where you are to sacrifice the Pesach offering , in the evening , when the sun sets , at the time of year that you came out of Egypt .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	7	You are to roast it and eat it in the place Adonai your God will choose ; in the morning you will return and go to your tents .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	8	For six days you are to eat matzah ; on the seventh day there is to be a festive assembly for Adonai your God ; do not do any kind of work .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	9	“ You are to count seven weeks ; you are to begin counting seven weeks from the time you first put your sickle to the standing grain .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	10	You are to observe the festival of Shavu ‘ ot [ weeks ] for Adonai your God with a voluntary offering , which you are to give in accordance with the degree to which Adonai your God has prospered you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	11	You are to rejoice in the presence of Adonai your God — you , your sons and daughters , your male and female slaves , the L ’ vi ’ im living in your towns , and the foreigners , orphans and widows living among you — in the place where Adonai your God will choose to have his name live .
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	12	Remember that you were a slave in Egypt ; then you will keep and obey these laws . ( Maftir )
CJB	Deuteronomy	16	13	“ You are to keep the festival of Sukkot for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing-floor and winepress .

CJB	Deuteronomy	16	15	Seven days you are to keep the festival for Adonai your God in the place Adonai your God will choose , because Adonai your God will bless you in all your crops and in all your work , so you are to be full of joy !

CJB	Deuteronomy	18	11	a spell-caster , a consulter of ghosts or spirits , or a necromancer .
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	12	For whoever does these things is detestable to Adonai , and because of these abominations Adonai your God is driving them out ahead of you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	13	You must be wholehearted with Adonai your God . ( v )
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	14	For these nations , which you are about to dispossess , listen to soothsayers and diviners ; but you , Adonai your God does not allow you to do this .
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	15	“ Adonai will raise up for you a prophet like me from among yourselves , from your own kinsmen . You are to pay attention to him ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	16	just as when you were assembled at Horev and requested Adonai your God , ‘ Don ’ t let me hear the voice of Adonai my God any more , or let me see this great fire ever again ; if I do , I will die ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	17	On that occasion Adonai said to me , ‘ They are right in what they are saying .
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	19	Whoever doesn ’ t listen to my words , which he will speak in my name , will have to account for himself to me .
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	20	“ ‘ But if a prophet presumptuously speaks a word in my name which I didn ’ t order him to say , or if he speaks in the name of other gods , then that prophet must die. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	21	You may be wondering , ‘ How are we to know if a word has not been spoken by Adonai ? ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	18	22	When a prophet speaks in the name of Adonai , and the prediction does not come true — that is , the word is not fulfilled — then Adonai did not speak that word . The prophet who said it spoke presumptuously ; you have nothing to fear from him .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	19	you are to do to him what he intended to do to his brother . In this way , you will put an end to such wickedness among you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	2	you are to set aside three cities for yourselves in your land that Adonai your God is giving you to possess .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	3	Divide the territory of your land , which Adonai your God is having you inherit , into three parts ; and prepare the roads , so that any killer can flee to these cities .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	4	The killer who will live if he flees there is someone who has killed his fellow member of the community by mistake , who did not hate him in the past .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	5	An example would be if a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood and takes a stroke with the axe to fell a tree , but the head of the axe flies off the handle , hits his neighbor and kills him . Then he is to flee to one of these cities and live there .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	6	Otherwise the next-of-kin avenger , in the heat of his anger , may pursue the killer , overtake him because the distance [ to the city of refuge ] is long , and strike him dead — even though he didn ’ t deserve to die , inasmuch as he hadn ’ t hated him in the past .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	7	This is why I am ordering you to set aside for yourselves three cities .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	8	“ If Adonai your God expands your territory , as he swore to your ancestors that he would , and gives you all the land he promised to give to your ancestors —
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	9	provided you keep and observe all these mitzvot I am giving you today , loving Adonai your God and always following his ways — then you are to add three more cities for yourselves , besides these three ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	10	so that innocent blood will not be shed in the land Adonai your God is giving you as an inheritance , and thus blood guilt be on you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	11	“ However , if someone hates his fellow member of the community , lies in wait for him , attacks him , strikes him a death blow , and then flees into one of these cities ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	12	then the leaders of his own town are to send and bring him back from there and hand him over to the next-of-kin avenger , to be put to death .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	13	You are not to pity him . Rather , you must put an end to the shedding of innocent blood in Isra ’ el . Then things will go well with you . ( vi )
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	14	“ You are not to move your neighbor ’ s boundary marker from the place where people put it long ago , in the inheritance soon to be yours in the land Adonai your God is giving you to possess .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	15	“ One witness alone will not be sufficient to convict a person of any offense or sin of any kind ; the matter will be established only if there are two or three witnesses testifying against him .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	16	“ If a malicious witness comes forward and gives false testimony against someone ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	17	then both the men involved in the controversy are to stand before Adonai , before the cohanim and the judges in office at the time .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	18	The judges are to investigate carefully . If they find that the witness is lying and has given false testimony against his brother ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	20	Those who remain will hear about it , be afraid and no longer commit such wickedness among you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	19	21	Show no pity : life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	20	However , if you know that certain trees provide no food , you may destroy them and cut them down , in order to build siege-works against the town making war with you , until it falls .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	2	When you are about to go into battle , the cohen is to come forward and address the people .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	3	He should tell them , ‘ Listen , Isra ’ el ! You are about to do battle against your enemies . Don ’ t be fainthearted or afraid ; don ’ t be alarmed or frightened by them ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	4	because Adonai your God is going with you to fight on your behalf against your enemies and give you victory. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	5	“ Then the officials will speak to the soldiers . They are to say , ‘ Is there a man here who has built a new house , but hasn ’ t dedicated it yet ? He should go back home now ; otherwise he may die fighting , and another man will dedicate it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	6	“ ‘ Is there a man here who has planted a vineyard , but hasn ’ t yet made use of its fruit ? He should go back home ; otherwise he may die fighting , and another man will use it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	7	“ ‘ Is there a man here who is engaged to a woman , but hasn ’ t married her yet ? He should go back home ; otherwise he may die fighting , and another man will marry her. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	8	“ The officials will then add to what they have said to the soldiers : ‘ Is there a man here who is afraid and fainthearted ? He should go back home ; otherwise his fear may demoralize his comrades as well. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	9	When the officials have finished speaking with the soldiers , commanders are to be appointed to lead the army . ( vii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	10	“ When you advance on a town to attack it , first offer it terms for peace .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	11	If it accepts the terms for peace and opens its gates to you , then all the people there are to be put to forced labor and work for you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	12	However , if they refuse to make peace with you but prefer to make war against you , you are to put it under siege .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	13	When Adonai your God hands it over to you , you are to put every male to the sword .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	14	However , you are to take as booty for yourself the women , the little ones , the livestock , and everything in the city — all its spoil . Yes , you will feed on your enemies ’ spoil , which Adonai your God has given you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	15	This is what you are to do to all the towns which are at a great distance from you , which are not the towns of these nations .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	16	“ As for the towns of these peoples , which Adonai your God is giving you as your inheritance , you are not to allow anything that breathes to live .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	17	Rather you must destroy them completely — the Hitti , the Emori , the Kena ‘ ani , the P ’ rizi , the Hivi and the Y ’ vusi — as Adonai your God has ordered you ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	18	so that they won ’ t teach you to follow their abominable practices , which they do for their gods , thus causing you to sin against Adonai your God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	20	19	“ When , in making war against a town in order to capture it , you lay siege to it for a long time , you are not to destroy its trees , cutting them down with an axe . You can eat their fruit , so don ’ t cut them down . After all , are the trees in the field human beings , so that you have to besiege them too ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	21	Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death ; in this way you will put an end to such wickedness among you , and all Isra ’ el will hear about it and be afraid . ( ii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	2	then your leaders and judges are to go out and measure the distance between it and the surrounding towns .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	3	After it has been determined which town is the closest , the leaders of that town are to take a young female cow that has never been put to work or yoked for use as a draft animal .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	4	The leaders of that town are to bring the heifer down to a vadi with a stream in it that never dries up , to a place that is neither plowed nor sown ; and they are to break the cow ’ s neck there in the vadi .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	5	Then the cohanim , who are L ’ vi ’ im , are to approach ; for Adonai your God has chosen them to serve him and to pronounce blessings in the name of Adonai ; they will decide the outcome of every dispute and matter involving violence .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	6	All the leaders of the town nearest the murder victim are to wash their hands over the cow whose neck was broken in the vadi . ( Maftir )
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	7	Then they are to speak up and say , ‘ This blood was not shed by our hands , nor have we seen who did it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	8	Adonai , forgive your people Isra ’ el , whom you redeemed ; do not allow innocent blood to be shed among your people Isra ’ el. ’ And they will be forgiven this bloodshed .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	9	Thus you will banish the shedding of innocent blood from among you , by doing what Adonai sees as right .

CJB	Deuteronomy	21	12	you are to bring her home to your house , where she will shave her head , cut her fingernails
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	13	and remove her prison clothing . She will stay there in your house , mourning her father and mother for a full month ; after which you may go in to have sexual relations with her and be her husband , and she will be your wife .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	14	In the event that you lose interest in her , you are to let her go wherever she wishes ; but you may not sell her for money or treat her like a slave , because you humiliated her .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	15	“ If a man has two wives , the one loved and the other unloved , and both the loved and unloved wives have borne him children , and if the firstborn son is the child of the unloved wife ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	16	then , when it comes time for him to pass his inheritance on to his sons , he may not give the inheritance due the firstborn to the son of the loved wife in place of the son of the unloved one , who is in fact the firstborn .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	17	No , he must acknowledge as firstborn the son of the unloved wife by giving him a double portion of everything he owns , for he is the firstfruits of his manhood , and the right of the firstborn is his .
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	18	“ If a man has a stubborn , rebellious son who will not obey what his father or mother says , and even after they discipline him he still refuses to pay attention to them ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	21	19	then his father and mother are to take hold of him and bring him out to the leaders of his town , at the gate of that place ,

CJB	Deuteronomy	25	17	“ Remember what ‘ Amalek did to you on the road as you were coming out of Egypt ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	25	18	how he met you by the road , attacked those in the rear , those who were exhausted and straggling behind when you were tired and weary . He did not fear God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	25	19	Therefore , when Adonai your God has given you rest from all your surrounding enemies in the land Adonai your God is giving you as your inheritance to possess , you are to blot out all memory of ‘ Amalek from under heaven . Don ’ t forget ! Haftarah Ki Tetze : Yesha ‘ yahu ( Isaiah ) 54:1–10 [ Messianic adaptation : commence the reading at 52:13 ] B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Ki Tetze : Mattityahu ( Matthew ) 5:31–32 ; 19:3–12 ; 22:23–32 ; Mark 10:2–12 ; 12:18–27 ; Luke 20:27–38 ;

CJB	Deuteronomy	26	50	: Ki Tavo ( When you come ) 26:1–29:8 (
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	9	Now he has brought us to this place and given us this land , a land flowing with milk and honey .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	2	you are to take the firstfruits of all the crops the ground yields , which you will harvest from your land that Adonai your God is giving you , put them in a basket and go to the place where Adonai your God will choose to have his name live .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	3	You will approach the cohen holding office at the time and say to him , ‘ Today I declare to Adonai your God that I have come to the land Adonai swore to our ancestors that he would give us. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	4	The cohen will take the basket from your hand and put it down in front of the altar of Adonai your God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	5	“ Then , in the presence of Adonai your God , you are to say , ‘ My ancestor was a nomad from Aram . He went down into Egypt few in number and stayed . There he became a great , strong , populous nation .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	6	But the Egyptians treated us badly ; they oppressed us and imposed harsh slavery on us .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	7	So we cried out to Adonai , the God of our ancestors . Adonai heard us and saw our misery , toil and oppression ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	8	and Adonai brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and a stretched-out arm , with great terror , and with signs and wonders .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	10	Therefore , as you see , I have now brought the firstfruits of the land which you , Adonai , have given me. ’ You are then to put the basket down before Adonai your God , prostrate yourself before Adonai your God ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	11	and take joy in all the good that Adonai your God has given you , your household , the Levi and the foreigner living with you . ( ii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	12	“ After you have separated a tenth of the crops yielded in the third year , the year of separating a tenth , and have given it to the Levi , the foreigner , the orphan and the widow , so that they can have enough food to satisfy them while staying with you ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	13	you are to say , in the presence of Adonai your God , ‘ I have rid my house of the things set aside for God and given them to the Levi , the foreigner , the orphan and the widow , in keeping with every one of the mitzvot you gave me . I haven ’ t disobeyed any of your mitzvot or forgotten them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	14	I haven ’ t eaten any of this food when mourning , I haven ’ t put any of it aside when unclean , nor have I given any of it for the dead . I have listened to what Adonai my God has said , and I have done everything you ordered me to do .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	15	Look out from your holy dwelling-place , from heaven ; and bless your people Isra ’ el and the land you gave us , as you swore to our ancestors , a land flowing with milk and honey. ’ ( iii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	16	“ Today Adonai your God orders you to obey these laws and rulings . Therefore , you are to observe and obey them with all your heart and all your being .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	17	You are agreeing today that Adonai is your God and that you will follow his ways ; observe his laws , mitzvot and rulings ; and do what he says .
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	18	In turn Adonai is agreeing today that you are his own unique treasure , as he promised you ; that you are to observe all his mitzvot ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	26	19	and that he will raise you high above all the nations he has made , in praise , reputation and glory ; and that , as he said , you will be a holy people for Adonai your God . ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	27	( iv ) Then Moshe and all the leaders of Isra ’ el gave orders to the people . They said , “ Observe all the mitzvot I am giving you today .
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	2	When you cross the Yarden to the land Adonai your God is giving you , you are to set up large stones , put plaster on them ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	3	and , after crossing over , write this Torah on them , every word — so that you can enter the land Adonai your God is giving you , a land flowing with milk and honey , as Adonai , the God of your ancestors , promised you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	4	When you have crossed the Yarden , you are to set up these stones , as I am ordering you today , on Mount ‘ Eival ; and put plaster on them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	5	There you are to erect an altar to Adonai your God , an altar made of stones . You are not to use any iron tool on them ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	6	but are to build the altar of Adonai your God of uncut stones ; and you are to offer burnt offerings on it to Adonai your God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	7	Also you are to sacrifice peace offerings , eat there and be joyful in the presence of Adonai your God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	8	You are to write on the stones all the words of this Torah very clearly. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	9	Next Moshe and the cohanim , who are L ’ vi ’ im , spoke to all Isra ’ el . They said , “ Be quiet ; and listen , Isra ’ el ! Today you have become the people of Adonai your God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	10	Therefore you are to listen to what Adonai your God says and obey his mitzvot and laws , which I am giving you today. ” ( v )
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	11	That same day Moshe commissioned the people as follows :
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	12	“ These are the ones who are to stand on Mount G ’ rizim and bless the people after you have crossed the Yarden : Shim ‘ on , Levi , Y ’ hudah , Yissakhar , Yosef and Binyamin ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	13	while these are to stand on Mount ‘ Eival for the curse : Re ’ uven , Gad , Asher , Z ’ vulun , Dan and Naftali .
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	14	The L ’ vi ’ im , speaking loudly , will proclaim to every man of Isra ’ el :
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	15	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who makes a carved or metal image , something Adonai detests , the handiwork of a craftsman , and sets it up in secret ! ’ All the people are to respond by saying , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	16	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who dishonors his father or mother. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	17	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who moves his neighbor ’ s boundary marker. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’

CJB	Deuteronomy	27	19	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who interferes with justice for the foreigner , orphan or widow. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	20	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who has sexual relations with his father ’ s wife , because he has violated his father ’ s rights. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	21	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who has sexual relations with any kind of animal. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	22	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who has sexual relations with his sister , no matter whether she is the daughter of his father or of his mother. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	23	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who has sexual relations with his mother-in-law. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	24	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who secretly attacks a fellow member of the community. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	25	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	27	26	“ ‘ A curse on anyone who does not confirm the words of this Torah by putting them into practice. ’ All the people are to say , ‘ Amen ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	28	Adonai will strike you with insanity , blindness and utter confusion .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	2	and all the following blessings will be yours in abundance — if you will do what Adonai your God says :
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	3	“ A blessing on you in the city , and a blessing on you in the countryside .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	4	“ A blessing on the fruit of your body , the fruit of your land and the fruit of your livestock — the young of your cattle and flocks .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	5	“ A blessing on your grain-basket and kneading-bowl .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	6	“ A blessing on you when you go out , and a blessing on you when you come in . ( vi )
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	7	“ Adonai will cause your enemies attacking you to be defeated before you ; they will advance on you one way and flee before you seven ways .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	8	“ Adonai will order a blessing to be with you in your barns and in everything you undertake ; he will bless you in the land Adonai your God is giving you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	9	“ Adonai will establish you as a people separated out for himself , as he has sworn to you — if you will observe the mitzvot of Adonai your God and follow his ways .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	10	Then all the peoples on earth will see that Adonai ’ s name , his presence , is with you ; so that they will be afraid of you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	11	“ Adonai will give you great abundance of good things — of the fruit of your body , the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your land in the land Adonai swore to your ancestors to give you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	12	Adonai will open for you his good treasure , the sky , to give your land its rain at the right seasons and to bless everything you undertake . You will lend to many nations and not borrow ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	13	Adonai will make you the head and not the tail ; and you will be only above , never below — if you will listen to , observe and obey the mitzvot of Adonai your God
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	14	and not turn away from any of the words I am ordering you today , neither to the right nor to the left , to follow after other gods and serve them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	15	“ But if you refuse to pay attention to what Adonai your God says , and do not observe and obey all his mitzvot and regulations which I am giving you today , then all the following curses will be yours in abundance :
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	16	“ A curse on you in the city , and a curse on you in the countryside .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	17	“ A curse on your grain-basket and kneading-bowl .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	18	“ A curse on the fruit of your body , the fruit of your land and the young of your cattle and flocks .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	19	“ A curse on you when you come in , and a curse on you when you go out .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	20	“ Adonai will send on you curses , disasters and frustration in everything you set out to do , until you are destroyed and quickly perish , because of your evil actions in abandoning me .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	21	“ Adonai will bring on you a plague that will stay with you until he has exterminated you from the land you are entering in order to take possession of it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	22	Adonai will strike you down with wasting diseases , fever , inflammation , fiery heat , drought , blasting winds and mildew ; and they will pursue you until you perish .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	23	“ The sky over your head will be brass and the earth under you iron .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	24	Adonai will turn the rain your land needs into powder and dust that will fall on you from the sky until you are destroyed .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	25	“ Adonai your God will cause you to be defeated before your enemies ; you will advance on them one way and flee before them seven . You will become an object of horror to every kingdom on earth .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	26	Your carcasses will become food for all the birds in the air and the wild animals , and there will be no one to scare them away .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	27	Adonai will strike you down with the boils that broke out on the Egyptians , tumors , skin lesions and itching , all incurable .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	29	You will grope about at noon like a blind person groping in the dark , unable to find your way . “ You will be continually oppressed and robbed , and there will be no one to save you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	30	You will get engaged to a woman , but another man will marry her . You will build a house but not live in it . You will plant a vineyard but not use its fruit .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	31	Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes , but you won ’ t eat any of its meat . Your donkey will be taken away from you by force as you watch , and you won ’ t get it back . Your sheep will be given to your enemies , and there will be no one to help you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	32	Your sons and daughters will be handed over to another people ; you will watch for them longingly all day but not see them ; and there will be nothing you can do about it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	33	A nation unknown to you will eat the fruit of your land and labor . Yes , you will be continually oppressed and crushed ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	34	till you go crazy from what your eyes have to see .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	35	Adonai will strike you down in the knees and legs with painful and incurable boils ; they will spread from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	36	Adonai will bring you and your king whom you have put over yourselves to a nation you have not known , neither you nor your ancestors ; and there you will serve other gods made of wood and stone .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	37	You will be so devastated as to become a proverb and a laughingstock among all the peoples to which Adonai will drive you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	38	“ You will carry much seed out to the field but gather little in , because locusts will devour it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	39	You will plant vineyards and dress them but neither drink the wine nor gather the grapes , because worms will eat them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	40	You will have olive trees throughout your territory but not anoint yourself with the oil , because your olives will fall off unripe .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	41	You will father sons and daughters , but they won ’ t belong to you , because they will go into captivity .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	42	The bugs will inherit all your trees and the produce of your land .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	43	“ The foreigner living with you will rise higher and higher while you sink lower and lower .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	44	He will lend to you , but you will not lend to him ; he will be the head and you the tail .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	45	“ All these curses will come on you , pursuing you and overtaking you until you are destroyed , because you didn ’ t pay attention to what Adonai your God said , observing his mitzvot and regulations that he gave you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	46	These curses will be on you and your descendants as a sign and a wonder forever .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	47	Because you didn ’ t serve Adonai your God with joy and gladness in your heart when you had such an abundance of everything ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	48	Adonai will send your enemy against you ; and you will serve him when you are hungry , thirsty , poorly clothed and lacking everything ; he will put a yoke of iron on your neck until he destroys you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	49	Yes , Adonai will bring against you a nation from far away that will swoop down on you from the end of the earth like a vulture , a nation whose language you don ’ t understand ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	50	a nation grim in appearance , whose people neither respect the old nor pity the young .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	51	They will devour the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your soil , until you have been destroyed . They will leave you without grain , wine , olive oil , or your young cattle and sheep — until they have caused you to perish .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	52	They will besiege all your towns until your high , fortified walls , in which you trusted , collapse everywhere in your land , which Adonai your God gave you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	53	Then , because of the severity of the siege and distress that your enemies are inflicting on you , you will eat the offspring of your own body , the flesh of your own sons and daughters , whom Adonai your God has given you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	54	Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will be without pity for his brother , his beloved wife or his surviving children ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	55	to the degree that he will refuse to share with any of them the flesh of his children whom he is eating ; because if he did , he would have nothing left for himself — in the severity of the siege and distress your enemies are inflicting on you in all your towns .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	56	The most delicate and sensitive woman among you , so sensitive and delicate that she wouldn ’ t think of touching the sole of her foot to the ground , will so begrudge her own beloved husband , son and daughter
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	57	that she will secretly eat the afterbirth that comes out of her and even her own children as she bears them — so desperately hungry will she be in the severity of the siege and distress your enemies are inflicting on you in your towns .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	58	“ If you will not observe and obey all the words of this Torah that are written in this book , so that you will fear this glorious and awesome name , Adonai your God ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	59	then Adonai will strike down you and your descendants with extraordinary plagues and severe sicknesses that go on and on .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	60	He will bring back upon you all the diseases the Egyptians had , which you were in dread of ; and they will cling to you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	61	Not only that , but Adonai will bring upon you all the sicknesses and plagues that are not written in this book of the Torah — until you are destroyed .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	62	You will be left few in number , whereas you were once as numerous as the stars in the sky — because you did not pay attention to the voice of Adonai your God .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	63	“ Thus it will come about that just as once Adonai took joy in seeking to do you good and increase your numbers , so now Adonai will take joy in causing you to perish and be destroyed , and you will be plucked off the land you are entering in order to take possession of it .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	64	Adonai will scatter you among all peoples from one end of the earth to the other , and there you will serve other gods , made of wood and stone , which neither you nor your ancestors have known .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	65	Among these nations you will not find repose , and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot ; rather Adonai will give you there anguish of heart , dimness of eyes and apathy of spirit .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	66	Your life will hang in doubt before you ; you will be afraid night and day and have no assurance that you will stay alive .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	67	In the morning you will say , ‘ Oh , how I wish it were evening ! ’ and in the evening you will say , ‘ Oh , how I wish it were morning ! ’ — because of the fear overwhelming your heart and the sights your eyes will see .
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	68	Finally , Adonai will bring you back in ships to Egypt , the place of which I said to you , ‘ You will never ever see it again ’ ; and there you will try to sell yourselves as slaves to your enemies , but no one will buy you. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	28	69	( 29:1 ) These are the words of the covenant which Adonai ordered Moshe to make with the people of Isra ’ el in the land of Mo ’ av , in addition to the covenant which he made with them in Horev .
CJB	Deuteronomy	29	29	) “ Things which are hidden belong to Adonai our God . But the things that have been revealed belong to us and our children forever , so that we can observe all the words of this Torah .

CJB	Deuteronomy	31	13	and so that their children , who have not known , can hear and learn to fear Adonai your God , for as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Yarden to possess. ” ( RY : vi , LY : v )
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	14	Adonai said to Moshe , “ The time is coming for you to die . Summon Y ’ hoshua , and present yourselves in the tent of meeting , so that I can commission him. ” Moshe and Y ’ hoshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting .
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	15	Adonai appeared in the tent in a column of cloud ; the column of cloud stood above the entrance to the tent .
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	16	Adonai said to Moshe , “ You are about to sleep with your ancestors . But this people will get up and offer themselves as prostitutes to the foreign gods of the land where they are going . When they are with those gods , they will abandon me and break my covenant which I have made with them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	17	Then my anger will flare up , and I will abandon them and hide my face from them . They will be devoured , and many calamities and troubles will come upon them . Then they will ask , ‘ Haven ’ t these calamities come upon us because our God isn ’ t here with us ? ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	18	But I will be hiding my face from them because of all the evil they will have done in turning to other gods .
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	19	“ Therefore , write this song for yourselves , and teach it to the people of Isra ’ el . Have them learn it by heart , so that this song can be a witness for me against the people of Isra ’ el . ( RY : vii , LY : vi )
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	20	For when I have brought them into the land I swore to their ancestors , flowing with milk and honey ; and they have eaten their fill , grown fat and turned to other gods , serving them and despising me , and broken my covenant ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	21	then , after many calamities and troubles have come upon them , this song will testify before them as a witness , because their descendants will still be reciting it and will not have forgotten it . For I know how they think even now , even before I have brought them into the land about which I swore. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	22	So Moshe wrote this song that same day and taught it to the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	23	Adonai also commissioned Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun with these words : “ Be strong and full of courage ; for you are to bring the people of Isra ’ el into the land about which I swore to them ; and I will be with you. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	24	Moshe kept writing the words of this Torah in a book until he was done . When he had finished , ( LY : vii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	25	Moshe gave these orders to the L ’ vi ’ im who carried the ark with the covenant of Adonai :
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	26	“ Take this book of the Torah and put it next to the ark with the covenant of Adonai your God , so that it can be there to witness against you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	27	For I know how rebellious and stiffnecked you are ! Here , even while I am still alive with you today , you have rebelled against Adonai ; so how much more will you do so after my death ? ( Maftir )
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	28	Assemble for me all the leaders of your tribes and your officials , so that I can say these things in their hearing , calling heaven and earth to witness against them —
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	29	because I know that after my death you will become very corrupt and turn aside from the way that I have ordered you , and that disaster will come upon you in the acharit-hayamim , because you will do what Adonai sees as evil and provoke him by your deeds. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	30	Then Moshe spoke in the hearing of the whole assembly of Isra ’ el the words of this song , from beginning to end : Haftarah Vayelekh : Hoshea ( Hosea ) 14:2 (
CJB	Deuteronomy	31	1	) –10 (
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	32	“ ‘ Rather , their vine is from the vine of S ’ dom , from the fields of ‘ Amora — their grapes are poisonous , their clusters are bitter ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	53	: Ha ’ azinu ( Hear ) 32:1–52
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	2	Samuel ) 22:1–51 B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah Ha ’ azinu : Romans 10:14 –21 ; 12:14–21 ; Messianic Jews ( Hebrews ) 12:28–39
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	3	“ For I will proclaim the name of Adonai . Come , declare the greatness of our God !
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	4	The Rock ! His work is perfect , for all his ways are just . A trustworthy God who does no wrong , he is righteous and straight .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	5	“ He is not corrupt ; the defect is in his children , a crooked and perverted generation .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	6	You foolish people , so lacking in wisdom , is this how you repay Adonai ? He is your father , who made you his ! It was he who formed and prepared you ! ( ii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	7	“ Remember how the old days were ; think of the years through all the ages . Ask your father — he will tell you ; your leaders too — they will inform you .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	8	“ When ‘ Elyon gave each nation its heritage , when he divided the human race , he assigned the boundaries of peoples according to Isra ’ el ’ s population ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	9	but Adonai ’ s share was his own people , Ya ‘ akov his allotted heritage .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	10	“ He found his people in desert country , in a howling , wasted wilderness . He protected him and cared for him , guarded him like the pupil of his eye ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	11	like an eagle that stirs up her nest , hovers over her young , spreads out her wings , takes them and carries them as she flies .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	12	“ Adonai alone led his people ; no alien god was with him . ( iii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	13	He made them ride on the heights of the earth . They ate the produce of the fields . He had them suck honey from the rocks and olive oil from the crags ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	14	curds from the cows and milk from the sheep , with lamb fat , rams from Bashan and goats , with the finest wheat flour ; and you drank sparkling wine from the blood of grapes .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	15	“ But Yeshurun grew fat and kicked ( you grew fat , thick , gross ! ) . He abandoned God his Maker ; he scorned the Rock , his salvation .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	16	They roused him to jealousy with alien gods , provoked him with abominations .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	17	They sacrificed to demons , non-gods , gods that they had never known , new gods that had come up lately , which your ancestors had not feared .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	18	You ignored the Rock who fathered you , you forgot God , who gave you birth . ( iv )
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	19	“ Adonai saw and was filled with scorn at his sons ’ and daughters ’ provocation .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	20	He said , ‘ I will hide my face from them and see what will become of them ; for they are a perverse generation , untrustworthy children .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	21	They aroused my jealousy with a non-god and provoked me with their vanities ; I will arouse their jealousy with a non-people and provoke them with a vile nation .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	22	“ ‘ For my anger has been fired up . It burns to the depths of Sh ’ ol , devouring the earth and its crops , kindling the very roots of the hills .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	23	I will heap disasters on them and use up all my arrows against them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	24	“ ‘ Fatigued by hunger , they will be consumed by fever and bitter defeat ; I will send them the fangs of wild beasts , and the poison of reptiles crawling in the dust .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	25	Outside , the sword makes parents childless ; inside , there is panic , as young men and girls alike are slain , sucklings and graybeards together .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	26	“ ‘ I considered putting an end to them , erasing their memory from the human race ;
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	27	but I feared the insolence of their enemy , feared that their foes would mistakenly think , “ We ourselves accomplished this ; Adonai had nothing to do with it. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	28	“ ‘ They are a nation without common sense , utterly lacking in discernment . ( v )
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	29	If they were wise they could figure it out and understand their destiny .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	30	After all , how can one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to rout , unless their Rock sells them to their enemies , unless Adonai hands them over ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	31	For our enemies have no rock like our Rock — even they can see that !
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	33	their wine is snake poison , the cruel venom of vipers .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	34	“ ‘ Isn ’ t this hidden with me , sealed in my storehouses ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	35	Vengeance and payback are mine for the time when their foot slips ; for the day of their calamity is coming soon , their doom is rushing upon them. ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	36	“ Yes , Adonai will judge his people , taking pity on his servants , when he sees that their strength is gone , that no one is left , slave or free .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	37	Then he will ask , ‘ Where are their gods , the rock in whom they trusted ?
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	38	Who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offering ? Let him get up and help you , let him protect you !
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	39	See now that I , yes , I , am he ; and there is no god beside me . I put to death , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal ; no one saves anyone from my hand ! ( vi )
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	40	“ ‘ For I lift up my hand to heaven and swear , “ As surely as I am alive forever ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	41	if I sharpen my flashing sword and set my hand to judgment , I will render vengeance to my foes , repay those who hate me .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood , my sword will devour flesh — the blood of the slain and the captives , flesh from the wild-haired heads of the enemy. ” ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	43	“ Sing out , you nations , about his people ! For he will avenge the blood of his servants . He will render vengeance to his adversaries and make atonement for the land of his people. ” ( vii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	44	Moshe came and proclaimed all the words of this song in the hearing of the people and of Hoshea the son of Nun .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	45	When he had finished speaking all these words to all Isra ’ el ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	46	he said to them , “ Take to heart all the words of my testimony against you today , so that you can use them in charging your children to be careful to obey all the words of this Torah .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	47	For this is not a trivial matter for you ; on the contrary , it is your life ! Through it you will live long in the land you are crossing the Yarden to possess. ” ( Maftir )
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	48	That same day Adonai said to Moshe ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	49	“ Go up into the ‘ Avarim Range , to Mount N ’ vo , in the land of Mo ’ av across from Yericho ; and look out over the land of Kena ‘ an , which I am giving the people of Isra ’ el as a possession .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	50	On the mountain you are ascending you will die and be gathered to your people , just as Aharon your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	51	The reason for this is that both of you broke faith with me there among the people of Isra ’ el at the M ’ rivat-Kadesh Spring , in the Tzin Desert ; you failed to demonstrate my holiness there among the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Deuteronomy	32	52	So you will see the land from a distance , but you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Isra ’ el. ” Haftarah Ha ’ azinu : Sh ’ mu ’ el Bet (
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	33	This is the blessing that Moshe , the man of God , spoke over the people of Isra ’ el before his death :
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	54	: V ’ Zot HaBrachah ( This is the blessing ) 33:1–34:12
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	2	“ Adonai came from Sinai ; from Se ‘ ir he dawned on his people , shone forth from Mount Pa ’ ran ; and with him were myriads of holy ones ; at his right hand was a fiery law for them .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	3	He truly loves the peoples — all his holy ones are in your hand ; sitting at your feet , they receive your instruction ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	4	the Torah Moshe commanded us as an inheritance for the community of Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	5	Then a king arose in Yeshurun when the leaders of the people were gathered , all the tribes of Isra ’ el together .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	6	“ Let Re ’ uven live and not die out , even though his numbers grow few. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	7	Of Y ’ hudah he said : “ Hear , Adonai , the cry of Y ’ hudah ! Bring him in to his people , let his own hands defend him ; but you , help him against his enemies. ” ( ii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	8	Of Levi he said : “ Let your tumim and urim be with your pious one , whom you tested at Massah , with whom you struggled at M ’ rivah Spring .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	9	Of his father and mother he said , ‘ I don ’ t know them ’ ; he didn ’ t acknowledge his brothers or children . For he observed your word , and he kept your covenant .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	10	They will teach Ya ‘ akov your rulings , Isra ’ el your Torah . They will set incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	11	Adonai , bless his possessions , accept the work he does ; but crush his enemies hip and thigh ; may those who hate him rise no more. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	12	Of Binyamin he said : “ Adonai ’ s beloved lives securely . He protects him day after day . He lives between his shoulders. ” ( iii )
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	13	Of Yosef he said : “ May Adonai bless his land with the best from the sky , for the dew , and for what comes from the deep beneath ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	14	with the best of what the sun makes grow , with the best of what comes up each month ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	15	with the best from the mountains of old , with the best from the eternal hills ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	16	with the best from the earth and all that fills it , and the favor of him who lived in the [ burning ] bush . May blessing come on the head of Yosef , on the brow of the prince among his brothers .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	17	His firstborn bull — glory is his ; his horns are those of a wild ox ; With them he will gore the peoples , all of them , to the ends of the earth . These are the myriads of Efrayim ; these are the thousands of M ’ nasheh. ” ( iv )
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	18	Of Z ’ vulun he said : “ Rejoice , Z ’ vulun , as you go forth , and you , Yissakhar , in your tents .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	19	They will summon peoples to the mountain and there offer righteous sacrifices ; for they will draw from the abundance of the seas and from the hidden treasures of the sand. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	20	Of Gad he said : “ Blessed is he who makes Gad so large ; he lies there like a lion , tearing arm and scalp .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	21	He chose the best for himself when the princely portion was assigned . When the leaders of the people came , he carried out Adonai ’ s justice and his rulings concerning Isra ’ el. ” ( v )
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	22	Of Dan he said : “ Dan is a lion cub leaping forth from Bashan. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	23	Of Naftali he said : “ You , Naftali , satisfied with favor and full of blessing from Adonai , take possession of the sea and the south. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	24	Of Asher he said : “ May Asher be most blessed of sons , may he be the favorite among his brothers and bathe his feet in oil .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	25	May your bolts be of iron and bronze and your strength last as long as you live .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	26	“ Yeshurun , there is no one like God , riding through the heavens to help you , riding on the clouds in his majesty . ( vi )
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	27	The God of old is a dwelling-place , with everlasting arms beneath . He expelled the enemy before you and he said , ‘ Destroy ! ’
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	28	So Isra ’ el lives in security ; the fountain of Ya ‘ akov is alone in a land of grain and new wine , where the skies drip with dew .
CJB	Deuteronomy	33	29	Happy are you , Isra ’ el ! “ Who is like you , a people saved by Adonai , your defender helping you and your sword of triumph ? Your enemies will cringe before you , but you will trample down their high places . ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	34	( vii ) Moshe ascended from the plains of Mo ’ av to Mount N ’ vo , to the summit of Pisgah , across from Yericho . There Adonai showed him all the land — Gil ‘ ad as far as Dan ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	2	all Naftali , the land of Efrayim and M ’ nasheh , the land of Y ’ hudah all the way to the sea beyond ,
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	3	the Negev , and the ‘ Aravah , including the valley where Yericho , the City of Date-Palms , as far away as Tzo ‘ ar .
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	4	Adonai said to him , “ This is the land concerning which I swore to Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov , ‘ I will give it to your descendants. ’ I have let you see it with your eyes , but you will not cross over there. ”
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	5	So Moshe , the servant of Adonai , died there in the land of Mo ’ av , as Adonai had said .
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	6	He was buried in the valley across from Beit-P ‘ or in the land of Mo ’ av , but to this day no one knows where his grave is .
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	7	Moshe was
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	120	years old when he died , with eyes undimmed and vigor undiminished .
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	8	The people of Isra ’ el mourned Moshe on the plains of Mo ’ av for thirty days ; after this , the days of crying and mourning for Moshe ended .
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	9	Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun was full of the Spirit of wisdom , for Moshe had laid his hands on him , and the people of Isra ’ el heeded him and did what Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	10	Since that time there has not arisen in Isra ’ el a prophet like Moshe , whom Adonai knew face to face .
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	11	What signs and wonders Adonai sent him to perform in the land of Egypt upon Pharaoh , all his servants and all his land !
CJB	Deuteronomy	34	12	What might was in his hand ! What great terror he evoked before the eyes of all Isra ’ el ! Haftarah V ’ zot HaBrachah : Y ’ hoshua ( Joshua ) 1:1–18 ( A ) ; 1:1–9 ( S ) B ’ rit Hadashah suggested readings for Parashah V ’ zot HaBrachah : Mattityahu ( Matthew ) 17:1–9 ; Mark 9:2–10 ; Luke 9:28–36 ; Y ’ hudah ( Jude ) 3–4 , 8–10 Hazak , hazak , v ’ nit ’ chazek ! Be strong , be strong , and let us be strengthened !
CJB	Joshua	1	1	After the death of Moshe the servant of Adonai , Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun , Moshe ’ s assistant ,
CJB	Joshua	1	2	“ Moshe my servant is dead . So now , get up and cross over this Yarden , you and all the people , to the land I am giving to them , the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	1	3	I am giving you every place you will step on with the sole of your foot , as I said to Moshe .
CJB	Joshua	1	4	All the land from the desert and the L ’ vanon to the great river , the Euphrates River — all the land of the Hitti — and on to the Great Sea in the west will be your territory .
CJB	Joshua	1	5	No one will be able to withstand you as long as you live . Just as I was with Moshe , so I will be with you . I will neither fail you nor abandon you .
CJB	Joshua	1	6	“ Be strong , be bold ; for you will cause this people to inherit the land I swore to their fathers I would give them .
CJB	Joshua	1	7	Only be strong and very bold in taking care to follow all the Torah which Moshe my servant ordered you to follow ; do not turn from it either to the right or to the left ; then you will succeed wherever you go .
CJB	Joshua	1	8	Yes , keep this book of the Torah on your lips , and meditate on it day and night , so that you will take care to act according to everything written in it . Then your undertakings will prosper , and you will succeed .
CJB	Joshua	1	9	Haven ’ t I ordered you , ‘ Be strong , be bold ’ ? So don ’ t be afraid or downhearted , because Adonai your God is with you wherever you go. ”
CJB	Joshua	1	10	Y ’ hoshua instructed the officials of the people
CJB	Joshua	1	11	to go through the camp and order the people , “ Prepare provisions , because in three days you will cross this Yarden to go in and take possession of the land Adonai your God is giving you. ”
CJB	Joshua	1	12	To the Re ’ uveni , the Gadi and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh Y ’ hoshua said ,
CJB	Joshua	1	13	“ Remember what Moshe the servant of Adonai ordered you : ‘ Adonai your God has let you rest and will give you this land. ’
CJB	Joshua	1	14	Your wives , your little ones and your livestock will stay in the land Moshe gave you on the east side of the Yarden ; but you are to cross over armed as a fighting force ahead of your brothers , to help them ;
CJB	Joshua	1	15	until Adonai allows your brothers to rest , as he has allowed you ; and they too have taken possession of the land Adonai your God is giving them . At that point , you will return to the land which is yours and possess it , the land Moshe the servant of Adonai gave you in ‘ Ever-HaYarden to the east , toward the sunrise. ”
CJB	Joshua	1	16	They answered Y ’ hoshua , “ We will do everything you have ordered us to do , and we will go wherever you send us .
CJB	Joshua	1	17	Just as we listened to everything Moshe said , so will we listen to you . Only may Adonai your God be with you as he was with Moshe .
CJB	Joshua	1	18	If anyone rebels against your order and doesn ’ t heed what you say in every detail of your order , he will be put to death . Just be strong , be bold ! ”
CJB	Joshua	2	2	The king of Yericho was told about it — “ Tonight some men from Isra ’ el came here to reconnoiter the land. ”
CJB	Joshua	2	3	The king of Yericho sent a message to Rachav , “ Bring out the men who came to you and are staying in your house , because they have come to reconnoiter all the land. ”
CJB	Joshua	2	4	However , the woman , after taking the two men and hiding them , replied , “ Yes , the men did come to me ; but I didn ’ t know where they had come from .
CJB	Joshua	2	5	The men left around the time when they shut the gate , when it was dark . Where they went I don ’ t know ; but if you chase after them quickly , you will overtake them. ”
CJB	Joshua	2	6	Actually she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax she had spread out there .
CJB	Joshua	2	7	The men pursued them all the way to the fords at the Yarden ; as soon as the pursuit party had left , the gate was shut .
CJB	Joshua	2	8	The two men had not yet lain down when she returned to the roof
CJB	Joshua	2	9	and said to them , “ I know that Adonai has given you the land . Fear of you has fallen on us ; everyone in the land is terrified at the thought of you .
CJB	Joshua	2	10	We ’ ve heard how Adonai dried up the water in the Sea of Suf ahead of you , when you left Egypt ; and what you did to the two kings of the Emori on the other side of the Yarden , Sichon and ‘ Og , that you completely destroyed them .
CJB	Joshua	2	11	As soon as we heard it , our hearts failed us . Because of you , everyone is in a state of depression . For Adonai your God — he is God in heaven above and on the earth below .
CJB	Joshua	2	12	So , please , swear to me by Adonai that , since I have been kind to you , you will also be kind to my father ’ s family . Give me some evidence of your good faith ,
CJB	Joshua	2	13	that you will spare the lives of my father , mother , brothers and sisters and all who are theirs , so that we won ’ t be killed. ”
CJB	Joshua	2	14	The men replied to her , “ Our lives are certainly worth yours , provided you don ’ t betray our mission . So when Adonai gives us the land , we will treat you kindly and in good faith. ”
CJB	Joshua	2	15	Then she lowered them by a rope through the window ; since her house abutted the city wall , indeed was actually built into it .
CJB	Joshua	2	16	She told them , “ Head for the hills , so that the pursuit party won ’ t get their hands on you ; and hide yourselves there for three days , until the pursuers have returned . After that , you can go on your way. ”
CJB	Joshua	2	17	The men said to her , “ We will not be guilty of violating the oath you made us swear , provided that
CJB	Joshua	2	18	when we enter the land , you tie this piece of scarlet cord in the window you let us down from ; and you gather together in your house your father , mother , brothers , and your father ’ s entire household .
CJB	Joshua	2	19	If anyone goes out the doors of your house into the street , he will be responsible for his own blood , and we will be guiltless . But everyone who stays with you in the house — we will be responsible for his blood if anyone lays a hand on him .
CJB	Joshua	2	20	However , if you say a word about this business of ours , then we will be free of your oath that you made us swear. ”
CJB	Joshua	2	21	“ According to your words , so be it , ” she said , and sent them away . As they departed , she tied the scarlet cord in the window .
CJB	Joshua	2	22	They left , arrived in the hills , and stayed there three days , until the pursuers had returned . The pursuers had searched for them all the way but hadn ’ t found them .
CJB	Joshua	2	23	Then the two men returned . Descending from the hills they crossed over and came to Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun , and reported everything that had happened to them .
CJB	Joshua	2	24	“ Truly Adonai has handed over all the land to us , ” they told Y ’ hoshua . “ Everyone in the land is terrified that we ’ re coming . ”
CJB	Joshua	3	3	and gave the people these orders : “ When you see the ark for the covenant of Adonai your God and the cohanim , who are L ’ vi ’ im , carrying it , you are to leave your position and follow it .
CJB	Joshua	3	2	After three days , the officials circulated through the camp
CJB	Joshua	3	4	But keep a distance between yourelves and it of about a thousand yards — don ’ t come any closer , so that you will understand which way to go , because you haven ’ t gone this way before. ”
CJB	Joshua	3	5	Y ’ hoshua said to the people , “ Consecrate yourselves , because tomorrow Adonai is going to work wonders among you. ”
CJB	Joshua	3	6	Then Y ’ hoshua said to the cohanim , “ Take the ark for the covenant , and go on ahead of the people. ” They took the ark for the covenant and went ahead of the people .
CJB	Joshua	3	7	Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua , “ Starting today , I will make you great in full view of all Isra ’ el ; so that they will know that just as I was with Moshe , so I will be with you .
CJB	Joshua	3	8	Now you are to order the cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant as follows : ‘ When you come to the edge of the Yarden River , you are to stop in the Yarden itself. ’ ”
CJB	Joshua	3	9	Y ’ hoshua said to the people of Isra ’ el , “ Come here , and listen to the words of Adonai your God. ”
CJB	Joshua	3	10	Then Y ’ hoshua said , “ Here is how you will know that the living God is here with you and that , without fail , he will drive out from before you the Kena ‘ ani , the Hitti , the Hivi , the P ’ rizi , the Girgashi , the Emori and the Y ’ vusi :
CJB	Joshua	3	11	the ark for the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going on ahead of you across the Yarden .
CJB	Joshua	3	12	Now choose yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Isra ’ el , one man for each tribe .
CJB	Joshua	3	13	As soon as the cohanim carrying the ark of Adonai , the Lord of all the earth , put the soles of their feet in the water of the Yarden , the water of the Yarden will be cut off upstream and stand piled up like an embankment. ”
CJB	Joshua	3	14	So the people left their tents to cross the Yarden , with the cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant ahead of the people .
CJB	Joshua	3	15	When those carrying the ark had come to the Yarden , and the cohanim carrying the ark had waded into the water ( for throughout harvest season the Yarden overflows its banks ) ,
CJB	Joshua	3	16	the water upstream stood piled up like an embankment for a great distance at Adam , the city next to Tzartan ; so that the water flowing downstream toward the Sea of the ‘ Aravah , the Dead Sea , was completely cut off ; and the people crossed over right by Yericho .
CJB	Joshua	3	17	The cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant of Adonai stood fast on dry ground in the middle of the Yarden , while all Isra ’ el crossed on dry ground , until the entire nation had finished crossing the Yarden .
CJB	Joshua	4	4	Y ’ hoshua called the twelve men whom he had chosen from the people of Isra ’ el , a man from every tribe ,
CJB	Joshua	4	2	“ Take for yourselves from the people twelve men , a man from every tribe ;
CJB	Joshua	4	3	and give them this order : ‘ Take twelve stones from the middle of the Yarden riverbed , where the cohanim are standing , carry them over with you and set them down in the place where you will camp tonight. ’ ”
CJB	Joshua	4	5	and said to them , “ Go on ahead of the ark of Adonai your God into the riverbed of the Yarden . Then , each of you take a stone on his shoulder , corresponding to the number of tribes of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	4	6	This will be a sign for you . In the future , when your children ask , ‘ What do you mean by these stones ? ’
CJB	Joshua	4	7	you will answer them , ‘ It ’ s because the water in the Yarden was cut off before the ark for the covenant of Adonai ; when it crossed the Yarden , the water in the Yarden was cut off ; and these stones are to be a reminder for the people of Isra ’ el forever. ’ ”
CJB	Joshua	4	8	The people of Isra ’ el did just as Y ’ hoshua had ordered . They took twelve stones out of the Yarden riverbed , as Adonai had said to Y ’ hoshua , corresponding to the number of the tribes of the people of Isra ’ el , carried them over with them to the place where they were camping , and set them down there .
CJB	Joshua	4	9	Y ’ hoshua also set up twelve stones in the Yarden River itself , in the place where the feet of the cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant had stood . They are there to this day .
CJB	Joshua	4	10	The cohanim carrying the ark stood in the Yarden riverbed until Y ’ hoshua had finished saying to the people everything that Adonai had ordered him to say , in keeping with everything that Moshe had ordered Y ’ hoshua ; then the people hurried across .
CJB	Joshua	4	11	When all the people had finished crossing , the ark of Adonai passed on , and the cohanim , ahead of the people .
CJB	Joshua	4	12	The descendants of Re ’ uven , the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh went on , armed , ahead of the people of Isra ’ el , as Moshe had said to them ;
CJB	Joshua	4	13	some 40,000 armed soldiers ready for battle crossed in the presence of Adonai to the plains of Yericho .
CJB	Joshua	4	14	That day Adonai made Y ’ hoshua great in full view of all Isra ’ el . They were in awe of him , just as they had been in awe of Moshe all his life .
CJB	Joshua	4	15	Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua ,
CJB	Joshua	4	16	“ Order the cohanim carrying the ark for the testimony to come up out of the Yarden. ”
CJB	Joshua	4	17	So Y ’ hoshua ordered the cohanim , “ Come up out of the Yarden ! ”
CJB	Joshua	4	18	The cohanim carrying the ark for the covenant of Adonai came up from the Yarden riverbed , and as soon as the soles of the feet of the cohanim touched dry ground , the water of the Yarden returned to its place and the river overflowed its banks as it had before .
CJB	Joshua	4	19	The people came up out of the Yarden on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal , by the eastern boundary of Yericho .
CJB	Joshua	4	20	Those twelve stones which they took out of the Yarden , Y ’ hoshua piled up at Gilgal .
CJB	Joshua	4	21	Then he said to the people of Isra ’ el , “ In the future , when your children ask their fathers what these stones mean ,
CJB	Joshua	4	22	you are to explain it to them by saying , ‘ Isra ’ el came over this Yarden on dry land .
CJB	Joshua	4	23	For Adonai your God dried up the water in the Yarden from in front of you , until you had crossed , just as Adonai your God did to the Sea of Suf , which he dried up from in front of us , until we had crossed .
CJB	Joshua	4	24	From this all the peoples of the earth can know that the hand of Adonai is strong , and you can fear Adonai your God forever . ’ ”
CJB	Joshua	5	5	For although all the people who left Egypt had been circumcised , all those who had been born in the desert on the way as they went on from Egypt had not been circumcised ;
CJB	Joshua	5	2	It was at that time that Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua , “ Make yourself knives of flint , and circumcise the people of Isra ’ el again , a second time .
CJB	Joshua	5	3	So Y ’ hoshua made himself knives of flint and circumcised the people of Isra ’ el at Giv ‘ at-Ha ‘ Aralot [ the hill of foreskins ] .
CJB	Joshua	5	4	The reason Y ’ hoshua circumcised was that all the people who had left Egypt who were males , all the fighting men , had died in the desert along the way after leaving Egypt .
CJB	Joshua	5	6	because the people of Isra ’ el walked forty years in the desert until the whole nation , that is , the fighting men who had left Egypt , had died out ; because they had not heeded what Adonai said . Adonai had sworn that he would not allow them to see the land which Adonai swore to their ancestors that he would give us , a land flowing with milk and honey .
CJB	Joshua	5	7	So he raised up their children to take their place , and it was these whom Y ’ hoshua circumcised ; till then they had been uncircumcised , because they had not been circumcised while traveling .
CJB	Joshua	5	8	When all the nation had been circumcised , every one of them , they stayed where they were in camp until they had healed .
CJB	Joshua	5	9	Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua , “ Today I have rolled off from you the stigma of Egypt. ” This is why the place has been called Gilgal [ rolling ] ever since .
CJB	Joshua	5	10	The people of Isra ’ el camped at Gilgal , and they observed Pesach on the fourteenth day of the month , there on the plains of Yericho .
CJB	Joshua	5	11	The day after Pesach they ate what the land produced , matzah and roasted ears of grain that day .
CJB	Joshua	5	12	The following day , after they had eaten food produced in the land , the man ended . From then on the people of Isra ’ el no longer had man ; instead , that year , they ate the produce of the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Joshua	5	13	One day , when Y ’ hoshua was there by Yericho , he raised his eyes and looked ; and in front of him stood a man with his drawn sword in his hand . Y ’ hoshua went over to him and asked him , “ Are you on our side or on the side of our enemies ? ”
CJB	Joshua	5	14	“ No , ” he replied , “ but I am the commander of Adonai ’ s army ; I have come just now. ” Y ’ hoshua fell down with his face to the ground and worshipped him , then asked , “ What does my lord have to say to his servant ? ”
CJB	Joshua	5	15	The commander of Adonai ’ s army answered Y ’ hoshua , “ Take your sandals off your feet , because the place where you are standing is holy. ” And Y ’ hoshua did so .
CJB	Joshua	6	6	Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun called the cohanim and told them , “ Take up the ark for the covenant , and have seven cohanim carry seven shofars ahead of the ark of Adonai. ”
CJB	Joshua	6	2	Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua , “ I have handed Yericho over to you , including its king and his warriors .
CJB	Joshua	6	3	You are to encircle the city with all your soldiers and march around it once . Do this for six days .
CJB	Joshua	6	4	Seven cohanim are to carry seven shofars in front of the ark . On the seventh day you are to march around the city seven times , and the cohanim will blow the shofars .
CJB	Joshua	6	5	Then they are to blow a long blast on the shofar . On hearing the sound of the shofar , all the people are to shout as loudly as they can ; and the wall of the city will fall down flat . Then the people are to go up into the city , each one straight from where he stands. ”
CJB	Joshua	6	7	To the people he said , “ Move on , encircle the city , and have the army march ahead of the ark of Adonai. ”
CJB	Joshua	6	8	When Y ’ hoshua had spoken to the people , the seven cohanim carrying the seven shofars before Adonai passed on and blew on the shofars , with the ark for the covenant of Adonai following them .
CJB	Joshua	6	9	The fighting men went ahead of the cohanim blowing the shofars , while the rearguard marched after the ark , with incessant blowing on the shofars .
CJB	Joshua	6	10	Y ’ hoshua gave this order to the people : “ Don ’ t shout , don ’ t let your voice be heard , don ’ t let a single word out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout ; then you will shout. ”
CJB	Joshua	6	11	So he had the ark of Adonai make a circle around the city , going around it once ; then they returned to camp and stayed in the camp .
CJB	Joshua	6	12	The next morning Y ’ hoshua got up early , and the cohanim took up the ark of Adonai .
CJB	Joshua	6	13	The seven cohanim carrying the seven shofars ahead of the ark of Adonai went on , continually blowing on their shofars , with the fighting men marching ahead of them and the rearguard following after the ark of Adonai ; all the while the blowing on the shofars was incessant .
CJB	Joshua	6	14	The second day , they went around the city once and returned to camp . They did the same for six days .
CJB	Joshua	6	15	On the seventh day , they got up early , at sunrise , and went around the city in the same way seven times . That was the only day they encircled the city seven times .
CJB	Joshua	6	16	The seventh time , when the cohanim blew on their shofars , Y ’ hoshua said to the people , “ Shout ! because Adonai has given you the city !
CJB	Joshua	6	17	But the city and everything in it is to be set aside for Adonai and therefore to be destroyed completely ; only Rachav the prostitute is to be spared , she and everyone with her in her house , because she hid the messengers we sent .
CJB	Joshua	6	18	So you , keep clear of everything reserved for destruction . If you bring a curse on yourselves by taking anything set aside to be destroyed , you will bring a curse on the whole camp of Isra ’ el and cause great distress there .
CJB	Joshua	6	19	All the silver and gold , and all the brass and iron utensils are to be separated out for Adonai and added to the treasury of Adonai. ”
CJB	Joshua	6	20	So the people shouted , with the shofars blowing . When the people heard the sound of the shofars , the people let out a great shout ; and the wall fell down flat ; so that the people went up into the city , each one straight ahead of him ; and they captured the city .
CJB	Joshua	6	21	They completely destroyed everything in the city with the sword — men and women , young and old , cattle , sheep and donkeys .
CJB	Joshua	6	22	Y ’ hoshua said to the two men who had reconnoitered the land , “ Go into the prostitute ’ s house and bring the woman out with all that she has , as you swore to her. ”
CJB	Joshua	6	23	The young men , the spies , went in and brought out Rachav with her father , mother , brothers and all she had ; they brought out all her relatives and put them safely outside the camp of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	6	24	Then they burned the city to ashes with everything in it , except for the silver , the gold and the brass and iron utensils , which they put in the treasury of the house of Adonai .
CJB	Joshua	6	25	But Y ’ hoshua spared Rachav the prostitute , her father ’ s household and everything she had ; and she has continued living with Isra ’ el from then until now ; because she hid the messengers Y ’ hoshua had sent to reconnoiter Yericho .
CJB	Joshua	6	26	Y ’ hoshua then made the people take this oath : “ A curse before Adonai on anyone who rises up and rebuilds this city of Yericho : he will lay its foundation with the loss of his firstborn son and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son. ”
CJB	Joshua	6	27	So Adonai was with Y ’ hoshua , and people heard about him throughout the land .
CJB	Joshua	7	7	Y ’ hoshua said , “ Oh , Adonai Elohim ! Why did you take the trouble to bring this people across the Yarden if you meant to hand us over to the Emori and have us perish ? We should have been satisfied to live on the other side of the Yarden !
CJB	Joshua	7	2	Y ’ hoshua sent men from Yericho to ‘ Ai , which is next to Beit-Aven , east of Beit-El , telling them to go up and spy out the land . So the men went up , reconnoitered ‘ Ai ,
CJB	Joshua	7	3	returned to Y ’ hoshua and told him , “ Don ’ t have all the people go up ; but let perhaps two or three thousand men go up and attack ‘ Ai . There ’ s no point in making all the people exert themselves to get there , because there are only a few of them. ”
CJB	Joshua	7	4	So from the people about three thousand men went up there , but they were routed by the men of ‘ Ai .
CJB	Joshua	7	5	The men of ‘ Ai killed some thirty-six of them and chased them from before their gate all the way to Sh ’ varim , attacking them on the descent . The hearts of the people melted and turned to water .
CJB	Joshua	7	6	Y ’ hoshua tore his clothes and fell to his face on the ground before the ark of Adonai until evening , he and the leaders of Isra ’ el , and they put dust on their heads .
CJB	Joshua	7	8	Oh , Adonai ! What can I say , after Isra ’ el has turned their backs and retreated before their enemies ?
CJB	Joshua	7	9	For when the Kena ‘ ani and the other people living in the land hear about it , they will surround us and wipe us off the face of the earth . What will you do then to save the honor of your great name ? ”
CJB	Joshua	7	10	Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua , “ Stand up ! Why are you lying there face down ?
CJB	Joshua	7	11	Isra ’ el has sinned . Yes , they have violated my covenant , which I commanded them . They have taken some of what was to have been set aside for destruction . They have stolen it , lied about it and put it with their own things .
CJB	Joshua	7	12	This is why the people of Isra ’ el can not stand before their enemies . They turn their backs on their enemies , because they have come under a curse . I won ’ t be with you any more unless you destroy the things meant for destruction that you have with you .
CJB	Joshua	7	13	So get up , consecrate the people , and say , ‘ Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow ; for here is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : “ Isra ’ el , you have things under the curse of destruction among you ; and you will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove the things that were to have been destroyed from among you. ”
CJB	Joshua	7	14	Therefore , tomorrow morning you are to come forward , one tribe at a time ; the tribe Adonai takes is to come forward , one family at a time ; the family Adonai takes is to come forward , one household at a time ; and the household Adonai takes is to come forward , one person at a time .
CJB	Joshua	7	15	The person who is caught with things in his possession that were reserved for destruction is to be burned to ashes , he and everything he has , because he has violated the covenant of Adonai and has committed a shameful deed in Isra ’ el. ’ ”
CJB	Joshua	7	16	So Y ’ hoshua got up early in the morning and had Isra ’ el come forward , one tribe at a time ; and the tribe of Y ’ hudah was taken .
CJB	Joshua	7	17	He had the families of Y ’ hudah come forward and took the family of the Zarchi . He had the Zarchi family come forward by household leaders , and Zavdi was taken .
CJB	Joshua	7	18	He had his household come forward , one person at a time ; and ‘ Akhan the son of Karmi , the son of Zavdi , the son of Zerach , of the tribe of Y ’ hudah , was taken .
CJB	Joshua	7	19	Y ’ hoshua said to ‘ Akhan , “ My son , swear to Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , that you will tell the truth and confess to him . Tell me , now , what did you do ? Don ’ t hide anything from me. ”
CJB	Joshua	7	20	‘ Akhan answered Y ’ hoshua , “ It is true : I have sinned against Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el . Here is exactly what I did :
CJB	Joshua	7	21	when I saw there with the spoil a beautiful robe from Shin ‘ ar , five pounds of silver shekels and a one-and-a-quarter-pound wedge of gold , I really wanted them . So I took them . You will find them hidden in the ground inside my tent , with the silver underneath. ”
CJB	Joshua	7	22	Y ’ hoshua sent messengers , who ran to the tent . It was all there , hidden in his tent , including the silver underneath .
CJB	Joshua	7	23	They took the things from inside the tent , brought them to Y ’ hoshua and all the people of Isra ’ el , and put them down before Adonai .
CJB	Joshua	7	24	Y ’ hoshua , together with all Isra ’ el , took ‘ Akhan , the son of Zerach , with the silver , the robe , the gold wedge , his sons , his daughters , his cattle , his donkeys , his sheep , his tent , and everything he had , and brought them up to the Akhor Valley .
CJB	Joshua	7	25	Y ’ hoshua said , “ Why have you brought trouble on us ? Today Adonai will bring trouble on you ! ” Then all Isra ’ el stoned him to death ; they burned them to ashes and stoned them .
CJB	Joshua	7	26	Over him they piled a great mound of stones , which is there to this day . Finally Adonai turned away from his fierce anger . And this is why that place is called the Valley of Akhor [ trouble ] to this day .
CJB	Joshua	8	8	When you have captured the city , you are to set it on fire ; do according to what Adonai has said . Those are your orders. ”
CJB	Joshua	8	2	Do to ‘ Ai and its king as you did to Yericho and its king ; but this time , take its spoil and cattle as booty for yourselves . Ambush the city from behind. ”
CJB	Joshua	8	3	So Y ’ hoshua set out for ‘ Ai with all the people who could fight . Y ’ hoshua chose 30,000 men , the most courageous of his troops , and sent them out by night .
CJB	Joshua	8	4	He instructed them , “ You are to lie in wait to ambush the city from behind . Stay close to the city ; and all of you , be ready .
CJB	Joshua	8	5	I and all the troops with me will approach the city ; and when they come out to attack us , as they did before , we will run away from them .
CJB	Joshua	8	6	They will chase after us until we have drawn them away from the city ; because they will say , ‘ They ’ re running away from us , as they did before ’ ; so we ’ ll run away from them .
CJB	Joshua	8	7	Then you will jump up from your ambush position and take possession of the city , for Adonai your God will hand it over to you .
CJB	Joshua	8	9	Y ’ hoshua sent them out ; and they went to the place for the ambush , staying between Beit-El and ‘ Ai , to the west of ‘ Ai ; while Y ’ hoshua camped that night with the people .
CJB	Joshua	8	10	Y ’ hoshua got up early in the morning , mustered his men and went up to ‘ Ai ahead of the people , he and the leaders of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	8	11	All the troops marching with him went up , advanced , arrived in front of the city and camped on the north side of ‘ Ai , with a valley between him and ‘ Ai .
CJB	Joshua	8	12	Then he took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Beit-El and ‘ Ai , to the west of ‘ Ai .
CJB	Joshua	8	13	Thus the people arrayed themselves , with all the army to the north of the city , and their rearguard lying in wait to the west of the city . Y ’ hoshua spent that night in the valley .
CJB	Joshua	8	14	The king of ‘ Ai saw this , so the men in the city hurried out early in the morning to battle against Isra ’ el , he and all his people , at a meeting-place facing the ‘ Aravah . But he was unaware that behind the city an ambush had been laid against him .
CJB	Joshua	8	15	Y ’ hoshua and all Isra ’ el made as if they had been defeated before them and ran off on the road to the desert .
CJB	Joshua	8	16	All the people in ‘ Ai were summoned together to pursue them , so they chased Y ’ hoshua and were drawn away from the city .
CJB	Joshua	8	17	Not a man was left in ‘ Ai or Beit-El who had not gone after Isra ’ el ; pursuing Isra ’ el , they left the city wide open .
CJB	Joshua	8	18	Then Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua , “ Point the spear in your hand toward ‘ Ai , because I will hand it over to you. ” Y ’ hoshua pointed the spear in his hand toward the city .
CJB	Joshua	8	19	The men in ambush jumped up quickly from their place ; the moment he stretched out his hand , they ran , entered the city and captured it ; and they hurried to set the city on fire .
CJB	Joshua	8	20	When the men of ‘ Ai looked behind them , they saw it — there was the smoke from the city , rising to the sky ; and they had no power to flee this way or that — at which point the people who had run off toward the desert turned back on the pursuers .
CJB	Joshua	8	21	When Y ’ hoshua and all Isra ’ el saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city was going up , they turned back and slaughtered the men of ‘ Ai ;
CJB	Joshua	8	22	while the others came out of the city against them too ; so that they were surrounded by Isra ’ el with some on this side and some on that side . They attacked them , allowing none to remain or escape .
CJB	Joshua	8	23	But they took the king of ‘ Ai alive and brought him to Y ’ hoshua .
CJB	Joshua	8	24	When Isra ’ el had finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of ‘ Ai in the countryside , in the desert where they had pursued them , and they had all fallen , consumed by the sword , then all Isra ’ el returned to ‘ Ai and defeated it with the sword .
CJB	Joshua	8	25	Twelve thousand men and women fell that day , everyone in ‘ Ai .
CJB	Joshua	8	26	For Y ’ hoshua did not withdraw his hand , which he had used to point the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ‘ Ai .
CJB	Joshua	8	27	Only the livestock and the spoil of that city did Isra ’ el take as booty for themselves , in keeping with the order Adonai had given Y ’ hoshua .
CJB	Joshua	8	28	So Y ’ hoshua burned down ‘ Ai and turned it into a tel forever , so that it remains a ruin to this day .
CJB	Joshua	8	29	The king of ‘ Ai he hanged on a tree until evening ; at sundown Y ’ hoshua gave an order , so they took his carcass down from the tree , threw it at the entrance of the city gate and piled on it a big heap of stones , which is there to this day .
CJB	Joshua	8	30	Then Y ’ hoshua built an altar to Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , on Mount ‘ Eival ,
CJB	Joshua	8	31	as Moshe the servant of Adonai had ordered the people of Isra ’ el to do ( this is written in the book of the Torah of Moshe ) , an altar of uncut stones that no one had touched with an iron tool . On it they offered burnt offerings to Adonai and sacrificed peace offerings .
CJB	Joshua	8	32	He wrote there on the stones a copy of the Torah of Moshe , inscribing it in the presence of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	8	33	Then all Isra ’ el , including their leaders , officials and judges , stood on either side of the ark in front of the cohanim , who were L ’ vi ’ im and who carried the ark for the covenant of Adonai . The foreigners were there along with the citizens . Half of the people were in front of Mount G ’ rizim and half of them in front of Mount ‘ Eival , as Moshe the servant of Adonai had ordered them earlier in connection with blessing the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	8	34	After this , he read all the words of the Torah , the blessing and the curse , according to everything written in the book of the Torah .
CJB	Joshua	8	35	There was not a word of everything Moshe had ordered that Y ’ hoshua did not read before all Isra ’ el assembled , including the women , the little ones and the foreigners living with them .
CJB	Joshua	9	9	They answered him , “ Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the reputation of Adonai your God . We have heard reports about him — everything he did in Egypt ,
CJB	Joshua	9	2	they joined forces to fight together against Y ’ hoshua and Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	9	3	But when the inhabitants of Giv ‘ ah heard what Y ’ hoshua had done to Yericho and ‘ Ai ,
CJB	Joshua	9	4	they developed a clever deception : they made themselves look as if they had been on a long journey by putting old sacks on their donkeys and taking used wineskins that had burst and been mended back together .
CJB	Joshua	9	5	They put old , patched sandals on their feet and dressed in worn-out clothes ; and took as provisions nothing but dried-up bread that was crumbling to pieces .
CJB	Joshua	9	6	Then they went to Y ’ hoshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Isra ’ el , “ We have come from a country far away . Now , make a covenant with us. ”
CJB	Joshua	9	7	The men of Isra ’ el said to the Hivi , “ How do we know that you don ’ t live here among us ? If you do , we don ’ t want to make a covenant with you. ”
CJB	Joshua	9	8	But they answered Y ’ hoshua , “ We are your servants. ” Y ’ hoshua asked , “ Who are you , and where do you come from ? ”
CJB	Joshua	9	10	and everything he did to the two kings of the Emori across the Yarden , Sichon king of Heshbon and ‘ Og king of Bashan at ‘ Ashtarot .
CJB	Joshua	9	11	So our leaders and all the people living in our country said to us , “ Take provisions with you for the journey , go to meet them , and say to them , ‘ We are your servants , and now make a covenant with us. ’
CJB	Joshua	9	12	Here is the bread which we took for our provisions . It was still warm when we took it out of our homes the day we left to come to you . Now look at it ! It ’ s dry and turned to crumbs !
CJB	Joshua	9	13	And these wineskins were new when we filled them , but look , now they ’ re torn . Likewise these clothes of ours and our shoes are worn out because of the very long journey. ”
CJB	Joshua	9	14	The men sampled some of their food but didn ’ t seek the advice of Adonai ,
CJB	Joshua	9	15	so Y ’ hoshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them to spare their lives , and the leading officials of the community swore to them .
CJB	Joshua	9	16	But three days later , after they had made the covenant with them , they heard that they were their neighbors , that they lived there with them .
CJB	Joshua	9	17	The people of Isra ’ el traveled and arrived at their cities on the third day . Their cities were Giv ‘ on , K ’ firah , Be ’ erot and Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim .
CJB	Joshua	9	18	The people of Isra ’ el did not attack them , because the leading officials of the community had sworn to them by Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el ; but all the community grumbled against the leaders .
CJB	Joshua	9	19	However , the leaders replied to the whole community , “ We have sworn to them by Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el ; so we can ’ t touch them .
CJB	Joshua	9	20	Here is what we will do to them : we will let them live , so that God ’ s anger will not be on us because of the oath we swore to them .
CJB	Joshua	9	21	Yes , let them live , ” the leaders continued , “ but let them chop wood and draw water for the whole community. ” This is what the leaders said .
CJB	Joshua	9	22	Y ’ hoshua summoned them and said this to them : “ Why have you deceived us by saying , ‘ We come from a place very far away , ’ when in fact you are living right here with us ?
CJB	Joshua	9	23	Now you have a curse on you : you will be slaves forever , supplying people to chop wood and draw water for the house of my God. ”
CJB	Joshua	9	24	They answered Y ’ hoshua , “ It is because we heard the reports that Adonai your God had ordered his servant Moshe to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from ahead of you . So we were terrified for our lives on account of you ; that ’ s why we did this .
CJB	Joshua	9	25	Now , as you see , we are in your hands ; do to us whatever seems good and right to you. ”
CJB	Joshua	9	26	So Y ’ hoshua did exactly that : he saved them from the power of the people of Isra ’ el , so that they didn ’ t kill them .
CJB	Joshua	9	27	But he did that same day make them choppers of wood and drawers of water for the community and for the altar of Adonai in the place which he would choose ; and they remain so to this day .
CJB	Joshua	10	10	Adonai threw them into confusion before Isra ’ el and defeated them in a great slaughter at Giv ‘ on , pursuing them along the road that goes up from Beit-Horon , and beating them back to ‘ Azekah and all the way to Makkedah .
CJB	Joshua	10	2	his people became greatly alarmed ; because Giv ‘ on was as large as one of the royal cities , larger than ‘ Ai , and all its men were courageous .
CJB	Joshua	10	3	So Adoni-Tzedek king of Yerushalayim sent this message to Hoham king of Hevron , Pir ’ am king of Yarmut , Yafia king of Lakhish and D ’ vir king of ‘ Eglon :
CJB	Joshua	10	4	“ Come up and help me , and we ’ ll attack Giv ‘ on , because it has made peace with Y ’ hoshua and the people of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Joshua	10	5	So the five kings of the Emori — the kings of Yerushalayim , Hevron , Yarmut , Lakhish and ‘ Eglon — got together , went up with all their armies , pitched camp against Giv ‘ on and made war against it .
CJB	Joshua	10	6	The people of Giv ‘ on sent a message to Y ’ hoshua at their camp in Gilgal that said , “ Don ’ t ignore your servants ! Come up to us quickly , and save us ! Help us , because all the kings of the Emori living in the hills have gotten together to fight us. ”
CJB	Joshua	10	7	Y ’ hoshua went up from Gilgal , he and all the fighting men with him , including all the bravest ones .
CJB	Joshua	10	8	Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua , “ Don ’ t be afraid of them , for I have handed them over to you ; not one of their men will stand against you. ”
CJB	Joshua	10	9	Having spent the entire night marching up from Gilgal , Y ’ hoshua fell upon them , taking them by surprise .
CJB	Joshua	10	11	As they fled before Isra ’ el down the road to Beit-Horon , Adonai threw huge hailstones down on them all the way to ‘ Azekah , and they died ; more died because of the hail than because Isra ’ el had killed them with the sword .
CJB	Joshua	10	12	Then , on the day Adonai handed over the Emori to the people of Isra ’ el , Y ’ hoshua spoke to Adona i ; in the sight of Isra ’ el he said , “ Sun , stand motionless over Giv ‘ on ! Moon , you too , over Ayalon Valley ! ”
CJB	Joshua	10	13	So the sun stood still and the moon stayed put , till Isra ’ el took vengeance on their enemies . This is written in the book of Yashar . The sun stood still in the sky and was in no rush to set for nearly a whole day .
CJB	Joshua	10	14	There has never been a day like that before or since , when Adonai listened to the voice of a man ; it happened because Adonai was fighting on Isra ’ el ’ s behalf .
CJB	Joshua	10	15	Y ’ hoshua returned with all Isra ’ el to the camp at Gilgal .
CJB	Joshua	10	16	But those five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah ,
CJB	Joshua	10	17	and it was reported to Y ’ hoshua that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah .
CJB	Joshua	10	18	Y ’ hoshua said , “ Roll big stones to the mouth of the cave , and put men there to guard them .
CJB	Joshua	10	19	However , you , don ’ t wait , but keep chasing your enemies , and attack those farthest in the rear . Don ’ t allow them to return to their cities , because Adonai has handed them over to you. ”
CJB	Joshua	10	20	After Y ’ hoshua and the people of Isra ’ el had finished killing them off in a very great slaughter , till they had been destroyed , and the remaining remnant had entered the fortified cities ,
CJB	Joshua	10	21	all the people returned safely to Y ’ hoshua at the camp in Makkedah ; and no one said a word against any of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	10	22	Then Y ’ hoshua said , “ Open up the mouth of the cave , and bring those five kings out of the cave to me .
CJB	Joshua	10	23	They did it ; they brought the five kings out to him — the kings of Yerushalayim , Hevron , Yarmut , Lakhish and ‘ Eglon .
CJB	Joshua	10	24	After they had brought the five kings to Y ’ hoshua , he summoned all the men of Isra ’ el and said to the commanders of the soldiers who had gone with him , “ Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings. ” They came and put their feet on their necks .
CJB	Joshua	10	25	Y ’ hoshua said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid or confused , but be strong and bold , because this is what Adonai will do to all your enemies that you fight against. ”
CJB	Joshua	10	26	With that , Y ’ hoshua struck them and put them to death , hanging them on five trees , where they remained hanging until evening .
CJB	Joshua	10	27	At sunset Y ’ hoshua gave an order , and they lowered them from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves , then laid big stones at the mouth of the cave ; and there they remain to this day .
CJB	Joshua	10	28	Y ’ hoshua captured Makkedah that day , defeating it and its king by the sword . He completely destroyed them , everyone there — he left no one ; and he did to the king of Makkedah what he had done to the king of Yericho .
CJB	Joshua	10	29	Y ’ hoshua went on from Makkedah , and all Isra ’ el with him , to Livnah ; and he fought against Livnah .
CJB	Joshua	10	30	Adonai also handed it and its king over to Isra ’ el . He defeated it with the sword , everyone there — he left no one , and he did to its king what he had done to the king of Yericho .
CJB	Joshua	10	31	Y ’ hoshua went on from Livnah , and all Isra ’ el with him , to Lakhish ; and he pitched camp against it and fought against it .
CJB	Joshua	10	32	Adonai handed it over to Isra ’ el ; he captured it the second day . He defeated it with the sword , everyone there , exactly as he had done to Livnah .
CJB	Joshua	10	33	But then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lakhish ; so Y ’ hoshua attacked him and his people , until he had no one left with him .
CJB	Joshua	10	34	Y ’ hoshua went on from Lakhish , and all Isra ’ el with him , to ‘ Eglon ; and he pitched camp against it and fought against it .
CJB	Joshua	10	35	They captured it that very day . He defeated it with the sword , completely destroying everyone there , exactly as he had done to Lakhish .
CJB	Joshua	10	36	Y ’ hoshua went up from ‘ Eglon , and all Isra ’ el with him , to Hevron ; and they fought against it .
CJB	Joshua	10	37	They captured it , defeating it with the sword , including its king , its villages and everyone there ; he left no one , exactly as he had done to ‘ Eglon ; but he completely destroyed it and everyone there .
CJB	Joshua	10	38	Y ’ hoshua turned back , and all Isra ’ el with him , to D ’ vir and fought against it .
CJB	Joshua	10	39	They captured it , its king and all its villages , defeating them with the sword and utterly destroying everyone there ; he left no one . He did to D ’ vir and it king as he had done to Hevron and as he had done to Livnah and its king .
CJB	Joshua	10	40	So Y ’ hoshua attacked all the land — the hills , the Negev , the Sh ’ felah and the mountain slopes — and all their kings ; he left none but completely destroyed everything that breathed , as Adonai the God of Isra ’ el had ordered .
CJB	Joshua	10	41	Y ’ hoshua attacked them from Kadesh-Barnea to ‘ Azah and all the land of Goshen , as far as Giv ‘ on .
CJB	Joshua	10	42	Y ’ hoshua captured all these kings and their land all at the same time , because Adonai the God of Isra ’ el fought on Isra ’ el ’ s behalf .
CJB	Joshua	10	43	Then Y ’ hoshua returned , and all Isra ’ el with him , to the camp at Gilgal .
CJB	Joshua	11	11	They put everyone there to death with the sword , completely destroying them ; there was nothing left that breathed ; and he burned Hatzor to the ground .
CJB	Joshua	11	2	the kings to the north , in the hills , in the ‘ Aravah south of Kinn ’ rot , in the Sh ’ felah and in the regions of Dor on the west ;
CJB	Joshua	11	3	the Kena ‘ ani to east and west ; the Emori , Hitti , P ’ rizi and Y ’ vusi in the hills ; and the Hivi at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mitzpah .
CJB	Joshua	11	4	So they set out , they and all their armies , many people , in number like the sand at the seashore , with very many horses and chariots .
CJB	Joshua	11	5	All these kings met together , then came and pitched camp together at the Merom Spring , to fight Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	11	6	Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua , “ Don ’ t be afraid on their account ; because at this time tomorrow I will hand them over , all of them dead , before Isra ’ el . You are to hamstring their horses and burn up their chariots. ”
CJB	Joshua	11	7	So Y ’ hoshua came against them suddenly with all his fighting men and fell on them at the Merom Spring .
CJB	Joshua	11	8	Adonai handed them over to Isra ’ el — they attacked and chased them to Greater Tzidon , Misrefot-Mayim and eastward to the Mitzpeh Valley ; they attacked them until none of them was left .
CJB	Joshua	11	9	Y ’ hoshua did to them what Adonai had ordered — he hamstrung their horses and burned up their chariots .
CJB	Joshua	11	10	Then Y ’ hoshua turned back and captured Hatzor , striking its king dead with the sword ; for in time past Hatzor had been the head of all those kingdoms .
CJB	Joshua	11	12	Y ’ hoshua captured all the cities of those kings and the kings as well ; he defeated them with the sword and completely destroyed them , as Moshe the servant of Adonai had ordered .
CJB	Joshua	11	13	But as for the cities built on their tels , Isra ’ el burned none of them except Hatzor ; Y ’ hoshua did burn that one .
CJB	Joshua	11	14	All the spoil of these cities and the livestock the people of Isra ’ el took as booty for themselves ; but every human being they put to death with the sword , until they had destroyed them — they left no one breathing .
CJB	Joshua	11	15	Moshe had given orders to Y ’ hoshua , just as Adonai had given orders to Moshe his servant , and Y ’ hoshua acted accordingly — he did everything Adonai had ordered Moshe .
CJB	Joshua	11	16	So Y ’ hoshua captured all that land , the hills , the Negev , all the land of Goshen , the Sh ’ felah , the ‘ Aravah and the Isra ’ el hills and Sh ’ felah ,
CJB	Joshua	11	17	from the bare mountain that goes up to Se ‘ ir to Ba ‘ al-Gad in the L ’ vanon Valley under Mount Hermon ; and he took all their kings , struck them and put them to death .
CJB	Joshua	11	18	Y ’ hoshua made war with all those kings for a long time .
CJB	Joshua	11	19	Not one city made peace with the people of Isra ’ el , except for the Hivi living in Giv ‘ on ; they took everything in battle .
CJB	Joshua	11	20	For it was Adonai who caused them to harden their hearts and come against Isra ’ el in battle , so that they would be utterly destroyed , so that they would not find favor but be destroyed , in keeping with the orders Adonai had given Moshe .
CJB	Joshua	11	21	Y ’ hoshua at that time came and cut off the ‘ Anakim from the land — from Hevron , D ’ vir , ‘ Anav and from all the hill-country of Y ’ hudah and Isra ’ el ; Y ’ hoshua utterly destroyed them and their cities .
CJB	Joshua	11	22	No ‘ Anakim were left in the land of the people of Isra ’ el — only in ‘ Azah , Gat and Ashdod did some remain .
CJB	Joshua	11	23	Y ’ hoshua took the whole land , in keeping with all that Adonai had said to Moshe and to Isra ’ el according to their divisions into tribes . Then the land rested from war .
CJB	Joshua	12	12	the king of ‘ Eglon , the king of Gezer ,
CJB	Joshua	12	2	Sichon king of the Emori , who lived in Heshbon and ruled the territory that includes ‘ Aro ‘ er , at the edge of the Arnon Valley ; the middle of the valley ; half of Gil ‘ ad , to the Yabok River , which forms the border with the people of ‘ Amon ;
CJB	Joshua	12	3	the ‘ Aravah to Lake Kinneret eastward and to the sea of the ‘ Aravah , the Dead Sea , eastward by way of Beit-Yeshimot and on the south under the slopes of Pisgah .
CJB	Joshua	12	4	There was also the territory of ‘ Og king of Bashan , who belonged to the remnant of the Refa ’ im . He lived at ‘ Ashtarot and at Edre ‘ i ;
CJB	Joshua	12	5	and he ruled Mount Hermon ; Salkhah ; all Bashan , to the border with the G ’ shuri and the Ma ‘ akhati ; and half of Gil ‘ ad , to its border with Sichon king of Heshbon .
CJB	Joshua	12	6	Moshe the servant of Adonai , with the people of Isra ’ el , defeated them ; and Moshe the servant of Adonai gave it to the Re ’ uveni , the Gadi and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh as their possession . 7-8 Following are the kings of the land whom Y ’ hoshua , with the people of Isra ’ el , defeated in the area west of the Yarden , between Ba ‘ al-Gad in the L ’ vanon Valley and the bare mountain that goes up to Se ‘ ir . Y ’ hoshua gave this land , inhabited by the Hitti , Emori , Kena ‘ ani , P ’ rizi , Hivi and Y ’ vusi , to the tribes of Isra ’ el to possess , according to their divisions , in the hills , the Sh ’ felah , the ‘ Aravah , the mountain slopes , the desert and the Negev :
CJB	Joshua	12	9	the king of Yericho , the king of ‘ Ai , by Beit-El ,
CJB	Joshua	12	10	the king of Yerushalayim , the king of Hevron ,
CJB	Joshua	12	11	the king of Yarmut , the king of Lakhish ,
CJB	Joshua	12	13	the king of D ’ vir , the king of Geder ,
CJB	Joshua	12	14	the king of Hormah , the king of ‘ Arad ,
CJB	Joshua	12	15	the king of Livnah , the king of ‘ Adulam ,
CJB	Joshua	12	16	the king of Makkedah , the king of Beit-El ,
CJB	Joshua	12	17	the king of Tapuach , the king of Hefer ,
CJB	Joshua	12	18	the king of Afek , the king of Sharon ,
CJB	Joshua	12	19	the king of Madon , the king of Hatzor ,
CJB	Joshua	12	20	the king of Shimron-M ’ ron , the king of Akhshaf ,
CJB	Joshua	12	21	the king of Ta ‘ anakh , the king of Megiddo ,
CJB	Joshua	12	22	the king of Kedesh , the king of Yokne ‘ am in Karmel ,
CJB	Joshua	12	23	the king of Dor in the region of Dor , the king of Goyim in the Gilgal , and
CJB	Joshua	12	24	the king of Tirtzah — making a total of thirty-one kings .
CJB	Joshua	13	13	However , the people of Isra ’ el expelled neither the G ’ shuri nor the Ma ‘ akhati , with the consequence that G ’ shur and Ma ‘ akhat have lived among Isra ’ el to this day .
CJB	Joshua	13	2	“ This is the land that still remains : all the regions of the P ’ lishtim and all the G ’ shuri ,
CJB	Joshua	13	3	from the Shichor which fronts Egypt , to the border of ‘ Ekron ( northward from there the land is considered as belonging to the Kena ‘ ani ) — that is , the territory of the rulers of the P ’ lishtim in ‘ Azah , Ashdod , Ashkelon , Gat and ‘ Ekron ; also the ‘ Avim
CJB	Joshua	13	4	to the south ; all the land of the Kena ‘ ani ; Me ‘ arah , which belongs to the Tzidonim , as far as Afek and on to the border with the Emori ;
CJB	Joshua	13	5	the land of the Givli ; all the L ’ vanon eastward , from Ba ‘ al-Gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamat .
CJB	Joshua	13	6	“ As for the inhabitants of the hills between the L ’ vanon and Misrefot-Mayim , that is , all the Tzidonim , I myself will expel them ahead of the people of Isra ’ el ; all you have to do is assign it to Isra ’ el as an inheritance , as I have ordered you .
CJB	Joshua	13	7	So now , divide this land as an inheritance for the nine tribes and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh. ”
CJB	Joshua	13	8	With the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh , the Re ’ uveni and the Gadi received their inheritance , which Moshe had given them , beyond the Yarden eastward , just as Moshe the servant of Adonai had given them —
CJB	Joshua	13	9	from ‘ Aro ‘ er on the edge of the Arnon Valley , the city in the middle of the valley , all the plateau between Meidva and Divon ,
CJB	Joshua	13	10	and all the cities of Sichon king of the Emori who ruled in Heshbon to the border with the people of ‘ Amon ;
CJB	Joshua	13	11	and Gil ‘ ad , the territory of the G ’ shuri and Ma ‘ akhati , all Mount Hermon , all Bashan as far as Salkhah —
CJB	Joshua	13	12	that is , all the kingdom of ‘ Og in Bashan , who ruled in ‘ Ashtarot and Edre ‘ i . ‘ Og was one of those remaining from the Refa ’ im , whom Moshe defeated and expelled .
CJB	Joshua	13	14	Only to the tribe of Levi did Moshe give no inheritance ; because the offerings made by fire for Adonai the God of Isra ’ el are its inheritance ; as [ Adonai ] had said to Moshe .
CJB	Joshua	13	15	Moshe gave land to the tribe of the descendants of Re ’ uven by clans .
CJB	Joshua	13	16	Their territory included ‘ Aro ‘ er on the edge of the Arnon Valley , the city in the middle of the valley , all the plateau near Meidva ,
CJB	Joshua	13	17	Heshbon and its villages on the plateau , Divon , Bamot-Ba ‘ al , Beit-Ba ‘ al-M ‘ on ,
CJB	Joshua	13	18	Yahatz , K ’ demot , Mefa ‘ at ,
CJB	Joshua	13	19	Kiryatayim , Sivmah , Tzeret-Shachar at the top of the valley ,
CJB	Joshua	13	20	Beit-P ‘ or , the slopes of Pisgah , Beit-Yeshimot ,
CJB	Joshua	13	21	all the cities of the plateau — all the kingdom of Sichon king of the Emori , who ruled in Heshbon . Moshe defeated him with the chiefs of Midyan , along with Evi , Rekem , Tzur , Hur and Reva the princes of Sichon who lived in the land .
CJB	Joshua	13	22	Along with the others the people of Isra ’ el killed with the sword , they also struck down Bil ‘ am the son of B ‘ or , who practiced divination .
CJB	Joshua	13	23	The Yarden formed the border for the descendants of Re ’ uven . This was the inheritance of the descendants of Re ’ uven by clans , with its cities and villages .
CJB	Joshua	13	24	Moshe gave land to the tribe of the Gad , to the descendants of Gad by clans .
CJB	Joshua	13	25	Their territory included Ya ‘ zer ; all the cities of Gil ‘ ad ; half the land of the people of ‘ Amon , as far as ‘ Aro ‘ er fronting Rabbah —
CJB	Joshua	13	26	that is , from Heshbon to Ramot-Mitzpeh and B ’ tonim ; and from Machanayim to the border of Lidvir ;
CJB	Joshua	13	27	while in the valley it included Beit-Haram , Beit-Nimrah , Sukkot and Tzafon — in other words , the rest of the kingdom of Sichon king of Heshbon ; with the Yarden to the far end of Lake Kinneret as its border , their territory extended eastward .
CJB	Joshua	13	28	This is the inheritance of the descendants of Gad by clans , with its cities and villages .
CJB	Joshua	13	29	Moshe gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of the M ’ nasheh ; it was for the half-tribe of the descendants of M ’ nasheh by clans .
CJB	Joshua	13	30	Their territory included Machanayim and all of Bashan — that is , all the kingdom of ‘ Og king of Bashan ; all the villages of Ya ’ ir in Bashan , sixty cities ;
CJB	Joshua	13	31	half of Gil ‘ ad ; and ‘ Ashtarot and Edre ‘ i , the cities of the kingdom of ‘ Og in Bashan . All this was for the descendants of Makhir the son of M ’ nasheh , or , rather , for half of the descendants of Makhir , by clans .
CJB	Joshua	13	32	These are the inheritances which Moshe distributed in the plains of Mo ’ av , beyond the Yarden and Yericho , eastward .
CJB	Joshua	13	33	But to the tribe of Levi Moshe gave no inheritance ; Adonai the God of Isra ’ el is their inheritance — as he told them .
CJB	Joshua	14	14	So Hevron became the inheritance of Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh the K ’ nizi , as it is to this day ; because he followed Adonai the God of Isra ’ el completely .
CJB	Joshua	14	2	by lot for them to inherit , as Adonai ordered through Moshe , for the nine tribes and the half-tribe .
CJB	Joshua	14	3	Moshe had already given the inheritances to the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Yarden ; to the L ’ vi ’ im he gave no inheritance among them .
CJB	Joshua	14	4	The descendants of Yosef constituted two tribes , M ’ nasheh and Efrayim ; and they gave no portion of the land to the L ’ vi ’ im except cities to live in , with the open land surrounding them for their livestock and crops .
CJB	Joshua	14	5	As Adonai had ordered Moshe , so the people of Isra ’ el did — they divided the land .
CJB	Joshua	14	6	The descendants of Y ’ hudah approached Y ’ hoshua in Gilgal , and Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh the K ’ nizi said to him , “ You know what Adonai told Moshe the man of God about me and you in Kadesh-Barnea .
CJB	Joshua	14	7	I was forty years old when Moshe the servant of Adonai sent me from Kadesh-Barnea to reconnoiter the land , and I brought back to him an honest report .
CJB	Joshua	14	8	My brothers who went up with me discouraged the people , but I followed Adonai my God completely .
CJB	Joshua	14	9	On that day Moshe swore , ‘ Surely the land where your foot has been will be the inheritance for you and your descendants forever , because you have followed Adonai my God completely. ’
CJB	Joshua	14	10	Now , look : Adonai has kept me alive these forty-five years , as he said he would , from the time Adonai said this to Moshe , when Isra ’ el was going through the desert . Today I am eighty-five years old ,
CJB	Joshua	14	11	but I am as strong today as on the day Moshe sent me — I ’ m as strong now as I was then , whether for war or simply for going here and there .
CJB	Joshua	14	12	Therefore , give me this hill , the one Adonai spoke about on that day ; for on that day you heard how the ‘ Anakim were there with great , fortified cities ; perhaps Adonai will be with me , and I will drive them away , as Adonai said. ”
CJB	Joshua	14	13	Y ’ hoshua blessed him and gave Hevron to Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh as his inheritance .
CJB	Joshua	14	15	( Hevron was formerly called Kiryat-Arba ; this Arba was the greatest man among the ‘ Anakim . ) Then the land had rest from war .
CJB	Joshua	15	15	From there he went up to fight the inhabitants of D ’ vir ( D ’ vir was formerly called Kiryat-Sefer ) .
CJB	Joshua	15	2	Their southern border began at the far shore of the Dead Sea , from the bay facing southward ,
CJB	Joshua	15	3	and went out south of the Scorpion Ascent , passed toward Tzin , went up south of Kadesh-Barnea , passed Hetzron , went up toward Adar , turned toward Karka ,
CJB	Joshua	15	4	passed toward ‘ Atzmon , and went out at the Vadi of Egypt , with the border ending at the sea ; this will be your southern border .
CJB	Joshua	15	5	The eastern border was the Dead Sea to where the Yarden entered it . The northern border began at the bay of the sea at the end of the Yarden ;
CJB	Joshua	15	6	then the border went up to Beit-Hoglah and passed north of Beit- ‘ Aravah ; next the border went up to the Stone of Bohan the son of Re ’ uven ;
CJB	Joshua	15	7	then the border went up to D ’ vir from the Akhor Valley , then northward facing Gilgal ( that is , across from Ma ‘ alei-Adumim , which is on the south side of the vadi ) ; next the border passed to the ‘ Ein-Shemesh Spring and went out at ‘ Ein-Rogel .
CJB	Joshua	15	8	Then the border went up the Ben-Hinnom Valley to the south side of the Y ’ vusi ( that is , Yerushalayim ) , and the border continued up to the top of the hill in front of the Hinnom Valley on the west ( which is also at the northernmost end of the Refa ’ im Valley )
CJB	Joshua	15	9	From this hilltop the border was drawn to the source of the Neftoach Spring and continued out to the cities of Mount ‘ Efron ; next the border was drawn to Ba ‘ alah ( that is , Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim ) .
CJB	Joshua	15	10	Then the border turned from Ba ‘ al westward to Mount Se ‘ ir , passed the spur of Mount Ye ‘ arim ( also called K ’ salon ) on the north , went down to Beit-Shemesh and passed Timnah .
CJB	Joshua	15	11	Next the border went out toward the side of ‘ Ekron northward ; and finally , the border was drawn to Shikron , passed Mount Ba ‘ alah , and went out at Yavne ’ el , with the border ending at the sea .
CJB	Joshua	15	12	As for the west border , the Great Sea was its border . These were the borders of the territory of the descendants of Y ’ hudah , by clans .
CJB	Joshua	15	13	To Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh he gave a portion with the descendants of Y ’ hudah , as Adonai had ordered Y ’ hoshua , namely , Kiryat-Arba ( Arba was the father of the ‘ Anak ) , also called Hevron .
CJB	Joshua	15	14	Kalev expelled from there three descendants of ‘ Anak — Sheshai , Achiman and Talmai , children of ‘ Anak .
CJB	Joshua	15	16	Kalev said , “ To whoever overpowers Kiryat-Sefer and captures it I will give my daughter Akhsah as his wife. ”
CJB	Joshua	15	17	‘ Otni ’ el the son of K ’ naz , Kalev ’ s brother , captured it ; so he gave him ‘ Akhsah his daughter as his wife .
CJB	Joshua	15	18	After becoming his wife , she persuaded him to ask her father to give them a field ; when she got off her donkey , Kalev asked her , “ What do you want ? ”
CJB	Joshua	15	19	She said to him : “ Give me a blessing : since you gave me land in the Negev , also give me sources of water. ” So Kalev gave her the Upper Springs and the Lower Springs .
CJB	Joshua	15	20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Y ’ hudah , by clans .
CJB	Joshua	15	21	The cities at the outer part of the tribe of Y ’ hudah toward the border with Edom in the south were : Kavtze ’ el , ‘ Eder , Yagur ,

CJB	Joshua	15	62	Nivshan , ‘ Ir-Hamelach and ‘ Ein-Gedi — six cities , together with their villages .
CJB	Joshua	15	63	As for the Y ’ vusi , who lived in Yerushalayim , the descendants of Y ’ hudah could not drive them out ; so the Y ’ vusi live with the descendants of Y ’ hudah in Yerushalayim to this day .
CJB	Joshua	16	16	The border of the territory chosen by lot for the descendants of Yosef began from the Yarden at Yericho , at the spring of Yericho on the east , went up from Yericho through the hills and desert to Beit-El ,
CJB	Joshua	16	2	went out from Beit-El to Luz , passed on to the border with the Arki to ‘ Atarot ,
CJB	Joshua	16	3	went down westward to the border with the Yafleti , to the border of Lower Beit-Horon , on to Gezer and ending at the sea .
CJB	Joshua	16	4	So the descendants of Yosef , M ’ nasheh and Efrayim took the inheritance .
CJB	Joshua	16	5	The border of the descendants of Efrayim according to their families was as follows : the eastern border of their inheritance began at ‘ Atrot-Adar and went to Upper Beit-Horon ;
CJB	Joshua	16	6	then the border extended westward , with Mikhm ’ tat on the north ; next the border turned eastward to Ta ’ anat-Shiloh and passed by it to the east of Yanochah ;
CJB	Joshua	16	7	then it went down from Yanochah to ‘ Atarot , went to Na ‘ arah , extended to Yericho and ended at the Yarden .
CJB	Joshua	16	8	From Tapuach the border went westward to Vadi Kanah and ended at the sea . This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Efrayim according to their families ,
CJB	Joshua	16	9	together with the cities set aside for the descendants of Efrayim inside the territory to be inherited by the descendants of M ’ nasheh , all the cities with their villages .
CJB	Joshua	16	10	They did not drive out the Kena ‘ ani living in Gezer , so the Kena ‘ ani live together with Efrayim to this day , having become slaves to do the heavy work .
CJB	Joshua	17	17	Then Y ’ hoshua said to the house of Yosef , to both Efrayim and M ’ nasheh , “ You are a great people with much power ; you will not have only one lot ,
CJB	Joshua	17	2	So the lot was drawn for the other descendants of M ’ nasheh according to their families — for the descendants of Avi ‘ ezer , Helek , Asri ’ el , Sh ’ khem , Hefer and Sh ’ mida ; these were the male descendants of M ’ nasheh according to their families .
CJB	Joshua	17	3	But Tz ’ lof ’ chad the son of Hefer , the son of Gil ‘ ad , the son of Makhir , the son of M ’ nasheh , had no sons , only daughters ; these are the names of his daughters : Machlah , No ‘ ah , Hoglah , Milkah and Tirtzah .
CJB	Joshua	17	4	They approached El ‘ azar the cohen , Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said , “ Adonai ordered Moshe to give us an inheritance together with our kinsmen. ” Therefore , in keeping with Adonai ’ s order , he gave them an inheritance together with the kinsmen of their father .
CJB	Joshua	17	5	Thus ten parts fell to M ’ nasheh , in addition to the land of Gil ‘ ad and Bashan beyond the Yarden ,
CJB	Joshua	17	6	because the daughters of M ’ nasheh had an inheritance along with his descendants ; but the land of Gil ‘ ad belonged to the rest of the descendants of M ’ nasheh .
CJB	Joshua	17	7	The border of M ’ nasheh began at Asher and went to Mikhm ’ tat , which is across from Sh ’ khem ; next the border went along to the right , to the people of ‘ Ein-Tapuach .
CJB	Joshua	17	8	The land of Tapuach belonged to M ’ nasheh , but Tapuach on the border of M ’ nasheh belonged to the descendants of Efrayim .
CJB	Joshua	17	9	The border descended to Vadi Kanah , south of the vadi , by cities which belonged to Efrayim among the cities of M ’ nasheh ; but the border with M ’ nasheh was on the north side of the vadi , and it ended at the sea .
CJB	Joshua	17	10	Southward it was Efrayim ’ s , northward it was M ’ nasheh ’ s , and the sea was its border ; while to the north they extended to Asher , and on the east to Yissakhar .
CJB	Joshua	17	11	In Asher and Yissakhar , M ’ nasheh had Beit-Sh ’ an and its villages ; Yivle ‘ am and its villages ; and the inhabitants of Dor and its villages , of ‘ Ein-Dor and its villages , of Ta ‘ anakh and its villages , and of Megiddo and its villages — three districts in all .
CJB	Joshua	17	12	But the descendants of M ’ nasheh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; the Kena ‘ ani wanted to stay in that land .
CJB	Joshua	17	13	After the people of Isra ’ el had become strong , they made the Kena ‘ ani do heavy labor but didn ’ t completely drive them out .
CJB	Joshua	17	14	Then the descendants of Yosef spoke to Y ’ hoshua ; they said , “ Why have you given me only one lot and only one portion to inherit ? After all , I am a great people , since Adonai has blessed me so. ”
CJB	Joshua	17	15	Y ’ hoshua answered them , “ If you are a great people , go up to the forest , and clear land for yourself there in the territory of the P ’ rizi and the Refa ’ im — since the hills of Efrayim don ’ t give you enough space. ”
CJB	Joshua	17	16	The descendants of Yosef replied , “ The hills won ’ t be enough for us ; and all the Kena ‘ ani living in the valleys have iron chariots — both those in Beit-Sh ’ an and its villages and those in the Yizre ‘ el Valley. ”
CJB	Joshua	17	18	but the hills too will be yours . Although it is a forest , you will clear it , and the resulting open land will be yours . You will drive out the Kena ‘ ani , even though they have iron chariots and are strong . ”
CJB	Joshua	18	18	passed alongside the ‘ Aravah , heading north ; and went down to the ‘ Aravah .
CJB	Joshua	18	2	There still remained among the people of Isra ’ el seven tribes that had not yet received their inheritance .
CJB	Joshua	18	3	Y ’ hoshua said to the people of Isra ’ el , “ How long will you delay going in to take possession of the land which Adonai the God of your ancestors has given you ?
CJB	Joshua	18	4	Appoint three men for each tribe ; I will commission them ; and they are to set out , go through the land and describe it according to their inheritance ; then they are to come back to me .
CJB	Joshua	18	5	They are to divide it into seven portions , with Y ’ hudah remaining in its territory to the south and the house of Yosef in their territory to the north .
CJB	Joshua	18	6	You will describe seven portions of land and bring the descriptions here to me ; then I will cast lots for you here before Adonai our God .
CJB	Joshua	18	7	But the L ’ vi ’ im have no share with you , because the office of cohen to Adonai is their inheritance ; and Gad and Re ’ uven and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh have received their inheritance beyond the Yarden to the east , which Moshe the servant of Adonai gave them. ”
CJB	Joshua	18	8	So the men got up and went . Y ’ hoshua gave them this commission as they left to describe the land : “ Go ; walk through the land ; and describe it ; then come back to me , and I will cast lots for you here before Adonai in Shiloh. ”
CJB	Joshua	18	9	The men went and passed through the land , surveying it by cities , dividing it into seven regions and writing the results on a scroll . Then they came to Y ’ hoshua in the camp at Shiloh .
CJB	Joshua	18	10	Y ’ hoshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Adonai , and there Y ’ hoshua divided the land among the people of Isra ’ el according to their regions .
CJB	Joshua	18	11	The lot for the tribe of the descendants of Binyamin came up according to their families . The border of their territory chosen by lot was between the descendants of Y ’ hudah and the descendants of Yosef .
CJB	Joshua	18	12	On the north side , their border began at the Yarden , went up alongside Yericho on the north , continued up through the hills westward and arrived at the Beit-Aven Desert .
CJB	Joshua	18	13	From there the border passed on to Luz , to the south side of Luz ( that is , Beit-El ) ; then the border went down to ‘ Atrot-Adar , by the hill on the south side of Lower Beit-Horon .
CJB	Joshua	18	14	The border was delineated as turning at the western corner and heading southward , from the hill located in front of Beit-Horon on the south ; and it ended at Kiryat-Ba ‘ al ( that is , Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim ) , a city belonging to the descendants of Y ’ hudah ; this was the west side .
CJB	Joshua	18	15	On the south the border extended westward from the most distant part of Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim , going out to the source of the Neftoach Spring .
CJB	Joshua	18	16	Then the border went down to the farthest part of the hill located in front of the Ben-Hinnom Valley , north of the Refa ’ im Valley , south of the Y ’ vusi ; and continued down to ‘ Ein-Rogel ,
CJB	Joshua	18	17	where it was drawn to the north ; then it went on to ‘ Ein-Shemesh ; continued to G ’ lilot , which is across from Ma ‘ alei-Adumim ; went down to the Stone of Bohan the son of Re ’ uven ;
CJB	Joshua	18	19	Then the border passed alongside Beit-Hoglah , heading north ; and the border ended at the north bay of the Dead Sea , at the south end of the Yarden ; this was the south border .
CJB	Joshua	18	20	The Yarden was to be its border on the east side . This was the inheritance of the descendants of Binyamin , defined by its surrounding borders , according to their families .

CJB	Joshua	19	9	The inheritance of the descendants of Shim ‘ on was taken out of the allotment for the descendants of Y ’ hudah , because the portion given to the descendants of Y ’ hudah was too much for them , so the descendants of Shim ‘ on had an inheritance inside the descendants of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Joshua	19	10	The third lot came up for the descendants of Z ’ vulun according to their families . The border of their inheritance began at Sarid .
CJB	Joshua	19	11	Then their border went up westward to Mar ‘ alah , extended to Dabeshet and on to the vadi fronting Yokne ‘ am .

CJB	Joshua	19	46	Yarkon Springs and Rakon , with the border fronting Yafo .
CJB	Joshua	19	47	The territory of the descendants of Dan was too small for them , so the descendants of Dan went up and fought against Leshem , captured it , defeated it by the sword , took possession of it and lived there , calling Leshem “ Dan ” after Dan their ancestor .
CJB	Joshua	19	48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
CJB	Joshua	19	49	When they had finished distributing the land for inheritance according to its borders , the people of Isra ’ el gave an inheritance within their territory to Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun .
CJB	Joshua	19	50	According to Adonai ’ s order they gave him the city he had asked for , Timnat-Serach in the hills of Efrayim ; so he built up the city and lived in it .
CJB	Joshua	19	51	These are the inheritances which El ‘ azar the cohen , Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun and the leaders of the ancestral clans of the tribes of the people of Isra ’ el distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Adonai at the door of the tent of meeting . Thus they finished dividing up the land .
CJB	Joshua	20	20	Adonai said to Y ’ hoshua ,
CJB	Joshua	20	2	“ Tell the people of Isra ’ el , ‘ Select the cities of refuge about which I spoke to you through Moshe ;
CJB	Joshua	20	3	so that anyone who kills someone by mistake and unknowingly may escape there ; they will serve as refuges for you from the next-of-kin avenger .
CJB	Joshua	20	4	He is to flee to one of those cities , stand at the entrance to the city gate and state his cause to the city leaders . Then they will bring him into the city with them and give him a place , so that he may live among them .
CJB	Joshua	20	5	If the next-of-kin avenger pursues him , they are not to hand over the killer to him ; because he struck his fellow community member unknowingly and had not hated him previously .
CJB	Joshua	20	6	So he will live in that city until he stands trial before the community , until the death of the cohen hagadol who is in office at the time . When that time comes , the killer may return to his own city and his own house , to the city from which he fled. ’ ”
CJB	Joshua	20	7	So they set apart Kedesh in the Galil , in the hills of Naftali ; Sh ’ khem in the hills of Efrayim ; and Kiryat-Arba ( that is , Hevron ) in the hills of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Joshua	20	8	Beyond the Yarden east of Yericho they selected Betzer in the desert , on the plateau , out of the tribe of Re ’ uven ; Ramot in Gil ‘ ad out of the tribe of Gad , and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of M ’ nasheh .
CJB	Joshua	20	9	These were the cities selected for all the people of Isra ’ el and for the foreigner living among them , so that anyone who kills any person by mistake could flee there and not die at the hand of the next-of-kin avenger prior to standing trial before the community .
CJB	Joshua	21	21	they gave them : Sh ’ khem with its surrounding open land , in the hills of Efrayim , the city of refuge for the killer ; Gezer with its surrounding open land ;
CJB	Joshua	21	2	It was at Shiloh in the land of Kena ‘ an that they spoke to them ; they said , “ Adonai ordered through Moshe that we be given cities to live in , with the surrounding open land for our livestock. ”
CJB	Joshua	21	3	So out of their inheritance the people of Isra ’ el gave the L ’ vi ’ im the following cities with the surrounding open land :
CJB	Joshua	21	4	The lot came out for the families of the K ’ hati . The descendants of Aharon the cohen , who were of the L ’ vi ’ im , received by lot thirteen cities from the tribes of Y ’ hudah , Shim ‘ on and Binyamin .

CJB	Joshua	21	7	The descendants of M ’ rari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribes of Re ’ uven , Gad and Z ’ vulun .
CJB	Joshua	21	8	The people of Isra ’ el gave by lot to the L ’ vi ’ im these cities with the surrounding open land , as Adonai had ordered through Moshe .
CJB	Joshua	21	9	They gave from the tribe of the descendants of Y ’ hudah and from the tribe of the descendants of Shim ‘ on these cities here mentioned by name ;
CJB	Joshua	21	10	they were for the descendants of Aharon , of the families of the K ’ hati , who were among the descendants of Levi ; because theirs was the first lot .
CJB	Joshua	21	11	They gave them : Kiryat-Arba — this Arba was the father of ‘ Anak — ( that is , Hevron ) , in the hills of Y ’ hudah , with the surrounding open land ;
CJB	Joshua	21	12	but the fields and villages of the city they gave to Kalev the son of Y ’ funeh as his possession .
CJB	Joshua	21	13	Thus to the descendants of Aharon the cohen they gave : Hevron with its surrounding open land , already a city of refuge for the killer ; Livnah with its surrounding open land ;
CJB	Joshua	21	14	Yatir with its surrounding open land ; Esht ’ moa with its surrounding open land ;

CJB	Joshua	21	24	Ayalon with its surrounding open land and Gat-Rimmon with its surrounding open land — four cities .

CJB	Joshua	21	26	All the cities of the families of the rest of the descendants of K ’ hat numbered ten with their surrounding open land .
CJB	Joshua	21	27	To the descendants of Gershon , of the families of the L ’ vi ’ im , out of the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh they gave : Golan in Bashan with its surrounding open land , the city of refuge for the killer ; and B ’ esht ’ rah with its surrounding open land — two cities .

CJB	Joshua	21	35	Dimnah with its surrounding open land and Nahalal with its surrounding open land — four cities . { (

CJB	Joshua	21	41	(

CJB	Joshua	21	43	(
CJB	Joshua	21	44	) Then Adonai gave them rest all around , according to everything he had sworn to their ancestors . Not a man from all their enemies stood against them ; Adonai handed all their enemies over to them .
CJB	Joshua	21	45	) Not one good thing that Adonai had spoken of to the household of Isra ’ el failed to happen ; it all took place .
CJB	Joshua	22	22	“ The Mighty One , God , is Adonai ! He knows , and Isra ’ el will know — if we acted in rebellion or treachery against Adonai , don ’ t vindicate us today !
CJB	Joshua	22	2	and said to them , “ You have done everything Moshe the servant of Adonai ordered you to do and heeded what I said in all the orders I gave you .
CJB	Joshua	22	3	All this time you have not abandoned your kinsmen but have obeyed your commission , as Adonai your God ordered .
CJB	Joshua	22	4	Now Adonai your God has given rest to your kinsmen , as he told them he would . So you too , return to your tents in the land which is your possession , which Moshe the servant of Adonai gave you beyond the Yarden .
CJB	Joshua	22	5	Only take great care to obey the mitzvah and the Torah which Moshe the servant of Adonai gave you — to love Adonai your God , follow all his ways , observe his mitzvot , cling to him , and serve him with all your heart and being. ”
CJB	Joshua	22	6	Then Y ’ hoshua blessed them and sent them away , and they went to their tents .
CJB	Joshua	22	7	( To the one half-tribe of M ’ nasheh , Moshe had given an inheritance in Bashan ; but to the other half , Y ’ hoshua gave one among their kinsmen on the west side of the Yarden . ) When Y ’ hoshua sent them away to their tents he blessed them ,
CJB	Joshua	22	8	saying , “ Return with great riches to your tents — with very much livestock , with silver , gold , bronze , iron and with great quantities of clothing ; share the spoil of your enemies with your kinsmen. ”
CJB	Joshua	22	9	So the descendants of Re ’ uven , the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh returned ; they left the people of Isra ’ el in Shiloh , in the land of Kena ‘ an , to go to the land of Gil ‘ ad , to the land they were to possess and which they already did possess — according to the order of Adonai through Moshe .
CJB	Joshua	22	10	When the descendants of Re ’ uven , the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe arrived in the area of the land of Kena ‘ an near the Yarden , they built an altar there by the Yarden , a large , impressive altar .
CJB	Joshua	22	11	The people of Isra ’ el heard of it and said , “ Look ! The descendants of Re ’ uven , the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh have built an altar by the frontier of the land of Kena ‘ an , in the area by the Yarden , on the side that belongs to the people of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Joshua	22	12	When the people of Isra ’ el heard of it , the entire community of Isra ’ el gathered together in Shiloh to wage war against them .
CJB	Joshua	22	13	The people of Isra ’ el sent Pinchas the son of El ‘ azar the cohen into the land of Gil ‘ ad to the descendants of Re ’ uven , the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh .
CJB	Joshua	22	14	With him were ten leaders , one leader of an ancestral clan for each of the tribes of Isra ’ el ; each one was a head of his ancestral clan among the thousands of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	22	15	They came to the descendants of Re ’ uven , the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh in the land of Gil ‘ ad and spoke with them ; they said ,
CJB	Joshua	22	16	“ Here is what the whole community of Adonai is saying : ‘ What is this treachery that you have committed against the God of Isra ’ el , turning away today from following Adonai , in that you have built yourselves an altar , thus rebelling today against Adonai ?
CJB	Joshua	22	17	Is the guilt we incurred at P ‘ or not enough for us ? We haven ’ t cleansed ourselves from it to this day , even though a plague came on the community of Adonai .
CJB	Joshua	22	18	Is this why you have to turn away today from following Adonai ? If you rebel against Adonai today , he will be angry tomorrow with the whole community of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	22	19	If the land you have taken possession of is unclean , then cross back over into the land which belongs to Adonai , where the tabernacle of Adonai is located , and take a possession among us . But don ’ t rebel against Adonai , and don ’ t rebel against us , by building yourselves an altar other than the altar of Adonai our God .
CJB	Joshua	22	20	Didn ’ t Achan the son of Zerach commit a sin in regard to things set aside for destruction , and God ’ s anger fell on the whole community of Isra ’ el ? He was not the only one who died for his crime. ’ ”
CJB	Joshua	22	21	Then the descendants of Re ’ uven , the descendants of Gad and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh answered the leaders of the thousands of Isra ’ el :
CJB	Joshua	22	23	We haven ’ t built an altar in order to turn away from following Adonai or to offer on it burnt offerings , grain offerings or sacrifices as peace offerings . If we have , let Adonai himself require us to atone for it .
CJB	Joshua	22	24	Rather , we did this out of anxiety , because we thought , ‘ Sometime in the future , your descendants might say to our descendants , “ You don ’ t have anything to do with Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el ,
CJB	Joshua	22	25	because Adonai made the Yarden the border between us and you , so you descendants of Re ’ uven and Gad have no share in Adonai. ” ’ In this way your descendants could make our descendants stop fearing Adonai .
CJB	Joshua	22	26	So we said , ‘ Let us now make preparations and build ourselves an altar , not for burnt offerings or sacrifices ,
CJB	Joshua	22	27	but as a witness between us and you , and between our generations who will come after us , so that we may perform the service for Adonai in his presence with our burnt offerings , sacrifices and peace offerings — so that your descendants will not say to our descendants at some future time , “ You have no share in Adonai. ” ’
CJB	Joshua	22	28	For this reason we said , ‘ When they accuse us or future generations in this way , we will say , “ Look ! Here is a replica of the altar of Adonai which our ancestors made , not for burnt offerings or sacrifices , but as a witness between us and you. ” ’
CJB	Joshua	22	29	Far be it from us that we should rebel against Adonai and turn away today from following Adonai by building an altar for burnt offerings , grain offerings or sacrifices other than the altar of Adonai our God which stands in front of his tabernacle ! ”
CJB	Joshua	22	30	When Pinchas the cohen and the leaders of the community , the heads of the thousands of Isra ’ el who were with him , heard what the descendants of Re ’ uven , the descendants of Gad and the descendants of M ’ nasheh said , it satisfied them .
CJB	Joshua	22	31	Pinchas the son of El ‘ azar the cohen said to the descendants of Re ’ uven , the descendants of Gad and the descendants of M ’ nasheh , “ Today we know that Adonai is here with us , because you have not committed this treasonous act against Adonai . Now you have saved the people of Isra ’ el from the anger of Adonai. ”
CJB	Joshua	22	32	So Pinchas the son of El ‘ azar the cohen and the leaders returned from the descendants of Re ’ uven and Gad , from the land of Gil ‘ ad to the land of Kena ‘ an and the people of Isra ’ el , bringing word back to them .
CJB	Joshua	22	33	What they said satisfied the people of Isra ’ el . The people of Isra ’ el blessed God and said no more about going to wage war against the descendants of Re ’ uven and Gad and destroying the land where they lived .
CJB	Joshua	22	34	The descendants of Re ’ uven and Gad called the altar “ ‘ Ed [ a witness ] ” between us that Adonai is God .
CJB	Joshua	23	23	A long time afterwards , when Adonai had given Isra ’ el rest from all their surrounding enemies , and Y ’ hoshua was old , with age taking its toll ,
CJB	Joshua	23	2	Y ’ hoshua summoned all Isra ’ el — their leaders , heads , judges and officials — and said to them , “ I am old ; age is taking its toll .
CJB	Joshua	23	3	You have seen everything that Adonai your God has done to all these nations because of you , for it is Adonai your God who has fought on your behalf .
CJB	Joshua	23	4	Here , I have allotted to you land for inheritance according to your tribes between the Yarden and the Great Sea to the west ; it includes the land of the nations I have destroyed and the nations which remain .
CJB	Joshua	23	5	Adonai your God will thrust them out ahead of you and drive them out of your sight , so that you will possess their land , as Adonai your God told you .
CJB	Joshua	23	6	“ Therefore be very firm about keeping and doing everything written in the book of the Torah of Moshe and not turning aside from it either to the right or to the left .
CJB	Joshua	23	7	Then you won ’ t become like those nations remaining among you . Don ’ t even mention the name of their gods , let alone have people swear by them , serve them or worship them ;
CJB	Joshua	23	8	but cling to Adonai your God , as you have done to this day .
CJB	Joshua	23	9	This is why Adonai has driven out great , strong nations ahead of you ; and it explains why no one has prevailed against you to this day ,
CJB	Joshua	23	10	why one man of you has chased a thousand — it is because Adonai your God has fought on your behalf , as he said to you .
CJB	Joshua	23	11	“ Therefore take great care to love Adonai your God .
CJB	Joshua	23	12	Otherwise , if you retreat and cling to the remnant of these other nations remaining among you , if you make marriages with them and have children with them and they with you ,
CJB	Joshua	23	13	know for certain that Adonai your God will stop driving out these nations from your sight . Instead , they will become a snare and a trap for you , whipping your sides and pricking your eyes , until you perish from this good land which Adonai your God has given you .
CJB	Joshua	23	14	“ Today I am going the way of all the earth . Therefore consider in all your heart and being that not one of all the good things Adonai your God said concerning you has failed to happen ; it has all come to pass ; nothing of it has failed .
CJB	Joshua	23	15	Nevertheless , just as all the good things Adonai your God promised you have come upon you , likewise Adonai will bring upon you all the bad things too , until he has destroyed you from this good land which Adonai your God has given you .
CJB	Joshua	23	16	When you violate the covenant of Adonai your God , which he ordered you to obey , and go and serve other gods and worship them , then the anger of Adonai will blaze up against you ; and you will perish quickly from the good land which he has given you ! ”
CJB	Joshua	24	24	The people answered Y ’ hoshua , “ We will serve Adonai our God ; we will pay attention to what he says. ”
CJB	Joshua	24	2	Y ’ hoshua said to all the people , “ This is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ In antiquity your ancestors lived on the other side of the [ Euphrates ] River — Terach the father of Avraham and Nachor — and they served other gods .
CJB	Joshua	24	3	I took your ancestor Avraham from beyond the River , led him through all the land of Kena ‘ an , increased his descendants and gave him Yitz ’ chak .
CJB	Joshua	24	4	I gave to Yitz ’ chak Ya ‘ akov and ‘ Esav . To ‘ Esav I gave Mount Se ‘ ir as his possession , but Ya ‘ akov and his children went down into Egypt .
CJB	Joshua	24	5	I sent Moshe and Aharon , I inflicted plagues on Egypt in accordance with what I did among them , and afterwards I brought you out .
CJB	Joshua	24	6	Yes , I brought your fathers out of Egypt : you arrived at the sea , and the Egyptians were pursuing your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Sea of Suf .
CJB	Joshua	24	7	But when they cried out to Adonai , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , overwhelmed them with the sea and drowned them . Your eyes saw what I did in Egypt , and then you lived in the desert for a long time .
CJB	Joshua	24	8	I brought you into the land of the Emori living beyond the Yarden ; they fought against you , but I handed them over to you . You took possession of their land , and I destroyed them ahead of you .
CJB	Joshua	24	9	Then Balak the son of Tzippor , king of Mo ’ av , rose up and fought against Isra ’ el . He sent and summoned Bil ‘ am the son of B ‘ or to put a curse on you .
CJB	Joshua	24	10	But I refused to listen to Bil ‘ am , and he actually blessed you . In this way I rescued you from him .
CJB	Joshua	24	11	Next you crossed the Yarden and came to Yericho . The men of Yericho fought against you — the Emori , P ’ rizi , Kena ‘ ani , Hitti , Girgashi , Hivi and Y ’ vusi — and I handed them over to you .
CJB	Joshua	24	12	I sent the hornet ahead of you , driving them out from ahead of you , the two kings of the Emori — it wasn ’ t by your sword or your bow .
CJB	Joshua	24	13	Then I gave you a land where you had not worked and cities you had not built , and you live there . You eat fruit from vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant. ’
CJB	Joshua	24	14	“ Therefore fear Adonai , and serve him truly and sincerely . Put away the gods your ancestors served beyond the [ Euphrates ] River and in Egypt , and serve Adonai !
CJB	Joshua	24	15	If it seems bad to you to serve Adonai , then choose today whom you are going to serve ! Will it be the gods your ancestors served beyond the River ? or the gods of the Emori , in whose land you are living ? As for me and my household , we will serve Adonai ! ”
CJB	Joshua	24	16	The people answered , “ Far be it from us that we would abandon Adonai to serve other gods ;
CJB	Joshua	24	17	because it is Adonai our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt , from a life of slavery , and did those great signs before our eyes , and preserved us all along the way we traveled and among all the peoples we passed through ;
CJB	Joshua	24	18	and it was Adonai who drove out from ahead of us all the peoples , the Emori living in the land . Therefore we too will serve Adonai , for he is our God. ”
CJB	Joshua	24	19	Y ’ hoshua said to the people , “ You can ’ t serve Adonai ; because he is a holy God , a jealous God , and he will not forgive your crimes and sins .
CJB	Joshua	24	20	If you abandon Adonai and serve foreign gods , he will turn , doing you harm and destroying you after he has done you good. ”
CJB	Joshua	24	21	But the people said to Y ’ hoshua , “ No , but we will serve Adonai. ”
CJB	Joshua	24	22	Y ’ hoshua said to the people , “ You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Adonai , to serve him. ” They answered , “ We are witnesses. ”
CJB	Joshua	24	23	“ Now , ” Y ’ hoshua urged , “ put away the foreign gods you have among you , and turn your hearts to Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Joshua	24	25	So Y ’ hoshua made a covenant with the people that day , laying down for them laws and rulings there in Sh ’ khem .
CJB	Joshua	24	26	Y ’ hoshua wrote these words in the book of the Torah of God . Then he took a big stone and set it up there under the oak next to the sanctuary of Adonai .
CJB	Joshua	24	27	Y ’ hoshua said to all the people , “ See , this stone will be a witness against us ; because it has heard all the words of Adonai which he said to us ; therefore it will be a witness against you , in case you deny your God. ”
CJB	Joshua	24	28	Then Y ’ hoshua sent the people away , every man to his inheritance .
CJB	Joshua	24	29	After this , Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun , the servant of Adonai , died ; he was
CJB	Joshua	24	110	years old .
CJB	Joshua	24	30	They buried him on his property in Timnat-Serach , which is in the hills of Efrayim , north of Mount Ga ‘ ash .
CJB	Joshua	24	31	Isra ’ el served Adonai throughout Y ’ hoshua ’ s lifetime and throughout the lifetimes of the leaders who outlived Y ’ hoshua and had known all the deeds that Adonai had done on behalf of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Joshua	24	32	The bones of Yosef , which the people of Isra ’ el had brought up from Egypt , they buried in Sh ’ khem , in the parcel of ground which Ya ‘ akov had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Sh ’ khem for a hundred pieces of silver ; and they became a possession of the descendants of Yosef .
CJB	Joshua	24	33	Finally , El ‘ azar the son of Aharon died ; and they buried him on the hill belonging to Pinchas his son , which had been given to him in the hills of Efrayim .
CJB	Judges	1	1	After the death of Y ’ hoshua , the people of Isra ’ el asked Adonai , “ Who will go up for us first to fight against the Kena ‘ ani ? ”
CJB	Judges	1	2	Adonai said : “ Y ’ hudah will go up ; here , I have handed the land over to him. ”
CJB	Judges	1	3	Y ’ hudah said to his brother Shim ‘ on , “ Come up with me into my assigned territory , so that we can fight against the Kena ‘ ani ; and I likewise will go with you into your territory. ” So Shim ‘ on went with him .
CJB	Judges	1	4	Y ’ hudah went up ; and Adonai gave the Kena ‘ ani and the P ’ rizi into their hands ; of those in Bezek they killed ten thousand men .
CJB	Judges	1	5	They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek ; and they fought against him . They killed the Kena ‘ ani and the P ’ rizi ,
CJB	Judges	1	6	but Adoni-Bezek fled . They pursued him , caught him , and cut off his thumbs and big toes .
CJB	Judges	1	7	Adoni-Bezek said : “ Seventy kings , with their thumbs and their big toes cut off , gathered food under my table ; God has paid me back in accordance with what I did. ” They brought him to Yerushalayim , and he died there .
CJB	Judges	1	8	Then the people of Y ’ hudah fought against Yerushalayim , captured it , overpowered it with the sword , and set the city on fire .
CJB	Judges	1	9	Afterwards , the people of Y ’ hudah went down to fight against the Kena ‘ ani who lived in the hill-country , in the Negev , and in the Sh ’ felah .
CJB	Judges	1	10	Y ’ hudah also attacked the Kena ‘ ani living in Hevron ( formerly called Kiryat-Arba ) , and they overpowered Sheshai , Achiman and Talmai .
CJB	Judges	1	11	From there they attacked the inhabitants of D ’ vir ( D ’ vir was formerly called Kiryat-Sefer ) .
CJB	Judges	1	12	Kalev said : “ To whoever overpowers Kiryat-Sefer and captures it I will give my daughter ‘ Akhsah as his wife. ”
CJB	Judges	1	13	‘ Otni ’ el the son of K ’ naz , Kalev ’ s younger brother , captured it ; so he gave him ‘ Akhsah his daughter as his wife .
CJB	Judges	1	14	After becoming his wife , she persuaded him to ask her father to give them a field ; when she got off her donkey , Kalev asked her , “ What do you want ? ”
CJB	Judges	1	15	She said to him : “ Give me a blessing : since you gave me land in the Negev , also give me sources of water. ” So Kalev gave her the Upper Springs and the Lower Springs .
CJB	Judges	1	16	Next , the descendants of the Keini , Moshe ’ s father-in-law , went up out of the City of Date-Palms with the people of Y ’ hudah into the Y ’ hudah Desert south of ‘ Arad ; and they came and settled with the people .
CJB	Judges	1	17	Y ’ hudah went with Shim ‘ on his brother ; they overpowered the Kena ‘ ani who inhabited Tz ’ fat , and completely destroyed it . The name of the city was called Hormah .
CJB	Judges	1	18	Y ’ hudah also took ‘ Azah with its territory , Ashkelon with its territory and ‘ Ekron with its territory .
CJB	Judges	1	19	Adonai was with Y ’ hudah , and they took possession of the hill-country , because they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , since they had iron chariots .
CJB	Judges	1	20	They gave Hevron to Kalev , as Moshe had said to do ; and he drove out from there the three sons of ‘ Anak .
CJB	Judges	1	21	The people of Binyamin did not drive out the Y ’ vusi who inhabited Yerushalayim ; rather , the Y ’ vusi continued living with the people of Binyamin in Yerushalayim , as they do to this day .
CJB	Judges	1	22	The house of Yosef likewise attacked Beit-El ; and Adonai was with them .
CJB	Judges	1	23	The house of Yosef sent spies to Beit-El ( the city was formerly called Luz ) .
CJB	Judges	1	24	The spies saw a man coming out of the city and said to him : “ Please show us the way to enter the city , and we will treat you kindly. ”
CJB	Judges	1	25	So he showed them the way into the city , and they overpowered the city with the sword , but they let the man and all his family go free .
CJB	Judges	1	26	He went into the land of the Hittim , built a city and called it Luz , which is its name to this day .
CJB	Judges	1	27	M ’ nasheh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beit-Sh ’ an and its villages , Ta ‘ anakh and its villages , Dor and its villages , Yivle ‘ am and its villages or Megiddo and its villages ; so that the Kena ‘ ani managed to keep on living in that land .
CJB	Judges	1	28	In time , when Isra ’ el had grown strong , they did put the Kena ‘ ani to forced labor but failed to drive them out completely .
CJB	Judges	1	29	Efrayim did not drive out the Kena ‘ ani living in Gezer ; so the Kena ‘ ani continued living in Gezer along with them .
CJB	Judges	1	30	Z ’ vulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or Nahalol ; so the Kena ‘ ani continued to live among them but became subject to forced labor .
CJB	Judges	1	31	Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of ‘ Akko , Tzidon , Achlav , Akhziv , Helbah , Afik or Rechov ;
CJB	Judges	1	32	so the Asheri lived among the Kena ‘ ani who were living in the land , because they didn ’ t drive them out .
CJB	Judges	1	33	Naftali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beit-Shemesh or Beit- ‘ Anat but lived among the Kena ‘ ani living in the land ; however , the inhabitants of Beit-Shemesh and Beit- ‘ Anat became forced labor for them .
CJB	Judges	1	34	The Emori forced the people of Dan into the hills ; for they would not let them come down to the valley .
CJB	Judges	1	35	The Emori had resolved to live in the Heres Hills , in Ayalon and in Sha ‘ alvim ; but when the power of the house of Yosef grew greater , they became subject to forced labor .
CJB	Judges	1	36	So the territory of the Emori was from the Scorpion Ascent and the Rock upward .
CJB	Judges	2	2	you , for your part , are not to make any covenant with the inhabitants of this land but must tear down their altars. ’ However , you have paid no attention to what I said . What is this you have done ?
CJB	Judges	2	3	This is why I also said , ‘ I will not drive them out before you ; but they will be on your flanks , and their gods will become a snare for you. ’ ”
CJB	Judges	2	4	When the angel of Adonai spoke these words to all the people of Isra ’ el , they began crying and wailing at the top of their voices .
CJB	Judges	2	5	So they called the name of that place Bokhim [ crying ] and sacrificed there to Adonai .
CJB	Judges	2	6	When Y ’ hoshua had sent the people away , the people of Isra ’ el had gone each one to his assigned property in order to take possession of the land .
CJB	Judges	2	7	The people served Adonai throughout Y ’ hoshua ’ s life and throughout the lives of all the older men who outlived Y ’ hoshua and who had seen all the great work of Adonai which he had done for Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	2	8	When Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun , the servant of Adonai , died , he was
CJB	Judges	2	110	years old ;
CJB	Judges	2	9	and they buried him near the boundary of his property in Timnat-Heres , in the hills of Efrayim , north of Mount Ga ‘ ash .
CJB	Judges	2	10	When that entire generation had been gathered to their ancestors , another generation arose that knew neither Adonai nor the work he had done for Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	2	11	Then the people of Isra ’ el did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective and served the ba ‘ alim .
CJB	Judges	2	12	They abandoned Adonai , the God of their fathers , who had brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , selected from the gods of the peoples around them , and worshipped them ; this made Adonai angry .
CJB	Judges	2	13	They abandoned Adonai and served Ba ‘ al and the ‘ ashtarot .
CJB	Judges	2	14	The anger of Adonai blazed against Isra ’ el ; and he handed them over to pillagers , who plundered them , and to their enemies around them ; so that they could no longer resist their enemies .
CJB	Judges	2	15	Whenever they launched an attack , the power of Adonai was against them , so that things turned out badly — just as Adonai had said would happen and had sworn to them . They were in dire distress .
CJB	Judges	2	16	But then Adonai raised up judges , who rescued them from the power of those who were plundering them .
CJB	Judges	2	17	Yet they did not pay attention to their judges , but made whores of themselves to other gods and worshipped them ; they quickly turned away from the path on which their ancestors had walked , the way of obeying Adonai ’ s mitzvot — they failed to do this .
CJB	Judges	2	18	When Adonai raised up judges for them , Adonai was with the judge and delivered them from the hands of their enemies throughout the lifetime of the judge ; for Adonai was moved to pity by their groaning under those oppressing and crushing them .
CJB	Judges	2	19	But after the judge died , they would relapse into worse behavior than that of their ancestors , following other gods to serve and worship them ; they abandoned none of their practices or stubborn ways .
CJB	Judges	2	20	So the anger of Adonai blazed against Isra ’ el ; he said , “ Because this nation violates my covenant , which I ordered their fathers to obey ; and they don ’ t pay attention to what I say ;
CJB	Judges	2	21	in the future , I will not expel ahead of them any of the nations that Y ’ hoshua left when he died .
CJB	Judges	2	22	This is how I will test Isra ’ el , to see whether or not they will keep the way of Adonai , living according to it , as their ancestors did. ”
CJB	Judges	2	23	So Adonai allowed those nations to remain where they were , without quickly driving them out ; he did not hand them over to Y ’ hoshua .
CJB	Judges	3	3	These nations consisted of the five chiefs of the P ’ lishtim , all the Kena ‘ ani , the Tzidoni , and the Hivi who lived in the hills of the L ’ vanon between Mount Ba ‘ al-Hermon and the entrance to Hamat .
CJB	Judges	3	2	This was only so that the generations of Isra ’ el who had previously known nothing of war might learn about it .
CJB	Judges	3	4	They stayed there to test whether Isra ’ el would pay attention to the mitzvot of Adonai , which , through Moshe , he had ordered their ancestors to obey .
CJB	Judges	3	5	So the people of Isra ’ el lived among the Kena ‘ ani , Hitti , Emori , P ’ rizi , Hivi and Y ’ vusi ;
CJB	Judges	3	6	taking their daughters as their wives , giving their own daughters to their sons and serving their gods .
CJB	Judges	3	7	Thus the people of Isra ’ el did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , forgot Adonai their God , and served the ba ‘ alim and asherim .
CJB	Judges	3	8	Therefore the anger of Adonai blazed against Isra ’ el , and he gave them over into the hands of Kushan-Rish ‘ atayim king of Aram-Naharayim ; and the people of Isra ’ el served Kushan-Rish ‘ atayim eight years .
CJB	Judges	3	9	But when the people of Isra ’ el cried out to Adonai , Adonai raised up a savior for the people of Isra ’ el ; and he rescued them ; this was ‘ Otni ’ el , the son of Kalev ’ s younger brother K ’ naz .
CJB	Judges	3	10	The spirit of Adonai came upon him , and he judged Isra ’ el . Then he went out to war , and Adonai gave Kushan-Rish ‘ atayim king of Aram into his hands ; his power prevailed against Kushan-Rish ‘ atayim .
CJB	Judges	3	11	So the land had rest for forty years , until ‘ Otni ’ el the son of K ’ naz died .
CJB	Judges	3	12	But the people of Isra ’ el again did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , so Adonai strengthened ‘ Eglon the king of Mo ’ av against Isra ’ el , because they had done what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective .
CJB	Judges	3	13	In confederation with the people of ‘ Amon and ‘ Amalek , ‘ Eglon went out and defeated Isra ’ el , capturing the City of Date-Palms ;
CJB	Judges	3	14	and the people of Isra ’ el served ‘ Eglon the king of Mo ’ av eighteen years .
CJB	Judges	3	15	But when the people of Isra ’ el cried out to Adonai , Adonai raised up for them a savior , Ehud the son of Gera , from the tribe of Binyamin , a left-handed man . The people of Isra ’ el appointed him to take their tribute to ‘ Eglon the king of Mo ’ av .
CJB	Judges	3	16	Ehud made himself a double-edged sword eighteen inches long and strapped it to his right thigh under his clothes .
CJB	Judges	3	17	Then he presented the tribute to ‘ Eglon king of Mo ’ av . Now ‘ Eglon was a very fat man .
CJB	Judges	3	18	When he had finished presenting the tribute , he dismissed the people who had brought it .
CJB	Judges	3	19	But he himself , after reaching the quarries at Gilgal , went back and said , “ King , I have a secret message for you. ” The king commanded silence , and all his attendants withdrew .
CJB	Judges	3	20	Ehud came to him ; he was sitting alone by himself in his upstairs room , where it was cool . Ehud said : “ I have a message from God for you. ” As the king arose from his seat ,
CJB	Judges	3	21	Ehud reached out with his left hand , took the sword from his right thigh , and thrust it into the king ’ s belly .
CJB	Judges	3	22	The hilt too went in after the blade , and the fat closed around the blade , for he did not draw the sword out of his belly , so that it came out behind .
CJB	Judges	3	23	Then Ehud went out onto the porch , shut the doors of the upstairs room behind him and locked them .
CJB	Judges	3	24	After Ehud had left , the king ’ s servants came . Seeing that the doors of the upper room were locked , they said , “ He must be relieving himself in the inner part of the cool room. ”
CJB	Judges	3	25	They waited until they became embarrassed , but he still didn ’ t open the doors of the upstairs room . So they took the key and opened them ; and there before them lay their master , dead on the ground .
CJB	Judges	3	26	But while they were delaying , Ehud escaped — he passed beyond the quarries and arrived safely in Se ‘ irah .
CJB	Judges	3	27	Upon arrival in the hills of Efrayim , he began sounding the call on the shofar ; and the people of Isra ’ el went down with him from the hill-country ; he himself took the lead .
CJB	Judges	3	28	He said to them : “ Follow me , because Adonai has given your enemy Mo ’ av into your hands . They went down after him , seized the fords of the Yarden opposite Mo ’ av and permitted no one to cross .
CJB	Judges	3	29	On that occasion they defeated Mo ’ av , some ten thousand men , all tough , experienced soldiers ; not one of them escaped .
CJB	Judges	3	30	Thus was Mo ’ av subdued that day under the power of Isra ’ el . Then the land had rest for eighty years .
CJB	Judges	3	31	After Ehud came Shamgar the son of ‘ Anat , who killed
CJB	Judges	3	600	P ’ lishtim with an oxgoad ; and he too rescued Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	4	4	Now D ’ vorah , a woman and a prophet , the wife of Lapidot , was judging Isra ’ el at that time .
CJB	Judges	4	2	So Adonai handed them over to Yavin king of Kena ‘ an . He ruled from Hatzor ; and the commander of his army was Sisra , who lived in Haroshet-HaGoyim .
CJB	Judges	4	3	The people of Isra ’ el cried out to Adonai , because he had
CJB	Judges	4	900	iron chariots , and all the troops he had with him , from Haroshet-HaGoyim to the Kishon River .
CJB	Judges	4	5	She used to sit under D ’ vorah ’ s Palm between Ramah and Beit-El , in the hills of Efrayim ; and the people of Isra ’ el would come to her for judgment .
CJB	Judges	4	6	She sent for Barak the son of Avino ‘ am , from Kedesh in Naftali , and said to him : “ Adonai has given you this order : ‘ Go , march to Mount Tavor , and take with you 10,000 men from the people of Naftali and Z ’ vulun .
CJB	Judges	4	7	I will cause Sisra , the commander of Yavin ’ s army , to encounter you at the Kishon River with his chariots and troops ; and I will hand him over to you. ’ ”
CJB	Judges	4	8	Barak answered her : “ If you go with me , I ’ ll go ; but if you won ’ t go with me , I won ’ t go. ”
CJB	Judges	4	9	She replied , “ Yes , I will gladly go with you ; but the way you are doing it will bring you no glory ; because Adonai will hand Sisra over to a woman. ” Then D ’ vorah set out and went with Barak to Kedesh .
CJB	Judges	4	10	Barak summoned Z ’ vulun and Naftali to come to Kedesh . Ten thousand men followed him , and D ’ vorah went up with him .
CJB	Judges	4	11	Now Hever the Keini had cut himself off from the rest of Kayin , the descendants of Hovav Moshe ’ s father-in-law ; he had pitched his tent near the oak at Tza ‘ ananim , which is close to Kedesh .
CJB	Judges	4	12	Sisra was informed that Barak the son of Avino ‘ am had gone up to Mount Tavor .
CJB	Judges	4	13	So Sisra rallied his chariots , all
CJB	Judges	4	14	D ’ vorah said to Barak : “ Get going ! This is the day when Adonai will hand Sisra over to you ! Adonai has gone out ahead of you ! ” So Barak went down from Mount Tavor with 10,000 men following him ;
CJB	Judges	4	15	and Adonai threw Sisra , all his chariots and his entire army into a panic before Barak ’ s sword ; so that Sisra got down from his chariot and fled on foot .
CJB	Judges	4	16	But Barak pursued the chariots and the army all the way to Haroshet-HaGoyim . Sisra ’ s entire army was put to the sword ; not one man was left .
CJB	Judges	4	17	However , Sisra ran on foot to the tent of Ya ‘ el the wife of Hever the Keini , because there was peace between Yavin the king of Hatzor and the family of Hever the Keini .
CJB	Judges	4	18	Ya ‘ el went out to meet Sisra and said to him , “ Come in , my lord ; stay here with me ; and don ’ t be afraid. ” So he went into her tent , and she covered him with a blanket .
CJB	Judges	4	19	He said to her , “ Please give me a little water to drink — I ’ m thirsty. ” She opened a goatskin of milk , gave him some to drink , and covered him up again .
CJB	Judges	4	20	He said to her , “ Stand at the entrance to the tent ; and if anyone asks you if somebody is here , say , ‘ No. ’ ”
CJB	Judges	4	21	But when he was deeply asleep , Ya ‘ el the wife of Hever took a tent peg and a hammer in her hand , crept in to him quietly and drove the tent peg into his temple , right through to the ground ; so that he died without waking up .
CJB	Judges	4	22	So here is Barak pursuing Sisra , and Ya ‘ el steps out to meet him and says , “ Come , I will show you the man you are looking for. ” He goes into her tent ; and there is Sisra , lying dead with the tent peg through his temple .
CJB	Judges	4	23	Thus God on that day defeated Yavin the king of Kena ‘ an in the presence of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	4	24	The hand of the people of Isra ’ el came down more and more heavily against Yavin the king of Kena ‘ an , until they had completely destroyed Yavin the king of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Judges	5	5	The mountains melted at the presence of Adonai , at Sinai , before Adonai the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	5	2	“ When leaders in Isra ’ el dedicate themselves , and the people volunteer , you should all bless Adonai .
CJB	Judges	5	3	Hear , kings ; listen , princes ; I will sing to Adonai ! I will sing praise to Adonai the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	5	4	“ Adonai , when you went out from Se ‘ ir , when you marched out from the field of Edom ; the earth quaked , and the sky shook ; yes , the clouds poured down torrents .
CJB	Judges	5	6	“ In the days of Shamgar the son of ‘ Anat , in the days of Ya ‘ el , the main roads were deserted ; travelers walked the byways .
CJB	Judges	5	7	The rulers ceased in Isra ’ el , they ceased , until you arose , D ’ vorah , arose a mother in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	5	8	“ They chose new gods when war was at the gates . Was there a shield or spear to be seen among Isra ’ el ’ s forty thousand men ?
CJB	Judges	5	9	My heart goes out to Isra ’ el ’ s leaders and to those among the people who volunteer . All of you , bless Adonai .
CJB	Judges	5	10	“ You who ride white donkeys , sitting on soft saddle-blankets , and you walking on the road , talk about it !
CJB	Judges	5	11	Louder than the sound of archers at the watering-holes will they sound as they retell the righteous acts of Adonai , the righteous acts of his rulers in Isra ’ el . “ Then Adonai ’ s people marched down to the gates .
CJB	Judges	5	12	“ Awake , awake , D ’ vorah ! Awake , awake , break into song ! Arise , Barak ! Lead away your captives , son of Avino ‘ am !
CJB	Judges	5	13	“ Then a remnant of the nobles marched down ; the people of Adonai marched down to me like warriors .
CJB	Judges	5	14	From Efrayim came those rooted in ‘ Amalek . Behind you , Binyamin is with your peoples . From Makhir the commanders marched down , and from Z ’ vulun those holding the musterer ’ s staff .
CJB	Judges	5	15	The princes of Yissakhar were with D ’ vorah , Yissakhar , along with Barak ; into the valley they rushed forth behind him . Among the divisions of Re ’ uven they made great resolutions in their hearts .
CJB	Judges	5	16	But why did you stay at the pens for the sheep , and listen to the shepherd ’ s flute playing for the flocks ? Concerning the divisions of Re ’ uven there were great searchings of heart .
CJB	Judges	5	17	Gil ‘ ad lives beyond the Yarden . Dan — why does he stay by the ships ? Asher stayed by the shore of the sea , remaining near its bays .
CJB	Judges	5	18	The people of Z ’ vulun risked their lives , Naftali too , on the open heights .
CJB	Judges	5	19	“ Kings came ; they fought . Yes , the kings of Kena ‘ an fought at Ta ‘ anakh , by the waters of Megiddo ; but they took no spoil of silver .
CJB	Judges	5	20	They fought from heaven , the stars in their courses ; yes , they fought against Sisra .
CJB	Judges	5	21	The Kishon River swept them away , that ancient river , the Kishon River . O my soul , march on with strength !
CJB	Judges	5	22	Then the horses ’ hoofs pounded the ground , their mighty steeds galloping at full speed .
CJB	Judges	5	23	“ ‘ Curse Meroz ! ’ said the angel of Adonai , ‘ Curse the people living there with a bitter punishment for not coming to help Adonai , to help Adonai against the mighty warriors. ’
CJB	Judges	5	24	“ Ya ‘ el will be blessed more than all women . The wife of Hever the Keini will be blessed more than any woman in the tent .
CJB	Judges	5	25	He asked for water , and she gave him milk ; In an elegant bowl she brought him curds .
CJB	Judges	5	26	Then she took a tent peg in her left hand and a workman ’ s hammer in her right ; with the hammer she struck Sisra , pierced his skull , yes , she shattered and crushed his temple .
CJB	Judges	5	27	He sank down at her feet , he fell and lay there ; he sank at her feet , he fell — where he sank down , there he fell dead .
CJB	Judges	5	28	“ Sisra ’ s mother looks out the window ; peering out through the lattice she wonders , ‘ Why is his chariot so long in coming ? Why are his horses so slow to return ? ’
CJB	Judges	5	29	The wisest of her ladies answer her , and she repeats it to herself ,
CJB	Judges	5	30	‘ Of course ! They ’ re collecting and dividing the spoil — a girl , two girls for every warrior , for Sisra booty of dyed clothing , a plunder of colorfully embroidered garments , two embroidered scarves for every soldier ’ s neck. ’
CJB	Judges	5	31	“ May all your enemies perish like this , Adonai ; but may those who love him be like the sun going forth in its glory ! ” Then the land had rest for forty years .
CJB	Judges	6	6	Isra ’ el became very discouraged because of Midyan , and the people of Isra ’ el cried out to Adonai .
CJB	Judges	6	2	Midyan exercised its power harshly against Isra ’ el , and because of Midyan the people of Isra ’ el hid themselves in mountains , in caves and in other safe places .
CJB	Judges	6	3	One time , after Isra ’ el ’ s sowing season , Midyan , with ‘ Amalek and others from the east , attacked them .
CJB	Judges	6	4	They set up camp by them and destroyed the produce of the country all the way to ‘ Azah ; they left nothing for people to live on , no sheep , no oxen , no donkeys .
CJB	Judges	6	5	For they came up with their cattle and tents , and they came in as thick as locusts ; both they and their camels were beyond numbering , and they came into the land to destroy it .
CJB	Judges	6	7	When the people of Isra ’ el cried out to Adonai because of Midyan ,
CJB	Judges	6	8	Adonai sent a prophet to the people of Isra ’ el , who said to them : “ Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says , ‘ I brought you up from Egypt , out of a life of slavery .
CJB	Judges	6	9	I delivered you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all your oppressors . I drove them out ahead of you and gave you their land .
CJB	Judges	6	10	And I said to you : “ I am Adonai your God ; you are not to be afraid of the gods of the Emori in whose land you are living. ” But you paid no attention to what I said ! ’ ”
CJB	Judges	6	11	Then the angel of Adonai came and sat under the pistachio tree in ‘ Ofrah that belonged to Yo ’ ash the Avi ‘ ezri . His son Gid ‘ on was threshing wheat in the winepress , in order to hide it from Midyan .
CJB	Judges	6	12	The angel of Adonai appeared to him and said to him : “ You valiant hero ! Adonai is with you ! ”
CJB	Judges	6	13	“ Excuse me , sir , ” answered Gid ‘ on , “ but if Adonai is with us , then why is all this happening to us ? And where are all his miracles our ancestors told us about when they said , ‘ Didn ’ t Adonai bring us up from Egypt ? ’ For now Adonai has abandoned us and handed us over to Midyan. ”
CJB	Judges	6	14	Adonai turned to him and said , “ Go in this strength of yours and save Isra ’ el from the hands of Midyan . Haven ’ t I sent you ? ”
CJB	Judges	6	15	But Gid ‘ on answered him , “ Forgive me , my Lord , but with what am I to save Isra ’ el ? Why , my family is the poorest in M ’ nasheh , and I ’ m the youngest person in my father ’ s house ! ”
CJB	Judges	6	16	Adonai said to him , “ Because I will be with you , you will strike down Midyan as easily as if they were just one man. ”
CJB	Judges	6	17	Gid ‘ on replied , “ If indeed you favor me , would you mind giving me a sign that it is really you talking with me ?
CJB	Judges	6	18	Please don ’ t leave until I go and return with a gift and present it to you. ” He replied , “ I ’ ll wait till you come back. ”
CJB	Judges	6	19	Gid ‘ on went in , cooked a young goat and made matzot from a bushel of flour . He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot , brought them out to him under the pistachio tree and presented them .
CJB	Judges	6	20	The angel of God said to him , “ Take the meat and matzot , lay them on this rock , and pour out the broth. ” Gid ‘ on did so .
CJB	Judges	6	21	Then the angel of Adonai reached out with the stick he was holding , touched the meat and matzot , and fire shot up out of the rock and burned up the meat and matzot . Then the angel of Adonai disappeared before his eyes .
CJB	Judges	6	22	Gid ‘ on realized that he was the angel of Adonai and said , “ Oh no ! My Lord ! Adonai ! Because I ’ ve seen the angel of Adonai face-to-face ! ”
CJB	Judges	6	23	But Adonai reassured him , “ Shalom to you , don ’ t be afraid , you won ’ t die ! ”
CJB	Judges	6	24	Then Gid ‘ on built an altar there to Adonai and called it “ Adonai-Shalom ” ; to this day it remains in ‘ Ofrah of the Avi ‘ ezri .
CJB	Judges	6	25	That very night Adonai said to him , “ Take your father ’ s bull and the other bull , the seven-year-old . Destroy the altar to Ba ‘ al that belongs to your father , cut down the sacred pole next to it ,
CJB	Judges	6	26	and build a proper altar to Adonai your God on top of this strong-point . Then take the second bull ; and offer it as a burnt offering , using the wood of the sacred pole you cut down. ”
CJB	Judges	6	27	Gid ‘ on took ten of his servants and did what Adonai had told him to do . He didn ’ t do it by day , because he was afraid of the men in his father ’ s household and those from the city , so he did it at night .
CJB	Judges	6	28	When the men of the city got up the next morning , there was the altar of Ba ‘ al destroyed , the sacred pole cut down , and the second bull a burnt offering on the newly built altar .
CJB	Judges	6	29	They asked each other , “ Who could have done this ? ” But after investigating , they concluded that Gid ‘ on the son of Yo ’ ash had done it .
CJB	Judges	6	30	“ Bring out your son , ” the men of the city demanded of Yo ’ ash , “ so that he may die , because he destroyed the altar of Ba ‘ al and cut down the sacred pole next to it ! ”
CJB	Judges	6	31	But Yo ’ ash said to all those crowding around him , “ You ’ re defending Ba ‘ al , are you ? It ’ s your job to save him ? Anyone who defends Ba ‘ al will be put to death before morning ! If he ’ s a god , let him defend himself ! After all , somebody destroyed his altar ! ”
CJB	Judges	6	32	Therefore on that day Gid ‘ on was given the name Yeruba ‘ al [ let Ba ‘ al defend ] , because they said , “ Let Ba ‘ al defend himself against him , since he destroyed his altar. ”
CJB	Judges	6	33	Now all Midyan , ‘ Amalek and the others from the east joined forces , crossed the Yarden , and set up camp in the Yizre ‘ el Valley .
CJB	Judges	6	34	But the Spirit of Adonai covered Gid ‘ on . He sounded the call on the shofar , and Avi ‘ ezer rallied behind him .
CJB	Judges	6	35	He sent messengers throughout all M ’ nasheh , and they too rallied behind him . He also sent messengers to Asher , Z ’ vulun and Naftali ; and they came up to join them .
CJB	Judges	6	36	Gid ‘ on said to God , “ If you are going to save Isra ’ el through me , as you said you would ,
CJB	Judges	6	37	then , here : I will lay a wool fleece on the threshing-floor ; if there is dew on the fleece only , while all the ground stays dry , I will be convinced that you will save Isra ’ el through me , as you said you would. ”
CJB	Judges	6	38	And it happened ! He got up early in the morning , pressed the fleece together and wrung dew out of it , a bowlful of water .
CJB	Judges	6	39	But Gid ‘ on said to God , “ Don ’ t be angry with me because I am asking one more thing , let me make one more test , please : this time let it be dry only on the fleece , with dew all over the ground. ”
CJB	Judges	6	40	And that is what God did that night — it was dry only on the fleece , even though there was dew all over the ground .
CJB	Judges	7	7	Adonai said to Gid ‘ on , “ I will use the three hundred men who lapped the water to save you ; I will hand Midyan over to you . Let all these others go back home. ”
CJB	Judges	7	2	Adonai said to Gid ‘ on , “ There are too many people with you for me to hand Midyan over to them , because I don ’ t want Isra ’ el to be able to boast against me , ‘ We saved ourselves by our own strength. ’
CJB	Judges	7	3	Therefore , proclaim to the people ‘ Anyone who is anxious or afraid should go back home , while we stay here on Mount Gil ‘ ad. ’ ” Twenty-two thousand returned , but ten thousand remained .
CJB	Judges	7	4	Adonai said to Gid ‘ on , “ There are still too many people . Have them come down to the water , and there I will screen them for you . If I say of anyone , ‘ This one is for you , ’ he will go with you ; and if I say , ‘ This one is not for you , ’ he won ’ t go with you. ”
CJB	Judges	7	5	So he brought the people down to the water , and Adonai said to Gid ‘ on , “ Put to one side everyone who laps up water with his tongue the way a dog does , and put to the other side everyone who gets down on his knees to drink. ”
CJB	Judges	7	6	Three hundred lapped , putting their hand to their mouth ; all the rest of the men got down on their knees to drink water .
CJB	Judges	7	8	So they took the provisions and the shofars of the people ; then he sent all the men of Isra ’ el away , each to his tent . But the three hundred men he kept . The camp of Midyan was in the valley below him .
CJB	Judges	7	9	That night Adonai said to him , “ Get up and attack the camp , because I have handed it over to you .
CJB	Judges	7	10	But if you are afraid to attack , go down with your servant Purah ;
CJB	Judges	7	11	and after you hear what they are saying , you will have the courage to attack the camp. ” So with his servant Purah he went down to the outposts of the camp .
CJB	Judges	7	12	Now Midyan , ‘ Amalek and all the others from the east had settled in the valley as thick as locusts ; their camels too were beyond counting , like the sand on the seashore .
CJB	Judges	7	13	Gid ‘ on got there just as a man was telling a comrade about a dream he had had : “ I just now dreamt that a loaf of barley bread fell into the camp of Midyan , came to the tent and struck it so hard that it overturned the tent and knocked it flat. ”
CJB	Judges	7	14	His comrade answered , “ This can only be the sword of Gid ‘ on son of Yo ’ ash , a man of Isra ’ el . God has given Midyan and all its army into his hands. ”
CJB	Judges	7	15	When Gid ‘ on heard the dream and its interpretation , he fell on his knees in worship . Then he returned to the camp of Isra ’ el and said , “ Get up ! because Adonai has handed Midyan ’ s army over to you. ”
CJB	Judges	7	16	He divided the three hundred men into three companies . He put in the hands of all of them shofars and empty pitchers with torches in them .
CJB	Judges	7	17	Then he said to them , “ Watch me , and do what I do . When I get to the edge of the camp , whatever I do , you do the same .
CJB	Judges	7	18	When I and everyone with me blow the shofar , then you blow your shofars all around the whole camp , and shout , “ For Adonai and for Gid ‘ on ! ”
CJB	Judges	7	19	Gid ‘ on and the hundred men with him arrived at the edge of the camp a little before midnight , just after they had changed the guard . They blew the shofars and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands .
CJB	Judges	7	20	All three companies blew the shofars , broke the pitchers and held the torches in their left hands , keeping their right hands free for the shofars they were blowing ; and they shouted , “ The sword for Adonai and for Gid ‘ on ! ”
CJB	Judges	7	21	Then , as every man stood still in place around the camp , the whole camp was thrown into panic , with everyone screaming and trying to escape .
CJB	Judges	7	22	Gid ‘ on ’ s men blew their
CJB	Judges	7	300	shofars , and Adonai caused everyone in the camp to attack his comrades ; and the enemy fled beyond Beit-Sheetah near Tz ’ rerah , as far as the border of Avel-M ’ cholah , by Tabat .
CJB	Judges	7	23	Then men of Isra ’ el were summoned from Naftali , Asher , and both regions of M ’ nasheh ; and they pursued Midyan .
CJB	Judges	7	24	Gid ‘ on sent messengers through all the hills of Efrayim , with the message , “ Come down and attack Midyan ; and capture the rivers before they get there , as far as Beit-Barah , and also the Yarden. ” So all the men of Efrayim came together and seized the rivers as far as Beit-Barah and the Yarden .
CJB	Judges	7	25	They also captured two chiefs of Midyan , ‘ Orev and Ze ’ ev . They put ‘ Orev to death at the Rock of ‘ Orev and Ze ’ ev at Ze ’ ev ’ s Winepress ; then , as they kept pursuing Midyan , they brought the heads of Orev and Ze ’ ev to Gid ‘ on , who had crossed to the far side of the Yarden .
CJB	Judges	8	8	From there he went up to P ’ nu ’ el and made the same request , and the people of P ’ nu ’ el gave the same answer as those of Sukkot .
CJB	Judges	8	2	He answered by saying to them , “ How can what I have done be compared with what you have done ? Aren ’ t the grapes Efrayim leaves on the vines better than the ones Avi ‘ ezer harvests ?
CJB	Judges	8	3	God handed over to you Midyan ’ s chiefs , ‘ Orev and Ze ’ ev . What could I do that matches what you did ? ” By saying that , he appeased their anger at him .
CJB	Judges	8	4	By now Gid ‘ on and his three hundred men had come to the Yarden and crossed over . They were exhausted but were still pursuing the enemy .
CJB	Judges	8	5	In Sukkot he asked the people there , “ Please give some loaves of bread to the men following me , because they are exhausted , and I am pursuing Zevach and Tzalmuna the kings of Midyan. ”
CJB	Judges	8	6	But the chiefs of Sukkot said , “ You haven ’ t captured Zevach and Tzalmuna yet , so why should we give bread to your army ? ”
CJB	Judges	8	7	Gid ‘ on said : “ If that ’ s your answer , then after Adonai has put Zevach and Tzalmuna in my hands , I will tear your flesh apart with desert thorns and thistles ! ”
CJB	Judges	8	9	So he answered the people of P ’ nu ’ el similarly , “ When I return safe and sound , I will break down this tower ! ”
CJB	Judges	8	10	Now Zevach and Tzalmuna were in Karkor with their army , about 15,000 men , all that remained of the entire army of the people from the east ; since 120,000 arms-bearing soldiers had fallen .
CJB	Judges	8	11	Gid ‘ on went up , using the route of the nomads east of Novach and Yogbehah , and struck down the army when they thought they were safe .
CJB	Judges	8	12	Zevach and Tzalmuna fled , but Gid ‘ on pursued them . Thus he captured the two kings of Midyan , Zevach and Tzalmuna , and routed their whole army in panic .
CJB	Judges	8	13	When Gid ‘ on the son of Yo ’ ash returned from the battle by way of the Heres Pass ,
CJB	Judges	8	14	he captured a young man from Sukkot and asked him about the chiefs and leaders of Sukkot ; he wrote down for him the names of seventy-seven of them .
CJB	Judges	8	15	Then he came to the people of Sukkot and said : “ You insulted me when you said , ‘ You haven ’ t captured Zevach and Tzalmuna yet , so why should we give bread to your exhausted men ? ’ Well , here are Zevach and Tzalmuna ! ”
CJB	Judges	8	16	And he took the leaders of the city and desert thorns and thistles , and used them to teach the people of Sukkot a lesson !
CJB	Judges	8	17	He also broke down the tower of P ’ nu ’ el and put the men of the city to death .
CJB	Judges	8	18	Then he said to Zevach and Tzalmuna , “ Tell me about the men you killed at Tavor. ” They answered , “ They looked like you , like a king ’ s sons. ”
CJB	Judges	8	19	Gid ‘ on replied , “ They were my brothers , my mother ’ s sons . As surely as Adonai is alive , I swear that if you had spared them , I would not kill you. ”
CJB	Judges	8	20	Then he ordered his oldest son , Yeter , “ Get up , and kill them ! ” But the boy didn ’ t draw his sword ; being still a boy , he was afraid .
CJB	Judges	8	21	Then Zevach and Tzalmuna said , “ You , do it . You , kill us . Let a grown man do what takes a grown man ’ s strength. ” So Gid ‘ on got up and killed Zevach and Tzalmuna ; then he took the ornamental crescents from around their camels ’ necks .
CJB	Judges	8	22	The men of Isra ’ el said to Gid ‘ on : “ Rule over us , you , your son and your grandson , because you saved us from the power of Midyan .
CJB	Judges	8	23	Gid ‘ on replied , “ Neither I nor my son will rule over you ; Adonai will rule over you. ”
CJB	Judges	8	24	Then he added , “ But I have this request to make of you , that each of you would give me the earrings from the booty you have taken. ” For the enemy soldiers had worn gold earrings , like all the other tribes descended from Yishma ‘ el .
CJB	Judges	8	25	They replied , “ We ’ re glad to give them to you. ” They spread out a robe , and each man threw in the earrings from his booty .
CJB	Judges	8	26	The gold earrings he requested weighed more than forty-two pounds ; and this doesn ’ t include the crescents , pendants and purple cloth worn by the kings of Midyan and the chains around their camels ’ necks .
CJB	Judges	8	27	Out of these things Gid ‘ on made a ritual vest , which he located in his city , ‘ Ofrah . But all Isra ’ el turned it into an idol there , and it thus became a snare to Gid ‘ on and his family .
CJB	Judges	8	28	This is how Midyan was defeated by Isra ’ el , so that they ceased to be a threat . The land had rest forty years during the lifetime of Gid ‘ on ;
CJB	Judges	8	29	Yeruba ‘ al the son of Yo ’ ash returned to his home and stayed there .
CJB	Judges	8	30	Gid ‘ on became the father of seventy sons , because he had many wives .
CJB	Judges	8	31	He also had a concubine in Sh ’ khem , and she too bore him a son , whom he called Avimelekh .
CJB	Judges	8	32	Gid ‘ on the son of Yo ’ ash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Yo ’ ash , in ‘ Ofrah of the Avi ‘ ezri .
CJB	Judges	8	33	But as soon as Gid ‘ on was dead , the people of Isra ’ el again went astray after the ba ‘ alim and made Ba ‘ al-B ’ rit their god .
CJB	Judges	8	34	They forgot Adonai their God , who had saved them from the power of all their enemies on every side ;
CJB	Judges	8	35	and they showed no kindness toward the family of Yeruba ‘ al , that is , Gid ‘ on , to repay them for all the good he had done for Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	9	9	But the olive tree replied , ‘ Am I supposed to leave my oil , which is used to honor both God and humanity , just to go and hold sway over the trees ? ’
CJB	Judges	9	2	“ Please ask all the men of Sh ’ khem , ‘ Which is better for you — that all seventy sons of Yeruba ‘ al rule over you , or that one person rule over you ? And remember that I am your blood relative. ’ ”
CJB	Judges	9	3	His mother ’ s brothers spoke to all the men of Sh ’ khem and said all this about him , so that they followed their feelings and supported Avimelekh , arguing , “ After all , he ’ s our brother. ”
CJB	Judges	9	4	They also gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Ba ‘ al-B ’ rit ; and he used these to pay good-for-nothing thugs to follow him .
CJB	Judges	9	5	He went back to his father ’ s house in ‘ Ofrah and killed his brothers the sons of Yeruba ‘ al , all seventy of them , on a single rock , except for Yotam Yeruba ‘ al ’ s youngest son , who stayed alive because he hid himself .
CJB	Judges	9	6	All the men of Sh ’ khem and all Beit-Millo got together and went and made Avimelekh king at the oak by the cult-pillar in Sh ’ khem .
CJB	Judges	9	7	When they told this to Yotam , he went and stood on top of Mount G ’ rizim and shouted , “ Listen to me , you leaders of Sh ’ khem ; then God will listen to you !
CJB	Judges	9	8	Once the trees went out to choose a king to rule them . They said to the olive tree , ‘ Rule over us ! ’
CJB	Judges	9	10	So the trees said to the fig tree , ‘ You , come and rule over us ! ’
CJB	Judges	9	11	But the fig tree replied , ‘ Am I supposed to leave my sweetness and my good fruit just to go and hold sway over the trees ? ’
CJB	Judges	9	12	So the trees said to the grapevine , ‘ You , come and rule over us ! ’
CJB	Judges	9	13	But the grapevine replied , ‘ Am I supposed to leave my wine , which gives cheer to God and humanity , just to go and hold sway over the trees ? ’
CJB	Judges	9	14	Finally , all the trees said to the thorn bush , ‘ You , come and rule over us ! ’
CJB	Judges	9	15	The thorn bush replied , ‘ If you really make me king over you , then come and take shelter in my shade . But if not , let fire come out of the thorn bush and burn down the cedars of the L ’ vanon ! ’
CJB	Judges	9	16	“ Here ’ s the point . Have you been honest and straightforward in making Avimelekh king ? Have you been fair with Yeruba ‘ al and his household and treated him as he deserves ?
CJB	Judges	9	17	My father fought on your behalf , risking his life , and rescued you from the power of Midyan ;
CJB	Judges	9	18	and now you are rebelling against my father ’ s household . You ’ ve killed his seventy sons on a single stone and made Avimelekh , the son of his slave-girl , king over the men of Sh ’ khem , because he ’ s your brother .
CJB	Judges	9	19	I say this : if you are dealing honestly and righteously with Yeruba ‘ al and his household today , then may you enjoy Avimelekh and may he enjoy you !
CJB	Judges	9	20	But if not , let fire come out from Avimelekh and burn up the men of Sh ’ khem and Beit-Millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Sh ’ khem and Beit-Millo and burn up Avimelekh ! ”
CJB	Judges	9	21	Then Yotam fled , making his way to Be ’ er , and he lived there for fear of Avimelekh his brother .
CJB	Judges	9	22	Avimelekh was chief over Isra ’ el for three years .
CJB	Judges	9	23	But God sent a spirit of discord between Avimelekh and the men of Sh ’ khem , so that the men of Sh ’ khem dealt treacherously with Avimelekh .
CJB	Judges	9	24	This came about so that the crime against the seventy sons of Yeruba ‘ al might be avenged and the responsibility for their bloody death be placed on Avimelekh their brother , who murdered them , and on the men of Sh ’ khem , who helped him kill his brothers .
CJB	Judges	9	25	So the men of Sh ’ khem sent out men to ambush him on the mountaintops . They robbed everyone who went past them , and Avimelekh was told about it .
CJB	Judges	9	26	Ga ‘ al the son of a slave came with his brothers and went on to Sh ’ khem , and the men of Sh ’ khem put their trust in him .
CJB	Judges	9	27	They went out into the field , gathered their grapes and pressed the juice out of them . Then they held a feast and went into the house of their god to eat and drink , and there they insulted Avimelekh .
CJB	Judges	9	28	Ga ‘ al the son of a slave said , “ Who is Avimelekh ? Think of the contrast with Sh ’ khem ! Why should we serve Avimelekh ? Isn ’ t he the son of Yeruba ‘ al ? Isn ’ t Z ’ vul his officer ? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Sh ’ khem ! Why should we serve Avimelekh ?
CJB	Judges	9	29	If I were in control of this people , I ’ d get rid of Avimelekh ! ” Then , addressing his words to Avimelekh , he said , “ Come out and fight ! I don ’ t care if you make your army even larger ! ”
CJB	Judges	9	30	When Z ’ vul the ruler of the city heard the words of Ga ‘ al the son of a slave , he was enraged .
CJB	Judges	9	31	He sent messengers to Avimelekh in Tormah with this message : “ Ga ‘ al the son of a slave and his brothers have come to Sh ’ khem , and they ’ re inciting the city against you .
CJB	Judges	9	32	You and the men with you should come up now at night and lie in wait in the field .
CJB	Judges	9	33	In the morning , get up early , as soon as the sun rises ; and attack the city . Then , when Ga ‘ al and the men with him come out to fight you , do whatever you can to them. ”
CJB	Judges	9	34	Avimelekh and all the men with him came up by night and lay in wait against Sh ’ khem in four groups .
CJB	Judges	9	35	Ga ‘ al the son of a slave went out and stationed himself at the entrance to the city gate . Then Avimelekh and his men rose from their ambush .
CJB	Judges	9	36	When Ga ‘ al saw the men , he said to Z ’ vul , “ Look , there are men coming down from the mountaintops. ” Z ’ vul answered , “ You ’ re seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men. ”
CJB	Judges	9	37	Ga ‘ al said again , “ Look , there are men coming down from the main hill in the land , and one group is coming on the road from the Fortuneteller ’ s Oak .
CJB	Judges	9	38	Z ’ vul said to him , “ Where ’ s your mouth now ? You said , ‘ Who is Avimelekh ? Why should we serve him ? ’ Aren ’ t these the people you despise ? Go on out and fight them ! ”
CJB	Judges	9	39	So Ga ‘ al went out , leading the men of Sh ’ khem , and fought Avimelekh .
CJB	Judges	9	40	But Avimelekh gave chase , and Ga ‘ al took to flight ; many fell wounded , strewn all along the way to the city gate .
CJB	Judges	9	41	Then Avimelekh took up residence in Arumah , and Z ’ vul drove out Ga ‘ al and his brothers , so that they could not live in Sh ’ khem .
CJB	Judges	9	42	But the very next day , the people went out into the field , and Avimelekh was told about it .
CJB	Judges	9	43	He took his men , divided them into three groups , and lay in wait in the field . When he saw the people going out of the city , he came out of hiding and slaughtered them .
CJB	Judges	9	44	Avimelekh and his group rushed forward and occupied the entrance to the city gate , while the other two groups attacked all those in the field and killed them .
CJB	Judges	9	45	Avimelekh fought against the city all that day ; captured it , killed its people , destroyed its buildings and sowed its land with salt .
CJB	Judges	9	46	When all the men in the fortress at Sh ’ khem heard about this , they took refuge in the stronghold of the temple of El-B ’ rit .
CJB	Judges	9	47	Avimelekh was told that all the men from the Sh ’ khem fortress had gathered together ;
CJB	Judges	9	48	so he led all his men up to Mount Tzalmon , where he took an axe in his hand , cut a branch off a tree , and laid it on his shoulder . Then he said to those with him , “ Quick ! Do just what you saw me do ! ”
CJB	Judges	9	49	They all did likewise , each man cutting off his branch ; and they followed Avimelekh . They put the branches up against the stronghold , set them on fire , and burned down the stronghold ; so that all the people from the Sh ’ khem fortress died , about a thousand men and women .
CJB	Judges	9	50	Then Avimelekh went to Tevetz , set up camp against Tevetz and captured it .
CJB	Judges	9	51	But there was a fortified tower inside the city ; and all the men and women took refuge in it , everyone in the city . They shut themselves inside and went up onto the roof of the tower .
CJB	Judges	9	52	However , when Avimelekh approached the tower , attacked it , and then came up close to the tower ’ s door in order to burn it down ,
CJB	Judges	9	53	a woman dropped an upper millstone on Avimelekh ’ s head , cracking his skull .
CJB	Judges	9	54	He quickly called out to the young man holding his armor , “ Draw your sword , and finish me off , so that people won ’ t say a woman killed me. ” So his attendant ran him through , and he died .
CJB	Judges	9	55	When the men of Isra ’ el saw that Avimelekh was dead , they all went back home .
CJB	Judges	9	56	This is how God paid back Avimelekh for the wrong he did to his father in murdering his seventy brothers .
CJB	Judges	9	57	God also repaid the men of Sh ’ khem for all the wrong they had done ; on them came the curse of Yotam the son of Yeruba ‘ al .
CJB	Judges	10	10	Then the people of Isra ’ el cried to Adonai , “ We have sinned against you by forsaking our God and serving the ba ‘ alim. ”
CJB	Judges	10	2	He judged Isra ’ el twenty-three years , and when he died he was buried in Shamir .
CJB	Judges	10	3	After him arose Ya ’ ir , from Gil ‘ ad . He judged Isra ’ el twenty-two years .
CJB	Judges	10	4	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty young donkeys . They owned thirty cities which are called Havot-Ya ’ ir to this day ; they are in the territory of Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	Judges	10	5	When Ya ’ ir died , he was buried in Kamon .
CJB	Judges	10	6	Again the people of Isra ’ el did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective — they served the ba ‘ alim , the ‘ ashtarot , the gods of Aram , the gods of Tzidon , the gods of Mo ’ av , the gods of the people of ‘ Amon and the gods of the P ’ lishtim . They abandoned Adonai and did not serve him ;
CJB	Judges	10	7	so the anger of Adonai blazed against Isra ’ el , and he handed them over to the P ’ lishtim and the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	Judges	10	8	For eighteen years , starting that year , they oppressed and persecuted all the people of Isra ’ el who lived beyond the Yarden , in the territory of the Emorim , in Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	Judges	10	9	The people of ‘ Amon also crossed the Yarden to fight Y ’ hudah , Binyamin and the house of Efrayim ; so that Isra ’ el was greatly distressed .
CJB	Judges	10	11	Adonai said to the people of Isra ’ el , “ I saved you from the Egyptians , the Emorim , the people of ‘ Amon , and the P ’ lishtim , didn ’ t I ?
CJB	Judges	10	12	Likewise , when the people of Tzidon , ‘ Amalek and Ma ‘ on oppressed you , you cried out to me ; and I rescued you from their power .
CJB	Judges	10	13	Yet you abandoned me and served other gods ; therefore I will not rescue you any more .
CJB	Judges	10	14	Go and cry to the gods you chose ; let them rescue you when you ’ re in trouble ! ”
CJB	Judges	10	15	The people of Isra ’ el said to Adonai , “ We have sinned ! Treat us in whatever way seems good to you , but save us today , please ! ”
CJB	Judges	10	16	They got rid of their foreign gods and served Adonai , and he became troubled by Isra ’ el ’ s misery .
CJB	Judges	10	17	Then the people of ‘ Amon gathered together and set up camp in Gil ‘ ad , while the people of Isra ’ el assembled and camped at Mitzpah .
CJB	Judges	10	18	The people , the chiefs of Gil ‘ ad , said to each other , “ Whoever leads the battle against the army of ‘ Amon will be head over everyone living in Gil ‘ ad . ”
CJB	Judges	11	11	Then Yiftach went with the leaders of Gil ‘ ad , and the people made him head and chief over them . Yiftach repeated all these conditions at Mitzpah in the presence of Adonai .
CJB	Judges	11	2	had other sons by his wife ; and when his wife ’ s sons grew up , they drove Yiftach away and told him , “ You will not inherit from our father , because you are another woman ’ s son. ”
CJB	Judges	11	3	Then Yiftach fled from his brothers and lived in the territory of Tov , where he enlisted a gang of rowdies who would go out raiding with him .
CJB	Judges	11	4	After a while the people of ‘ Amon made war against Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	11	5	When the army of ‘ Amon attacked Isra ’ el , the leaders of Gil ‘ ad went to fetch Yiftach from the territory of Tov
CJB	Judges	11	6	and said to him , “ Come and be our chief , so that we can fight the army of ‘ Amon. ”
CJB	Judges	11	7	Yiftach answered the leaders of Gil ‘ ad , “ Didn ’ t you hate me so much that you forced me out of my father ’ s house ? Why are you coming to me now , when you ’ re in trouble ? ”
CJB	Judges	11	8	The leaders of Gil ‘ ad replied , “ Here is why we ’ ve come back to you now : if you lead us in war with the people of ‘ Amon , you will be head over everyone living in Gil ‘ ad. ”
CJB	Judges	11	9	Yiftach answered them , “ If you bring me back home to fight the army of ‘ Amon , and Adonai defeats them for me , I will be your head. ”
CJB	Judges	11	10	The leaders of Gil ‘ ad said to Yiftach , “ Adonai is witness that we promise to do what you have said. ”
CJB	Judges	11	12	Yiftach sent messengers to the king of the people of ‘ Amon to say , “ What ’ s your problem with us ? Why are you invading our territory ? ”
CJB	Judges	11	13	The king of ‘ Amon answered the messengers of Yiftach , “ Because Isra ’ el took away my territory when they came up from Egypt . They took everything from the Arnon to the Yabok and the Yarden . Now , restore it peacefully. ”
CJB	Judges	11	14	Yiftach sent messengers again to the king of the people of ‘ Amon
CJB	Judges	11	15	with this response , “ Here is what Yiftach has to say : ‘ Isra ’ el captured neither the territory of Mo ’ av nor the territory of the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	Judges	11	16	But when Isra ’ el came up from Egypt , walked through the desert to the Red Sea and arrived at Kadesh ,
CJB	Judges	11	17	then Isra ’ el sent messengers to the king of Edom , to say , “ Please let us pass through your land. ” But the king of Edom wouldn ’ t let them . He sent a similar message to the king of Mo ’ av , but neither would he , so Isra ’ el stayed at Kadesh .
CJB	Judges	11	18	Then they walked through the desert , around the territory of Edom and the territory of Mo ’ av , past the east border of the territory of Mo ’ av , and pitched camp on the other side of the Arnon ; but they did not cross the border into Mo ’ av , for the Arnon was the border of Mo ’ av .
CJB	Judges	11	19	Isra ’ el sent messengers to Sichon king of the Emori and king of Heshbon with this message , “ Please let us pass through your land to our own place. ”
CJB	Judges	11	20	But Sichon did not trust that Isra ’ el would only pass through his land , so he gathered all his people together , pitched camp in Yahatz and fought against Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	11	21	Adonai the God of Isra ’ el handed Sichon and all his people over to Isra ’ el , and they killed them . Thus Isra ’ el possessed all the territory of the Emori who lived there .
CJB	Judges	11	22	They took possession of all the territory of the Emori from the Arnon to the Yabok and from the desert to the Yarden .
CJB	Judges	11	23	So now that Adonai the God of Isra ’ el has expelled the Emori before his people Isra ’ el , do you think that you will expel us ?
CJB	Judges	11	24	You should just keep the territory your god K ’ mosh has given you ; while we , for our part , will hold onto whatever Adonai our God has given us of the lands that belonged to others before us .
CJB	Judges	11	25	Really , are you better than Balak the son of Tzippor , king of Mo ’ av ? Did he ever pick a quarrel with Isra ’ el or fight with us ?
CJB	Judges	11	26	Isra ’ el lived in Heshbon and its villages , in ‘ Aro ‘ er and its villages and in all the cities on the banks of the Arnon for three hundred years . Why didn ’ t you take them back during that time ?
CJB	Judges	11	27	No , I have done you no wrong . But you are doing me wrong to war against me . May Adonai the Judge be judge today between the people of Isra ’ el and the people of ‘ Amon. ’ ”
CJB	Judges	11	28	But the king of the people of ‘ Amon paid no attention to the message Yiftach sent him .
CJB	Judges	11	29	Then the spirit of Adonai came upon Yiftach ; and he passed through Gil ‘ ad and M ’ nasheh , on through Mitzpeh of Gil ‘ ad , and from there over to the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	Judges	11	30	Yiftach made a vow to Adonai : “ If you will hand the people of ‘ Amon over to me ,
CJB	Judges	11	31	then whatever comes out the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the people of ‘ Amon will belong to Adonai ; I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering. ”
CJB	Judges	11	32	So Yiftach crossed over to fight the people of ‘ Amon , and Adonai handed them over to him .
CJB	Judges	11	33	He killed them from ‘ Aro ‘ er until you reach Minnit , twenty cities , all the way to Avel-K ’ ramim ; it was a massacre . So the people of ‘ Amon were defeated before the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	11	34	As Yiftach was returning to his house in Mitzpah , his daughter came dancing out to meet him with tambourines . She was his only child ; he had no other son or daughter .
CJB	Judges	11	35	When he saw her , he tore his clothes and said , “ Oh , no , my daughter ! You ’ re breaking my heart ! Why must you be the cause of such pain to me ? I made a vow to Adonai , and I can ’ t go back on my word. ”
CJB	Judges	11	36	She said to him , “ Father , you made a vow to Adonai ; so do whatever you said you would do to me ; because Adonai did take vengeance on your enemies the people of ‘ Amon. ”
CJB	Judges	11	37	Then she said to her father , “ Just do this one thing for me — let me be alone for two months . I ’ ll go away into the mountains with my friends and mourn , because I will die without getting married. ”
CJB	Judges	11	38	“ You may go , ” he answered , and he sent her away for two months . She left , she and her friends , and mourned in the mountains that she would die unmarried .
CJB	Judges	11	39	After two months she returned to her father , and he did with her what he had vowed ; she had remained a virgin . So it became a law in Isra ’ el
CJB	Judges	11	40	that the women of Isra ’ el would go every year for four days to lament the daughter of Yiftach from Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	Judges	12	12	Then Elon from Z ’ vulun died and was buried at Ayalon , in the territory of Z ’ vulun .
CJB	Judges	12	2	Yiftach answered , “ When my people and I were in a serious dispute with the people of ‘ Amon , I called you ; and you didn ’ t rescue me from their power .
CJB	Judges	12	3	When I saw that you weren ’ t rescuing me , I put my life in my own hands and went over to attack the people of ‘ Amon ; and Adonai gave them over into my power . So why have you come up today to fight me ? ”
CJB	Judges	12	4	Then Yiftach gathered together all the men of Gil ‘ ad and fought with Efrayim , and the men of Gil ‘ ad defeated Efrayim ; because they were saying , “ You Gil ‘ ad men who live in Efrayim and M ’ nasheh have deserted Efrayim ! ”
CJB	Judges	12	5	The men of Gil ‘ ad cut off Efrayim from the crossings over the Yarden , and whenever anyone from Efrayim tried to escape and said , “ Let me go across , ” the men of Gil ‘ ad would ask him , “ Are you from Efrayim ? ” and if he said , “ No , ”
CJB	Judges	12	6	they would tell him to say “ Shibbolet. ” If he said , “ Sibbolet , ” because he could not make his mouth pronounce it right , they took hold of him and killed him on the spot at the Yarden crossing ; at that time 42,000 men of Efrayim died .
CJB	Judges	12	7	Yiftach judged Isra ’ el for six years . Then Yiftach from Gil ‘ ad died , and he was buried in one of the cities of Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	Judges	12	8	After him Ibtzan of Beit-Lechem judged Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	12	9	He had thirty sons , and he had thirty daughters whom he sent abroad ; he brought thirty women from abroad in to marry his sons . He judged Isra ’ el for seven years .
CJB	Judges	12	10	Then Ibtzan died and was buried at Beit-Lechem .
CJB	Judges	12	11	After him Elon from Z ’ vulun judged Isra ’ el ; he judged Isra ’ el for ten years .
CJB	Judges	12	13	After him Avdon the son of Hillel from Pir ‘ aton judged Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	12	14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy young donkeys . He judged Isra ’ el for eight years .
CJB	Judges	12	15	Then Avdon the son of Hillel from Pir ‘ aton died and was buried at Pir ‘ aton in the territory of Efrayim , in the ‘ Amalek hills .
CJB	Judges	13	13	The angel of Adonai said to Manoach , “ The woman should take care to do everything I said to her .
CJB	Judges	13	2	There was a man from Tzor ‘ ah from the family of Dan , whose name was Manoach ; his wife was barren , childless .
CJB	Judges	13	3	The angel of Adonai appeared to the woman and said to her , “ Listen ! You are barren , you haven ’ t had a child , but you will conceive and bear a son .
CJB	Judges	13	4	Now , therefore , be careful not to drink any wine or other intoxicating liquor , and don ’ t eat anything unclean .
CJB	Judges	13	5	For indeed you will conceive and bear a son . No razor is to touch his head , because the child will be a nazir for God from the womb . Moreover , he will begin to rescue Isra ’ el from the power of the P ’ lishtim. ”
CJB	Judges	13	6	The woman came and told her husband ; she said , “ A man of God came to me ; his face was fearsome , like that of the angel of God . I didn ’ t ask him where he came from , and he didn ’ t tell me his name .
CJB	Judges	13	7	But he said to me , ‘ Listen ! You will conceive and bear a son , so now don ’ t drink any wine or other intoxicating liquor , and don ’ t eat anything unclean , because the child will be a nazir for God from the womb until the day he dies. ’ ”
CJB	Judges	13	8	Then Manoach prayed to Adonai , “ Please , Adonai , let the man of God you sent come again to us and teach us what we should do for the child who will be born. ”
CJB	Judges	13	9	God paid attention to what Manoach said , and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field , but her husband Manoach wasn ’ t with her .
CJB	Judges	13	10	The woman hurried and ran to tell her husband , “ Here ! That man , the one who came to me the other day , he ’ s come again ! ”
CJB	Judges	13	11	Manoach got up , followed his wife , went to the man and said to him , “ Are you the man who spoke to the woman ? ” He answered , “ I am. ”
CJB	Judges	13	12	Manoach asked , “ Now , when what you said comes true , what are the guidelines for raising the child ? What should be done for him ? ”
CJB	Judges	13	14	She shouldn ’ t eat anything that comes from a grapevine , she shouldn ’ t drink wine or other intoxicating liquor , and she shouldn ’ t eat anything unclean . She should do everything I ordered her to do. ”
CJB	Judges	13	15	Manoach said to the angel of Adonai , “ Please stay with us a bit longer , so that we can cook a young goat for you. ”
CJB	Judges	13	16	The angel of Adonai said to Manoach , “ Even if I do stay , I won ’ t eat your food ; and if you prepare a burnt offering , you must offer it to Adonai. ” For Manoach did not know that he was the angel of Adonai .
CJB	Judges	13	17	Manoach said to the angel of Adonai , “ Tell us your name , so that when your words come true we can honor you. ”
CJB	Judges	13	18	The angel of Adonai answered him , “ Why are you asking about my name ? It is wonderful. ”
CJB	Judges	13	19	Manoach took the kid and the grain offering and offered them on the rock to Adonai . Then , with Manoach and his wife looking on , the angel did something wonderful —
CJB	Judges	13	20	as the flame went up toward the sky from the altar , the angel of Adonai went up in the flame from the altar . When Manoach and his wife saw it , they fell to the ground on their faces .
CJB	Judges	13	21	But the angel of Adonai did not appear again to Manoach or his wife . Then Manoach realized it had been the angel of Adonai .
CJB	Judges	13	22	Manoach said to his wife , “ We will surely die , because we have seen God ! ”
CJB	Judges	13	23	But his wife said to him , “ If Adonai had wanted to kill us , he wouldn ’ t have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from us , and he wouldn ’ t have shown us all this or told us such things at this time. ”
CJB	Judges	13	24	The woman bore a son and called him Shimshon . The child grew , and Adonai blessed him .
CJB	Judges	13	25	The Spirit of Adonai began to stir him when he was in the Camp of Dan , between Tzor ‘ ah and Eshta ’ ol .
CJB	Judges	14	14	So he said to them , “ Out of the eater came food ; out of the strong came sweetness. ” Three days passed , and they couldn ’ t solve the riddle .
CJB	Judges	14	2	He came up and told his father and mother , “ I saw a woman in Timnah , one of the P ’ lishtim . Now get her for me to be my wife. ”
CJB	Judges	14	3	His father and mother replied , “ Isn ’ t there any woman from the daughters of your kinsmen or among all my people ? Must you go to the uncircumcised P ’ lishtim to find a wife ? ” Shimshon said to his father , “ Get her for me . I like her. ”
CJB	Judges	14	4	His father and mother didn ’ t know that all this came from Adonai , who was seeking grounds for a quarrel with the P ’ lishtim . ( At that time the P ’ lishtim were ruling Isra ’ el . )
CJB	Judges	14	5	Shimshon went down with his father and mother to Timnah . When they came to the vineyards of Timnah , a young lion roared at him .
CJB	Judges	14	6	The Spirit of Adonai came powerfully upon Shimshon , and barehanded he tore the lion to pieces as easily as if it had been a young goat . But he didn ’ t tell his father or mother what he had done .
CJB	Judges	14	7	Then he went down and talked with the woman and found he still liked her .
CJB	Judges	14	8	Awhile later , as he was returning to claim his bride , he turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion and saw that there was now a swarm of bees in the body of the lion , and honey .
CJB	Judges	14	9	He scraped the honey out into his hands and went on , eating as he went ; and when he came to his father and mother , he gave them some ; and they ate too . But he didn ’ t tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion .
CJB	Judges	14	10	His father went down to the woman , and there Shimshon gave a banquet — this is what the young men used to do .
CJB	Judges	14	11	When the P ’ lishtim saw him , they provided thirty companions to be with him .
CJB	Judges	14	12	Shimshon said to them , “ Let me present you with a riddle . If you can solve it within the seven days of the banquet and tell me the solution , I will give you thirty linen shirts and thirty changes of good clothes .
CJB	Judges	14	13	But if you can ’ t solve it , you give me thirty linen shirts and thirty changes of good clothes. ” They answered , “ Tell us the riddle , we want to hear it. ”
CJB	Judges	14	15	On the seventh day , they said to Shimshon ’ s wife , “ Coax your husband into telling us the solution to the riddle . Otherwise we ’ ll burn down your father ’ s house and you with it . You two called us here to turn us into paupers , didn ’ t you ? ”
CJB	Judges	14	16	Shimshon ’ s wife went to him in tears and said , “ You don ’ t love me , you hate me ! You told a riddle to my fellow countrymen , and you haven ’ t told me the answer. ” He said to her , “ Look , I haven ’ t even told it to my father and mother ! Should I tell you ? ”
CJB	Judges	14	17	But she had been crying throughout the seven days of the banquet ; so on the seventh day , because she had kept pressing him , he told her the solution ; and she passed it on to her people .
CJB	Judges	14	18	Then , before sundown on the seventh day , the men of the city said to him , “ What is sweeter than honey ? and what is stronger than a lion ? ” Shimshon answered , “ If you hadn ’ t plowed with my young cow , you wouldn ’ t have solved my riddle now. ”
CJB	Judges	14	19	Then the Spirit of Adonai came over him powerfully . He went down to Ashkelon , killed thirty of their men , took their good clothes , and gave them to the men who had “ solved ” the riddle . He was boiling with rage , so he went straight up to his father ’ s house ,
CJB	Judges	14	20	and his wife was given to the companion who had been best man at the wedding .
CJB	Judges	15	15	He found a fresh donkey jawbone , took it in his hand , and with it he struck down a thousand men .
CJB	Judges	15	2	Her father said , “ I really thought you hated her altogether , so I gave her to your best man . But her younger sister — isn ’ t she even prettier ? Why not take her instead ? ”
CJB	Judges	15	3	Shimshon said to them , “ This time I ’ m through with the P ’ lishtim ! I ’ m going to do something terrible to them ! ”
CJB	Judges	15	4	So Shimshon went and caught three hundred foxes . Then he took torches , tied pairs of foxes to each other by their tails , and put a torch in the knot of every pair of tails .
CJB	Judges	15	5	Then he set the torches on fire and let the foxes loose in wheat fields of the P ’ lishtim . In this way he burned up the harvested wheat along with the grain waiting to be harvested , and the olive orchards as well .
CJB	Judges	15	6	The P ’ lishtim asked , “ Who did this ? ” They answered , “ Shimshon the son-in-law of the man from Timnah , because he took Shimshon ’ s wife and gave her to his best man. ” Then the P ’ lishtim came up and burned both her and her father to death .
CJB	Judges	15	7	Shimshon said to them , “ I will certainly have my revenge on you for doing such a thing ; but after I do , I ’ ll stop. ”
CJB	Judges	15	8	Infuriated , he began killing them right and left ; it was a massacre . Then he went down and stayed in the cave at the ‘ Eitam Rock .
CJB	Judges	15	9	The P ’ lishtim went up , pitched camp in Y ’ hudah and attacked Lechi .
CJB	Judges	15	10	The men of Y ’ hudah said , “ Why are you attacking us ? ” They replied , “ To arrest Shimshon , that ’ s why — to treat him the way he treated us. ”
CJB	Judges	15	11	Then 3,000 men from Y ’ hudah went down to the cave at the Eitam Rock and said to Shimshon , “ Don ’ t you know that the P ’ lishtim are our rulers ? What are you doing to us ? ” He answered , “ I ’ ve only treated them the way they treated me. ”
CJB	Judges	15	12	They said to him , “ We ’ ve come down to arrest you and hand you over to the P ’ lishtim. ” Shimshon replied , “ Swear to me that you won ’ t fall on me yourselves. ”
CJB	Judges	15	13	They said to him , “ No , but we will tie you up and hand you over to them . However , we promise not to kill you. ” So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock .
CJB	Judges	15	14	When he got to Lechi , the P ’ lishtim came running and shouting at him ; and the Spirit of Adonai came on him powerfully . The ropes on his arms became as weak as burnt flax and fell from his arms .
CJB	Judges	15	16	Shimshon said , “ With the jawbone of a donkey I left heaps piled on heaps ! With the jawbone of a donkey I killed a thousand men ! ”
CJB	Judges	15	17	After he finished speaking he threw the jawbone away , and the place came to be called Ramat-Lechi [ jawbone heights ] .
CJB	Judges	15	18	Then he felt very thirsty , so he called on Adonai , saying , “ You accomplished this great rescue through your servant . But am I now to die from thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised ? ”
CJB	Judges	15	19	Then God made a gash in the crater at Lechi , and water came out . When he had drunk , his spirit came back ; and he revived . This is why the place was called ‘ Ein-HaKorei [ the spring of him who called ] , and it is there in Lechi until now .
CJB	Judges	15	20	He judged Isra ’ el in the period of the P ’ lishtim for twenty years .
CJB	Judges	16	16	Every day she kept nagging at him and pressing at him , till it bothered him to death ,
CJB	Judges	16	2	The people in ‘ Azah were told that Shimshon had come , so they surrounded the place where he was and also set an ambush for him all night at the city gate . Their plan was to do nothing at night , but to wait until morning and then kill him .
CJB	Judges	16	3	However , Shimshon stayed in bed until midnight ; then he got up , took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two posts as well , pulled them up , bar and all , hoisted them on his shoulders , and carried them up to the top of the hill overlooking Hevron .
CJB	Judges	16	4	After this , he fell in love with a woman who lived in the Sorek Valley , whose name was D ’ lilah .
CJB	Judges	16	5	The chiefs of the P ’ lishtim went up to her and said , “ Coax him into telling you where his great strength comes from and how we can overcome him , so that we can tie him up and subdue him . If you do , each of us will give you 1,100 pieces of silver. ”
CJB	Judges	16	6	D ’ lilah said to Shimshon , “ Please tell me what it is that makes you so strong , and how someone could tie you up and subdue you. ”
CJB	Judges	16	7	Shimshon replied , “ If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that have never been dried , I will become as weak as any other man. ”
CJB	Judges	16	8	The chiefs of the P ’ lishtim brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried , and she tied him up with them .
CJB	Judges	16	9	Now she had people lying in wait in the inside room . So she said to him , “ Shimshon ! The P ’ lishtim have come for you ! ” But he snapped the bowstrings as easily as a piece of straw breaks when it touches fire , and the source of his strength remained unknown .
CJB	Judges	16	10	D ’ lilah said to Shimshon , “ You ’ re making fun of me , telling me lies . Now , come on , tell me what it takes to tie you up. ”
CJB	Judges	16	11	“ All it takes , ” he answered , “ is to tie me up with new ropes that haven ’ t been used . Then I ’ ll become weak and be like anyone else. ”
CJB	Judges	16	12	So D ’ lilah took new ropes , tied him up , and said to him , “ Shimshon ! The P ’ lishtim have come for you ! ” ( The people lying in wait were in the inside room . ) But he broke the ropes from off his arms like a thread .
CJB	Judges	16	13	D ’ lilah said to Shimshon , “ Till now you ’ ve been making fun of me and telling me lies . Tell me what it takes to tie you up. ” He said , “ If you weave the seven locks of my hair across thread on a loom. ”
CJB	Judges	16	14	So she fastened her cloth work in the loom with a pin and wove his hair in , then said to him , “ Shimshon ! The P ’ lishtim have come for you ! ” He awoke from his sleep and pulled away the loom pin and the interwoven cloth .
CJB	Judges	16	15	She said to him , “ How can you say you love me when your heart isn ’ t with me ? Three times you ’ ve made fun of me , and you haven ’ t told me the source of your great strength. ”
CJB	Judges	16	17	so that he finally told her everything . He said to her , “ No razor has ever touched my head , because I have been a nazir of God since I was born . If someone shaves me , then my strength will leave me ; and I will be like any other man. ”
CJB	Judges	16	18	When D ’ lilah saw that he had really confided in her , she sent and summoned the chiefs of the P ’ lishtim with the message , “ Come up this one last time , because he has finally told me the truth. ” The chiefs of the P ’ lishtim went up to her and brought the money with them .
CJB	Judges	16	19	She had him go to sleep in her lap and called for a man to shave off his seven locks of hair . Then she began tormenting him , but his strength had gone away .
CJB	Judges	16	20	She said , “ Shimshon ! The P ’ lishtim have come for you ! ” He awoke from his sleep and said , “ I ’ ll get out this time , just as I shook myself loose before. ” But he didn ’ t know that Adonai had left him .
CJB	Judges	16	21	So the P ’ lishtim seized him , gouged out his eyes and took him down to ‘ Azah . There they bound him with two bronze chains and put him to work grinding grain at the mill in the prison .
CJB	Judges	16	22	However , after the hair on his head had been cut off , it began growing back again .
CJB	Judges	16	23	The chiefs of the P ’ lishtim assembled to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon . As they celebrated they sang , “ Our god has handed over to us our enemy Shimshon. ”
CJB	Judges	16	24	Upon seeing him , the people praised their god : “ Our god has handed over to us our enemy , who destroyed our land and killed so many of us. ”
CJB	Judges	16	25	When they were in high spirits they said , “ Summon Shimshon to amuse us. ” So they called Shimshon out of the prison , and he amused them . When they put him between the columns ,
CJB	Judges	16	26	Shimshon said to the boy holding him by the hand , “ Let me feel the columns supporting the building , so that I can lean on them. ”
CJB	Judges	16	27	The building was full of men and women ; and all the chiefs of the P ’ lishtim were there ; in addition to them , there were about three thousand men and women on the roof , watching , as Shimshon performed .
CJB	Judges	16	28	Shimshon called to Adonai , “ Adonai Elohim , just this once , please , think of me , and please , give me strength , so that I can take revenge on the P ’ lishtim for at least one of my two eyes. ”
CJB	Judges	16	29	Shimshon got a good hold on the two middle columns supporting the building and leaned on them , on one with his right hand and on the other with his left .
CJB	Judges	16	30	Then , crying , “ Let me die with the P ’ lishtim ! ” he pushed with all his might ; and the building collapsed on the chiefs and on all the people inside . So he killed more at his death than he had killed during his life .
CJB	Judges	16	31	His brothers and all his father ’ s family came down , took him , brought him up and buried him between Tzor ‘ ah and Eshta ’ ol , in the tomb of his father Manoach . He had judged Isra ’ el twenty years .
CJB	Judges	17	17	There was a man from the hills of Efrayim named Mikhay ’ hu .
CJB	Judges	17	2	He said to his mother , “ You know the 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you — you pronounced a curse about it , and you told me about it ? Well , the money is with me . I took it. ” His mother said , “ May Adonai bless my son , ”
CJB	Judges	17	3	as he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother . Then his mother said , “ I solemnly dedicate this money of mine to Adonai , in order for my son to make a carved image overlaid with silver . So now I ’ m giving it back to you. ”
CJB	Judges	17	4	But he returned the money to his mother , and she took
CJB	Judges	17	200	pieces of silver and gave them to the metalworker , who made a carved image overlaid with silver which was put in Mikhay ’ hu ’ s house .
CJB	Judges	17	5	This man Mikhah owned a house of God ; so he made a ritual vest and household gods and consecrated one of his sons , who became his cohen .
CJB	Judges	17	6	At that time there was no king in Isra ’ el ; a man simply did whatever he thought was right .
CJB	Judges	17	7	There was a young man from Beit-Lechem in Y ’ hudah , from the family of Y ’ hudah , who was a Levi . He had been staying
CJB	Judges	17	8	in Beit-Lechem , but he left there to find another place to live and came to the hills of Efrayim , where eventually he made his way to the house of Mikhah .
CJB	Judges	17	9	Mikhah asked him , “ Where are you coming from ? ” He answered , “ I am a Levi from Beit-Lechem in Y ’ hudah , and I ’ m looking for a place to live. ”
CJB	Judges	17	10	Mikhah replied , “ Stay with me , and be a father and cohen for me ; I will give you ten pieces of silver a year , in addition to your clothing and food. ” So the Levi went in
CJB	Judges	17	11	and agreed to stay with the man ; the young man became like one of his sons .
CJB	Judges	17	12	After Mikhah consecrated the Levi , the young man became his cohen and stayed there in Mikhah ’ s house .
CJB	Judges	17	13	Mikhah said , “ Now I know that Adonai will treat me well , because I have a Levi for a cohen .
CJB	Judges	18	18	But when they went into Mikhah ’ s house and took the silver-covered image , the vest and the household gods , the cohen asked them , “ What are you doing ? ”
CJB	Judges	18	2	The people of Dan sent five leading men from Tzor ‘ ah and Eshta ’ ol , representing their whole tribe , to spy out and explore the land . They instructed them , “ Go , and explore the land. ” They came to the hills of Efrayim , to the house of Mikhah , and stayed there .
CJB	Judges	18	3	While they were at Mikhah ’ s house they recognized the accent of the young man , the Levi , so they approached him and said , “ Who brought you here ? What are you doing in this place ? What is there for you here ? ”
CJB	Judges	18	4	He answered , “ Here ’ s the arrangement Mikhah has made with me : he pays me a wage , and I serve as his cohen. ”
CJB	Judges	18	5	They said to him , “ Please ask God whether our journey will be successful. ”
CJB	Judges	18	6	The cohen replied , “ Don ’ t worry . Adonai is with you on this journey. ”
CJB	Judges	18	7	The five men left , came to Layish and saw the people there living securely according to the customs of the Tzidonim , quietly and securely ; since no one in the land was exercising authority that might shame them in any respect ; moreover , they were far away from the Tzidonim and had no dealings with other peoples .
CJB	Judges	18	8	When they returned to their kinsmen in Tzor ‘ ah and Eshta ’ ol , they asked them what they had to report .
CJB	Judges	18	9	They said , “ Let ’ s go up and attack them . We ’ ve seen the land , and it ’ s excellent . Don ’ t delay ; start moving ! Go in , and take the land !
CJB	Judges	18	10	When you go , you will come to a people who feel safe . There ’ s plenty of land , the place lacks nothing , it has everything there is on earth , and God has given it to you. ”
CJB	Judges	18	11	So from the tribe of Dan
CJB	Judges	18	600	soldiers by the gate .
CJB	Judges	18	12	They went up and camped at Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim , in Y ’ hudah , which is why that place is called Machaneh-Dan [ the camp of Dan ] to this day ( actually , it ’ s behind Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim ) .
CJB	Judges	18	13	From there they passed on into the hills of Efrayim and came to Mikhah ’ s house .
CJB	Judges	18	14	The men who had gone to spy out the land of Layish then said to their kinsmen , “ Are you aware that in these buildings there is a ritual vest , household gods and a carved image overlaid with silver ? Decide what you ought to do. ”
CJB	Judges	18	15	They turned off the road and went to the house of the young Levi , that is , to Mikhah ’ s house , and asked how he was doing .
CJB	Judges	18	16	The
CJB	Judges	18	17	while the five who had spied out the land went in and took the idol overlaid with silver , the vest and the household gods . The cohen had stayed with the
CJB	Judges	18	19	They replied , “ Be quiet , keep your mouth shut , and come with us . Be a father and a cohen for us . Which is better ? To be a cohen in the house of one man or to be cohen to a whole tribe and family in Isra ’ el ? ”
CJB	Judges	18	20	This made the cohen feel very good ; so he took the ritual vest , the household gods and the image and went off with the people .
CJB	Judges	18	21	So they turned and left , with their children , cattle and belongings going ahead of them .
CJB	Judges	18	22	When they were a good distance from Mikhah ’ s house , the men who lived in the houses near his got together [ with him ] , overtook the people from Dan
CJB	Judges	18	23	and began shouting at them . The people from Dan turned and said to Mikhah , “ What ’ s wrong with you , that you ’ ve gathered such a crowd ? ”
CJB	Judges	18	24	He answered , “ You ’ ve taken away my god , which I made , and gone off with the cohen ! What more have I got ? How can you ask me , ‘ What ’ s wrong with you ? ’ ”
CJB	Judges	18	25	The men from Dan replied , “ You had best say no more to us , because some of us might get angry and attack you . You could lose your life , and so might the others in your household. ”
CJB	Judges	18	26	Then the people from Dan went their way ; and when Mikhah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house .
CJB	Judges	18	27	So they took what Mikhah had made and his cohen . They came to Layish , to a quiet and trusting people . They attacked , killed them and burned down the city .
CJB	Judges	18	28	No one came to rescue them , because it was far from Tzidon , and they had no dealings with other peoples . This was in the valley near Beit-Rechov . Then the people of Dan rebuilt the city and settled there .
CJB	Judges	18	29	They named the city Dan , after Dan their ancestor , who was born to Isra ’ el ; although the city had previously been called Layish .
CJB	Judges	18	30	The people of Dan set up the image for themselves . Y ’ honatan the son of Gershom , the son of M ’ nasheh , and his sons were cohanim for the tribe of the people of Dan until the day of the exile from the land .
CJB	Judges	18	31	Thus they erected for themselves Mikhah ’ s idol which he had made , and it remained there as long as the house of God was in Shiloh .
CJB	Judges	19	19	We have straw and food for our donkeys , also bread and wine for me , my concubine and the boy there with your servants ; we don ’ t need anything else. ”
CJB	Judges	19	2	But his concubine was unfaithful to him and left him to go to her father ’ s house at Beit-Lechem in Y ’ hudah , where she stayed for some time , four months .
CJB	Judges	19	3	Then her husband went after her to persuade her to return ; he had his servant with him and a pair of donkeys . She brought him into her father ’ s house ; and when the girl ’ s father saw him , he was glad to meet him .
CJB	Judges	19	4	His father-in-law , the girl ’ s father , kept him there ; so he remained with him three days ; they ate , drank and stayed there .
CJB	Judges	19	5	On the fourth day they got up early in the morning , and he prepared to leave . But the girl ’ s father said to his son-in-law , “ You ’ ll feel better if you have a bite of food before you leave. ”
CJB	Judges	19	6	So the two of them sat down and ate and drank together . Then the girl ’ s father said to the man , “ Please stay one more night , and have a good time. ”
CJB	Judges	19	7	The man rose to leave , but his father-in-law pressed him , so he stayed there again .
CJB	Judges	19	8	The morning of the fifth day , he got up early to leave ; but the girl ’ s father said , “ Why don ’ t you have something to eat , and leave this afternoon ? ” So the two men ate .
CJB	Judges	19	9	When the man got up to leave with his concubine and servant , his father-in-law , the girl ’ s father , said to him , “ Look , it ’ s almost evening . Please stay the night — you see that it ’ s getting late . Stay on , enjoy yourself , and tomorrow get going early on your way home. ”
CJB	Judges	19	10	But the man wouldn ’ t stay that night ; so he got up and left with his concubine and his two saddled donkeys ; and they arrived at Y ’ vus , also known as Yerushalayim .
CJB	Judges	19	11	By the time they arrived at Y ’ vus it was nearly evening ; and the servant said to his master , “ Why don ’ t we go on into this city of the Y ’ vusi and stay there ? ”
CJB	Judges	19	12	But his master said to him , “ We won ’ t go into a city of foreigners which doesn ’ t belong to the people of Isra ’ el . We ’ ll go on across to Giv ‘ ah. ”
CJB	Judges	19	13	He said to his servant , “ Let ’ s go , and we ’ ll get to one of those places ; we ’ ll stay in Giv ‘ ah or Ramah. ”
CJB	Judges	19	14	So they went on and kept traveling , until the sun set on them near Giv ‘ ah , which belongs to Binyamin .
CJB	Judges	19	15	There they turned off the road to go and stay in Giv ‘ ah . He went in and sat down in the city ’ s open space , since no one had offered his home for them to spend the night .
CJB	Judges	19	16	In time , at nightfall , an old man came from his work in the field . He was from the Efrayim hills and was staying in Giv ‘ ah , although the residents were of Binyamin .
CJB	Judges	19	17	The old man looked up , saw the traveler in the city ’ s open space and said , “ Where are you going , and where are you coming from ? ”
CJB	Judges	19	18	He replied , “ We ’ re crossing from Beit-Lechem in Y ’ hudah to the far side of the Efrayim hills . That ’ s where I ’ m from . I went to Beit-Lechem in Y ’ hudah , and now I ’ m going to the house of Adonai ; but there ’ s no one here who will let me spend the night in his home .
CJB	Judges	19	20	The old man said , “ You ’ re welcome to stay with me . I ’ ll take care of anything you lack ; just don ’ t spend the night out in the open. ”
CJB	Judges	19	21	So he brought him home and gave food to the donkeys . Then they washed their feet , and ate and drank .
CJB	Judges	19	22	They were relaxing , when suddenly some men from the city , good-for-nothings , surrounded the house and began beating at the door . “ Send out the man who came home with you ! ” they demanded of the old man whose house it was . “ We want to have sex with him ! ”
CJB	Judges	19	23	The man whose house it was went out and said to them , “ No , my brothers , please don ’ t do anything as wrong as this . Look , he ’ s just a guest in my house ; don ’ t do this degrading thing .
CJB	Judges	19	24	Here ’ s my daughter , who ’ s a virgin , and his concubine . I ’ ll bring them out . Mistreat them , do what you want to them , but don ’ t do such a degrading thing to this man. ”
CJB	Judges	19	25	However , the men wouldn ’ t listen to him ; so the man took hold of his concubine and brought her out to them . They raped her and abused her all night long ; only at dawn did they let her go .
CJB	Judges	19	26	At daybreak the woman came and fell down at the door of the man ’ s house where her husband was , and she was still there when it grew light .
CJB	Judges	19	27	When her husband got up , opened the doors of the house , and went out to go on his way , he saw the woman lying there with her hands stretched out toward the door .
CJB	Judges	19	28	He said to her , “ Get up ! Let ’ s go ! ” But there was no answer . So he loaded her body on the donkey and began his trip home .
CJB	Judges	19	29	On arrival at his house , he got a knife , took hold of his concubine ’ s body , cut her up into twelve pieces , and sent them to all the regions of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	19	30	Everyone who saw it said , “ From the day the people of Isra ’ el came up from Egypt until now , never has such a thing happened or been seen . What are we going to do about it ? Talk it over and decide . ”
CJB	Judges	20	20	Then the army of Isra ’ el went out to attack Binyamin and set up their battle line in front of Giv ‘ ah .
CJB	Judges	20	2	The leaders of all the tribes of Isra ’ el presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , 400,000 foot soldiers armed with swords .
CJB	Judges	20	3	Now the people of Binyamin heard that the people of Isra ’ el had gone up to Mitzpah . The people of Isra ’ el said , “ Tell us , how was this crime committed ? ”
CJB	Judges	20	4	The Levi , the husband of the murdered woman , answered , “ I came to Giv ‘ ah , which belongs to Binyamin , I and my concubine , to stay the night ;
CJB	Judges	20	5	and the men in Giv ‘ ah attacked me and surrounded the house I was staying in at night . They wanted to kill me , but instead they raped my concubine to death .
CJB	Judges	20	6	I took my concubine ’ s body , cut it into pieces and sent them throughout all the territories belonging to Isra ’ el ; because they committed a shockingly obscene and degrading crime in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	20	7	Look , you are all people of Isra ’ el . So discuss what to do , and give your advice here and now. ”
CJB	Judges	20	8	All the people stood up in agreement and said , “ None of us will go home to his tent or his house .
CJB	Judges	20	9	What we will do now to Giv ‘ ah is this : we ’ ll draw lots ,
CJB	Judges	20	10	we ’ ll take ten men out of each hundred throughout all the tribes of Isra ’ el , and a hundred out of a thousand , and a thousand out of ten thousand to collect food for the others . When these come to Giv ‘ ah in Binyamin , they will avenge the crime that was committed. ”
CJB	Judges	20	11	Thus all the men of Isra ’ el , joined together in complete agreement , assembled to attack the city .
CJB	Judges	20	12	The tribes of Isra ’ el sent men throughout all the tribe of Binyamin with this message : “ What is this crime committed by some of your people ?
CJB	Judges	20	13	Turn over these good-for-nothings who are in Giv ‘ ah at once , so that we can execute them and rid Isra ’ el of such evil. ” But the people of Binyamin refused to obey the order of their kinsmen the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	20	14	Instead the people of Binyamin gathered themselves together from their cities and went to Giv ‘ ah to fight the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	20	15	On that day there were 26,000 men from Binyamin armed with swords , besides the inhabitants of Giv ‘ ah , who numbered
CJB	Judges	20	700	specially picked men were left-handed , and every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss .
CJB	Judges	20	16	All of these
CJB	Judges	20	17	The army of Isra ’ el , apart from Binyamin , numbered 400,000 men with swords ; they were all experienced soldiers .
CJB	Judges	20	18	The army of Isra ’ el began by going up to Beit-El , where they asked God , “ Who should go up first to attack the army of Binyamin ? ” Adonai said , “ Y ’ hudah first. ”
CJB	Judges	20	19	So the army of Isra ’ el got up in the morning and set up their camp near Giv ‘ ah .
CJB	Judges	20	21	But the army of Binyamin came out of Giv ‘ ah and slaughtered the army of Isra ’ el ; on that day 22,000 men fell .
CJB	Judges	20	22	The people , the men of Isra ’ el , restored their morale and again positioned themselves for battle where they had been the first day .
CJB	Judges	20	23	Then the army of Isra ’ el went up and cried before Adonai until evening . They asked Adonai , “ Should we attack our kinsmen the people of Binyamin again ? Adonai answered , “ Attack them. ”
CJB	Judges	20	24	So the army of Isra ’ el went out to attack the army of Binyamin the second day .
CJB	Judges	20	25	But Binyamin went out against them from Giv ‘ ah the second day and slaughtered the army of Isra ’ el ; 18,000 men armed with swords fell .
CJB	Judges	20	26	Then the whole army of Isra ’ el , all the people , went up to Beit-El and cried and sat there in the presence of Adonai . They fasted that day until evening , offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to Adonai ,
CJB	Judges	20	27	and asked Adonai what to do . The ark for the covenant of God was there at that time ;
CJB	Judges	20	28	and Pinchas the son of El ‘ azar , the son of Aharon , stood before it at that time . They asked , “ Should we still go out to battle again against our kinsmen the people of Binyamin , or should we stop ? ” Adonai answered , “ Attack , because tomorrow I will hand them over to you. ”
CJB	Judges	20	29	Isra ’ el hid some men around Giv ‘ ah ,
CJB	Judges	20	30	and on the third day Isra ’ el attacked the army of Binyamin and took a position against Giv ‘ ah as they had the other times .
CJB	Judges	20	31	Again the army of Binyamin went out against the people . Lured away from the city , they began attacking and killing some of the people , as they had the other times — they killed about thirty men of Isra ’ el in the countryside and on the roads , one of which goes up to Beit-El and the other to Giv ‘ ah .
CJB	Judges	20	32	The army of Binyamin said , “ They ’ re defeated , just as before. ” But the army of Isra ’ el said , “ Let ’ s run off and draw them away from the city onto the roads. ”
CJB	Judges	20	33	All the men of Isra ’ el left their places and took up a battle position at Ba ‘ al-Tamar , while the other Isra ’ el men burst out of their hiding places at Ma ‘ areh-Geva .
CJB	Judges	20	34	Ten thousand men chosen out of all Isra ’ el came over to attack Giv ‘ ah , and the combat was intense . But the army of Binyamin didn ’ t know that they were about to be defeated .
CJB	Judges	20	35	For Adonai routed Binyamin in Isra ’ el ’ s presence ; that day the army of Isra ’ el destroyed 25,100 men of Binyamin , all of whom carried swords ;
CJB	Judges	20	36	and the people of Binyamin realized that they had been beaten . The men of Isra ’ el , trusting the ones they had put in place to ambush Binyamin , gave ground to the men of Binyamin .
CJB	Judges	20	37	Then the men who had been lying in wait rushed in on Giv ‘ ah , drew their swords and destroyed the city .
CJB	Judges	20	38	The army of Isra ’ el and the ambushers had agreed that as a signal they would make a huge cloud of smoke rise from the city ,
CJB	Judges	20	39	at which time the men of Isra ’ el would turn back . When this happened , Binyamin began to attack . They killed about thirty of Isra ’ el ’ s men and said , “ Clearly we ’ re defeating them again , as in the first battle. ”
CJB	Judges	20	40	But when the smoke signal began rising from the city , the men of Binyamin looked behind them and saw the whole city going up to the sky in smoke .
CJB	Judges	20	41	Then , as the men of Isra ’ el reversed direction , those of Binyamin were overcome with terror . When they saw that disaster had come upon them ,
CJB	Judges	20	42	they turned their backs on the men of Isra ’ el and made for the road to the desert . But the battle followed them , and those who came out of the city destroyed them from the rear .
CJB	Judges	20	43	They surrounded the men of Binyamin , chased them and trampled them down across from Giv ‘ ah on the east .
CJB	Judges	20	44	Eighteen thousand men of Binyamin fell , all of them experienced soldiers .
CJB	Judges	20	45	They turned and fled toward the desert to the Rock of Rimmon ; and 5,000 of them were killed on the roads . They followed them to Gid ‘ om and killed another 2,000 .
CJB	Judges	20	46	Thus the total number from Binyamin who fell that day was 25,000 experienced , sword-bearing soldiers .
CJB	Judges	20	47	But
CJB	Judges	20	600	turned and fled toward the desert to the Rock of Rimmon , and lived there four months .
CJB	Judges	20	48	The men of Isra ’ el turned back on the people of Binyamin and killed them with the sword , the entire city , the cattle and everything they found . Moreover , they set on fire all the cities they encountered .
CJB	Judges	21	21	and keep watch . If the girls of Shiloh come out to do their dances , then come out of the vineyards , and each of you catch for himself a wife from the Shiloh girls , and go on to the land of Binyamin .
CJB	Judges	21	2	The people came to Beit-El and stayed there before God till evening crying out and weeping .
CJB	Judges	21	3	They said : “ Adonai , why has this come about in Isra ’ el ? Why should there be today in Isra ’ el one tribe missing ? ”
CJB	Judges	21	4	The next day the people got up early , built an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
CJB	Judges	21	5	The people of Isra ’ el asked , “ Who among the tribes of Isra ’ el did not come up to assemble before Adonai ? For they had made a great oath to put to death whoever didn ’ t come up to Adonai at Mitzpah .
CJB	Judges	21	6	The people of Isra ’ el became sorry for Binyamin their brother and said , “ Today one tribe has been cut off from Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	21	7	How are we going to obtain wives for those who remain alive , since we ’ ve sworn by Adonai that we won ’ t let our daughters marry them ? ”
CJB	Judges	21	8	Then they asked who from the tribes of Isra ’ el had not come up to Adonai at Mitzpah and found that none had come from Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad to the camp where the assembly was ;
CJB	Judges	21	9	since when the people were counted , none of the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad were found there .
CJB	Judges	21	10	So the gathering sent 12,000 warriors there and ordered them , “ Go , and put the people who live in Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad to death with the sword , including women and children .
CJB	Judges	21	11	Completely destroy every man and every woman who has had sex with a man. ”
CJB	Judges	21	12	Among the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad they found
CJB	Judges	21	400	young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him , and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh , which is in the land of Kena ‘ an .
CJB	Judges	21	13	Then the whole gathering sent a message proclaiming peace to the people of Binyamin who were at the Rock of Rimmon .
CJB	Judges	21	14	So Binyamin returned at that time , and the people of Isra ’ el gave them the women they had kept alive of the women from Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad . But those weren ’ t enough for them .
CJB	Judges	21	15	The people were still sorry for Binyamin because Adonai had made a division among the tribes of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	21	16	The leaders of the assembly asked , “ What are we to do for those who still don ’ t have wives , inasmuch as all the women of Binyamin have been killed ? ”
CJB	Judges	21	17	They said , “ There has to be a way to help the survivors preserve Binyamin ’ s inheritance , so that a tribe will not be eliminated from Isra ’ el .
CJB	Judges	21	18	Yet we can ’ t give them our daughters as wives. ” For the people of Isra ’ el had sworn , “ Cursed be whoever gives a wife to Binyamin. ”
CJB	Judges	21	19	Then they said , “ Look , each year there ’ s a festival in honor of Adonai in Shiloh , north of Beit-El , on the east side of the road that goes up from Beit-El to Sh ’ khem , and south of Levonah. ”
CJB	Judges	21	20	They ordered the men of Binyamin , “ Go , hide in the vineyards ,
CJB	Judges	21	22	When their fathers or brothers come to complain to us , we will say to them , ‘ Give them as a personal favor to us , because we didn ’ t take wives for each of them in battle . You didn ’ t give them to them ; that would have made you guilty of breaking your oath. ’ ”
CJB	Judges	21	23	So the men of Binyamin did this — they took wives for themselves from the girls who were dancing , as many as they needed . They carried them off , went back to the land of their inheritance , rebuilt the cities and lived in them .
CJB	Judges	21	24	The people of Isra ’ el then left that place , each man returned to his tribe and family , and each man went out from there to the land he had inherited .
CJB	Judges	21	25	At that time there was no king in Isra ’ el ; a man simply did whatever he thought was right .
CJB	Ruth	1	1	Back in the days when the judges were judging , at a time when there was a famine in the land , a certain man from Beit-Lechem went to live in the territory of Mo ’ av — he , his wife and his two sons .
CJB	Ruth	1	2	The man ’ s name was Elimelekh , his wife ’ s name was Na ‘ omi , and his two sons were named Machlon and Kilyon ; they were Efratim from Beit-Lechem in Y ’ hudah . They arrived in the plain of Mo ’ av and settled there .
CJB	Ruth	1	3	Elimelekh , Na ‘ omi ’ s husband , died ; and she was left , she and her two sons .
CJB	Ruth	1	4	They took wives for themselves from the women of Mo ’ av ; the name of the one was ‘ Orpah ; and the name of the other was Rut . They lived there for about ten years .
CJB	Ruth	1	5	Then Machlon and Kilyon died , both of them ; and the woman was left with neither her two sons nor her husband .
CJB	Ruth	1	6	So she prepared to return with her daughters-in-law from the plain of Mo ’ av ; for in the plain of Mo ’ av she had heard how Adonai had paid attention to his people by giving them food .
CJB	Ruth	1	7	She left the place where she was with her two daughters-in-law and took the road leading back to Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Ruth	1	8	Na ‘ omi said to her two daughters-in-law , “ Each of you , go back to your mother ’ s house . May Adonai show grace to you , as you did to those who died and to me .
CJB	Ruth	1	9	May Adonai grant you security in the home of a new husband. ” Then she kissed them , but they began weeping aloud .
CJB	Ruth	1	10	They said to her , “ No ; we want to return with you to your people. ”
CJB	Ruth	1	11	Na ‘ omi said , “ Go back , my daughters . Why do you want to go with me ? Do I still have sons in my womb who could become your husbands ?
CJB	Ruth	1	12	Go back , my daughters ; go your way ; for I ’ m too old to have a husband . Even if I were to say , ‘ I still have hope ’ ; even if I had a husband tonight and bore sons ;
CJB	Ruth	1	13	would you wait for them until they grew up ? Would you refuse to marry , just for them ? No , my daughters . On your behalf I feel very bitter that the hand of Adonai has gone out against me. ”
CJB	Ruth	1	14	Again they wept aloud . Then ‘ Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye . But Rut stuck with her .
CJB	Ruth	1	15	She said , “ Look , your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her god ; go back , after your sister-in-law. ”
CJB	Ruth	1	16	But Rut said , “ Don ’ t press me to leave you and stop following you ; for wherever you go , I will go ; and wherever you stay , I will stay . Your people will be my people and your God will be my God .
CJB	Ruth	1	17	Where you die , I will die ; and there I will be buried . May Adonai bring terrible curses on me , and worse ones as well , if anything but death separates you and me. ”
CJB	Ruth	1	18	When Na ‘ omi saw that she was determined to go with her , she said no more to her .
CJB	Ruth	1	19	So the two of them went on until they came to Beit-Lechem . When they arrived in Beit-Lechem , the whole city was stirred with excitement over them . The women asked , “ Can this be Na ‘ omi ? ”
CJB	Ruth	1	20	“ Don ’ t call me Na ‘ omi [ pleasant ] , ” she answered them ; “ call me Marah [ bitter ] , because Shaddai has made my life very bitter .
CJB	Ruth	1	21	I went out full , and Adonai has brought me back empty . Why call me Na ‘ omi ? Adonai has testified against me , Shaddai has afflicted me. ”
CJB	Ruth	1	22	This is how Na ‘ omi returned , with Rut the woman from Mo ’ av , her daughter-in-law , accompanying her from the plain of Mo ’ av . They arrived in Beit-Lechem at the beginning of the barley harvest .
CJB	Ruth	2	2	Rut the woman from Mo ’ av said to Na ‘ omi , “ Let me go into the field and glean ears of grain behind anyone who will allow me to. ” She answered her , “ Go , my daughter. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	3	So she set out , arrived at the field and gleaned behind the reapers . She happened to be in the part of the field that belonged to Bo ‘ az from Elimelekh ’ s clan ,
CJB	Ruth	2	4	when Bo ‘ az arrived from Beit-Lechem . He said to the reapers , “ Adonai be with you ” ; and they answered him , “ Adonai bless you. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	5	Then Bo ‘ az asked his servant supervising the reapers , “ Whose girl is this ? ”
CJB	Ruth	2	6	The servant supervising the reapers answered , “ She ’ s a girl from Mo ’ av who returned with Na ‘ omi from the plain of Mo ’ av .
CJB	Ruth	2	7	She said , ‘ Please , let me glean and gather what falls from the sheaves behind the reapers. ’ So she went and has kept at it from morning until now , except for a little rest in the shelter. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	8	Bo ‘ az said to Rut , “ Did you hear that , my daughter ? Don ’ t go to glean in another field , don ’ t leave this place , but stick here with my working girls .
CJB	Ruth	2	9	Keep your eyes on whichever field the reapers are working in , and follow the girls . I ’ ve ordered the young men not to bother you . Whenever you get thirsty , go and drink from the water jars the young men have filled. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	10	She fell on her face , prostrating herself , and said to him , “ Why are you showing me such favor ? Why are you paying attention to me ? After all , I ’ m only a foreigner. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	11	Bo ‘ az answered her , “ I ’ ve heard the whole story , everything you ’ ve done for your mother-in-law since your husband died , including how you left your father and mother and the land you were born in to come to a people about whom you knew nothing beforehand .
CJB	Ruth	2	12	May Adonai reward you for what you ’ ve done ; may you be rewarded in full by Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , under whose wings you have come for refuge. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	13	She said , “ My lord , I hope I continue pleasing you . You have comforted and encouraged me , even though I ’ m not one of your servants. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	14	When meal-time came , Bo ‘ az said to her , “ Come here , have something to eat , and dip your piece of bread in the [ olive oil and ] vinegar. ” She sat by the reapers , and they passed her some roasted grain . She ate till she was full , and she had some left over .
CJB	Ruth	2	15	When she got up to glean , Bo ‘ az ordered his young men , “ Let her glean even among the sheaves themselves , without making her feel ashamed .
CJB	Ruth	2	16	In fact , pull some ears of grain out from the sheaves on purpose . Leave them for her to glean , and don ’ t rebuke her. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until evening . When she beat out what she had gathered , it came to about a bushel of barley .
CJB	Ruth	2	18	She picked it up and went back to the city . Her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned , and Rut brought out and gave her what she had left over after eating her fill .
CJB	Ruth	2	19	Her mother-in-law asked her , “ Where did you glean today ? Where were you working ? Blessed be the one who took such good care of you ! ” She told her mother-in-law with whom she had been working ; she said , “ The name of the man with whom I was working today is Bo ‘ az. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	20	Na ‘ omi said to her daughter-in-law , “ May he be blessed by Adonai , who has never stopped showing grace , neither to the living nor to the dead. ” Na ‘ omi also told her , “ The man is closely related to us ; he ’ s one of our redeeming kinsmen. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	21	Rut the woman from Mo ’ av said , “ Moreover , he even said to me , ‘ Stay close to my young men until they ’ ve finished my harvest. ’ ”
CJB	Ruth	2	22	Na ‘ omi said to Rut her daughter-in-law , “ It ’ s good , my daughter , for you to keep going out with his girls ; so that you won ’ t encounter hostility in some other field. ”
CJB	Ruth	2	23	So she stayed close to Bo ‘ az ’ s girls to glean , until the end of the barley and wheat harvests ; and she lived with her mother-in-law .
CJB	Ruth	3	3	So bathe , anoint yourself , put on your good clothes , and go down to the threshing-floor ; but don ’ t reveal your presence to the man until he ’ s finished eating and drinking .
CJB	Ruth	3	2	Now there ’ s Bo ‘ az our relative — you were with his girls . He ’ s going to be winnowing barley tonight at the threshing-floor .
CJB	Ruth	3	4	Then , when he lies down , take note of where he ’ s lying ; later , go in , uncover his feet , and lie down . He will tell you what to do. ”
CJB	Ruth	3	5	She responded , “ I will do everything you tell me. ”
CJB	Ruth	3	6	She went down to the threshing-floor and did everything as her mother-in-law had instructed her .
CJB	Ruth	3	7	After Bo ‘ az was through eating and drinking and was feeling good , he went to lie down at the end of the pile of grain . She stole in , uncovered his feet and lay down .
CJB	Ruth	3	8	In the middle of the night the man was startled and turned over , and — there was a woman lying at his feet !
CJB	Ruth	3	9	He asked , “ Who are you ? ” and she answered , “ I ’ m your handmaid Rut . Spread your robe over your handmaid , because you are a redeeming kinsman. ”
CJB	Ruth	3	10	He said , “ May Adonai bless you , my daughter . Your latest kindness is even greater than your first , in that you didn ’ t go after the young men , neither the rich ones nor the poor .
CJB	Ruth	3	11	And now , my daughter , don ’ t be afraid . I will do for you everything you say , for all the city leaders among my people know that you are a woman of good character .
CJB	Ruth	3	12	Now , it is true that I am a redeeming kinsman ; but there is a redeemer who is a closer relative than I am .
CJB	Ruth	3	13	Stay tonight . If , in the morning , he will redeem you , fine ! — let him redeem you . But if he doesn ’ t want to redeem you , then , as Adonai lives , I will redeem you . Now , lie down until morning. ”
CJB	Ruth	3	14	She lay at his feet until morning ; then , before [ it was light enough that ] people could recognize each other , she got up ; because he said , “ No one should know that the woman came to the threshing-floor. ”
CJB	Ruth	3	15	He also said , “ Bring the shawl you are wearing , and take hold of it. ” She held it while he put six measures of barley into it ; then he went into the city .
CJB	Ruth	3	16	When she came to her mother-in-law , she asked , “ Who are you ? My daughter ? ” She told her everything the man had done for her .
CJB	Ruth	3	17	Then she added , “ He gave me these six measures of barley ; because he said to me , “ You shouldn ’ t return to your mother-in-law with nothing. ”
CJB	Ruth	3	18	Na ‘ omi said , “ My daughter , just stay where you are , until you learn how the matter comes out ; for the man won ’ t rest unless he resolves the matter today . ”
CJB	Ruth	4	4	I thought I should tell you about it and say , ‘ Buy it in the presence of the people sitting here and in the presence of the leaders of my people . If you want to redeem it , redeem it . But if it is not to be redeemed , then tell me , so that I can know , because there is no one else in line to redeem it , and I ’ m after you. ” He said , “ I want to redeem it. ”
CJB	Ruth	4	2	He took ten of the city ’ s leaders and said , “ Sit down here ” ; and they sat down .
CJB	Ruth	4	3	Then he said to the redeeming kinsman , “ The parcel of land which used to belong to our relative Elimelekh is being offered for sale by Na ‘ omi , who has returned from the plain of Mo ’ av .
CJB	Ruth	4	5	Then Bo ‘ az said , “ The same day you buy the field from Na ‘ omi , you must also buy Rut the woman from Mo ’ av , the wife of the deceased [ son ] , in order to raise up in the name of the deceased an heir for his property. ”
CJB	Ruth	4	6	The redeemer said , “ Then I can ’ t redeem it for myself , because I might put my own inheritance at risk . You , take my right of redemption on yourself ; because I can ’ t redeem it. ”
CJB	Ruth	4	7	In the past , this is what was done in Isra ’ el to validate all transactions involving redemption and exchange : a man took off his shoe and gave it to the other party ; this was the form of attestation in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ruth	4	8	So the redeemer said to Bo ‘ az , “ Buy it for yourself , ” and took off his shoe .
CJB	Ruth	4	9	Bo ‘ az addressed the leaders and all the people : “ You are witnesses today that I am purchasing from Na ‘ omi all that belonged to Elimelekh and all that belonged to Kilyon and Machlon .
CJB	Ruth	4	10	Also I am acquiring as my wife Rut the woman from Mo ’ av , the wife of Machlon , in order to raise up in the name of the deceased an heir for his property ; so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his kinsmen and from the gate of his place . You are witnesses today. ”
CJB	Ruth	4	11	All the people at the gate and the leaders said , “ We are witnesses . May Adonai make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Le ’ ah , who between them built up the house of Isra ’ el . Do worthy deeds in Efrat ; become renowned in Beit-Lechem .
CJB	Ruth	4	12	May your house , because of the seed Adonai will give you from this young woman , become like the house of Peretz , whom Tamar bore to Y ’ hudah. ”
CJB	Ruth	4	13	So Bo ‘ az took Rut , and she became his wife . He had sexual relations with her , Adonai enabled her to conceive , and she gave birth to a son .
CJB	Ruth	4	14	Then the women said to Na ‘ omi , “ Blessed be Adonai , who today has provided you a redeemer ! May his name be renowned in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ruth	4	15	May he restore your life and provide for your old age ; for your daughter-in-law , who loves you and is better to you than seven sons , has given birth to him. ”
CJB	Ruth	4	16	Na ‘ omi took the child , laid it on her breast and became its nurse .
CJB	Ruth	4	17	The women who were her neighbors gave it a name ; they said , “ A son has been born to Na ‘ omi , ” and called it ‘ Oved . He was the father of Yishai the father of David .
CJB	Ruth	4	18	Here is the genealogy of Peretz . Peretz was the father of Hetzron ,
CJB	Ruth	4	19	Hetzron was the father of Ram , Ram was the father of ‘ Amminadav ,
CJB	Ruth	4	20	‘ Amminadav was the father of Nachshon , Nachshon was the father of Salmon ,
CJB	Ruth	4	21	Salmon was the father of Bo ‘ az , Bo ‘ az was the father of ‘ Oved ,
CJB	Ruth	4	22	‘ Oved was the father of Yishai , and Yishai was the father of David .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	1	There was a man from Ramatayim-Tzofim , in the hills of Efrayim , whose name was Elkanah the son of Yerocham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tochu , the son of Tzuf , from Efrat .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	2	He had two wives , one named Hannah and the other P ’ ninah . P ’ ninah had children , but Hannah had no children .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	3	This man went up from his city every year to worship and sacrifice to Adonai-Tzva ’ ot in Shiloh . The two sons of ‘ Eli , Hofni and Pinchas , were cohanim of Adonai there .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	4	One day , when Elkanah was sacrificing , he gave a portion of the sacrifice to his wife P ’ ninah and portions to each of her sons and daughters ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	5	but to Hannah he gave a double portion , because he loved Hannah , even though Adonai had kept her from having children .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	6	Her rival taunted her and made her feel bad , because Adonai had kept her from having children .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	7	He did the same every year ; and each time she went up to the house of Adonai , she taunted her so much that she would cry and not eat .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	8	Her husband Elkanah said to her , “ Hannah , why are you crying , and why aren ’ t you eating ? Why be so sad ? Am I not better to you than ten sons ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	9	So Hannah got up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh . ‘ Eli the cohen was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the temple of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	10	In deep depression she prayed to Adonai and cried .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	11	Then she took a vow ; she said , “ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , if you will notice how humiliated your servant is , if you will remember me and not forget your servant but will give your servant a male child , then I will give him to Adonai for as long as he lives ; and no razor will ever come on his head. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	12	She prayed for a long time before Adonai ; and as she did so , ‘ Eli was watching her mouth .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	13	Hannah was speaking in her heart — her lips moved , but her voice could not be heard — so ‘ Eli thought she was drunk .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	14	‘ Eli said to her , “ How long are you going to stay drunk ? Stop drinking your wine ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	15	But Hannah answered , “ No , my lord , I am a very unhappy woman . I have not drunk either wine or other strong liquor ; rather , I ’ ve been pouring out my soul before Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	16	Don ’ t think of your servant as a worthless woman ; because I have been speaking from the depth of my distress and anger. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	17	Then ‘ Eli replied , “ Go in peace . May the God of Isra ’ el grant what you have asked of him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	18	She replied , “ May your servant find favor in your sight. ” So the woman went on her way , and she ate , and her face was no longer sad .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	19	They got up early in the morning and worshipped before Adonai , then returned and came to their house in Ramah . Elkanah had sexual relations with Hannah his wife , and Adonai remembered her .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	20	She conceived ; and in due time she gave birth to a son , whom she named Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ because I asked Adonai for him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	21	The husband , Elkanah , went up with all his household to offer the yearly sacrifice to Adonai and fulfill his vow .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	22	But Hannah did not go up , explaining to her husband , “ Not till the child has been weaned . Then I will bring him , so that he can appear before Adonai and live there forever. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	23	Her husband Elkanah answered her , “ Do what seems good to you ; stay here until you have weaned him . Only may Adonai bring about what he said. ” So the woman stayed behind and nursed the child , until she weaned him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	24	After weaning him , she took him up with her , along with three young bulls , a bushel of flour and a skin of wine , and brought him to the house of Adonai in Shiloh , even though he was just a child .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	25	After the bull had been slaughtered , the child was brought to ‘ Eli ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	26	and she said , “ My lord , as sure as you live , my lord , I am the woman who stood here near you , praying to Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	27	I prayed for this child , and Adonai has granted the request I asked of him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	1	28	Therefore , I too have loaned him to Adonai — as long as he lives , he is on loan to Adonai. ” And he prostrated himself there before Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	2	“ No one is as holy as Adonai , because there is none to compare with you , no rock like our God .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	3	“ Stop your proud boasting ! Don ’ t let arrogance come from your mouth ! For Adonai is a God of knowledge , and he appraises actions .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	4	The bows of the mighty are broken , while the feeble are armed with strength .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	5	The well-fed hire themselves for bread , while those who were hungry hunger no more . The barren woman has borne seven , while the mother of many wastes away .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	6	“ Adonai kills and makes alive ; he brings down to the grave , and he brings up .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	7	Adonai makes poor , and he makes rich ; he humbles , and he exalts .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	8	He raises the poor from the dust , lifts up the needy from the trash pile ; he gives them a place with leaders and assigns them seats of honor . “ For the earth ’ s pillars belong to Adonai ; on them he has placed the world .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	9	He will guard the steps of his faithful , but the wicked will be silenced in darkness . For it is not by strength that a person prevails —
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	10	those who fight Adonai will be shattered ; he will thunder against them in heaven — Adonai will judge the ends of the earth . He will strengthen his king and enhance the power of his anointed. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	11	Elkanah went home to Ramah , while the child began ministering to Adonai under the direction of ‘ Eli the cohen .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	12	‘ Eli ’ s sons were scoundrels who had no regard for Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	13	The rule these cohanim followed in dealing with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice , the cohen ’ s servant would come , while the meat was stewing , with a three-pronged fork in his hand .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	14	He would stick it in the pan , kettle , caldron or pot ; and the cohen would take for himself whatever the fork brought up . This is how they dealt with all the people of Isra ’ el who came there to Shiloh .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	15	The cohen ’ s servant would actually come before the fat had burned to smoke and say to the man who was sacrificing , “ Give the cohen meat he can roast ; because he doesn ’ t want your meat stewed , but raw. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	16	If the man answered , “ First let the fat burn to smoke , then take as much as you want , ” he would say , “ No , give it to me now , or I ’ ll take it by force. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	17	The sin of these young men was very serious in Adonai ’ s view , because they treated offerings made to Adonai with contempt .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	18	But Sh ’ mu ’ el ministered in the presence of Adonai , wearing a linen ritual vest even though he was only a child .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	19	Each year his mother would make him a little coat and bring it when she came up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	20	‘ Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say , “ May Adonai give you children from this woman because of the boy you have loaned to Adonai ” ; then they would go home .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	21	So Adonai took notice of Hannah , and she conceived and bore three more sons and two daughters . Meanwhile , the boy Sh ’ mu ’ el grew in the presence of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	22	When ‘ Eli was very old , he heard about everything his sons were doing to all Isra ’ el , and that they were having sex with the women doing service at the door of the tent of meeting .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	23	He asked them , “ Why are you doing things like this ? I am hearing bad reports about you from all these people .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	24	No , my sons , I don ’ t hear Adonai ’ s people spreading a single good report !
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	25	If a person commits a sin against another person , the judges can mediate between them . But if a person commits a sin against Adonai , who can intercede for him ? ” However , they wouldn ’ t pay attention to what their father said , because Adonai had decided to kill them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	26	The child Sh ’ mu ’ el kept growing and gaining favor both with Adonai and with people .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	27	A man of God came to ‘ Eli and told him , “ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ Didn ’ t I reveal myself to your ancestor ’ s clan when they were in Egypt , serving as slaves in Pharaoh ’ s household ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	28	Didn ’ t I choose him out of all the tribes of Isra ’ el to be my cohen , go up to my altar , burn incense and wear a ritual vest in my presence ? Didn ’ t I assign to your ancestor ’ s clan all the offerings of the people of Isra ’ el made by fire ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	29	So why are you showing such disrespect for my sacrifices and offerings , which I ordered to be made at my dwelling ? Why do you show more honor to your sons than to me , making yourselves fat with the choicest parts of all the offerings of Isra ’ el my people ? ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	30	“ Therefore Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says , ‘ I did indeed say that your family and your father ’ s family would walk in my presence forever. ’ But now Adonai says , ‘ Forget it ! I respect those who respect me , but those who despise me will meet with contempt .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	31	The day is coming when I will break your strength and the strength of your father ’ s family , so that no one in your family will live to old age .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	32	At a time when Isra ’ el is prospering , you will see a rival in my Dwelling ; and never will anyone in your family live to old age .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	33	Still , I won ’ t cut off every one of your men from my altar ; because that would make your eyes grow dim , and you would waste away . Nevertheless , all your descendants will die young .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	34	Your sign that this will occur will be what happens to your two sons Hofni and Pinchas — they will both die on the same day .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	35	I will raise up for myself a faithful cohen who will do what I want and what I intend . I will make his family faithful , and he will serve in the presence of my anointed one forever .
CJB	1%20Samuel	2	36	Everyone left in your family will come , prostrate himself before him for a silver coin or a loaf of bread , and say , “ Please , won ’ t you give me some work as a cohen , so I can have a scrap of bread to eat ? ” ’ ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	3	The lamp of God had not yet gone out ; and Sh ’ mu ’ el had lain down to sleep in the sanctuary of Adonai , where the ark of God was .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	2	Once , during that period , ‘ Eli had gone to bed — his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that it was hard for him to see .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	4	Adonai called , “ Sh ’ mu ’ el ! ” and he answered , “ Here I am. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	5	Then he ran to ‘ Eli and said , “ Here I am — you called me ? ” But he said , “ I didn ’ t call you ; go back , and lie down. ” So he went and lay down .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	6	Adonai called a second time , “ Sh ’ mu ’ el ! ” Sh ’ mu ’ el got up , went to ‘ Eli and said , “ Here I am — you called me. ” He answered , “ I didn ’ t call , my son ; lie down again. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	7	Now Sh ’ mu ’ el didn ’ t yet know Adonai ; the word of Adonai had not yet been revealed to him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	8	Adonai called , “ Sh ’ mu ’ el ! ” again , a third time . He got up , went to ‘ Eli and said , “ Here I am — you called me. ” At last ‘ Eli realized it was Adonai calling the child .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	9	So ‘ Eli said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ Go , and lie down . If you are called again , say , ‘ Speak , Adonai ; your servant is listening. ’ Sh ’ mu ’ el went and lay down in his place .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	10	Adonai came and stood , then spoke as at the other times : “ Sh ’ mu ’ el ! Sh ’ mu ’ el ! ” Then Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ Speak ; your servant is listening. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	11	Adonai said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ Look ! I am going to do something in Isra ’ el that will make both ears of everyone who hears about it tingle .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	12	On that day I will do against ‘ Eli everything I have said with regard to his family , from beginning to end .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	13	For I have told him that I will execute judgment against his family forever , because of his wickedness in not rebuking his sons , even though he knew that they had brought a curse on themselves .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	14	Therefore I have sworn to the family of ‘ Eli that the wickedness of ‘ Eli ’ s family will never be atoned for by any sacrifice or offering. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	15	Sh ’ mu ’ el lay there until morning ; then he opened the doors of the house of Adonai . But Sh ’ mu ’ el was afraid to tell ‘ Eli the vision .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	16	Then ‘ Eli called Sh ’ mu ’ el : “ Sh ’ mu ’ el , my son ! ” He answered , “ Here I am. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	17	‘ Eli said , “ What did he say to you ? Please , don ’ t hide it from me ; may God do whatever he said and worse , if you hide from me anything he said to you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	18	So Sh ’ mu ’ el told him every word and hid nothing . ‘ Eli replied , “ It is Adonai ; let him do what seems good to him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	19	Sh ’ mu ’ el kept growing , Adonai was with him , and he let none of his words fall to the ground .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	20	All Isra ’ el from Dan to Be ’ er-Sheva became aware that Sh ’ mu ’ el had been confirmed as a prophet of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	3	21	Adonai continued appearing in Shiloh , for Adonai revealed himself to Sh ’ mu ’ el in Shiloh by the word of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	4	So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark for the covenant of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , who is present above the k ’ ruvim . The two sons of ‘ Eli , Hofni and Pinchas , were there with the ark for the covenant of God .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	2	The P ’ lishtim drew up in battle formation against Isra ’ el . The battle was fierce , and Isra ’ el was beaten by the P ’ lishtim — they killed about four thousand soldiers on the battlefield .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	3	When the army had returned to camp , the leaders of Isra ’ el asked , “ Why has Adonai defeated us today before the P ’ lishtim ? Let ’ s bring the ark for the covenant of Adonai from Shiloh to us , so that he will come among us and save us from our enemies. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	5	When the ark for the covenant of Adonai entered the camp , all Isra ’ el gave a mighty shout that resounded through the land .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	6	On hearing the shout , the P ’ lishtim asked , “ What does this great shout in the Hebrews ’ camp mean ? ” Then they realized that the ark of Adonai had arrived in the camp ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	7	and the P ’ lishtim became afraid . They said , “ God has entered the camp ! We ’ re lost ! There was no such thing yesterday or the day before .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	8	We ’ re lost ! Who will rescue us from the power of these mighty gods ? These are the gods that completely overthrew the Egyptians in the desert .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	9	Be strong ; and behave like men , you P ’ lishtim ; so that you won ’ t become slaves to the Hebrews , as they have been to you . Behave like men , and fight ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	10	The P ’ lishtim fought , Isra ’ el was defeated , and every man fled to his tent . It was a terrible slaughter — 30,000 of Isra ’ el ’ s foot soldiers fell .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	11	Moreover , the ark of God was captured ; and the two sons of ‘ Eli , Hofni and Pinchas , died .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	12	One of the soldiers , a man from Binyamin , ran and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and earth on his head [ as a sign of mourning ] .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	13	As he arrived , ‘ Eli was sitting on his seat by the road , watching ; because he was trembling with anxiety over the ark of God . When the man entered the city and told the news , the whole city began crying out .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	14	On hearing the cries , ‘ Eli asked , “ What does this uproar mean ? ” So the man hurried , came to ‘ Eli and told him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	15	‘ Eli was ninety-eight years old , and his gaze was fixed , because he was blind .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	16	The man said to ‘ Eli , “ I ’ m the soldier that came ; I escaped today from the battlefield. ” He asked , “ How did things go , my son ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	17	The one who had come with the news answered , “ Isra ’ el fled before the P ’ lishtim , and there was a terrible slaughter among the people . Your two sons , Hofni and Pinchas , also are dead ; and the ark of God was captured .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	18	As soon as he mentioned what had happened to the ark of God , ‘ Eli fell backward off his seat next to the gate , broke his neck and died ; for he was an old man , and heavy . He had judged Isra ’ el forty years .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	19	His daughter-in-law , Pinchas ’ s wife , was pregnant and near delivery-time . When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead , she went into abnormal labor , bent over and gave birth .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	20	As she was dying , the women standing by her said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid , because you have given birth to a son. ” But she didn ’ t answer or show any sign of recognition .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	21	She named the child I-Khavod [ without glory ] , saying , “ The glory has departed from Isra ’ el ” ; because the ark of God had been captured , and because of her father-in-law and husband .
CJB	1%20Samuel	4	22	She said , “ The glory of Isra ’ el has gone into exile , because the ark of God has been captured . ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	5	This is why , to this day , the priests of Dagon and those entering his temple never walk on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod .
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	2	Then the P ’ lishtim took the ark of God , brought it to the temple of Dagon and set it next to Dagon .
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	3	But early the next morning , when the people of Ashdod got up , there was Dagon , fallen down with his face to the ground before the ark of Adonai . They took Dagon and set him in his place again ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	4	but early the following morning , when they got up , Dagon was again fallen down with his face to the ground before the ark of Adonai ; this time , the head of Dagon and both hands lay there , severed , on the threshold ; all that was left of Dagon was his torso .
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	6	Adonai began oppressing the people of Ashdod ; he ravaged them , striking Ashdod and its surrounding area with tumors .
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	7	When the people of Ashdod came to understand what was happening , they said , “ The ark of the God of Isra ’ el can ’ t remain with us , because he is oppressing us and our god Dagon. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	8	They summoned all the leaders of the P ’ lishtim and asked , “ What are we to do with the ark of the God of Isra ’ el ? ” They answered , “ Have the ark of the God of Isra ’ el carried to Gat. ” So they carried the ark of the God of Isra ’ el to Gat .
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	9	But after it arrived there , Adonai oppressed that city , causing terrible panic . He struck the people of the city , great and small alike ; tumors broke out on them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	10	Next they sent the ark of God to ‘ Ekron ; but when the ark of God arrived in ‘ Ekron the ‘ Ekronim shouted , “ Now they ’ ve brought the ark of the God of Isra ’ el to us , to kill us and our people ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	11	So they summoned all the leaders of the P ’ lishtim and said , “ Send the ark of the God of Isra ’ el away ! Let it go back to its own place , so that it won ’ t kill us and our people ! ” — because death and panic pervaded the whole city ; God ’ s oppression was very heavy there .
CJB	1%20Samuel	5	12	The people who didn ’ t die were struck with the tumors ; and the city ’ s cries for help reached the skies .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	6	Why be obstinate like the Egyptians and Pharaoh were ? When he had done his work among them , didn ’ t they let the people go ? — and they left .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	2	The P ’ lishtim summoned the priests and soothsayers and asked them , “ What are we to do with the ark of Adonai ? Tell us how to send it back where it belongs. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	3	They said , “ If you do send off the ark of the God of Isra ’ el , don ’ t send it back empty , but return it with some sort of guilt offering for him . Then you will be cured , and you will learn why he has not stopped oppressing you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	4	They asked , “ What kind of guilt offering should we send him ? ” and they replied , “ Five gold models of tumors and five gold rats , because that ’ s how many leaders the P ’ lishtim have , and you and your leaders all had the same illness .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	5	So make models of your tumors and models of your rats that are infesting your land , and show respect to the God of Isra ’ el . Maybe he will stop oppressing you , your gods and your land .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	7	Now take and prepare yourselves a new cart and two milk-cows that have never been under a yoke . Harness the cows to the cart , but put their calves back in the shed .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	8	Then take the ark of Adonai and lay it on the cart . In a box next to it , put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering . Then send it away to go off by itself ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	9	but watch to see if it goes up the road to Beit-Shemesh in its own territory . If it does , he is responsible for this great tragedy ; if not , we will know that it is not his oppression which has been over us , but that what has been happening to us has been only by chance. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	10	The men did it . They took two milk-cows , harnessed them to the cart and confined their calves to the shed .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	11	Then they put the ark on the cart , along with the box containing the gold rats and the models of their tumors .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	12	The cows made straight for the road to Beit-Shemesh and took that route , mooing as they went and turning off neither to the right nor to the left . The leaders of the P ’ lishtim followed them as far as the border of Beit-Shemesh .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	13	The people of Beit-Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley when they looked up and saw the ark . They were so happy to see it !
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	14	The cart entered the field of Y ’ hoshua the Beit-Shimshi and stood there by a big rock . They cut up the wood of the cart and offered up the cows as a burnt offering to Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	15	Then the L ’ vi ’ im removed the ark of Adonai and the box that was with it , which contained the gold objects , and put them on the big rock . That same day the men of Beit-Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrifices to Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	16	Upon seeing this , the five leaders of the P ’ lishtim returned that day to ‘ Ekron .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	17	The gold tumors which the P ’ lishtim sent back as a guilt offering for Adonai were one each for Ashdod , ‘ Azah , Ashkelon , Gat and ‘ Ekron ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	18	and the gold rats also corresponded to the number of all the cities of the P ’ lishtim that belonged to the five leaders — fortified cities and country villages . [ The rock ] is a witness to this day of the great mourning [ which resulted from ] putting the ark of Adonai on it in the field of Y ’ hoshua the Beit-Shimshi ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	19	for [ Adonai ] struck the people of Beit-Shemesh for looking at the ark of Adonai . He killed 50,070 of the people ; the people mourned because Adonai had struck them with such a terrible slaughter .
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	20	The people of Beit-Shemesh asked , “ Who can stand before Adonai , this holy God ? To whom can we send it , to get it away from us ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	6	21	They sent messengers to the people living in Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim with this message : “ The P ’ lishtim have returned the ark of Adonai . Come down and bring it back up with you . ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	7	When the P ’ lishtim heard that the people of Isra ’ el had gathered together at Mitzpah , the leaders of the P ’ lishtim marched up against Isra ’ el ; and when the people of Isra ’ el heard about this , they were afraid of the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	2	From the day that the ark arrived in Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim a long time elapsed , twenty years ; and all the people of Isra ’ el yearned for Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	3	Sh ’ mu ’ el addressed all the people of Isra ’ el ; he said : “ If you are returning to Adonai with all your heart , then be done with the foreign gods and ‘ ashtarot that you have with you , and direct your hearts to Adonai . If you will serve only him , he will rescue you from the power of the P ’ lishtim. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	4	So the people of Isra ’ el banished the ba ‘ alim and the ‘ ashtarot and served only Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	5	Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ Gather all Isra ’ el to Mitzpah , and I will pray for you to Adonai. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	6	So they gathered together at Mitzpah , drew water and poured it out before Adonai , fasted that day , and said there , “ We have sinned against Adonai. ” Sh ’ mu ’ el began serving as judge over the people of Isra ’ el at Mitzpah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	8	The people of Isra ’ el said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ Don ’ t stop crying out to Adonai our God for us , to save us from the power of the P ’ lishtim. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	9	Sh ’ mu ’ el took a baby lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to Adonai . Then Sh ’ mu ’ el cried to Adonai for Isra ’ el , and Adonai answered him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	10	As Sh ’ mu ’ el was presenting the burnt offering , the P ’ lishtim advanced to attack Isra ’ el . But this time , Adonai thundered violently over the P ’ lishtim , throwing them into such confusion that they were struck down before Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	11	The men of Isra ’ el went out from Mitzpah , pursuing the P ’ lishtim and attacking them all the way to Beit-Kar .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	12	Sh ’ mu ’ el took a stone , placed it between Mitzpah and Shen , and gave it the name Even- ‘ Ezer [ stone of help ] , explaining , “ Adonai has helped us until now. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	13	Thus the P ’ lishtim were humbled , so that they no longer entered Isra ’ el ’ s territory ; and the hand of Adonai was against the P ’ lishtim as long as Sh ’ mu ’ el lived .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	14	The cities between ‘ Ekron and Gat which the P ’ lishtim had captured from Isra ’ el were restored to Isra ’ el , and Isra ’ el rescued all this territory from the power of the P ’ lishtim . There was also peace between Isra ’ el and the Emori .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	15	Sh ’ mu ’ el continued in office as judge of Isra ’ el as long as he lived .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	16	Year by year he would travel in a circuit that included Beit-El , Gilgal and Mitzpah ; and in all these places he served as judge over Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Samuel	7	17	Then he would return to Ramah , because that ’ s where his home was , and he would judge Isra ’ el there too . He also built an altar there to Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	8	They are doing to you exactly what they have been doing to me , from the day I brought them out of Egypt until today , by abandoning me and serving other gods .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	2	His firstborn was named Yo ’ el , while his second son was named Aviyah ; they were judges in Be ’ er-Sheva .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	3	However , his sons did not follow his way of life ; they turned off it to pursue riches , so that they would take bribes to distort justice .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	4	All the leaders of Isra ’ el gathered themselves together , approached Sh ’ mu ’ el in Ramah
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	5	and said to him , “ Look , you have grown old , and your sons are not following your ways . Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	6	Sh ’ mu ’ el was not pleased to hear them say , “ Give us a king to judge us ” ; so he prayed to Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	7	Adonai said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ Listen to the people , to everything they say to you ; for it is not you they are rejecting ; they are rejecting me ; they don ’ t want me to be king over them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	9	So do what they say , but give them a sober warning , telling them what kinds of rulings their king will make. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	10	Sh ’ mu ’ el reported everything Adonai had said to the people asking him for a king .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	11	He said , “ Here is the kind of rulings your king will make : he will draft your sons and assign them to take care of his chariots , be his horsemen and be bodyguards running ahead of his chariots .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	12	He will appoint them to serve him as officers in charge of a thousand or of fifty , plowing his fields , gathering his harvest , and making his weapons and the equipment for his chariots .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	13	He will take your daughters and have them be perfume-makers , cooks and bakers .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	14	He will expropriate your fields , vineyards and olive groves — the very best of them ! — and hand them over to his servants .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	15	He will take the ten-percent tax of your crops and vineyards and give it to his officers and servants .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	16	He will take your male and female servants , your best young men and your donkeys , and make them work for him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will take the ten-percent tax of your flocks , and you will become his servants .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	18	When that happens , you will cry out on account of your king , whom you yourselves chose . But when that happens , Adonai will not answer you ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	19	However , the people refused to listen to what Sh ’ mu ’ el told them , and they said , “ No ! We want a king over us ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	20	so that we can be like all the nations , with our king to judge us , lead us and fight our battles. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	21	Sh ’ mu ’ el heard everything the people said and repeated them for Adonai to hear .
CJB	1%20Samuel	8	22	Adonai said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ Do what they ask , and set up a king for them. ” So Sh ’ mu ’ el told the men of Isra ’ el , “ Each of you , return to his city . ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	9	( In Isra ’ el , back in the old days , when someone went to consult God , he would say , “ Come , let ’ s go to the seer ” ; because a person now called a prophet used to be called a seer . )
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	2	He had a son named Sha ’ ul who was young and good-looking ; among the people of Isra ’ el there was no one better-looking than he ; he stood head and shoulders taller than anyone else in Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	3	Once the donkeys belonging to Kish Sha ’ ul ’ s father got lost . Kish said to his son Sha ’ ul , “ Please take one of the servants with you , go out , and look for the donkeys. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	4	He went through the hills of Efrayim and the territory of Shalishah , but they didn ’ t find them . Then they went through the territory of Sha ‘ alim , but they weren ’ t there . They went through the territory of Binyamin but didn ’ t find them there either .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	5	On reaching the territory of Tzuf , Sha ’ ul said to his servant with him , “ Come , let ’ s go back ; otherwise my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	6	His servant replied , “ Here now , there ’ s a man of God in this city , a man who is highly respected , and everything he says proves true . Let ’ s go to him ; maybe he can tell us something about where we should go. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	7	“ But look , ” Sha ’ ul said to his servant , “ if we go to the man , what can we bring him ? We ’ ve used up all the bread in our packs , and there ’ s nothing for us to give the man of God — what do we have left ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	8	The servant replied again to Sha ’ ul : “ See , I have here in my hand a silver quarter-shekel [ one-tenth of an ounce ] . I will give it to the man of God to tell us which way to go. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	10	“ Well said , ” Sha ’ ul answered his servant . “ Come on , let ’ s go. ” So they went to the city where the man of God was .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	11	Ascending the slope to the town they found girls going out to draw water and asked them , “ Is the seer here ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	12	The girls answered them , “ He ’ s here , he ’ s right ahead of you . Hurry now , he just came into the city today , because the people are sacrificing today at the high place .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	13	Find him as soon as you enter the city , before he goes up to the high place to eat ; because the people won ’ t eat until he comes and blesses the sacrifice . Afterwards , the ones invited will eat . So go on up , because this is when you will find him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	14	They went up to the city ; and as they entered the city , there was Sh ’ mu ’ el coming out toward them to go up to the high place .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	15	The day before Sha ’ ul arrived , Adonai had given Sh ’ mu ’ el a revelation :
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	16	“ Tomorrow at about this time I will send you a man from the territory of Binyamin . You are to anoint him prince over my people Isra ’ el . He will save my people from the power of the P ’ lishtim , because I have seen my people ’ s situation , and their cry of distress has come to me. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	17	When Sh ’ mu ’ el saw Sha ’ ul , Adonai said to him , “ Here is the man I told you about , the one who is going to govern my people. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	18	Sha ’ ul approached Sh ’ mu ’ el in the gateway and said , “ Please tell me where the seer ’ s house is. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	19	Sh ’ mu ’ el answered Sha ’ ul , “ I ’ m the seer . Go up ahead of me to the high place , because you are going to dine with me today . In the morning , I will let you leave ; and I will tell you everything that is on your heart .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	20	As for your donkeys that got lost three days ago , don ’ t worry about them ; they ’ ve been found . Now , who is it that all Isra ’ el wants ? Isn ’ t it you , and all your father ’ s household ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	21	Sha ’ ul replied , “ I ’ m only a man from Binyamin , the smallest tribe in Isra ’ el ; and my family is the least important of all the families in the tribe of Binyamin ! Why are you saying such a thing to me ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	22	Sh ’ mu ’ el took Sha ’ ul and his servant , brought them into the room and had them sit in the place reserved for the most important of the invited guests , who numbered about thirty persons .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	23	Sh ’ mu ’ el instructed the cook , “ Serve the portion I gave you and told you to set aside. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	24	The cook took the thigh and the adjoining meat and served it to Sha ’ ul . Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ Here , this is what remains ! Put it in front of you and eat — it was kept especially for you until the right time ; because I said , ‘ I have invited the people. ’ ” So Sha ’ ul dined with Sh ’ mu ’ el that day .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	25	On coming down from the high place to the city , he spoke with Sha ’ ul on the roof .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	26	They got up early . About daybreak , Sh ’ mu ’ el called out to Sha ’ ul on the roof , “ Get up , so I can send you on your way. ” Sha ’ ul got up , and both of them — he and Sh ’ mu ’ el — went out .
CJB	1%20Samuel	9	27	As they were going down , at the edge of the city , Sh ’ mu ’ el said to Sha ’ ul , “ Tell the servant to go on ahead ” ; so the servant went on . “ But you , stand still now , because I want you to hear what God has said . ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	10	When they arrived at the hill , and there in front of him was a group of prophets , the Spirit of God fell on him and he prophesied along with them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	2	After you leave me today , you will find two men by Rachel ’ s Tomb , in the territory of Binyamin at Tzeltzah . They will tell you that the donkeys you were searching for have been found , and that your father has stopped thinking about the donkeys and is anxious over you and asking , ‘ What am I to do about my son ? ’ ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	3	Go on from there , and you will come to the Oak of Tavor . Three men will meet you there on their way up to God at Beit-El . One of them will be carrying three kids , another three loaves of bread and the third a skin of wine .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	4	They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread , which you are to accept from them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	5	After that , you will come to Giv ‘ ah of God , where the P ’ lishtim are garrisoned . On arrival at the city there , you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place , preceded by lutes , tambourines , flutes and lyres ; and they will be prophesying .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	6	Then the Spirit of Adonai will fall on you ; you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man !
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	7	When these signs come over you , just do whatever you feel like doing , because God is with you .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	8	Then you are to go down ahead of me to Gilgal , and there I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and present sacrifices as peace offerings . Wait there seven days , until I come to you and tell you what to do. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	9	As it happened , as soon as he had turned his back to leave Sh ’ mu ’ el , God gave him another heart ; and all those signs took place that day .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	11	When those who knew him from before saw him there , prophesying with the prophets , they asked each other , “ What ’ s happened to Kish ’ s son ? Is Sha ’ ul a prophet , too ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	12	Someone in the crowd answered , “ Must prophets ’ fathers be special ? ” So it became an expression — “ Is Sha ’ ul a prophet , too ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	13	When he had finished prophesying , he arrived at the high place .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	14	Sha ’ ul ’ s uncle said to him and his servant , “ Where did you go ? ” He answered , “ To look for the donkeys . When we saw that they hadn ’ t been found , we went to Sh ’ mu ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	15	“ Tell me , please , ” said Sha ’ ul ’ s uncle , “ what Sh ’ mu ’ el said to you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	16	Sha ’ ul answered his uncle , “ He told us that the donkeys had been found , ” but said nothing to him about the matter of his being made king .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	17	Sh ’ mu ’ el summoned the people to Adonai in Mitzpah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	18	He said to the people of Isra ’ el , “ Here is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ I brought Isra ’ el up from Egypt . I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that oppressed you. ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	19	But today you have rejected your God , who himself saves you from all your disasters and distress . You have said to him , ‘ No ! Put a king over us ! ’ So now , present yourselves before Adonai by your tribes and families. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	20	So Sh ’ mu ’ el had all the tribes come forward , and the tribe of Binyamin was chosen .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	21	He had the tribe of Binyamin come forward by families , and the family of the Matri was chosen , and Sha ’ ul the son of Kish was chosen . But when they looked for him , he couldn ’ t be found .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	22	They asked Adonai , “ Has the man come here ? ” Adonai answered , “ There he is , hiding , in among the equipment. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	23	They ran and brought him from there , and when he stood among the people he was head and shoulders taller than anyone around .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	24	Sh ’ mu ’ el said to all the people , “ Do you see the man Adonai has chosen , that there is no one like him among all the people ? ” Then all the people shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	25	Sh ’ mu ’ el told the people what kinds of rulings should be made in the kingdom , then wrote it on a scroll and set it down before Adonai . After that , he sent all the people away , everyone to his own home .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	26	Sha ’ ul too went home to Giv ‘ ah , accompanied by warriors whose hearts God had touched .
CJB	1%20Samuel	10	27	True , there were some scoundrels who said , “ How can this man save us ? ” They showed him no respect and brought him no gift , but he held his peace .
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	11	The next day Sha ’ ul divided the people into three companies . Then they entered the camp of the ‘ Amoni during the morning watch and kept attacking until the heat of the day , until those who remained were so scattered that no two of them were left together .
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	2	Nachash the ‘ Amoni replied , “ I ’ ll do it on this condition : that all your right eyes be gouged out and thus bring disgrace on all of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	3	The leaders of Yavesh answered him , “ Give us seven days ’ grace to send messengers throughout Isra ’ el ’ s territory ; then , if no one will rescue us , we will surrender to you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	4	The messengers came to Giv ‘ ah , where Sha ’ ul lived , and said these words in the hearing of the people ; and all the people cried out and wept .
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	5	As this was going on , Sha ’ ul came , following the oxen out of the field . Sha ’ ul asked , “ What ’ s wrong with the people to make them cry like that ? ” They told him what the men from Yavesh had said .
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	6	The Spirit of God fell on Sha ’ ul when he heard this ; blazing furiously with anger ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	7	he seized a pair of oxen and cut them in pieces ; then he sent them throughout the territory of Isra ’ el with messengers saying , “ Anyone who doesn ’ t come and follow Sha ’ ul and Sh ’ mu ’ el , this is what will be done to his oxen ! ” The fear of Adonai fell on the people , and they came out with united hearts .
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	8	He reviewed them in Bezek ; there were 300,000 from the people of Isra ’ el ; the men of Y ’ hudah numbered 30,000 .
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	9	To the messengers that had come they said , “ Tell the men of Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad , ‘ Tomorrow , by the time the sun is hot , you will have been rescued. ’ ” The messengers returned and told the men of Yavesh ; they were overjoyed .
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	10	Then the men of Yavesh said [ to Nachash ] , “ Tomorrow we will surrender to you , and you can do with us whatever you like. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	12	The people said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ Who are the men who said , ‘ Is Sha ’ ul to rule over us ? ’ Hand them over to us , so we can put them to death. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	13	But Sha ’ ul said , “ No one will be put to death today , because today Adonai has rescued Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	14	Then Sh ’ mu ’ el said to the people , “ Come , let ’ s go to Gilgal and inaugurate the kingship there .
CJB	1%20Samuel	11	15	So all the people went to Gilgal ; and there in Gilgal , before Adonai , they made Sha ’ ul king . They presented sacrifices as peace offerings before Adonai there , and there Sha ’ ul and all the people of Isra ’ el celebrated with great joy .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	12	When you saw that Nachash the king of the people of ‘ Amon was attacking you , you said to me , “ No , we want a king to rule over us ” — when Adonai your God was your king .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	2	There is the king , walking ahead of you ; but I am old and gray-headed . There are my sons with you , and I have walked at your head from when I was a boy until today .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	3	So here I am ; now is the time to witness against me before Adonai and before his anointed king . Does any of you think I have taken your ox or donkey , defrauded or oppressed you , or accepted a bribe to deprive you of justice ? Tell me , and I will restore it to you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	4	They answered , “ You haven ’ t defrauded or oppressed us , and you have accepted nothing from anyone. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	5	He said , “ Adonai is witness against you , and his anointed king is witness against you today , that you have found nothing in my hands ? ” They replied , “ He is witness. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	6	Sh ’ mu ’ el said to the people , “ It was Adonai who appointed Moshe and Aharon and who brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	7	Now , hold still ; because I am going to enter into judgment with you before Adonai regarding all the righteous acts of Adonai that he did for you and your ancestors .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	8	“ After Ya ‘ akov had entered Egypt , your ancestors cried to Adonai ; and Adonai sent Moshe and Aharon , who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and had them live here in this place .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	9	But they forgot Adonai their God ; so he handed them over to Sisra , commander of the army of Hatzor , and to the P ’ lishtim , and to the king of Mo ’ av ; and they fought against them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	10	But they cried to Adonai and said , ‘ We sinned by abandoning Adonai and serving the ba ‘ alim and ‘ ashtarot . But now , if you rescue us from the power of our enemies , we will serve you. ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	11	So Adonai sent Yeruba ‘ al , B ’ dan , Yiftach and Sh ’ mu ’ el and rescued you from the power of our enemies on every side , and you lived securely .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	13	Now , here ’ s the king you have chosen , the one you asked for . See , Adonai has put a king over you .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	14	If you will fear Adonai , serve him , obey what he says and not rebel against Adonai ’ s orders — if both you and the king ruling you remain followers of Adonai your God — [ then things will go well for you . ]
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	15	But if you refuse to obey what Adonai says and rebel against Adonai ’ s orders , then Adonai will oppress both you and your leaders .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	16	“ Now therefore , hold still ; and see the great deed which Adonai will perform before your very eyes .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	17	Now is wheat harvest time , isn ’ t it ? I am going to call on Adonai to send thunder and rain . Then you will understand and see how wicked from Adonai ’ s viewpoint is the thing you have done in asking for a king. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	18	Sh ’ mu ’ el called to Adonai , and Adonai sent thunder and rain that day . Then all the people became very much afraid of Adonai and Sh ’ mu ’ el .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	19	All the people said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ Pray to Adonai your God for your servants , so that we won ’ t die ; because to all our other sins now we ’ ve added this evil as well , asking for a king over us. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	20	Sh ’ mu ’ el answered the people , “ Don ’ t be afraid . You have indeed done all this evil ; yet now , just don ’ t turn away from following Adonai ; but serve Adonai with all your heart .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	21	Don ’ t turn to the side ; because then you would go after useless things that can neither help nor rescue , they are so futile .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	22	For the sake of his great reputation , Adonai will not abandon his people ; because it has pleased Adonai to make you a people for himself .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	23	As for me , far be it from me to sin against Adonai by ceasing to pray for you ! Rather , I will continue instructing you in the good and right way .
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	24	Only fear Adonai , and serve him faithfully with all your heart ; for think what great things he has done for you !
CJB	1%20Samuel	12	25	However , if you insist on doing wicked things , you will be swept away — both you and your king ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	1	Samuel 13:1 The Hebrew text lacks the number .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	13	Sh ’ mu ’ el said to Sha ’ ul , “ You did a foolish thing . You didn ’ t observe the mitzvah of Adonai , which he gave you . If you had , Adonai would have set up your kingship over Isra ’ el forever .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	2	when he chose three thousand of Isra ’ el ’ s men . Two thousand of them were with Sha ’ ul in Mikhmas and in the hills of Beit-El , and a thousand were with Y ’ honatan in Giv ‘ at-Binyamin . The rest of the people he sent back to their respective tents .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	3	Y ’ honatan assassinated the governor of the P ’ lishtim in Geva . The P ’ lishtim heard of it ; so Sha ’ ul had the shofar sounded throughout the land , saying , “ Let the Hebrews hear ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	4	All Isra ’ el heard that Sha ’ ul had assassinated the governor of the P ’ lishtim and thus made Isra ’ el a stench in the nostrils of the P ’ lishtim . So the people rallied behind Sha ’ ul in Gilgal ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	5	while the P ’ lishtim assembled themselves together to make war on Isra ’ el — 30,000 chariots , 6,000 horsemen and an army as large as the number of sand grains on the seashore . They came up and pitched camp at Mikhmas , east of Beit-Aven .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	6	The men of Isra ’ el saw that their options were limited and that the people felt so hard pressed that they were hiding themselves in caves , thickets , crevices , watchtowers and cisterns ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	7	while some of the Hebrews crossed the Yarden to the territory of Gad and Gil ‘ ad . But Sha ’ ul was still in Gilgal , where all the people were eager to follow him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	8	He waited seven days , as Sh ’ mu ’ el had instructed ; but Sh ’ mu ’ el didn ’ t come to Gilgal ; so the army began to drift away from him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	9	Sha ’ ul said , “ Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings , ” and he offered the burnt offering .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	10	As soon as he had finished sacrificing the burnt offering , there was Sh ’ mu ’ el — he had come , and Sha ’ ul went out to meet and greet him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	11	Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ What have you done ? ” Sha ’ ul answered , “ I saw that the army was drifting away from me , that you hadn ’ t come during the time appointed and that the P ’ lishtim had assembled at Mikhmas .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	12	I said , ‘ Now the P ’ lishtim will fall on me at Gilgal , and I haven ’ t asked the favor of Adonai , ’ so I forced myself and offered the burnt offering. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	14	But as it is , your kingship will not be established . Adonai has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Adonai has appointed him to be prince over his people , because you did not observe what Adonai ordered you to do. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	15	Then Sh ’ mu ’ el left Gilgal and went up to Giv ‘ at-Binyamin . Sha ’ ul counted how many were still there with him , about
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	600	men .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	16	Sha ’ ul , Y ’ honatan his son and the men with him took up quarters at Giv ‘ at-Binyamin , while the P ’ lishtim remained in camp at Mikhmas .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	17	Then raiding parties began coming out from the camp of the P ’ lishtim , three of them : one group turned toward the road leading to ‘ Ofrah in the territory of Shu ‘ al ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	18	another group took the road toward Beit-Horon ; and another company took the road toward the desert through the territory overlooking Vadi Tzvo ‘ im .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	19	Now there was no metalsmith to be found anywhere in all the land of Isra ’ el , because the P ’ lishtim had said , “ We don ’ t want the Hebrews making themselves swords or spears. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	20	So whenever any of the people of Isra ’ el wanted to sharpen his hoe , plowshare , axe or pick , he had to go down to the P ’ lishtim ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	21	where the exorbitant prices were two-thirds of a shekel for filing a pick or plowshare and one-third of a shekel for filing an axe or setting an oxgoad in its handle .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	22	Thus when the time came to fight , no one in the army of Sha ’ ul and Y ’ honatan was equipped with either sword or spear ; although Sha ’ ul and Y ’ honatan his son did have them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	13	23	A garrison of the P ’ lishtim had gone out to the pass of Mikhmas . Footnotes -
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	14	That first slaughter , of about twenty men , was accomplished by Y ’ honatan and his armor bearer in a space only half as long as one side of the area a pair of oxen could plow in a day [ about
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	2	Sha ’ ul was waiting at the far edge of Giv ‘ ah under the pomegranate tree in Migron ; the force with him numbered about
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	600	men .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	3	Achiyah the son of Achituv , I-Khavod ’ s brother , the son of Pinchas the son of ‘ Eli , the cohen of Adonai in Shiloh , was carrying a ritual vest . No one knew that Y ’ honatan had gone .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	4	Between the passes by which Y ’ honatan was trying to cross to the garrison of the P ’ lishtim , there was a rocky spur on one side and another rocky spur on the other side ; the name of the one was Botzetz , and of the other , Seneh .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	5	The one spur rose up on the north , in front of Mikhmas , and the other on the south , in front of Geva .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	6	Y ’ honatan said to his armor-bearer , “ Come on , let ’ s go across to the garrison of these uncircumcised people . Maybe Adonai will do something for us , since Adonai can rescue with a few people as easily as with many. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	7	His armor-bearer replied , “ Do everything you think you should ; I ’ m with you , whatever you decide. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	8	Y ’ honatan said , “ Here , we ’ ll cross over to those men and let them know we ’ re there .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they say , ‘ Wait till we come to you , ’ we ’ ll stand still where we are and not go up to them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	10	But if they say , ‘ Come up to us , ’ we ’ ll go on up ; and that will be the sign that Adonai has given us victory over them. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	11	So both of them let their presence be known to the garrison of the P ’ lishtim ; and the P ’ lishtim said , “ Look , some Hebrews coming out of the holes they ’ ve been hiding in ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	12	Then the men of the garrison said to Y ’ honatan and his armor-bearer , “ Come up to us ; we want to show you something. ” Y ’ honatan told his armor-bearer , “ Come on up after me , for Adonai has handed them over to Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	13	Y ’ honatan climbed up , using his hands as well as his feet , with his armor-bearer behind him . The P ’ lishtim fell before Y ’ honatan , and his armor-bearer following him finished them off .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	200	yards ] .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	15	There was panic in the field camp among all the P ’ lishtim ; likewise , the garrison and the raiding party panicked . Besides all this , there was an earthquake ; thus it grew into panic caused by God .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	16	Sha ’ ul ’ s men on watch in Giv ‘ at-Binyamin could see the enemy camp scattering and running in all directions .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	17	Sha ’ ul ordered the forces with him to call the roll and see who was missing . So they called the roll , and found Y ’ honatan and his armor-bearer not present .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	18	Sha ’ ul told Achiyah , “ Bring the ark of God here ” ; for at that time the ark of God was with the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	19	But while Sha ’ ul was talking to the cohen , the uproar in the camp of the P ’ lishtim continued and kept getting louder . Sha ’ ul said to the cohen , “ Put your hand down. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	20	Sha ’ ul and the entire force with him assembled and went to battle , but they found the P ’ lishtim all fighting each other in utter confusion .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	21	The Hebrews from the surrounding countryside who had previously been with the P ’ lishtim and had gone up with them into the camp deserted and went over to Isra ’ el with Sha ’ ul and Y ’ honatan .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	22	Likewise , on hearing that the P ’ lishtim were fleeing , all the men of Isra ’ el who had hidden themselves in the hills of Efrayim pursued them in battle .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	23	So Adonai saved Isra ’ el that day , and the battle spread as far as Beit-Aven .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	24	Isra ’ el ’ s soldiers had been driven to exhaustion that day ; but Sha ’ ul issued this warning to the people : “ A curse on any man who eats any food until evening , when I will have finished taking vengeance on my enemies. ” So none of the people even tasted food .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	25	Now the people came to a forest where there was a honeycomb on the ground .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	26	When the people had entered the forest , they saw there the honeycomb with honey dripping out ; but no one put his hand to his mouth , because the people feared the oath .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Y ’ honatan hadn ’ t heard his father charging the people with the oath , so he put out the end of the staff in his hand , dipped it in the honeycomb and raised it to his mouth ; whereupon his eyes lit up .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	28	But one of the people said in response , “ Your father strictly charged the people with an oath , ‘ A curse on any man who eats any food today ’ ; even though the people are fainting with hunger. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	29	Y ’ honatan answered , “ My father has brought trouble to the land . Just look how my eyes have lit up because I tasted a little of this honey .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	30	How much greater would the slaughter of the P ’ lishtim have been today , then , if the people had eaten freely of the spoil they found with their enemies ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	31	That day they had attacked the P ’ lishtim from Mikhmas to Ayalon ; but the people were very exhausted .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	32	So the people rushed at the spoil , seizing sheep , cows and calves , slaughtering them on the ground , and eating the flesh with the blood .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	33	Sha ’ ul was told , “ Look how the people are sinning against Adonai , eating with the blood. ” He said , “ You have not kept faith ! Roll a big stone to me immediately !
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	34	Now , ” Sha ’ ul said , “ go around among the people and tell them , ‘ Each of you is to bring his cow and his sheep and slaughter them here . Then eat . Don ’ t sin against Adonai by eating with the blood. ” So each person brought his animal with him that evening and killed it there .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	35	Sha ’ ul erected an altar to Adonai ; it was the first altar that he erected to Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	36	Sha ’ ul said , “ Let ’ s go after the P ’ lishtim by night . We ’ ll plunder them until dawn ; we won ’ t leave one of them alive. ” They answered , “ Do whatever seems good to you. ” But the cohen said , “ Let ’ s approach God here. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	37	Sha ’ ul consulted God : “ Should I go down in pursuit of the P ’ lishtim ? Will you hand them over to Isra ’ el ? ” But he didn ’ t answer him that day .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	38	Sha ’ ul said , “ Come here , all you heads of the people . Think carefully : who has committed this sin today ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	39	For , as Adonai Isra ’ el ’ s deliverer lives , even if it proves to be Y ’ honatan my son , he must be put to death. ” But no one among all the people answered him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	40	Then he said to all Isra ’ el , “ You be on one side , and I and Y ’ honatan my son will be on the other side. ” The people replied to Sha ’ ul , “ Do what seems good to you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	41	Sha ’ ul said to Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , “ Who is right ? ” Y ’ honatan and Sha ’ ul were chosen by lot , and the people went free .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	42	Sha ’ ul said , “ Cast lots between me and Y ’ honatan my son. ” Y ’ honatan was chosen .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	43	Then Sha ’ ul said to Y ’ honatan , “ Tell me what you did. ” Y ’ honatan told him , “ Yes , I tasted a little honey with the end of the staff in my hand . Here I am ; I ’ m ready to die. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	44	Sha ’ ul said , “ May God do the same to me and more also if you are not put to death , Y ’ honatan ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	45	But the people said to Sha ’ ul , “ Must Y ’ honatan die , who has accomplished this great deliverance in Isra ’ el ? Heaven forbid ! As Adonai lives , not one hair of his head will fall to the ground ; because he worked with God today ! ” In this way the people rescued Y ’ honatan , so that he didn ’ t die .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	46	Then Sha ’ ul stopped pursuing the P ’ lishtim , and the P ’ lishtim returned to their own territory .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	47	So Sha ’ ul took over the rulership of Isra ’ el . He fought against all his enemies on every side — against Mo ’ av , the people of ‘ Amon , Edom , the kings of Tzovah and the P ’ lishtim . No matter which way he turned , he defeated them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	48	He demonstrated his strength by attacking ‘ Amalek , and he saved Isra ’ el from the power of those who were plundering them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	49	The sons of Sha ’ ul were Y ’ honatan , Yishvi and Malkishua , while the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the older , Merav , and of the younger , Mikhal .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	50	Sha ’ ul ’ s wife was named Achino ‘ am the daughter of Achima ‘ atz ; the commander of his army was named Avner the son of Ner , Sha ’ ul ’ s uncle .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	51	Kish was the father of Sha ’ ul , and Ner the father of Avner was the son of Avi ’ el .
CJB	1%20Samuel	14	52	As long as Sha ’ ul lived there was bitter war against the P ’ lishtim . Whenever Sha ’ ul saw any strong or courageous man , he recruited him into his service .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	15	Sha ’ ul said , “ They brought them from the ‘ Amaleki , because the people spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to Adonai your God . But we completely destroyed the rest. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	2	Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ I remember what ‘ Amalek did to Isra ’ el , how they fought against Isra ’ el when they were coming up from Egypt .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now go and attack ‘ Amalek , and completely destroy everything they have . Don ’ t spare them , but kill men and women , children and babies , cows and sheep , camels and donkeys. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	4	Sha ’ ul summoned the people and reviewed them in T ’ la ’ im — 200,000 foot soldiers , with another 10,000 men from Y ’ hudah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	5	Sha ’ ul arrived at the city of ‘ Amalek and lay in wait in the valley .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	6	Sha ’ ul said to the Keni , “ Go away , withdraw , leave your homes there with the ‘ Amaleki . Otherwise , I might destroy you along with them , even though you were kind to all the people of Isra ’ el when they came out of Egypt . So the Keni went away from among the ‘ Amaleki .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	7	Then Sha ’ ul attacked ‘ Amalek , starting at Havilah and continuing toward Shur , at the border of Egypt .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	8	He took Agag the king of ‘ Amalek alive ; but he completely destroyed the people , putting them to the sword .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	9	However , Sha ’ ul and the people spared Agag , along with the best of the sheep and cattle , and even the second best , also the lambs , and everything that was good — they weren ’ t inclined to destroy these things . But everything that was worthless or weak they completely destroyed .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	10	Then the word of Adonai came to Sh ’ mu ’ el :
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	11	“ I regret setting up Sha ’ ul as king , because he has turned back from following me and hasn ’ t obeyed my orders. ” This made Sh ’ mu ’ el very sad , so that he cried to Adonai all night .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	12	Sh ’ mu ’ el got up early in the morning to meet Sha ’ ul ; however , Sh ’ mu ’ el was told , “ Sha ’ ul came to Karmel to set up a monument for himself there , but now he has left and is on his way down to Gilgal. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	13	Sh ’ mu ’ el went to Sha ’ ul ; Sha ’ ul said to him , “ May Adonai bless you ! I have done what Adonai ordered. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	14	But Sh ’ mu ’ el answered , “ If so , why do I hear sheep bleating and cows mooing ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	16	Then Sh ’ mu ’ el said to Sha ’ ul , “ Stop ! I ’ m going to tell you what Adonai said to me last night. ” He said , “ Speak. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	17	Sh ’ mu ’ el then said , “ You may be small in your own sight , but you are head of the tribes of Isra ’ el — Adonai anointed you king over Isra ’ el !
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	18	Now Adonai sent you on a mission and told you , ‘ Go and completely destroy ‘ Amalek , those sinners ; keep making war on them until they have been exterminated .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	19	Why did you seize the spoil instead of paying attention to what Adonai said ? From Adonai ’ s viewpoint , you have done an evil thing. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	20	Sha ’ ul said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ I did too pay attention to what Adonai said , and I carried out the mission on which Adonai sent me . I brought back Agag the king of ‘ Amalek , and I completely destroyed ‘ Amalek .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	21	But the people took some of the spoil , the best of the sheep and cattle set aside for destruction , to sacrifice to Adonai your God in Gilgal. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	22	Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ Does Adonai take as much pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying what Adonai says ? Surely obeying is better than sacrifice , and heeding orders than the fat of rams .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	23	“ For rebellion is like the sin of sorcery , stubbornness like the crime of idolatry . Because you have rejected the word of Adonai , he too has rejected you as king. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	24	Sha ’ ul said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ I have sinned . I violated the order of Adonai and your words too , because I was afraid of the people and listened to what they said .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	25	Now , please , pardon my sin ; and come back with me , so that I can worship Adonai. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	26	But Sh ’ mu ’ el said to Sha ’ ul , “ I will not go back with you , because you have rejected the word of Adonai , and Adonai has rejected you as king over Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	27	As Sh ’ mu ’ el was turning around to leave , he took hold of the hem of his cloak , and it tore .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	28	Sh ’ mu ’ el said to him , “ Adonai has torn the kingdom of Isra ’ el away from you today and given it to a fellow countryman of yours who is better than you .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	29	Moreover , the Eternal One of Isra ’ el will not lie or change his mind , because he isn ’ t a mere human being subject to changing his mind. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	30	Then Sha ’ ul said , “ I have sinned ; but in spite of that , please show me respect now before the leaders of my people and before Isra ’ el by coming back with me , so that I can worship Adonai your God. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Sh ’ mu ’ el followed Sha ’ ul back , and Sha ’ ul worshipped Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	32	Then Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ Bring Agag the king of ‘ Amalek here to me . Agag came to him in chains and said , “ Without doubt , mine will be a bitter death. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	33	Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ Just as your sword has left women childless , so will your mother be left childless among women. ” Then Sh ’ mu ’ el cut Agag in pieces before Adonai in Gilgal .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	34	Sh ’ mu ’ el returned to Ramah , and Sha ’ ul went up to his house in Giv ‘ at-Sha ’ ul .
CJB	1%20Samuel	15	35	Never again did Sh ’ mu ’ el see Sha ’ ul , until the day he died . But Sh ’ mu ’ el grieved over Sha ’ ul , and Adonai regretted that he had made Sha ’ ul king over Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	16	Let our lord now command your servants who are here with you to look for a man who knows how to play the lyre . Then , if the evil spirit from God comes over you , he will play ; and it will do you good. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	2	Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ How can I go ? If Sha ’ ul hears of it , he will have me killed. ” Adonai said , “ Take a female cow with you and say , ‘ I have come to sacrifice to Adonai. ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	3	Summon Yishai to the sacrifice . I will tell you what to do , and you are to anoint for me the person I point out to you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	4	Sh ’ mu ’ el did what Adonai said and arrived at Beit-Lechem . The leaders of the city came trembling to meet him and asked , “ Are you coming in peace ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	5	He answered , “ In peace . I have come to sacrifice to Adonai . Consecrate yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice. ” He consecrated Yishai and his sons and summoned them to the sacrifice .
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	6	When they had come , he looked at Eli ’ av and said , “ This has to be Adonai ’ s anointed one , here before him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	7	But Adonai said to Sh ’ mu ’ el , “ Don ’ t pay attention to how he looks or how tall he is , because I have rejected him . Adonai doesn ’ t see the way humans see — humans look at the outward appearance , but Adonai looks at the heart. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	8	Then Yishai called Avinadav and presented him to Sh ’ mu ’ el ; but he said , “ Adonai hasn ’ t chosen this one either. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	9	Yishai presented Shammah ; again Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ Adonai hasn ’ t chosen this one either. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	10	Yishai presented seven of his sons to Sh ’ mu ’ el ; but Sh ’ mu ’ el told Yishai , “ Adonai has not chosen these .
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	11	Are all your sons here ? ” Sh ’ mu ’ el asked Yishai . He replied , “ There is still the youngest ; he ’ s out there tending the sheep. ” Sh ’ mu ’ el said to Yishai , “ Send and bring him back , because we won ’ t sit down to eat until he gets here. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	12	He sent and brought him in . With ruddy cheeks , red hair and bright eyes , he was a good-looking fellow . Adonai said , “ Stand up and anoint him ; he ’ s the one. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	13	Sh ’ mu ’ el took the horn of oil and anointed him there in his brothers ’ presence . From that day on , the Spirit of Adonai would fall upon David with power . So Sh ’ mu ’ el set out and went to Ramah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	14	Now the Spirit of Adonai had left Sha ’ ul ; instead , an evil spirit from Adonai would suddenly come over him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	15	Sha ’ ul ’ s servants said to him , “ Do you notice that there ’ s an evil spirit from God that suddenly comes over you ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	17	Sha ’ ul said to his servants , “ Find me a man who can play well , and bring him to me. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	18	One of the young men answered , “ Here , I ’ ve seen one of the sons of Yishai the Beit-Lachmi who knows how to play . He ’ s a brave soldier , he can fight , he chooses his words carefully and he ’ s pleasant-looking . Besides , Adonai is with him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	19	So Sha ’ ul sent messengers to Yishai saying , “ Send me David your son , who is out with the sheep. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	20	Yishai took a donkey , loaded it with bread , a bottle of wine and a kid , and sent them with David his son to Sha ’ ul .
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	21	David came to Sha ’ ul and presented himself to him . Sha ’ ul took a great liking to him and made him his armor-bearer .
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	22	Sha ’ ul sent a message to Yishai : “ Please let David stay in my service , because I ’ m pleased with him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	16	23	So it was that whenever the [ evil ] spirit from God came over Sha ’ ul , David would take the lyre and play it , with the result that Sha ’ ul would find relief and feel better , as the evil spirit left him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	17	Yishai said to David his son , “ Please take your brothers five bushels of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread ; hurry , and carry them to your brothers at the camp .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	2	Sha ’ ul and the men of Isra ’ el assembled , set up camp in the Elah Valley and drew up their battle line opposite the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	3	The P ’ lishtim occupied a position on one hill and Isra ’ el a position on another hill , with a valley between them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	4	There came out a champion from the camp of the P ’ lishtim named Golyat , from Gat , who was nine feet nine inches tall .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	5	He had a bronze helmet on his head , and he wore a bronze armor plate weighing
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	120	pounds .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	6	He had bronze armor protecting his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	7	The shaft of his spear was as big as a weaver ’ s beam , and the iron spearhead weighed fifteen pounds . His shield-bearer went ahead of him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	8	He stood and yelled at the armies of Isra ’ el , “ Why come out and draw up a battle line ? I ’ m a P ’ lishti , and you are servants of Sha ’ ul , so choose a man for yourselves , and let him come down to me .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	9	If he can fight me and kill me , we ’ ll be your slaves ; but if I beat him and kill him , you will become slaves and serve us. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	10	The P ’ lishti added , “ I challenge Isra ’ el ’ s armies today — give me a man , and we ’ ll fight it out ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	11	When Sha ’ ul and all Isra ’ el heard those words of the P ’ lishti , they were shaken and terrified .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	12	Now David was the son of that Efrati from Beit-Lechem in Y ’ hudah named Yishai . He had eight sons ; and in the time of Sha ’ ul he was old — the years had taken their toll .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	13	Yishai ’ s three oldest sons had followed Sha ’ ul to battle ; the names of his three sons who went to battle were Eli ’ av the firstborn , next to him Avinadav , and the third Shammah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	14	David was the youngest ; the three oldest followed Sha ’ ul .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	15	David went back and forth from Sha ’ ul to pasture his father ’ s sheep at Beit-Lechem .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	16	Meanwhile , the P ’ lishti approached with his challenge every morning and evening for forty days .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	18	Also bring these ten cheeses to their field officer . Find out if your brothers are well , and bring back some token from them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	19	Sha ’ ul and your brothers , with all the army of Isra ’ el , are in the Elah Valley , fighting the P ’ lishtim. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	20	David got up early in the morning , left the sheep with a helper , took his load and set out , as Yishai had ordered him . He arrived at the barricade of the camp just as the troops were going out to their battle stations and shouting the war cry .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	21	Isra ’ el and the P ’ lishtim had set up their battle lines facing each other .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	22	David left his equipment in charge of the equipment guard , ran to the troops , went to his brothers and asked if they were well .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	23	As he was talking with them , there came the champion , the P ’ lishti from Gat named Golyat , from the ranks of the P ’ lishtim , saying the same words as before ; and David heard them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	24	When the soldiers from Isra ’ el saw the man , they all ran away from him , terrified .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	25	The soldiers from Isra ’ el said [ to each other ] , “ You saw that man who just came up ? He has come to challenge Isra ’ el . To whoever kills him , the king will give a rich reward ; he ’ ll also give him his daughter and exempt his father ’ s family from all service and taxes in Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	26	David said to the men standing with him , “ What reward will be given to the man who kills this P ’ lishti and removes this disgrace from Isra ’ el ? Who is this uncircumcised P ’ lishti anyway , that he challenges the armies of the living God ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	27	The people answered with what they had been saying , adding , “ That ’ s what will be done for the man who kills him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	28	Eli ’ av his oldest brother heard when David spoke to the men , and it made Eli ’ av angry at him . He asked , “ Why did you come down here ? With whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert ? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is ! You just came down to watch the fighting. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	29	David said , “ What have I done now ? I only asked a question. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	30	He turned away from him to someone else and asked the same question , and the people gave him the same answer .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	31	David ’ s words were overheard and told to Sha ’ ul , who summoned him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	32	David said to Sha ’ ul , “ No one should lose heart because of him ; your servant will go and fight this P ’ lishti. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	33	Sha ’ ul said to David , “ You can ’ t go to fight this P ’ lishti — you ’ re just a boy , and he has been a warrior from his youth ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	34	David answered Sha ’ ul , “ Your servant used to guard his father ’ s sheep . When a lion or a bear would come and grab a lamb from the flock ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	35	I would go after it , hit it , and snatch the lamb from its mouth ; and if it turned on me , I would catch it by the jaw , smack it and kill it .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	36	Your servant has defeated both lions and bears , and this uncircumcised P ’ lishti will be like one of them , because he has challenged the armies of the living God. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	37	Then David said , “ Adonai , who rescued me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear , will rescue me from the paw of this P ’ lishti ! ” Sha ’ ul said to David , “ Go ; may Adonai be with you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	38	Sha ’ ul dressed David in his own armor — he put a bronze helmet on his head and gave him armor plate to wear .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	39	David buckled his sword on his armor and tried to walk , but he wasn ’ t used to such equipment . David said to Sha ’ ul , “ I can ’ t move wearing these things , because I ’ m not used to them. ” So David took them off .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	40	Then he took his stick in his hand and picked five smooth stones from the riverbed , putting them in his shepherd ’ s bag , in his pouch . Then , with his sling in his hand , he approached the P ’ lishti .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	41	The P ’ lishti , with his shield-bearer ahead of him , came nearer and nearer to David .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	42	The P ’ lishti looked David up and down and had nothing but scorn for what he saw — a boy with ruddy cheeks , red hair and good looks .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	43	The P ’ lishti said to David , “ Am I a dog ? Is that why you ’ re coming at me with sticks ? ” — and the P ’ lishti cursed David by his god .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	44	Then the P ’ lishti said to David , “ Come here to me , so I can give your flesh to the birds in the air and the wild animals. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	45	David answered the P ’ lishti , “ You ’ re coming at me with a sword , a spear and a javelin . But I ’ m coming at you in the name of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of the armies of Isra ’ el , whom you have challenged .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	46	Today Adonai will hand you over to me . I will attack you , lop your head off , and give the carcasses of the army of the P ’ lishtim to the birds in the air and the animals in the land . Then all the land will know that there is a God in Isra ’ el ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	47	and everyone assembled here will know that Adonai does not save by sword or spear . For this is Adonai ’ s battle , and he will hand you over to us. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	48	When the P ’ lishti got up , approached and came close to meet David , David hurried and ran toward the army to meet the P ’ lishti .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	49	David put his hand in his bag , took out a stone , and hurled it with his sling . It struck the P ’ lishti in his forehead and buried itself in his forehead , so that he fell face down on the ground .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	50	Thus David defeated the P ’ lishti with a sling and a stone , striking the P ’ lishti and killing him ; but David had no sword in his hand .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	51	Then David ran and stood over the P ’ lishti , took his sword , drew it out of its sheath , and finished killing him , cutting off his head with it . When the P ’ lishtim saw that their hero was dead , they fled .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	52	The men of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah got up , shouting , and pursued the P ’ lishtim all the way to Gat and the gates of ‘ Ekron . The wounded P ’ lishtim fell down all along the road from Sha ‘ arayim to Gat and ‘ Ekron .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	53	After chasing the P ’ lishtim , the army of Isra ’ el returned and plundered their camp .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	54	David took the head of the P ’ lishti and brought it to Yerushalayim , but he put the armor of the P ’ lishti in his tent .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	55	When Sha ’ ul saw David go out to fight the P ’ lishti , he said to Avner , the army ’ s commander , “ Avner , whose son is this boy ? ” “ By your life , O king , ” Avner replied , “ I don ’ t know. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	56	The king said , “ Find out whose son this boy is. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	57	As David returned from killing the P ’ lishti , Avner took him and brought him to Sha ’ ul with the head of the P ’ lishti in his hand .
CJB	1%20Samuel	17	58	Sha ’ ul asked him , “ Young man , whose son are you ? ” David answered , “ I am the son of your servant Yishai the Beit-Lachmi . ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	18	David ’ s response to Sha ’ ul was , “ Who am I , that I should become the king ’ s son-in-law ? I don ’ t have any kind of a life , and my father ’ s family has no rank in Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	2	That day , Sha ’ ul took David into his service and would not let him go home to his father ’ s house any more .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	3	Y ’ honatan made a covenant with David , because he loved him as he did himself .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	4	Y ’ honatan removed the cloak he was wearing and gave it to David , his armor too , including his sword , bow and belt .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	5	David would go out , and no matter where Sha ’ ul sent him , he was successful . Sha ’ ul put him in charge of the fighting men ; all the people thought it good , and so did Sha ’ ul ’ s servants .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	6	As David and the others were returning from the slaughter of the P ’ lishti , the women came out of all the cities of Isra ’ el to meet King Sha ’ ul , singing and dancing joyfully with tambourines and three-stringed instruments .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	7	In their merrymaking the women sang , “ Sha ’ ul has killed his thousands , but David his tens of thousands. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	8	Sha ’ ul became very angry , because this song displeased him . He said , “ They give David credit for tens of thousands , but me they give credit for only thousands . Now all he lacks is the kingdom ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	9	From that day on , Sha ’ ul viewed David with suspicion .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	10	The following day an evil spirit from God came powerfully over Sha ’ ul , so that he fell into a frenzy in the house . David was there , playing his lyre as on other occasions . This time Sha ’ ul had his spear in his hand ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	11	and he threw the spear , thinking , “ I will pin David to the wall ! ” But David dodged out of the way twice .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	12	Sha ’ ul became afraid of David , because Adonai was with him and had left Sha ’ ul .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	13	Therefore Sha ’ ul put him at a distance from himself by making him commander over a thousand ; his goings and comings became public knowledge .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	14	David had great success in all his ways ; Adonai was with him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	15	When Sha ’ ul saw how very successful he was , he became afraid of him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	16	But all Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah loved David , because they knew about all his campaigns .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	17	Sha ’ ul said to David , “ Here is my older daughter Merav . I will give her to you as your wife ; only continue displaying your courage for me , and fight Adonai ’ s battles. ” Sha ’ ul was thinking , “ I don ’ t dare touch him , so let the P ’ lishtim do away with him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	19	However , when it was time for Merav Sha ’ ul ’ s daughter to be given to David , she was given to Adri ’ el the Mecholati as his wife .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	20	But Mikhal Sha ’ ul ’ s daughter fell in love with David . They told Sha ’ ul , and it pleased him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	21	Sha ’ ul said , “ I ’ ll give her to him , so that she can entrap him , and the P ’ lishtim can do away with him. ” So Sha ’ ul said to David , “ Today you will become my son-in-law through the second [ daughter ] . ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	22	Sha ’ ul ordered his servants to speak privately with David and say , “ Look , the king is pleased with you , and all his servants like you ; so become the king ’ s son-in-law. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	23	Sha ’ ul ’ s servants said this to David ; but David replied , “ Do you think being the king ’ s son-in-law is something to be treated so casually , given that I ’ m a poor man without social standing ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	24	Sha ’ ul ’ s servants reported back to him how David had responded .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	25	Sha ’ ul said , “ Here ’ s what you are to say to David : ‘ The king doesn ’ t want any dowry ; he wants a hundred foreskins of the P ’ lishtim , so that he can have vengeance on the king ’ s enemies. ” For Sha ’ ul was hoping to have David killed by the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	26	When his servants said these words to David , it pleased David to become the king ’ s son-in-law . Even before the time [ for him to be married ] ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	27	David got up and set out , he and his men , and killed two hundred men of the P ’ lishtim . He brought their foreskins and gave all of them to the king in order to become the king ’ s son-in-law . Then Sha ’ ul gave him Mikhal his daughter as his wife .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	28	Sha ’ ul saw and understood that Adonai was with David and that Mikhal Sha ’ ul ’ s daughter loved him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	29	This only made Sha ’ ul the more afraid of David , so that Sha ’ ul became David ’ s enemy for the rest of his life .
CJB	1%20Samuel	18	30	The leaders of the P ’ lishtim would attack ; but whenever they attacked , David was more successful than any of Sha ’ ul ’ s servants ; so that David acquired a great reputation .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	19	The news reached Sha ’ ul that David had been seen at the prophets ’ dormitory in Ramah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	2	he told him , “ My father Sha ’ ul is out to have you killed . Therefore you must be very cautious tomorrow morning . Find a well-concealed place to hide in .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	3	I will go out and stand next to my father in the countryside where you ’ re hiding . I will talk with my father about you ; and if I learn anything , I ’ ll tell you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	4	Y ’ honatan spoke well of David to Sha ’ ul his father and said to him , “ The king shouldn ’ t sin against his servant David , because he hasn ’ t sinned against you . On the contrary , his work for you has been very good indeed .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	5	He put his life in his hands to attack the P ’ lishtim , and Adonai accomplished a great victory for all Isra ’ el . You yourself saw it , and you were happy about it . So why do you want to sin against innocent blood by killing David without any reason ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	6	Sha ’ ul heeded Y ’ honatan ’ s advice and swore , “ As Adonai lives , he will not be put to death. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	7	Y ’ honatan called David and told him all these things . Then Y ’ honatan brought David to Sha ’ ul to be in attendance on the king , as before .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	8	War broke out again , and David went and fought the P ’ lishtim . He defeated them with a great slaughter , and they fled before him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	9	Then an evil spirit from Adonai came upon Sha ’ ul , as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand . David was playing his lyre ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	10	when Sha ’ ul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear . But he dodged it and moved out of Sha ’ ul ’ s way , so that the spear stuck in the wall . David fled , so that night he escaped .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	11	But Sha ’ ul sent messengers to David ’ s house to watch for him and kill him in the morning . Mikhal David ’ s wife told him , “ If you don ’ t save your life tonight , tomorrow you ’ ll be dead. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	12	So Mikhal let David down through the window ; and he left , fled and escaped .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	13	Mikhal took the household idol , laid it on the bed , put a goat ’ s-hair quilt at its head and covered it with a cloth .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	14	When Sha ’ ul sent messengers to capture David , she said , “ He ’ s ill. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	15	Sha ’ ul sent the messengers to see David with the order , “ Bring him up to me , bed and all , so that I can kill him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	16	But when the messengers entered , there before them was the household idol in the bed , with the goat ’ s-hair quilt at its head .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	17	Sha ’ ul asked Mikhal , “ Why did you deceive me this way and let my enemy go and escape ? ” Mikhal answered Sha ’ ul , “ He threatened me , ‘ Let me go , or I ’ ll kill you. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	18	David fled and escaped , then came to Sh ’ mu ’ el in Ramah and told him everything Sha ’ ul had done to him . So he and Sh ’ mu ’ el went and stayed in the prophets ’ dormitory .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	20	Sha ’ ul sent messengers to capture David . But when they saw the group of prophets prophesying , with Sh ’ mu ’ el standing and leading them , the Spirit of God fell on Sha ’ ul ’ s messengers ; and they too began prophesying .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	21	When Sha ’ ul was told , he sent other messengers ; but they too began prophesying . Sha ’ ul sent messengers a third time , and they also prophesied .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	22	Then he himself went to Ramah . When he arrived at the big cistern in Sekhu , he asked , “ Where are Sh ’ mu ’ el and David ? ” Someone answered , “ They ’ re at the prophets ’ dormitory in Ramah. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	23	While on his way to the prophets ’ dormitory in Ramah , the Spirit of God fell on him too ; and he went on , prophesying , until he arrived at the prophets ’ dormitory in Ramah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	19	24	He also stripped off his clothes , prophesied in Sh ’ mu ’ el ’ s presence and lay there naked all that day and all that night . Hence it continues to be an expression , “ Is Sha ’ ul a prophet , too ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	20	I will shoot three arrows to one side , as if I were shooting at a target .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	2	Y ’ honatan replied , “ Heaven forbid ! You ’ re not going to die ! Look , my father does nothing important or unimportant without telling me first ; so why should my father hide this from me ? It just won ’ t happen ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	3	In response David swore , “ Your father knows very well that you have made me your friend . This is why he will say , ‘ Y ’ honatan must not know this , or he will be unhappy. ’ As truly as Adonai lives , and as truly as you are alive , there is only a step between me and death. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	4	Y ’ honatan said to David , “ Anything you want me to do for you , I ’ ll do. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	5	David answered Y ’ honatan , “ Look , tomorrow is Rosh-Hodesh , and I ought to be dining with the king . Instead , let me go and hide myself in the countryside until evening of the third day .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	6	If your father misses me at all , say , ‘ David begged me to let him hurry to Beit-Lechem , his city ; because it ’ s the annual sacrifice there for his whole family. ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	7	If he says , ‘ Very good , ’ then your servant will be all right . But if he gets angry , you will know that he has planned something bad .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	8	Therefore show kindness to your servant , for you bound your servant to yourself by a covenant before Adonai . But if I have done something wrong , kill me yourself ! Why turn me over to your father ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	9	Y ’ honatan said , “ Heaven forbid ! If I ever were to learn that my father had definitely decided to do you harm , wouldn ’ t I tell you ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	10	Then David asked Y ’ honatan , “ Who will tell me in the event your father gives you a harsh answer ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	11	Y ’ honatan said to David , “ Come , let ’ s go out in the countryside. ” They went out , both of them , to the countryside .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	12	Y ’ honatan said to David , “ Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el [ is witness ] : after I have sounded out my father , about this time tomorrow , or the third day , then , if things look good for David , I will send and let you know .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	13	But if my father intends to do you harm , may Adonai do as much and more to me if I don ’ t let you know and send you away , so that you can go in peace . And may Adonai be with you , just as he used to be with my father .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	14	However , you are to show me Adonai ’ s kindness not only while I am alive , so that I do not die ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	15	but also , after Adonai has eliminated every one of David ’ s enemies from the face of the earth , you are to continue showing kindness to my family forever. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	16	Thus Y ’ honatan made a covenant with the family of David , adding , “ May Adonai seek its fulfillment even through David ’ s enemies. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	17	Y ’ honatan had David swear it again , because of the love he had for him — he loved him as he loved himself .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	18	Y ’ honatan said to him , “ Tomorrow is Rosh-Hodesh , and you will be missed , because your seat will be empty .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	19	The third day , hide yourself well in the same place as you did before ; stay by the Departure Stone .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	21	Then I will send my boy to recover them . If I tell the boy , ‘ They ’ re here on this side of you , take them , ’ then come — it means that everything is peaceful for you ; as Adonai lives , there ’ s nothing wrong .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if I tell the boy , ‘ The arrows are out there , beyond you , ’ then get going , because Adonai is sending you away .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	23	As for the matter we discussed earlier , Adonai is between you and me forever. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	24	So David hid himself in the countryside . When Rosh-Hodesh came , the king sat down to eat his meal .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	25	The king sat at his usual place by the wall . Y ’ honatan stood up , and Avner sat next to Sha ’ ul , but David ’ s place was empty .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	26	However , Sha ’ ul didn ’ t say anything that day ; because he thought , “ Something has happened to him , he is unclean . Yes , that ’ s it , he isn ’ t clean. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	27	The day after Rosh-Hodesh , the second day , David ’ s place was empty ; and Sha ’ ul said to Y ’ honatan his son , “ Why hasn ’ t Yishai ’ s son come to the meal either yesterday or today ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	28	Y ’ honatan answered Sha ’ ul , “ David begged me to let him go to Beit-Lechem .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	29	He said , ‘ Please let me go , because our family has a sacrifice in the city , and my brother demanded that I come . So now , if you look on me favorably , please let me get away and see my brothers. ’ That ’ s why he hasn ’ t come to the king ’ s table. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	30	At that Sha ’ ul flew into a rage at Y ’ honatan and said , “ You crooked rebel ! Don ’ t I know that you ’ ve made this son of Yishai your best friend ? You don ’ t care that you ’ re shaming yourself and dishonoring your mother , do you ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	31	Because as long as the son of Yishai lives on this earth , neither you nor your kingdom will be secure . Now send and bring him here to me — he deserves to die. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	32	Y ’ honatan answered Sha ’ ul his father , “ Why should he be put to death ? What has he done ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	33	But Sha ’ ul threw his spear at him , aiming to kill ; Y ’ honatan could no longer doubt that his father was determined to put David to death .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	34	Y ’ honatan got up from the table in a fury , and he ate no food the second day of the month , both because he was upset over David and because his father had put him to shame .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	35	The next morning Y ’ honatan went out into the country at the time he had arranged with David , taking with him a young boy .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	36	He told the boy , “ Now run and find the arrows I ’ m about to shoot. ” As the boy ran , he shot an arrow beyond him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	37	When the boy reached the place where the arrow was that Y ’ honatan had shot , Y ’ honatan shouted at the boy , “ Isn ’ t the arrow beyond you ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	38	Y ’ honatan continued shouting after the boy , “ Quick ! Hurry ! Don ’ t just stand there ! ” Y ’ honatan ’ s boy gathered the arrows and returned to his master ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	39	but the boy didn ’ t understand anything about the matter — only Y ’ honatan and David understood .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	40	Y ’ honatan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him , “ Go , carry them to the city. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	41	As soon as the boy had gone , David got up from a place south of the stone , fell face down on the ground and prostrated himself three times ; and they kissed one another and wept each with the other until it became too much for David .
CJB	1%20Samuel	20	42	Y ’ honatan said to David , “ Go in peace ; because we have sworn , both of us , in the name of Adonai , that Adonai will be between me and you , and between my descendants and yours , forever . ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	1	) David went to see Achimelekh the cohen in Nov. Achimelekh came trembling to meet David and asked , “ Why are you alone ? Why is no one with you ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	21	( 20:42b ) So David got up and left , and Y ’ honatan went back to the city .
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	2	) David said to Achimelekh the cohen , “ The king has sent me on a mission and told me not to let anyone know its purpose or what I ’ ve been ordered to do . I ’ ve arranged a place where the guards are to meet me .
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	3	) Now , what do you have on hand ? If you can spare five loaves of bread , give them to me , or whatever there is. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	4	) The cohen answered David , “ I don ’ t have any regular bread ; however , there is consecrated bread — but only if the guards have abstained from women .
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	5	) David answered the cohen , “ Of course women have been kept away from us , as on previous campaigns . Whenever I go out on campaign , the men ’ s gear is clean , even if it ’ s an ordinary trip . How much more , then , today , when they will be putting something consecrated in their packs ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	6	) So the cohen gave him consecrated bread , because there was no bread there other than the showbread that had been removed from before Adonai to be replaced by freshly baked bread on the day the old bread was removed .
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	7	) One of the servants of Sha ’ ul happened to be there that day , detained before Adonai . His name was Do ’ eg the Edomi , the head of Sha ’ ul ’ s shepherds .
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	8	) David said to Achimelekh , “ Perhaps you have here with you a spear or a sword ? I brought neither my sword nor my other weapons , because the king ’ s mission was urgent. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	9	) The cohen said , “ The sword of Golyat the P ’ lishti you killed in the Elah Valley , is over there behind the ritual vest , wrapped in a cloth . If you want it , take it ; it ’ s the only one here. ” David said , “ There ’ s nothing like it ; give it to me. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	10	) The same day , David took flight from Sha ’ ul and went to Akhish king of Gat .
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	11	) The servants of Akhish said to him , “ Isn ’ t this David , king of the land ? Weren ’ t they dancing and singing to each other , ‘ Sha ’ ul has killed his thousands , but David his tens of thousands ’ ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	12	) These remarks were not lost on David , and he became very much afraid of Akhish king of Gat .
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	13	) So , as they were watching , he changed his behavior and acted like a madman when they had hold of him , scratching marks on the doors of the city gate and drooling down his beard .
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	14	) Akhish said to his servants , “ Here , you see that the man is meshugga ; why bring him to me ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	15	) Am I short of meshugga ‘ im ? Is that why you ’ ve brought this one to go crazy on me ? Must I have this one in my house ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	21	16	(
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	22	David said to Avyatar , “ I knew it ! That day , when Do ’ eg the Edomi was there , I knew he would tell Sha ’ ul . I caused the death of every person in your father ’ s family .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	2	Then all the people in distress , in debt or embittered began gathering around him , and he became their leader ; there were about four hundred with him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	3	David went from there to Mitzpeh of Mo ’ av and said to the king of Mo ’ av , “ Please let my father and mother come and stay with you until I know what God will do for me. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	4	He presented them to the king of Mo ’ av , and they lived with him as long as David remained in his stronghold .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	5	But the prophet Gad said to David , “ Don ’ t stay in the stronghold . Leave , and go to the land of Y ’ hudah. ” So David left and went to the Forest of Heret .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	6	Sha ’ ul heard that David and the men with him had been located . Sha ’ ul was sitting in Giv ‘ ah , under the tamarisk tree on the hill , with his spear in his hand and all his servants standing around him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	7	Sha ’ ul said to his servants standing around him , “ Listen , you men of Binyamin ! Is Yishai ’ s son going to give any of you fields and vineyards ? Is he going to make you all commanders of thousands and hundreds ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	8	Is this why you have all conspired against me , why none of you told me when my son went in league with Yishai ’ s son ? None of you is concerned about me ! Otherwise you would have told me that my son had incited my servant to become my enemy , as he is now. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	9	Then Do ’ eg the Edomi , who had been put in charge of Sha ’ ul ’ s servants , answered , “ I saw Yishai ’ s son come to Nov , to Achimelekh the son of Achituv .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	10	He consulted Adonai for him , gave him food and gave him the sword of Golyat the P ’ lishti. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	11	The king sent to summon Achimelekh the cohen the son of Achituv , along with all his father ’ s family , the cohanim in Nov ; and all of them went to the king .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	12	Sha ’ ul said , “ Listen here , you son of Achituv ! ” He answered , “ Here I am , my lord. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	13	Sha ’ ul said to him , “ Why did you conspire against me , you and Yishai ’ s son ? By giving him bread and a sword and consulting God for him , you helped him rebel against me and become my enemy , which he now is ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	14	Achimelekh answered the king , “ Is there anyone among all your servants more trustworthy than David ? He ’ s the king ’ s son-in-law , he carries out your every request , your household honors him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	15	I didn ’ t start consulting God for him just today . Heaven forbid ! The king shouldn ’ t accuse me or my father ’ s family of anything ! Your servant knows nothing at all about any of this ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	16	But the king said , “ You must die , you and your father ’ s whole family. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	17	Then the king told the guards standing around him , “ Go around , and kill the cohanim of Adonai , because they are siding with David , and because they knew he was escaping , yet they didn ’ t tell me. ” But the king ’ s servants refused to lift their hands against the cohanim of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	18	So the king said to Do ’ eg , “ You go around and kill the cohanim ! ” Do ’ eg the Edomi went around and fell on the cohanim ; that day he killed eighty-five persons wearing linen ritual vests .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	19	He also attacked Nov , the city of the cohanim , with the sword ; he put to the sword both men and women , children and babies , cattle , donkeys and sheep .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	20	One of the sons of Achimelekh the son of Achituv , named Avyatar , escaped and fled to join David .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	21	Avyatar told David that Sha ’ ul had killed the cohanim of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Samuel	22	23	Stay with me ; don ’ t be afraid ; because the one who is seeking my life seeks yours too . You ’ ll be safe with me . ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	23	So look closely , find out where all his hiding-places are , and come back when you ’ re sure . Then I will go with you , and if he is there in that territory , I ’ ll search till I find him among all the thousands of Y ’ hudah. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	2	David consulted Adonai , asking , “ Should I go and attack these P ’ lishtim ? ” Adonai answered David , “ Go , and attack the P ’ lishtim , and save Ke ‘ ilah. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	3	David ’ s men said to him , “ Look , we ’ re already afraid here in Y ’ hudah . How much more , then , if we go to Ke ‘ ilah to fight the armies of the P ’ lishtim ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	4	David consulted Adonai again ; and Adonai answered him , “ Set out , and go down to Ke ‘ ilah , because I will hand the P ’ lishtim over to you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	5	David and his men went to Ke ‘ ilah and fought the P ’ lishtim . They defeated them in a great slaughter and led away their livestock . Thus David saved the inhabitants of Ke ‘ ilah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	6	When Avyatar the son of Achimelekh fled to David in Ke ‘ ilah , he had brought a ritual vest with him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	7	Now Sha ’ ul , on being informed that David had gone to Ke ‘ ilah , had said , “ God has put him into my hands . He ’ s trapped himself by entering a town with gates and bars. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	8	So Sha ’ ul summoned all the people to war , to go down to Ke ‘ ilah and besiege David and his men .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	9	David knew that Sha ’ ul was plotting something against him , so he told Avyatar the cohen , “ Bring the ritual vest here. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	10	Then David said , “ Adonai God of Isra ’ el , your servant has certainly heard that Sha ’ ul intends to come to Ke ‘ ilah and destroy the city just to get me .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the men of Ke ‘ ilah turn me over to him ? Will Sha ’ ul come down , as your servant has heard ? Adonai God of Isra ’ el , please tell your servant ! ” Adonai said , “ He will come down. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	12	Then David asked , “ Will the men of Ke ‘ ilah hand me and my men over to Sha ’ ul ? ” Adonai said , “ They will hand you over. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	13	So David and his men , now around six hundred , got up , left Ke ‘ ilah and went wherever they could . It was told Sha ’ ul that David had escaped from Ke ‘ ilah , so he called off the expedition .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	14	David stayed in the desert strongholds , remaining in the hills of the Zif Desert . Sha ’ ul kept trying to find him , but God did not hand him over to him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	15	David saw that Sha ’ ul had mounted another expedition to seek his life . David was then at Horesh in the Zif Desert .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	16	Y ’ honatan Sha ’ ul ’ s son set out and went to David at Horesh to encourage him in God .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	17	He said to him , “ Don ’ t be afraid , because my father ’ s forces will not find you ; you will be king over Isra ’ el , and I will be second to you . Sha ’ ul my father knows this , too. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	18	Then the two of them made a covenant in the presence of Adonai , after which David stayed at Horesh and Y ’ honatan returned home .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	19	The people of Zif came to Sha ’ ul in Giv ‘ ah and said , “ David is hiding himself with us in the strongholds at Horesh , on Hakhilah Hill , south of Yeshimon .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	20	So now , king , since you ’ ve wanted so much to come down , come down ! Our part will be to turn him over to you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	21	Sha ’ ul said , “ May Adonai bless you for showing me compassion !
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	22	Please go and make still more certain exactly where he is and who has seen him there , because I ’ ve been told that he ’ s very tricky .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	24	They set out and went to Zif before Sha ’ ul . But David and his men had gone on to the Ma ‘ on Desert , in the ‘ Aravah south of Yeshimon .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	25	Sha ’ ul and his men went searching for him . David was told , so he came down to the rock and stayed in the Ma ‘ on Desert . When Sha ’ ul heard that , he pursued David in the Ma ‘ on Desert .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	26	Sha ’ ul went along one side of the mountain , while David and his men went along the other . David was hurrying to get away from Sha ’ ul , while Sha ’ ul and his men were trying to surround David and his men in order to capture them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	27	But then a messenger came to Sha ’ ul , saying , “ Hurry , come , because the P ’ lishtim are invading the country ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	23	28	So Sha ’ ul stopped chasing David and went to fight the P ’ lishtim . Therefore they called that place Sela-Hamachlekot [ rock of divisions ] .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	1	) When Sha ’ ul returned from pursuing the P ’ lishtim , he was told that David was in the desert at ‘ Ein-Gedi .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	24	( 23:29 ) From there David went up and lived in the strongholds of ‘ Ein-Gedi .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	2	) Sha ’ ul took three thousand men chosen from all Isra ’ el and went searching for David and his men on the cliffs where the mountain goats are .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	3	) Near some sheep pens along the way was a cave , and Sha ’ ul went inside to relieve himself . It happened that David and his men were sitting in the recesses at the back of the cave ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	4	) and David ’ s men said to him , “ Look ! The day has come that Adonai told you about when he said to you , ‘ I will turn your enemy over to you , and you will do to him whatever seems good to you. ’ ” Then David stole over unobserved and cut off the corner of Sha ’ ul ’ s cloak .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	5	) But after doing this , David felt remorse over cutting Sha ’ ul ’ s garment .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	6	) He said to his men , “ Adonai forbid that I should do such a thing to my lord , Adonai ’ s anointed , as raise my hand against him ! After all , he is Adonai ’ s anointed. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	7	) By saying this , David stopped his men and would not let them do anything to Sha ’ ul . Sha ’ ul got up , left the cave and went on his way .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	8	) Then David too got up and went outside the cave , where he called after Sha ’ ul , “ My lord the king ! ” When Sha ’ ul looked behind him , David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	9	) David said to Sha ’ ul , “ Why do you listen to people who say , ‘ David is out to harm you ? ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	10	) Here , today you have seen with your own eyes that Adonai put you in my power there in the cave . Some of my men said I should kill you , but I spared you ; I said , ‘ I won ’ t raise my hand against my lord , because he is Adonai ’ s anointed. ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	11	) Moreover , my father , look ! Here in my hand you see the corner of your cloak . By the fact that I only cut off a piece of your cloak and didn ’ t kill you , you can see and understand that I have no plan to do harm or rebel , and that I haven ’ t sinned against you — even though you are seeking every chance you get to take my life .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	12	) May Adonai judge between you and me , and may Adonai avenge me on you ! But I will not lay a hand on you —
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	13	) as the old saying has it , ‘ Out of the wicked comes wickedness , but I will not lay a hand on you. ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	14	) The king of Isra ’ el has come on a campaign — after whom ? Whom are you chasing ? A dead dog ! A single flea !
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	15	) Adonai be the judge ; let him decide between you and me . May he take my side and rescue me from your power ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	16	) After David had finished speaking to Sha ’ ul , Sha ’ ul said , “ Is that your voice , my son David ? ” Then Sha ’ ul cried out and wept ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	17	) and he said to David , “ You are more righteous than I , because you have treated me well , while I have been treating you badly .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	18	) You have made it clear to me today that you have done me good ; for when Adonai put my fate in your hands , you didn ’ t kill me .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	19	) A man finds his enemy and lets him go unharmed ? ! May Adonai reward you well for what you did to me today .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	20	) Now I ’ m certain that you will indeed become king , and that the kingship of Isra ’ el will be established in your hands .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	21	) So swear to me by Adonai that you will not kill my descendants after I die or blot out my name from my father ’ s family. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	22	) David swore to Sha ’ ul , and Sha ’ ul went home , but David and his men went back up to the stronghold .
CJB	1%20Samuel	24	23	(
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	25	Please ! My lord shouldn ’ t pay any attention to this worthless fellow Naval , because he ’ s just like his name — ‘ Naval ’ means ‘ boor , ’ and his boorishness stays with him . But I , your servant , did not see my lord ’ s men , whom you sent .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	2	Now there was a man in Ma ‘ on who had property in Karmel . He was very rich , having three thousand sheep and a thousand goats ; and he was shearing his sheep in Karmel .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	3	The man ’ s name was Naval , and his wife was named Avigayil . The woman was intelligent and attractive , but the man was surly and mean in his actions ; he belonged to the clan of Kalev .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	4	David , there in the desert , heard that Naval was shearing his sheep .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	5	David sent off ten young men with these orders : “ Go up to Naval in Karmel , and bring him greetings from me .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	6	Say , ‘ Long life and shalom to you , shalom to your household , and shalom to everything that is yours !
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	7	I ’ ve heard that you now have shearers . Your shepherds were with us [ for a while ] , we did them no harm , and they found nothing missing all the time they were in Karmel .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask your own men ; they ’ ll tell you . Therefore , receive my men favorably , since we have come on a festive day . Please give what you can to your servants and to your son David. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	9	On arrival , David ’ s men said all these things to Naval in David ’ s name . When they had finished ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	10	Naval answered David ’ s servants , “ Who is David ? Who is the son of Yishai ? There are many servants nowadays running away from their masters .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	11	Am I supposed to take my bread , my water and my meat that I slaughtered for my shearers and give it to men coming from who knows where ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	12	So David ’ s men turned around , went back and came and told him everything Naval had said .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	13	David said to his men , “ Buckle your swords on , all of you ! ” Each one buckled on his sword , David too ; and there went up after David about four hundred men , while two hundred stayed with the equipment .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	14	But one of Naval ’ s men told Avigayil his wife , “ David sent messengers from the desert to greet our master , and he flew on them in a rage ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	15	even though the men had been very good to us — they didn ’ t harm us , and we found nothing missing during the entire time we went with them , while we were out in the countryside .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	16	They served as a wall protecting us day and night all the time we were with them caring for the sheep .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	17	So now decide what you are going to do , for clearly harm is on its way to our master and all his household , but he ’ s so mean that no one can tell him anything. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	18	Avigayil wasted no time in taking
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	200	fig cakes , and having them loaded on donkeys .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	19	Then she said to her young men , “ Go on ahead of me , and I ’ ll come along after you. ” But she didn ’ t tell her husband Naval .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	20	She was riding her donkey down past the hiding-place in the mountain , when David and his men descended toward her , and she met them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	21	David had said , “ What a waste it has been guarding everything this fellow has in the desert , so that nothing of his was missing ! He has repaid me bad for good ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	22	Then he swore , “ May God do the same and more to David ’ s enemies if I leave alive even one male of everything he owns. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	23	When Avigayil saw David , she hurried to dismount from her donkey , fell on her face in front of David and bowed down to the ground .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	24	Having fallen at his feet , she said , “ It ’ s all my fault , my lord , all my fault ! Please let your servant speak in your ears , and listen to what your servant says .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	26	Therefore , my lord , as Adonai lives , and as you live , inasmuch as Adonai has kept you from the guilt of shedding blood and from taking vengeance into your own hands — therefore , may your enemies and anyone seeking your harm be [ as worthless ] as Naval .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	27	Meanwhile , let this present which your servant has brought to my lord be given to the men in my lord ’ s service .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	28	And please forgive the offense your servant has caused ; because Adonai will certainly establish my lord ’ s dynasty , for my lord fights Adonai ’ s battles , and nothing bad has been found in you all your life long .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	29	Even if someone comes along searching for you and seeking your life , your life will be bound in the bundle of life with Adonai your God . But the lives of your enemies he will fling away as if from the pouch of a slingshot .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	30	Then , when Adonai has done all the good to my lord that he has said about you and made you ruler over Isra ’ el ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	31	what happens here will not have become an obstacle to you or a cause for remorse to my lord , neither that you shed blood without cause nor that my lord took vengeance into his own hands . Finally , when Adonai has dealt well with my lord , then remember your servant. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	32	David said to Avigayil , “ Blessed be Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , who sent you today to meet me ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	33	and blessed be your tactfulness , and blessed be yourself for having kept me today from the guilt of shedding blood and taking vengeance into my own hands .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	34	For as Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , lives , who has kept me from harming you , if you hadn ’ t rushed to meet me , not even one male would have been left to Naval by morning ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	35	So David received from her what she had brought him , then said to her , “ Go up in peace to your home . I have listened to what you said and granted your request. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	36	Avigayil came to Naval ; there he was in his house , holding a feast fit for a king . He was in high spirits , because he was very drunk . So she told him nothing whatever until the next morning .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	37	In the morning , when he was sober and his wife told him what had happened , he had a stroke and became as motionless as a stone .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	38	Some ten days later Adonai struck Naval , and he died .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	39	When David heard that Naval was dead , he said , “ Blessed be Adonai for having taken my side in the matter of Naval ’ s insult and for having prevented his servant from doing anything bad . On the contrary , Adonai has caused Naval ’ s bad deeds to return on his own head. ” Then David sent a message that he wanted to make Avigayil his own wife .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	40	When David ’ s servants reached Avigayil in Karmel , they said to her , “ David has sent us to you to bring you to him to be his wife. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	41	She got up , bowed with her face to the ground , and said , “ Your servant is here to serve you , to wash the feet of my lord ’ s servants. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	42	Avigayil then hurried , set out and rode off on a donkey , with five of her female servants following her ; she went after David ’ s messengers ; and she became his wife .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	43	David also took Achino ‘ am of Yizre ‘ el ; both of them became his wives .
CJB	1%20Samuel	25	44	Meanwhile , Sha ’ ul had given Mikhal his daughter , David ’ s wife , to Palti the son of Layish , who came from Gallim .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	26	The people from Zif went to Sha ’ ul in Giv ‘ ah and said , “ David is hiding himself on Hakhilah Hill , across from Yeshimon. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	2	Then Sha ’ ul set out and went down to the Zif Desert with three thousand men chosen from Isra ’ el , to search for David in the Zif Desert .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	3	Sha ’ ul pitched camp on Hakhilah Hill , across from Yeshimon , near the road . David was staying in the desert , and he saw that Sha ’ ul was coming into the desert after him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	4	So David dispatched spies and determined that Sha ’ ul had definitely come .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	5	David set out and went to where Sha ’ ul had pitched his camp . He saw where Sha ’ ul and Avner the son of Ner , the commander of his army , were sleeping . Sha ’ ul was lying inside the barricade with the troops asleep all around him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	6	David said to Achimelekh the Hitti and Avishai the son of Tz ’ ruyah , Yo ’ av ’ s brother , “ Who will go down with me to Sha ’ ul in the camp ? ” Avishai said , “ I will go down with you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	7	So David and Avishai went to the soldiers by night . Sha ’ ul was lying there asleep inside the barricade . His spear was stuck in the ground next to his head , with Avner and the troops asleep all around him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	8	Avishai said to David , “ God has handed your enemy over to you today ; so now , please , let me pin him to the ground with just one stroke of the spear . I won ’ t strike him a second time. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	9	But David said to Avishai , “ Don ’ t destroy him ! Nobody can raise his hand against Adonai ’ s anointed without becoming guilty ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	10	David then added , “ As Adonai lives , Adonai will strike him down , or the day will come for him to die , or he will go down to battle and be swept away .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	11	Adonai forbid that I should raise my hand against Adonai ’ s anointed ! But now , we ’ ll take the spear by his head and the jug of water , and get out of here. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and the water jug from Sha ’ ul ’ s head and got away . Nobody saw or knew about it , and no one awoke , because they were all asleep — a deep sleep from Adonai had fallen over them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	13	David crossed to the other side and climbed to the top of the distant ridge , leaving a considerable space between them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	14	Then David called out to the troops and to Avner the son of Ner . “ Avner ! Aren ’ t you going to answer ? ” Avner answered , “ Who are you , calling to the king ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	15	David said to Avner , “ Aren ’ t you the brave one ! Who is there in Isra ’ el to compare with you ? So why haven ’ t you kept watch over your lord the king ? Someone came in to kill the king , your lord !
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	16	It ’ s not good , what you ’ ve done ! As Adonai lives , you deserve to die ; because you didn ’ t keep watch over your lord , Adonai ’ s anointed . And now , see where the king ’ s spear is , and the jug of water that was next to his head ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	17	Sha ’ ul recognized David ’ s voice and said , “ Is that your voice , my son David ? ” David said , “ It is my voice , my lord king ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	18	and continued , “ Why is my lord chasing his servant ? What have I done ? What evil am I planning ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	19	Please , now , may my lord the king hear what his servant is saying . If it is Adonai who has stirred you up against me , let him receive an offering . But if it ’ s human beings , then a curse on them before Adonai ! — because , as things stand today , they have driven me out , so that I can no longer share in Adonai ’ s inheritance — they ’ ve said , ‘ Go , serve other gods ! ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	20	Now don ’ t let my blood fall on the ground away from the presence of Adonai . The king of Isra ’ el has gone out in search of a single flea , as if he were hunting partridge in the mountains ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then Sha ’ ul said , “ I have sinned . Come back , my son David . I won ’ t harm you any longer , because you regarded my life as precious today . Yes , I have behaved like a fool . I was altogether in the wrong. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	22	David answered , “ Here is the king ’ s spear . Send one of the men over to bring it back .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	23	Adonai will give every person a reward suited to his uprightness and faithfulness . Adonai put you in my power today , but I would not raise my hand against Adonai ’ s anointed .
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	24	Look : just as I put great value on your life today , so may my life be given great value by Adonai . May he deliver me from every kind of trouble ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	26	25	Sha ’ ul answered David , “ Blessings on you , my son David ! No question that you will accomplish everything you set out to do ! ” So David went on his way , and Sha ’ ul returned to his place .
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	27	But David said to himself , “ One day Sha ’ ul will sweep me away . The best thing for me to do is to escape into the territory of the P ’ lishtim . Then Sha ’ ul will give up trying to find me here or there in Isra ’ el ’ s territory , and at last I ’ ll be free of him. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	2	So David set out with his six hundred men and passed on to Akhish the son of Ma ‘ okh , king of Gat .
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	3	David lived with Akhish , he and his men , each man with his household — including David with his two wives Achino ‘ am from Yizre ‘ el and Avigayil from Karmel , Naval ’ s widow .
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	4	Sha ’ ul was told that David had escaped to Gat , whereupon he stopped searching for him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	5	David said to Akhish , “ If you are now favorably disposed toward me , let me have a place to live in one of the cities in the countryside . Why should your servant live in the royal city with you ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	6	That very day Akhish gave him Ziklag , and that ’ s why to this day Ziklag belongs to the kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	7	After David had been living in the country of the P ’ lishtim for a year and four months ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	8	he and his men began going up and raiding the G ’ shuri , the Gizri and the ‘ Amaleki ( from ancient times these people had lived in the land in the direction of Shur , all the way to Egypt ) .
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	9	David would attack the land , leaving alive neither men nor women , but taking the sheep , cattle , donkeys , camels and clothing . Then he would return and go to Akhish .
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	10	Akhish would ask , “ Where were you raiding today ? ” and David would answer , “ Against the Negev of Y ’ hudah , ” or “ Against the Negev of the Yerachme ’ eli , ” or “ Against the Negev of the Keni. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	11	The reason David spared neither men nor women to be brought to Gat is that he thought , “ We don ’ t want them telling on us , saying , ‘ David did so-and-so. ’ ” That ’ s how he conducted his raids for as long as he lived in the country of the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	1%20Samuel	27	12	And Akhish believed him ; he said , “ David has caused his own people Isra ’ el to despise him utterly ; he will be my servant forever . ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	28	In due time the P ’ lishtim assembled their armies for war against Isra ’ el . Akhish told David , “ You know , of course , that you and your men will join me and the army in battle. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	2	David answered Akhish , “ I see that you already know what your servant will do. ” Akhish said to David , “ For that answer , I am making you my personal bodyguard for life. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	3	Now Sh ’ mu ’ el was dead ; all Isra ’ el had mourned him and buried him in his city , Ramah . Also Sha ’ ul had expelled from the land those who tell the future by communicating with the dead or with a demonic spirit .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	4	The P ’ lishtim assembled ; then they went and pitched camp at Shunem ; while Sha ’ ul gathered all Isra ’ el together and pitched camp at Gilboa .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	5	When Sha ’ ul saw the army of the P ’ lishtim , he became afraid — it struck terror in his heart .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	6	But when he consulted Adonai , Adonai didn ’ t answer him — not by dreams , not by urim and not by prophets .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	7	Then Sha ’ ul said to his servants , “ Try to find a woman who tells the future by communicating with the dead ; I want to go and consult with her. ” His servants answered him , “ Yes , there ’ s a woman in ‘ Ein-Dor who tells the future by communicating with the dead. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	8	So Sha ’ ul disguised himself by wearing different clothing , went with two men , came to the woman by night and said , “ Tell me the future , please . Bring up from the dead the person I name to you. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	9	The woman answered , “ Here , you know what Sha ’ ul did , how he expelled from the land those who tell the future by communicating with the dead or with a demonic spirit . Why are you trying to entrap me into causing my own death ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	10	But Sha ’ ul swore to her by Adonai , “ As Adonai lives , you will not be punished for doing this. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	11	Then the woman asked , “ Whom should I bring up for you ? ” He said , “ Bring up for me Sh ’ mu ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	12	When the woman saw Sh ’ mu ’ el , she let out a shriek . Then the woman said to Sha ’ ul , “ Why have you deceived me ? You yourself are Sha ’ ul ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	13	The king replied , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Just tell me what you see. ” The woman said to Sha ’ ul , “ I see a god-like being coming up out of the earth. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	14	He asked her , “ What does he look like ? ” She said , “ An old man is coming up ; he ’ s wearing a cloak. ” Sha ’ ul realized it was Sh ’ mu ’ el , so he bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	15	Sh ’ mu ’ el asked Sha ’ ul , “ Why have you disturbed me and brought me up ? ” Sha ’ ul answered , “ I ’ m very upset ; because the P ’ lishtim are making war against me ; and God has left me and doesn ’ t answer me any more , neither by prophets nor by dreams . This is why I ’ ve called you , so that you can let me know what to do. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	16	Sh ’ mu ’ el said , “ Why ask me , if Adonai has left you and become your enemy ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	17	Adonai has done for himself what he foretold through me — Adonai has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to your fellow countryman David ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	18	because you didn ’ t obey what Adonai said and execute his furious anger toward ‘ Amalek . That ’ s why Adonai is doing this to you today .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	19	Adonai is giving Isra ’ el as well as yourself over into the power of the P ’ lishtim , and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Adonai will hand over Isra ’ el ’ s army to the power of the P ’ lishtim. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	20	Sha ’ ul immediately fell full length on the ground and became terribly frightened because of what Sh ’ mu ’ el had said . He had no strength left in him , for he had eaten nothing all that day and night .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	21	The woman approached Sha ’ ul , saw that he was panic-stricken and said to him , “ Here , your servant listened to what you said ; I put my life in my hands and did what you requested me to do .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	22	Now therefore , please , you listen to what your servant says : let me put a little food in front of you ; then eat , so you will have some strength when you go on your way. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	23	But he refused and said , “ I won ’ t eat. ” Then his servants , together with the woman , urged him ; and he heeded what they said . He got up off the ground and sat on the bed .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	24	The woman had a fattened calf in the house ; she hurried to slaughter it ; then she took flour , kneaded it and baked matzah with it .
CJB	1%20Samuel	28	25	She served it to Sha ’ ul and his servants , and they ate . Afterwards , they got up ; and they went away that night .
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	29	The P ’ lishtim gathered all their army together at Afek , while Isra ’ el ’ s army pitched camp by the spring in Yizre ‘ el .
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	2	The leaders of the P ’ lishtim were passing by with their hundreds and thousands ; David and his men were bringing up the rear with Akhish .
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	3	The chiefs of the P ’ lishtim asked , “ What are these Hebrews doing here ? ” Akhish answered the chiefs of the P ’ lishtim , “ This is David , who was a servant of Sha ’ ul , king of Isra ’ el . He ’ s been with me now for well over a year , and I haven ’ t found anything wrong with him between the time he deserted to me and now. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	4	But the chiefs of the P ’ lishtim became angry and said to him , “ Have the man return and go back to the place you set aside for him . Don ’ t let him go into battle with us , because on the battlefield he might become our enemy . What better way could there be for him to get reconciled with his lord than by [ cutting off ] the heads of our men ?
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	5	This is David ! They used to dance and sing about him , ‘ Sha ’ ul has killed his thousands , but David his tens of thousands ’ ! ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	6	So Akhish summoned David and said to him , “ As Adonai lives , you have been upright ; and I myself would be more than pleased to have you go on campaign with me ; because I haven ’ t found anything wrong with you between the day you arrived and now . However , the chiefs don ’ t trust you .
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	7	Therefore , now , go on back ; and go in peace , so as not to do what appears bad to the chiefs of the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	8	David said to Akhish , “ But what have I done ? What have you found in your servant during the time I ’ ve been with you that disqualifies me from going and fighting against the enemies of my lord the king ? ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	9	Akhish answered David , “ I know that you are as good , from my point of view , as an angel of God . Nevertheless , the chiefs of the P ’ lishtim have said , ‘ He is not to go up with us to the battlefield. ’
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	10	So get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you ; and as soon as you are up and it gets light , leave. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	29	11	David got up early in the morning , he and his men , to leave and go back into the land of the P ’ lishtim ; while the P ’ lishtim continued up to Yizre ‘ el .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	30	to those in Hormah , to those in Kor- ‘ Ashan , to those in ‘ Atakh ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	2	and they had taken captive the women and everyone there , great and small . They hadn ’ t killed anyone but had carried them off as they went on their way .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	3	So when David and his men arrived at the city , there it was , burned down , with their wives , sons and daughters taken captive .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	4	Then David and the people with him cried aloud until they had no more power to cry .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	5	David ’ s two wives had been taken captive — Achino ‘ am from Yizre ‘ el and Avigayil the widow of Naval from Karmel .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	6	David was in serious trouble : the people were talking about stoning him to death , because all the people were in such deep grief , each man over his sons and daughters . But David strengthened himself in Adonai his God .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	7	David said to Avyatar the cohen , the son of Achimelekh , “ Please bring the ritual vest here to me. ” Avyatar brought the vest to David .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	8	Then David consulted Adonai . He asked , “ Should I go in pursuit of these raiders ? Will I catch up with them ? ” And [ Adonai ] answered him , “ Go in pursuit , because you will overtake them and recover everyone and everything. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	9	So David went , he and the six hundred men with him . They came to Vadi B ’ sor , where those who were to stay behind waited .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	10	Then David continued in pursuit with four hundred men , while two hundred too exhausted to cross Vadi B ’ sor stayed behind .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	11	They found an Egyptian in the countryside and brought him to David . They gave him some bread to eat and water to drink ;
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	12	they also gave him a lump of dried figs and two bunches of raisins . After eating , he revived ; because he hadn ’ t eaten anything or drunk any water for three days and nights .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	13	David asked him , “ To whom do you belong , and where are you from ? ” He answered , “ I ’ m an Egyptian boy , the slave of an ‘ Amaleki . My master abandoned me three days ago , because I got sick .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	14	We raided the Negev of the K ’ reti , the Negev of Y ’ hudah and the Negev of Kalev ; and we burned down Ziklag. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	15	David asked him , “ Will you lead me down to this raiding party ? ” He said , “ If you will swear by God to me that you won ’ t kill me or hand me back to my master , I will lead you down to the raiders. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	16	He led them down , and there they were , spread out all over the ground , eating , drinking and celebrating how much spoil they had taken from the territory of the P ’ lishtim and the territory of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	17	David attacked them from dawn until the evening of the next day . Not one of them escaped , except for
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	400	young men who jumped on camels and got away .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	18	David recovered all that the ‘ Amaleki had taken ; he also rescued his two wives .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	19	They found nothing missing , big or little — not sons , not daughters , not plundered goods or anything else they had taken — David brought it all back .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	20	David took all the flocks and herds and drove them ahead of their own livestock , announcing , “ This is David ’ s spoil. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	21	David came to where the two hundred men were who had been too exhausted to follow him , whom they had let stay at Vadi B ’ sor . They came out to meet David and the people with him . When David approached them he greeted them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	22	But some of the men who had gone with David were evil men , scoundrels ; and they said , “ They didn ’ t go with us , so we ’ re not giving them any of the property we ’ ve recovered . Each man can take his wife and children and leave. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	23	Then David said , “ No , my brothers , don ’ t do this with the goods Adonai has given us . He protected us , and he handed the raiding party over to us .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	24	Anyhow , no one agrees with you about this . No , the share of someone who stays with the equipment will be the same as the share of someone who goes out and fights — they will share equally. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	25	It has been that way from that day on ; he established it as a ruling for Isra ’ el to this day .
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	26	When David came to Ziklag , he sent some of the spoil to the leaders of Y ’ hudah who were his friends with a note , “ Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of Adonai. ”
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	27	He sent such gifts to those in Beit-El , to those in Ramot , to those in Yatir ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	28	to those in ‘ Aro ‘ er , to those in Sifmot , to those in Esht ’ moa ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	29	to those in Rakhal , to those in Yerachme ’ eli , to those in the cities of the Keni ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	30	31	to those in Hevron , and to all the places where David and his men had frequently visited .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	1	Samuel
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	31	Now the P ’ lishtim pressed their attack on Isra ’ el . The men of Isra ’ el fled before the P ’ lishtim , leaving their dead on Mount Gilboa .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	2	The P ’ lishtim pursued and overtook Sha ’ ul and his sons ; and the P ’ lishtim killed Y ’ honatan , Avinadav and Malkishua , the sons of Sha ’ ul .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	3	The fighting went hard against Sha ’ ul ; then the archers overtook and wounded him , so that he was in agony .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	4	Sha ’ ul said to his armor-bearer , “ Draw your sword and run me through with it . Otherwise these uncircumcised men will come , run me through and make sport of me. ” But his armor-bearer refused , he was too frightened . So Sha ’ ul took his sword and fell on it .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	5	When his armor-bearer saw that Sha ’ ul was dead , he too fell on his own sword and died with him .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	6	Thus Sha ’ ul , his three sons , his armor-bearer and all his men died that same day together .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	7	When the men of Isra ’ el who were on the other side of the valley and those who were on the far side of the Yarden saw that the men of Isra ’ el had fled and that Sha ’ ul and his sons were dead , they abandoned the cities and fled ; then the P ’ lishtim came and lived in them .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	8	The following day , when the P ’ lishtim came to strip the dead , they found Sha ’ ul and his three sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	9	They cut off his head , stripped off his armor and sent these all over the territory of the P ’ lishtim to carry the news to the temples of their idols and to the people .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	10	Then they put his armor in the temple for the ‘ ashtarot and fastened his body to the wall of Beit-Sh ’ an .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	11	When the people living in Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad heard what the P ’ lishtim had done to Sha ’ ul ,
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	12	all their warriors set out , traveling all night . They took the body of Sha ’ ul and the bodies of his sons off the wall of Beit-Sh ’ an , returned to Yavesh and burned them there .
CJB	1%20Samuel	31	13	Then they took their bones , buried them under the tamarisk tree in Yavesh and fasted seven days .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	2	On the third day , there came a man from Sha ’ ul ’ s camp with his clothes torn and earth on his head . He approached David , fell to the ground and prostrated himself .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	1	Sha ’ ul had died , and David had been two days in Ziklag after returning from the slaughter of the ‘ Amaleki .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	3	David said to him , “ Where are you coming from ? ” “ I escaped from the camp of Isra ’ el , ” he replied .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	4	“ Tell me , please , how did things go ? ” asked David . “ The people have fled the battle , ” he answered , “ and many of them are wounded or dead . Sha ’ ul and Y ’ honatan his son are dead too. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	5	David asked the young man who had told him this , “ How do you know that Sha ’ ul and Y ’ honatan his son are dead ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	6	The young man who had told him said , “ I happened to be on Mount Gilboa when I saw Sha ’ ul leaning on his spear . The chariots and cavalry were bearing down on him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	7	He looked behind him , saw me and called to me . I answered , ‘ Here I am. ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	8	He said to me , ‘ Who are you ? ’ and I answered , ‘ I ’ m an ‘ Amaleki ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	9	He said to me , ‘ I ’ m in agony , and I ’ m going to die , but I ’ m still alive . So please , stand next to me ; and kill me. ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	10	So I stood next to him and killed him , because I was sure he was so badly wounded that he couldn ’ t live . I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet on his arm and have brought them here to my lord. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	11	Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them , and likewise all the men who were with him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	12	They wailed and cried , and they fasted until evening for Sha ’ ul , for Y ’ honatan his son , for Adonai ’ s people and for the house of Isra ’ el ; because they had fallen by the sword .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	13	David said to the young man who had told him , “ Where are you from ? ” He answered , “ I ’ m the son of a [ resident ] foreigner , an ‘ Amaleki. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	14	David asked him , “ How is it that you weren ’ t afraid to raise your hand to destroy Adonai ’ s anointed ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	15	David called one of his young men and said , “ Go over to him , and kill him. ” The man struck him down , and he died .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	16	David said to him , “ Your blood is on your own head . Your own mouth convicted you when you said , ‘ I killed Adonai ’ s anointed. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	17	Then David pronounced this lament over Sha ’ ul and over Y ’ honatan his son ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	18	in order to teach the people of Y ’ hudah [ not to underestimate ] archery ( the lament has been written down in the book of Yashar ) :
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	19	“ Your glory , Isra ’ el , lies dead on your high places ! How the heroes have fallen !
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	20	Don ’ t speak of it in Gat ; don ’ t proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon ; then the daughters of the P ’ lishtim won ’ t rejoice , the daughters of the uncircumcised won ’ t gloat .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	21	“ Mountains of Gilboa — may there be on you no dew , no rain , no fields with good crops ; because there the shields of the heroes were dishonored , the shield of Sha ’ ul was no longer rubbed with oil .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	22	“ From the blood of the dead , from the flesh of heroes , the bow of Y ’ honatan did not retreat or the sword of Sha ’ ul return unsatisfied .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	23	Sha ’ ul and Y ’ honatan , loved and gracious while alive , were not separated even in death ; they were swifter than eagles , stronger than lions .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	24	“ Daughters of Isra ’ el , weep over Sha ’ ul ! He clothed you luxuriously in scarlet and put gold jewelry on your clothing .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	25	“ How the heroes have fallen in the heat of battle , Y ’ honatan killed on your high places !
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	26	I grieve for you , my brother Y ’ honatan , you meant so much to me ! Your love for me was deeper than the love of women .
CJB	2%20Samuel	1	27	How the heroes have fallen and the weapons of war perished ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	2	So David went up there with his two wives Achino ‘ am from Yizre ‘ el and Avigayil the widow of Naval from Karmel .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	3	David brought the men up with him , each with his household ; and they lived in the cities of Hevron .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	4	Then the men of Y ’ hudah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Y ’ hudah . They informed David that the men of Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad were the ones who had buried Sha ’ ul .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	5	So David sent messengers to the men of Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad with this message : “ May you be blessed by Adonai , because you showed this kindness to your lord , Sha ’ ul , and buried him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	6	Now may Adonai show kindness and truth to you ; and I too will show you favor because you have done this .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	7	Be strong , and be brave . Sha ’ ul your lord is dead , but the house of Y ’ hudah have anointed me king over them. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	8	Avner the son of Ner , commander of Sha ’ ul ’ s army , had taken Ish-Boshet the son of Sha ’ ul , brought him over to Machanayim ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	9	and made him king over Gil ‘ ad , the Ashuri , Yizre ‘ el , Efrayim , Binyamin and all Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	10	Ish-Boshet the son of Sha ’ ul was forty years old when he began to rule over Isra ’ el , and he ruled for two years . But the house of Y ’ hudah followed David .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	11	David was king in Hevron over the house of Y ’ hudah for seven years and six months .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	12	Avner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-Boshet the son of Sha ’ ul went out from Machanayim to Giv ‘ on ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	13	while Yo ’ av the son of Tz ’ ruyah and David ’ s servants also went out ; and they met together by the pool at Giv ‘ on . One group sat down on one side of the pool and the other on the other side .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	14	Avner said to Yo ’ av , “ If it ’ s all right with you , let ’ s have the young men get up and fight it out between themselves , while we watch. ” Yo ’ av said , “ Yes , let them. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	15	So they got up and paired off , twelve for Binyamin and Ish-Boshet the son of Sha ’ ul , and twelve of David ’ s servants .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	16	Each one grabbed his partner by the head and drove his sword into his side , so that they fell down together . For this reason that place was named Helkat-Hatzurim [ field of blades ] ; it is in Giv ‘ on .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	17	The battle that day was very fierce ; Avner and the men of Isra ’ el were beaten by David ’ s servants .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	18	The three sons of Tz ’ ruyah were there , Yo ’ av , Avishai and ‘ Asah ’ el . ‘ Asah ’ el was as fleet-footed as a gazelle in an open field .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	19	‘ Asah ’ el chased Avner , going straight for him , veering neither right nor left .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	20	Avner looked behind him and asked , “ Is that you , ‘ Asah ’ el ? ” “ Yes , it is , ” he answered .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	21	Avner said to him , “ Turn off to your right or your left , catch one of the young men and take his armor. ” But ‘ Asah ’ el wouldn ’ t turn aside and kept following him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	22	Avner said again to ‘ Asah ’ el , “ Turn aside and stop following me ! Why should I kill you ? If I did , how could I look your brother Yo ’ av in the eye ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	23	But he still refused to turn aside ; so Avner stabbed him in the groin with the back end of the spear , so that the shaft protruded behind him . He fell down and died on the spot . Everyone who came to the place where ‘ Asah ’ el lay dead stopped there .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	24	Yo ’ av and Avishai continued in pursuit of Avner ; the sun went down when they arrived at Amah Hill , across from Giach along the Giv ‘ on Desert road .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	25	The people of Binyamin gathered themselves together into a phalanx behind Avner and stood on top of a hill .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	26	Then Avner called out to Yo ’ av , “ Must the sword go on devouring forever ? Don ’ t you know that in the end it can produce only bitterness ? How long will it be , then , before you tell the people to quit pursuing their brothers ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	27	Yo ’ av said , “ As God lives , if you hadn ’ t said something , there is no doubt that the people would have kept following their brothers all night long. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	28	Then Yo ’ av sounded the shofar , and with that the people halted . They stopped pursuing Isra ’ el , and they stopped fighting .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	29	Avner and his men went through the ‘ Aravah all that night ; they crossed the Yarden , went through all of Bitron and arrived at Machanayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	30	Yo ’ av returned from following Avner . When he brought the troops together for review , nineteen of David ’ s servants were missing , along with ‘ Asah ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	31	But David ’ s servants had killed
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	360	of Avner ’ s men of Binyamin .
CJB	2%20Samuel	2	32	They took ‘ Asah ’ el and buried him in his father ’ s tomb in Beit-Lechem . Then Yo ’ av and his men marched all night , so that they reached Hevron at daybreak .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	2	Sons were born to David in Hevron . His firstborn was Amnon , whose mother was Achino ‘ am from Yizre ‘ el ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	3	his second , Kil ’ av , whose mother was Avigayil the widow of Naval from Karmel ; the third , Avshalom , whose mother was Ma ‘ akhah the daughter of Talmai king of G ’ shur ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	4	the fourth , Adoniyah the son of Haggit ; the fifth , Sh ’ fatyah the son of Avital ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	5	and the sixth , Yitre ‘ am , whose mother was ‘ Eglah David ’ s wife . These were born to David in Hevron .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	6	During the war that was going on between the house of Sha ’ ul and the house of David , Avner strengthened his position in the house of Sha ’ ul .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	7	Sha ’ ul had had a concubine named Ritzpah , the daughter of Ayah ; and [ Ish-Boshet ] challenged Avner : “ Why did you go and sleep with my father ’ s concubine ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	8	These words of Ish-Boshet ’ s enraged Avner . “ What am I , ” he shouted , “ [ that you treat me with such contempt ] ? A dog ’ s head in Y ’ hudah ? Till this moment I have shown only kindness to the house of Sha ’ ul your father , and to his brothers and to his friends ; and I haven ’ t handed you over to David . Yet you choose today to pick a fight with me over this woman !
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	9	May God bring terrible curses on Avner and worse ones yet if I don ’ t accomplish what Adonai swore to David —
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Sha ’ ul and set up the throne of David over Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah , from Dan all the way to Be ’ er-Sheva ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	11	Ish-Boshet couldn ’ t answer Avner a word , because he was afraid of him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	12	Avner immediately sent envoys to David with this message : “ Who is going to control the land ? If you make yourself my ally , I will use my power to bring all Isra ’ el over to you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	13	David sent this reply : “ Very well , I will be your ally — on one condition : you will not come into my presence unless at the same time you bring with you Mikhal Sha ’ ul ’ s daughter. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	14	David sent messengers to say to Ish-Boshet the son of Sha ’ ul , “ Give me back my wife Mikhal . I betrothed her to myself for
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	100	foreskins of the P ’ lishtim. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	15	Ish-Boshet sent and took her from her husband Palti ’ el the son of Layish .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	16	Her husband went with her , crying as he went , and followed her to Bachurim . But when Avner told him , “ Go back , ” he returned .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	17	Then Avner conferred with the leaders of Isra ’ el . He said , “ In the past , you wanted David to be king over you .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	18	So now , do it . For Adonai has said of David , ‘ Through my servant David I will rescue my people Isra ’ el from the power of the P ’ lishtim and from the power of all their enemies. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	19	Avner also spoke with the people of Binyamin . Then Avner went to Hevron and reported to David everything that had been agreed to by Isra ’ el and the house of Binyamin .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	20	When Avner came to David in Hevron he brought twenty men with him . David held a feast for Avner and his men .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	21	Avner said to David , “ I must get up and go to gather all Isra ’ el to my lord the king , so that they can make a covenant with you . Then you will be able to rule over everything your heart desires. ” David sent Avner off , giving him safe conduct .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	22	Just then David ’ s men and Yo ’ av returned from a raid , bringing a lot of plunder with them . But Avner was not with David in Hevron , because he had sent him off under safe conduct .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	23	When Yo ’ av and all his army had arrived , Yo ’ av was told , “ Avner the son of Ner came to the king , but he sent him off , and he has left under safe conduct. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	24	Yo ’ av went to the king and said , “ What have you done ? Here , Avner came to you , and you sent him away , and now he ’ s gone ! Why ?
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	25	You know Avner the son of Ner — he came only to deceive you , to learn what campaigns you ’ re planning and to find out everything you ’ re doing ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	26	After leaving David , Yo ’ av sent messengers after Avner , and they brought him back from the water cistern at Sirah without David ’ s knowledge .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	27	Upon Avner ’ s return to Hevron , Yo ’ av took him aside into the space between the outer and inner city gates as if to speak with him privately ; and there he struck him in the groin , so that he died — thus avenging the death of ‘ Asah ’ el his brother .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	28	Afterwards , when David heard of it , he said , “ I and my kingdom are forever innocent of the death of Avner the son of Ner .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	29	Let it fall on the head of Yo ’ av and all his father ’ s family . May Yo ’ av ’ s family always have someone with a hemorrhage or tzara ‘ at , or who has to walk with a cane , or who dies by the sword or who lacks food. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	30	Thus Yo ’ av and Avishai his brother killed Avner , because he had killed their brother ‘ Asah ’ el during the battle in Giv ‘ on .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	31	But David said to Yo ’ av and all those with him , “ Tear your clothes , put on sackcloth , and mourn over Avner. ” King David himself walked behind the body as it was carried .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	32	They buried Avner at Hevron ; the king wept aloud at Avner ’ s grave , and all the people wept .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	33	The king sang this lament over Avner : “ Should Avner have died like a thug ?
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	34	Your hands weren ’ t tied , your feet weren ’ t fettered ; you fell like one who falls at the hands of criminals. ” Then all the people wept over him more than ever .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	35	All the people came to David and tried to make him eat some bread while it was still daytime ; but David swore , “ May God bring terrible curses on me and worse ones yet if I taste bread or anything else until the sun goes down. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	36	All the people took note of this , and it pleased them ; whatever the king did pleased all the people .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	37	So that day , all the people and all Isra ’ el understood that the king had had no part in the killing of Avner the son of Ner .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	38	The king said to his servants , “ You realize that a leader , a great man , has fallen today in Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	3	39	Even though I have just been anointed king , I feel weak today ; and these men , the sons of Tz ’ ruyah , are too brutal for me . May Adonai repay the criminal as his crime deserves ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	2	Sha ’ ul ’ s son had two men who were captains of raiding parties , one called Ba ‘ anah and the other Rekhav , sons of Rimmon the Be ’ eroti , of the people of Binyamin ( for Be ’ erot is counted as part of Binyamin ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	4	Now Y ’ honatan the son of Sha ’ ul ’ s had a son , and he was lame in both legs . He had been five years old when the news about Sha ’ ul and Y ’ honatan came from Yizre ‘ el . His nurse had gathered him up and fled ; but as she was hurrying to get away , he fell and became lame . His name was M ’ fivoshet .
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	3	even though the Be ’ erotim fled to Gittayim and have lived as foreigners there to this day ) .
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	5	The sons of Rimmon the Be ’ eroti , Rekhav and Ba ‘ anah went and arrived during the heat of the day at the home of Ish-Boshet as he was taking his afternoon rest .
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	6	They went right into the house , as if they were coming to get wheat , and stabbed him in the groin ; then Rekhav and Ba ‘ anah his brother escaped .
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	7	They entered the house as he lay on his bed in his bedroom , stabbed him and killed him ; then they beheaded him , took his head and fled all night along the road through the ‘ Aravah .
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	8	They brought the head of Ish-Boshet to David in Hevron and said to the king , “ Here is the head of Ish-Boshet the son of Sha ’ ul your enemy , who wanted to take your life . Today Adonai has taken revenge on Sha ’ ul and his son for the sake of my lord the king. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	9	But David answered Rekhav and Ba ‘ anah his brother , the sons of Rimmon the Be ’ eroti , “ As Adonai lives , who has rescued me from every kind of difficulty ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	10	when someone told me , ‘ Here , Sha ’ ul is dead , ’ thinking to himself that he was bringing good news , I didn ’ t reward him for his news but seized him and killed him in Ziklag .
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	11	How much more , when criminals have killed an innocent man in his own house on his own bed , shouldn ’ t I hold you responsible for his death and rid the earth of you ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	4	12	David then gave the order to his men , and they put them to death , cutting off their hands and feet and hanging them up next to the pool at Hevron . But they took the head of Ish-Boshet and buried it in Avner ’ s grave at Hevron .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	2	In the past , when Sha ’ ul was king over us , it was you who led Isra ’ el ’ s military campaigns ; and Adonai said to you , ‘ You will shepherd my people Isra ’ el , and you will be chief over Isra ’ el. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	5	In Hevron he ruled over Y ’ hudah seven years and six months ; then in Yerushalayim he ruled thirty-three years over all Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	3	So all the leaders of Isra ’ el came to the king in Hevron , and King David made a covenant with them in Hevron in the presence of Adonai . Then they anointed David king over Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	4	David was thirty years old when he began his rule , and he ruled forty years .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	6	The king and his men went to Yerushalayim to attack the Y ’ vusi , the inhabitants of that region . They taunted David , “ You won ’ t get in here ! Even the blind and the lame could fend you off ! ” — in other words , they were thinking , “ David will never get in here. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	7	Nevertheless , David captured the stronghold of Tziyon , also known [ now ] as the City of David .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	8	What David said on that day was , “ In order to attack the Y ’ vusi , you have to climb up [ from the spring outside the city ] through the water tunnel . Then you can do away with those [ so-called ] ‘ lame and blind ’ ” ( whom David despises — hence the expression , “ The ‘ blind and lame ’ keep him from entering the house ” ) .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	9	David lived in the stronghold and called it the City of David . Then David built up the city around it , starting at the Millo [ earth rampart ] and working inward .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	10	David grew greater and greater , because Adonai the God of Armies was with him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	11	Hiram king of Tzor sent envoys to David with cedar logs , and with them were carpenters and stonemasons ; and they built David a palace .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	12	David then knew that Adonai had set him up as king over Isra ’ el and increased his royal power for the sake of his people .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	13	David took for himself more concubines and wives in Yerushalayim after coming from Hevron , so that still more sons and daughters were born to David .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	14	Here are the names of those born to him in Yerushalayim : Shamua , Shovav , Natan , Shlomo ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	15	Yivchar , Elishua , Nefeg , Yafia ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	16	Elishama , Elyada and Elifelet .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	17	When the P ’ lishtim heard that David had been anointed king over Isra ’ el , all the P ’ lishtim went up in search of David . On learning of it , David went down to the stronghold .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	18	The P ’ lishtim came and deployed in the Refa ’ im Valley .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	19	David consulted Adonai , asking , “ Should I attack the P ’ lishtim ? Will you hand them over to me ? ” Adonai answered David , “ Attack ; I will certainly hand the P ’ lishtim over to you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	20	So David went to Ba ‘ al-P ’ ratzim and defeated them there . He said , “ Adonai has broken through my enemies for me like a river breaking through its banks. ” This is why he called the place Ba ‘ al-P ’ ratzim [ Lord of breaking through ] .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	21	The P ’ lishtim had left their idols there , so David and his men took them away .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	22	The P ’ lishtim came up again and deployed in the Refa ’ im Valley .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	23	When David consulted Adonai , he said , “ Don ’ t attack ! Circle behind them , and engage them opposite the balsam trees .
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	24	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees , advance ; because then Adonai has gone out ahead of you to defeat the army of the P ’ lishtim. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	5	25	David did exactly as Adonai had ordered him to do and pursued his attack on the P ’ lishtim from Geva all the way to Gezer .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	2	Then David , taking along the entire force he had with him then , set out for Ba ‘ alei-Y ’ hudah to bring up from there the ark of God , which bears the Name , the name of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot enthroned above the k ’ ruvim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	6	When they arrived at Nakhon ’ s threshing-floor , the oxen stumbled ; and ‘ Uzah put out his hand to steady the ark of God .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	3	They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Avinadav on the hill , with ‘ Uzah and Achyo , the sons of Avinadav , driving the new cart .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	4	They led it from the house of Avinadav on the hill , with the ark of God ; Achyo walked in front of the ark .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	5	David and the whole house of Isra ’ el celebrated in the presence of Adonai with all kinds of musical instruments made of cypress-wood , including lyres , lutes , tambourines , rattles and cymbals .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	7	But Adonai ’ s anger blazed up against ‘ Uzah , and God struck him down on the spot for his offense , so that he died there by the ark of God .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	8	It upset David that Adonai had broken out against ‘ Uzah ; that place has been called Peretz- ‘ Uzah [ breaking-out of ‘ Uzah ] ever since .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	9	David was frightened of Adonai that day ; he asked , “ How can the ark of Adonai come to me ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	10	So David would not bring the ark of Adonai into the City of David ; rather , David took it over to the house of ‘ Oved-Edom the Gitti .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	11	The ark of Adonai stayed in the house of ‘ Oved-Edom the Gitti for three months ; and Adonai blessed ‘ Oved-Edom and all his household .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	12	King David was told , “ Adonai has blessed the house of ‘ Oved-Edom and everyone who belongs to him , thanks to the ark of God. ” So David went and joyously brought the ark of God up from the house of ‘ Oved-Edom into the City of David .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	13	When those bearing the ark of Adonai had gone only six paces , he sacrificed an ox and a fattened sheep .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	14	Then David danced and spun around with abandon before Adonai , wearing a linen ritual vest .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	15	So David and all the house of Isra ’ el brought up the ark of Adonai with shouting and the sound of the shofar .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	16	As the ark of Adonai entered the City of David , Mikhal the daughter of Sha ’ ul , watching from the window , saw King David leaping and spinning before Adonai ; and she was filled with contempt for him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	17	They brought the ark of Adonai in and put it in its place inside the tent that David had set up for it . David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Adonai .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	18	When David had finished offering the burnt offering and peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	19	Then he distributed to all the people of Isra ’ el , to everyone there , both men and women , a loaf of bread , a portion of meat and a raisin cake , after which the people all left for their homes .
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	20	When David returned to bless his household , Mikhal the daughter of Sha ’ ul came out to meet him and said , “ Such honor the king of Isra ’ el earned for himself today — exposing himself before his servants ’ slave-girls like some vulgar exhibitionist ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	21	David answered Mikhal , “ In the presence of Adonai — who chose me over your father and over everyone in his family to make me chief over Adonai ’ s people , over Isra ’ el — I will celebrate in the presence of Adonai !
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	22	I will make myself still more contemptible than that , and I will be humiliated in my own eyes , but those slave-girls you mentioned will honor me ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	6	23	Mikhal the daughter of Sha ’ ul remained childless until the day she died .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	2	the king said to Natan the prophet , “ Here , I ’ m living in a cedar-wood palace ; but the ark of God is kept in a tent ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	7	Everywhere I traveled with all the people of Isra ’ el , did I ever speak a word to any of the tribes of Isra ’ el , whom I ordered to shepherd my people Isra ’ el , asking , “ Why haven ’ t you built me a cedar-wood house ? ” ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	3	Natan said to the king , “ Go , do everything that is in your heart , for Adonai is with you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	4	But that same night the word of Adonai came to Natan :
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	5	“ Go and tell my servant David that this is what Adonai says : ‘ You are going to build me a house to live in ?
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	6	Since the day I brought the people of Isra ’ el out of Egypt until today , I never lived in a house ; rather , I traveled in a tent and a tabernacle .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	8	“ Therefore say this to my servant David that this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ I took you from the sheep-yards , from following the sheep , to make you chief over my people , over Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	9	I have been with you wherever you went ; I have destroyed all your enemies ahead of you ; and I am making your reputation great , like the reputations of the greatest people on earth .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	10	I will assign a place to my people Isra ’ el ; I will plant them there , so that they can live in their own place without being disturbed any more . The wicked will no longer oppress them , as they did at the beginning ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	11	and as they did from the time I ordered judges to be over my people Isra ’ el ; instead , I will give you rest from all your enemies . “ ‘ Moreover , Adonai tells you that Adonai will make you a house .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	12	When your days come to an end and you sleep with your ancestors , I will establish one of your descendants to succeed you , one of your own flesh and blood ; and I will set up his rulership .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	13	He will build a house for my name , and I will establish his royal throne forever .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	14	I will be a father for him , and he will be a son for me . If he does something wrong , I will punish him with a rod and blows , just as everyone gets punished ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	15	nevertheless , my grace will not leave him , as I took it away from Sha ’ ul , whom I removed from before you .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	16	Thus your house and your kingdom will be made secure forever before you ; your throne will be set up forever. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	17	Natan told David all of these words and described this entire vision .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	18	Then David went in , sat before Adonai and said , “ Who am I , Adonai Elohim ; and what is my family , that has caused you to bring me this far ?
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	19	Yet in your view , Adonai Elohim , even this was too small a thing ; so you have even said that your servant ’ s dynasty will continue on into the distant future . This is [ indeed ] a teaching for a man , Adonai Elohim —
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	20	what more can David say to you ? For you know your servant intimately , Adonai Elohim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	21	It is for the sake of your word and in accordance with your own heart that you have done all this greatness and revealed it to your servant .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	22	Therefore , you are great , Adonai , God ; for there is no one like you , and there is no God besides you — everything we have heard confirms that .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	23	Who can be compared with your people , with Isra ’ el ? What other nation on earth did God set out to redeem and make into a people for himself ? You made yourself a reputation by doing for your land things that even for you are great and terrifying , for the sake of your people whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt and from other nations and from their gods .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	24	You set up your people for yourself as your people forever ; and you , Adonai , became their God .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	25	So now , Adonai , God , establish forever the word you have spoken to your servant and his house ; do what you have promised .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	26	May your name be magnified forever , so that it will be said , ‘ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is God over Isra ’ el , and the dynasty of your servant David will be set up in your presence. ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	27	You , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , God of Isra ’ el , have disclosed to your servant , ‘ I will build you a house. ’ This is why your servant has the courage to pray this prayer to you .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	28	Now , Adonai Elohim , you alone are God ; your words are truth ; and you have made this wonderful promise to your servant .
CJB	2%20Samuel	7	29	So may it please you to bless the family of your servant and thereby cause it to continue forever in your presence . For you , Adonai Elohim , have said it . May your servant ’ s family be blessed forever by your blessing . ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	2	He also defeated Mo ’ av ; making them lie down on the ground , he measured them with a length of cord ; for every two lengths to be put to death he designated one length to be kept alive . The people of Mo ’ av became subjects of David and paid tribute .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	8	From Betach and Berotai , cities of Hadad ‘ ezer , King David took a great quantity of bronze .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	3	David , on his way to establish his dominion as far as the Euphrates River , also defeated Hadad ‘ ezer the son of Rechov king of Tzovah .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	4	David captured 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers . He reserved enough horses for
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	100	chariots and disabled the rest .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	5	When people of Aram from Dammesek came to the aid of Hadad ‘ ezer king of Tzovah , David killed 22,000 men of Aram .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	6	Then David put garrisons among the people of Aram in Dammesek ; Aram became subject to David and paid tribute . Adonai gave victory to David wherever he went .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	7	David took the gold shields which Hadad ‘ ezer ’ s servants were wearing and brought them to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	9	When To ‘ i king of Hamat heard that David had defeated Hadad ‘ ezer ’ s entire army ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	10	To ‘ i sent Yoram his son to King David to greet and congratulate him on fighting and defeating Hadad ‘ ezer , for Hadad ‘ ezer had been at war with To ‘ i . Yoram brought with him articles of silver , articles of gold and articles of bronze ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	11	which King David dedicated to Adonai , along with the silver and gold that he dedicated from all the nations he conquered —
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	12	Aram , Mo ’ av , the people of ‘ Amon , the P ’ lishtim , ‘ Amalek , and the spoil taken from Hadad ‘ ezer son of Rechov , king of Tzovah .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	13	David gained more fame on returning from killing 18,000 men from Aram in the Salt Valley .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	14	David stationed garrisons in Edom ; he put garrisons throughout all of Edom , and all the people of Edom became subject to him . Adonai gave victory to David wherever he went .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	15	David ruled over all Isra ’ el ; David administered law and justice for all his people .
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	16	Yo ’ av the son of Tz ’ ruyah was commander of the army , Y ’ hoshafat the son of Achilud was chief adviser ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	17	Tzadok the son of Achituv and Achimelekh the son of Evyatar were cohanim , S ’ rayah was secretary ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	8	18	B ’ nayahu the son of Y ’ hoyada was in charge of the K ’ reti and P ’ leti [ serving as the king ’ s bodyguards ] , and David ’ s sons were cohanim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	2	In Sha ’ ul ’ s household there had been a servant named Tziva , and they summoned him to David . The king asked him , “ Are you Tziva ? ” and he answered , “ At your service. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	9	The king called to Tziva , Sha ’ ul ’ s servant , and said to him , “ I have given everything Sha ’ ul and his family owned to your master ’ s [ grand ] son .
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	3	The king said , “ Is there anyone still alive from the family of Sha ’ ul , to whom I can show God ’ s grace ? ” Tziva said to the king , “ There is still Y ’ honatan ’ s son with the lame legs. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	4	The king said to him , “ Where is he ? ” and Tziva answered , “ He ’ s there in the house of Makhir the son of ‘ Ammi ’ el , in Lo-D ’ var. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	5	King David sent and took him from the house of Makhir the son of ‘ Ammi ’ el in Lo-D ’ var .
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	6	M ’ fivoshet the son of Y ’ honatan , the son of Sha ’ ul , came to David , fell on his face and prostrated himself . David said , “ M ’ fivoshet ! ” and he answered , “ Here is your servant ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	7	David said to him , “ Don ’ t be afraid , for I am determined to be kind to you for the sake of Y ’ honatan your father . I will restore to you all the land of Sha ’ ul your [ grand ] father , and you will always eat at my table. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	8	He prostrated himself and said , “ What is your servant that makes you pay such attention to a dead dog like me ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	10	You are to work the land for him , you , your sons and your slaves . Harvest the crops , so that your master ’ s [ grand ] son will have food to feed his family ; but M ’ fivoshet your master ’ s [ grand ] son will always eat at my table. ” Tziva had fifteen sons and twenty slaves .
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	11	Tziva said to the king , “ Your servant will do everything my lord the king commands his servant , although M ’ fivoshet has been eating at my table as one of the king ’ s descendants. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	12	M ’ fivoshet had a young son whose name was Mikha . Everyone living in Tziva ’ s house was a servant of M ’ fivoshet .
CJB	2%20Samuel	9	13	But M ’ fivoshet lived in Yerushalayim ; he always ate at the king ’ s table , and he was lame in both legs .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	2	David said , “ I will show grace to Hanun the son of Nachash , as his father showed grace to me. ” So David sent his servants to pass him a message of comfort concerning his father . David ’ s servants entered the territory of the people of ‘ Amon ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	10	while the rest of the army he put under the command of Avishai his brother to deploy against the army of ‘ Amon .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	3	but the leaders of the people of ‘ Amon said to Hanun their lord , “ Do you really think David is honoring your father by sending people to comfort you ? Hasn ’ t David actually sent his servants to you in order to look the city over , reconnoiter it and overthrow it ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	4	So Hanun took David ’ s servants , shaved off half their beards , cut off their clothes halfway up , at their buttocks , and then sent them away .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	5	On hearing how they had been treated , David sent a delegation to meet them , because the men had been deeply humiliated . The king said , “ Stay in Yericho until your beards have grown back , and then return. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	6	Aware that they were utterly abhorrent to David , the people of ‘ Amon sent and hired 20,000 Aram foot soldiers from Beit-Rechov and Tzovah , the king of Ma ‘ akhah with 1,000 men , and 12,000 soldiers from Tov .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	7	When David heard of it , he sent Yo ’ av with his entire army of trained soldiers .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	8	The army of ‘ Amon came out and went into battle formation at the entrance to the city gate ; the men of Aram from Tzovah and Rechov and the men of Tov and Ma ‘ akhah were by themselves in the open countryside .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	9	When Yo ’ av saw that he would be fighting on two fronts , ahead and behind , he chose the best troops of Isra ’ el to deploy against Aram ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	11	He said , “ If Aram is too strong for me , you help me ; but if the army of ‘ Amon is too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	12	Take courage , and let ’ s be strong for the sake of our people and the cities of our God . May Adonai do what seems good to him. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	13	So Yo ’ av and the people with him went to battle Aram , and they fled before him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	14	When the people of ‘ Amon saw that Aram had fled , they likewise fled before Avishai and retreated into the city . Yo ’ av returned from the people of ‘ Amon and went to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	15	When Aram saw that Isra ’ el had gotten the better of them , they gathered themselves together .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	16	Hadad ‘ ezer sent and brought out the people of Aram who lived beyond the [ Euphrates ] River . They came to Heilam with Shovakh the commander of Hadad ‘ ezer ’ s army at their head .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	17	It was reported to David ; so he gathered all Isra ’ el together , crossed the Yarden and came to Heilam . Aram deployed themselves against David and fought him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	18	But Aram fled before Isra ’ el ; David killed
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	700	chariot-drivers and 40,000 horsemen from Aram , and he struck Shovakh the commander of their army , so that he died there .
CJB	2%20Samuel	10	19	When all Hadad ‘ ezer ’ s vassal kings saw that they had been defeated by Isra ’ el , they made peace with Isra ’ el and became their subjects . So Aram was afraid to help the people of ‘ Amon any more .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	2	Once , after his afternoon nap , David got up from his bed and went strolling on the roof of the king ’ s palace . From the roof he saw a woman bathing , who was very beautiful .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	11	Uriyah answered David , “ The ark , Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah stay in tents ; and my lord Yo ’ av and the servants of my lord are camping in the countryside . So should I go into my house to eat and drink and go to bed with my wife ? As surely as you live , I will not do such a thing ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	3	David made inquiries about the woman and was told that she was Bat-Sheva the daughter of Eli ‘ am , the wife of Uriyah the Hitti .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	4	David sent messengers to get her , and she came to him , and he went to bed with her ( for she had been purified from her uncleanness ) . Then she returned to her house .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	5	The woman conceived ; and she sent a message to David , “ I am pregnant. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	6	David sent this order to Yo ’ av : “ Send me Uriyah the Hitti. ” Yo ’ av sent Uriyah to David .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	7	When Uriyah had come to him , David asked him how Yo ’ av was doing , how the people were feeling and how the war was going .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	8	Then David said to Uriyah , “ Go down to your house and wash your feet. ” Uriyah left the king ’ s palace and was followed by a present of food from the king .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	9	But Uriyah slept at the door of the king ’ s palace with all the servants of his lord and didn ’ t go down to his house .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	10	When they told David , “ Uriyah didn ’ t go down to his house , ” David said to Uriyah , “ Haven ’ t you just arrived from a journey ? Why didn ’ t you go down to your house ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	12	David said to Uriyah , “ Stay here today also ; tomorrow I will let you leave. ” So Uriyah stayed in Yerushalayim that day and the following day .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	13	David summoned him , ate and drank with him , and got him drunk . But in the evening he went out and lay on his bed with his lord ’ s servants and did not go down to his house .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	14	In the morning David wrote a letter to Yo ’ av and sent it with Uriyah .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	15	In the letter he wrote , “ Put Uriyah on the front lines of the fiercest fighting ; then pull back from him , so that he will be wounded and killed. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	16	So while Yo ’ av had the city under siege , he assigned Uriyah to the place where he knew the toughest defenders were .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	17	The men of the city went out and fought Yo ’ av ; a number of people fell , including some of David ’ s servants , with Uriyah the Hitti among the dead .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	18	Yo ’ av sent a message to David reporting all the news concerning the war ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	19	and he instructed the messenger , “ When you have finished telling the king all the news about the war ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	20	he may become angry and ask you , ‘ Why did you get so close to the city to fight ? Didn ’ t you know they would shoot from the wall ?
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	21	Didn ’ t you think about the person who struck Avimelekh the son of Yerubeshet , that a woman threw an upper millstone down on him from the wall , so that he died at Tevetz ? Why did you go so near the wall ? ’ If he says this , tell him , ‘ Your servant Uriyah is dead also. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	22	So the messenger left , and on arrival he told David all that Yo ’ av had sent him to say .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	23	The messenger said to David , “ The men were overpowering us and came out after us into the countryside . But we chased them back all the way to the entrance of the city gate .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	24	The archers shot at your servants from the wall ; some of the king ’ s servants are dead ; also your servant Uriyah the Hitti is dead. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	25	David said to the messenger , “ Tell Yo ’ av , ‘ Don ’ t let this matter get you down — the sword devours in one way or another . Intensify your battle against the city , and overthrow it. ’ And encourage him. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	26	When the wife of Uriyah heard that Uriyah her husband was dead , she mourned her husband .
CJB	2%20Samuel	11	27	When the mourning was over , David sent and took her home to his palace , and she became his wife and bore him a son . But Adonai saw what David had done as evil .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	2	The rich man had vast flocks and herds ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	12	For you did it secretly , but I will do this before all Isra ’ el in broad daylight. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	3	but the poor man had nothing , except for one little ewe lamb , which he had bought and reared . It had grown up with him and his children ; it ate from his plate , drank from his cup , lay on his chest — it was like a daughter to him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	4	One day a traveler visited the rich man , and instead of picking an animal from his own flock or herd to cook for his visitor , he took the poor man ’ s lamb and cooked it for the man who had come to him. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	5	David exploded with anger against the man and said to Natan , “ As Adonai lives , the man who did this deserves to die !
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	6	For doing such a thing , he has to pay back four times the value of the lamb — and also because he had no pity. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	7	Natan said to David , “ You are the man . “ Here is what Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ I anointed you king over Isra ’ el . I rescued you from the power of Sha ’ ul .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	8	I gave you your master ’ s house and your master ’ s wives to embrace . I gave you the house of Isra ’ el and the house of Y ’ hudah . And if that had been too little , I would have added to you a lot more .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	9	“ ‘ So why have you shown such contempt for the word of Adonai and done what I see as evil ? You murdered Uriyah the Hitti with the sword and taken his wife as your own wife ; you put him to death with the sword of the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	10	Now therefore , the sword will never leave your house — because you have shown contempt for me and taken the wife of Uriyah the Hitti as your own wife. ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	11	Here is what Adonai says : ‘ I will generate evil against you out of your own household . I will take your wives before your very eyes and give them to your neighbor ; he will go to bed with your wives , and everyone will know about it .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	13	David said to Natan , “ I have sinned against Adonai. ” Natan said to David , “ Adonai also has taken away your sin . You will not die .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	14	However , because by this act you have so greatly blasphemed Adonai , the child born to you must die. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	15	Then Natan returned to his house . Adonai struck the child that Uriyah ’ s wife had borne to David , and it became very ill.
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	16	David prayed to God on behalf of the child ; David fasted , then came and lay all night on the ground .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	17	The court officials got up and stood next to him trying to get him off the ground , but he refused , and he wouldn ’ t eat food with them .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	18	On the seventh day , the child died . The servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead , because they said , “ While the child was still alive , we spoke to him , and he didn ’ t listen to us ; if we tell him now that the child is dead , he may do himself some harm. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	19	But when David saw his servants whispering to each other , he suspected that the child was dead . David asked his servants , “ Is the child dead ? ” and they answered , “ He is dead. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	20	Then David got up off the ground , washed , anointed himself and changed his clothes . He went into the house of Adonai and worshipped ; then he went to his own palace ; and when he asked for food , they served it to him ; and he ate .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	21	His servants asked him , “ What are you doing ? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive ; but now that the child is dead , you get up and eat food ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	22	He answered , “ While the child was still alive , I fasted and wept ; because I thought , ‘ Maybe Adonai will show his grace to me and let the child live. ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	23	But now that he ’ s dead , why should I fast ? Can I bring him back again ? I will go to him , but he will not return to me. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	24	David comforted his wife Bat-Sheva , came to her and went to bed with her ; she gave birth to a son and named him Shlomo . Adonai loved him
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	25	and sent through Natan the prophet to have him named Y ’ didyah [ loved by God ] , for Adonai ’ s sake .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	26	Yo ’ av fought against Rabbah of the people of ‘ Amon and took the royal city .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	27	Yo ’ av sent people to David with this message : “ I have fought against Rabbah and captured its water supply .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	28	Therefore , assemble the rest of the people ; lay siege to the city ; and capture it . Otherwise , I will capture the city ; and it will be named after me ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	29	David assembled all the people , went to Rabbah , fought against it and captured it .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	30	He took the crown off Malkam ’ s head ; it weighed sixty-six pounds , with its gold and precious stones ; and it was placed on David ’ s head . He carried off great quantities of spoil from the city .
CJB	2%20Samuel	12	31	In addition , he expelled the people who were in it and set them to work with saws , iron harrows and iron axes , or had them cross over to work in the brick factory . This is what he did to all the cities of the people of ‘ Amon . Then David and all the people returned to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	2	Amnon became so obsessed with his sister Tamar that he became ill , for she was a virgin , and Amnon thought it would be impossible to approach her .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	13	Where could I go with such shame ? And as for you , you will be regarded as one of Isra ’ el ’ s vulgar brutes . Now therefore , please ! Speak to the king , because he won ’ t keep me from you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	3	But Amnon had a friend named Yonadav the son of Shim ‘ ah David ’ s brother ; and Yonadav was a very shrewd fellow .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	4	He asked him , “ Why , son of the king , are you growing thinner every day ? Won ’ t you tell me ? ” Amnon answered him , “ I ’ m in love with Tamar , my brother Avshalom ’ s sister. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	5	Yonadav said to him , “ Lie down on your bed , and pretend you ’ re sick . When your father comes to see you , say to him , ‘ Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food to eat , and have her prepare the food where I can watch . I ’ ll eat what she serves me. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	6	So Amnon lay down and pretended he was sick . When the king came to see him , Amnon said to the king , “ Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes here where I can watch , and I ’ ll eat what she serves me. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	7	David sent this instruction home to Tamar : “ Go now to your brother Amnon ’ s house , and prepare him some food. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon ’ s house ; he was lying down . She took dough , kneaded it , made cakes while he watched , and baked the cakes .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	9	Then she took the pan and turned them out in front of him , but he refused to eat . Amnon said , “ Have everyone leave me ” ; and everyone left him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	10	Amnon said to Tamar , “ Bring the food into the room , so that I can have you serve me . Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	11	But when she brought them near , so that he could eat , he grabbed her and said to her , “ Come to bed with me , my sister. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	12	“ No , my brother , ” she answered him , “ don ’ t force me ! Things like this aren ’ t done in Isra ’ el ; don ’ t behave so disgracefully !
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	14	However , he wouldn ’ t listen to her ; and since he was stronger than she , he overpowered her and raped her .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	15	But then he was filled with utter revulsion for her — his hatred of her was even greater than the love he had had for her before . Amnon said to her , “ Get up , and get out of here ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	16	“ No , ” she objected , “ because throwing me out like this is an even worse thing than what you ’ ve already done to me ! ” But he wouldn ’ t listen to her ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	17	he called his personal servant and said , “ Get rid of this woman for me ! Throw her out , and lock the door after her ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	18	She was wearing a long-sleeved robe ( this was how they used to dress the king ’ s daughters who were virgins ) . His servant took her out and locked the door after her .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	19	Tamar put ashes on her head , tore her long-sleeved robe that she was wearing , laid her hand on her head and went off , crying aloud as she went .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	20	Avshalom her brother said to her , “ Has Amnon your brother been with you ? But now , my sister , keep quiet ; because he ’ s your brother . Don ’ t take the matter to heart. ” But Tamar remained desolate in her brother Avshalom ’ s house .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	21	When King David heard about all these things , he became very angry .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	22	As for Avshalom , he refused to say a word to Amnon , either good or bad ; for Avshalom hated Amnon for having raped his sister Tamar .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	23	Two years later , when Avshalom had sheep-shearers in Ba ‘ al-Hatzor , near Efrayim , Avshalom invited all the king ’ s sons .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	24	Avshalom went to the king and said , “ Your servant has sheep-shearers ; please let the king and his servants come along with your servant. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	25	The king replied to Avshalom , “ No , my son , let ’ s not all go — we don ’ t want to be a burden to you. ” Avshalom pressed him , but he wouldn ’ t go ; however he gave him his blessing .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	26	Then Avshalom said , “ If you won ’ t go , then please let my brother Amnon go with us. ” The king said to him , “ Why should he go with you ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	27	But Avshalom kept pressing him , so he let Amnon and all the king ’ s sons go with him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	28	Avshalom ordered his servants , “ Pay close attention : when Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine , and I say to you , ‘ Kill Amnon , ’ then strike him down . Don ’ t be afraid — I ’ m the one ordering you to do it — but take courage , and be bold. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	29	Avshalom ’ s servants did to Amnon as Avshalom had ordered . At this , all the king ’ s sons jumped up , mounted their mules and fled .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	30	While they were on their way , the news came to David that Avshalom had killed all the king ’ s sons , and not one of them was left alive .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	31	The king got up , tore his clothes and lay on the ground , while all his servants stood by with their clothes torn too .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	32	But then Yonadav , the son of Shim ‘ ah , David ’ s brother , spoke up ; he said , “ My lord shouldn ’ t think they have killed all the young men , the king ’ s sons . Only Amnon is dead ; for Avshalom has meant to do this ever since the day he raped his sister Tamar .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	33	So my lord the king shouldn ’ t take it as seriously as if all the king ’ s sons are dead ; only Amnon is dead. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	34	However , Avshalom took flight . The young man keeping watch looked up and saw many people coming along the road behind him on the hillside .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	35	Yonadav said to the king , “ Here , the king ’ s sons have come ; it ’ s just as your servant said. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	36	The moment he finished speaking , the king ’ s sons came , cried out and wept ; and the king too , with all his servants , cried out in great pain .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	37	Avshalom fled and went to Talmai the son of ‘ Ammihud , king of G ’ shur . David mourned for his son every day .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	38	So Avshalom fled , went to G ’ shur and stayed there three years .
CJB	2%20Samuel	13	39	But as King David became reconciled to the death of his son Amnon , he was increasingly filled with longing to see Avshalom .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	2	so Yo ’ av sent to T ’ koa , brought from there a clever woman and said to her , “ Please , pretend you ’ re a mourner . Put on mourning clothes , and don ’ t anoint yourself with oil , but appear to be a woman who has mourned for the dead a long time .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	14	For we will all die someday ; we ’ ll be like water spilled on the ground that can ’ t be gathered up again ; and God makes no exception for anyone . The king should think of some way to keep the son he banished from being forever an outcast .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	3	Go in to the king and speak to him in this fashion — ” and then Yo ’ av told her just what to say .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	4	When the woman of T ’ koa spoke to the king , she fell down with her face to the ground , prostrating herself , and said , “ King , help ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	5	The king said to her , “ What ’ s the trouble ? ” She answered , “ I ’ m a widow . After my husband died ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	6	my two sons were out in the field ; and they got into a fight with each other . There was no one to separate them , and one hit the other and killed him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	7	Now the whole family has come against me , your servant ; they ’ re saying , ‘ Hand over the one who hit his brother , so that we can put him to death for killing his brother. ’ They want to destroy the heir as well and thus quench my one remaining coal ; then my husband will have neither name nor survivor anywhere on earth. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	8	The king said to the woman , “ Go back home ; I myself will decide what to do about you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	9	The woman of T ’ koa said to the king , “ My lord , king , let the guilt be on me and my father ’ s family ; the king and his throne be guiltless. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	10	The king answered , “ If anyone says anything to you , bring him to me ; and he won ’ t bother you any more. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	11	“ Please , ” she said , “ let the king swear by Adonai your God that the blood avengers won ’ t do any more destroying , so they won ’ t destroy my son. ” He said , “ As Adonai lives , not one of your son ’ s hairs will fall to the ground. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	12	Then the woman said , “ Please allow your servant to say something else to my lord the king. ” “ Go on , ” he replied .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	13	The woman said , “ Why is it , then , that you have produced a situation exactly like this against God ’ s people ? By saying what you have said , the king has virtually incriminated himself — in that the king does not bring home again the son he banished .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	15	Now the reason I came to speak about this matter to my lord the king is that the people were intimidating me ; so your servant said , ‘ I will speak now to the king ; maybe the king will do what his servant is asking .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	16	For the king will listen and rescue his servant from the hands of those who would destroy me and my son together from our share of God ’ s inheritance. ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	17	Then your servant said , ‘ Please let my lord the king say something that will give me relief ; for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good from bad — and may Adonai your God be with you. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	18	The king then answered the woman : “ I ’ m going to ask you a question , and please don ’ t hide anything from me. ” The woman said , “ Let my lord the king now speak. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	19	The king asked , “ Did Yo ’ av put you up to this ? ” The woman answered , “ As you live , my lord the king , when my lord the king speaks , no one can avoid the issue by turning either right or left . Yes , it was your servant Yo ’ av who had me do this , and he put in my mouth every word you have heard your servant say .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	20	Your servant Yo ’ av did this in order to bring about some change in the situation . But my lord is wise , he has the wisdom of an angel of God when it comes to understanding anything going on in the land. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	21	The king said to Yo ’ av , “ All right , I am granting this request . Go , and bring back young Avshalom. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	22	Yo ’ av fell to the ground on his face , prostrating himself , and blessed the king ; Yo ’ av said , “ Today your servant knows that I have won your favor , my lord , king , because the king has done what your servant requested. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	23	Then Yo ’ av got up , went to G ’ shur and brought Avshalom to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	24	However , the king said , “ Let him return to his own house , but he is not to appear in my presence. ” So Avshalom returned to his own house and did not appear before the king .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	25	Now in all Isra ’ el there was no one more praised for his beauty than Avshalom — there was no defect on him from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	26	He would cut his hair only once a year , at the end of the year ; and the only reason he cut it then was because it weighed him down . He weighed the hair from his head at
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	200	shekels ( using the royal weight ) [ about five pounds ] .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	27	To Avshalom were born three sons and one daughter , whose name was Tamar ; she was a beautiful woman .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	28	Avshalom lived two years in Yerushalayim without appearing before the king .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	29	Then Avshalom summoned Yo ’ av , planning to send him to the king ; but he refused to come to him . He summoned him a second time , but he still wouldn ’ t come .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	30	So he said to his servants , “ See , Yo ’ av ’ s field is close to mine , and he has barley there ; go , and set it on fire. ” Avshalom ’ s servants set the field on fire .
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	31	Then Yo ’ av got up , went to Avshalom at his house and asked him , “ Why did your servants set my field on fire ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	32	Avshalom answered Yo ’ av , “ Look , I sent a message to you to come here , so that I could send you to the king to ask , ‘ Why did I come from G ’ shur ? It would have been better for me if I had stayed there . So now , let me appear before the king ; and if I ’ m guilty of anything , he can kill me. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	14	33	Yo ’ av went to the king and told him ; and when he had called for Avshalom , he went to the king and prostrated himself with his face to the ground before the king . Then the king kissed Avshalom .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	2	He would get up early and stand by the road leading to the city gate ; and if someone had a case that was to come before the king for judgment , Avshalom would call to him and ask , “ What city are you from ? ” and he would answer , “ Your servant is from the such-and-such tribe in Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	15	The king ’ s servants said to the king , “ Here , your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	3	Avshalom would say to him , “ Look , your cause is good and just ; but the king hasn ’ t deputized anyone to hear your case. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	4	Then Avshalom would continue , “ Now if I were made judge in the land , anyone with a suit or other cause could come to me , and I would see that he gets justice ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	5	Moreover , whenever any man came close to prostrate himself before him , he would put out his hand , take hold of him and kiss him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	6	This is how Avshalom behaved toward anyone in Isra ’ el who came to the king for judgment , and in this way Avshalom stole the hearts of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	7	At the end of forty years , Avshalom said to the king , “ Please let me go to Hevron and fulfill the vow I made to Adonai .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	8	Your servant made a vow while I was staying at G ’ shur in Aram to the effect that if Adonai would bring me back to Yerushalayim , then I would serve Adonai. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	9	The king said to him , “ Go in peace. ” So he set out and went to Hevron .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	10	But Avshalom sent spies through all the tribes of Isra ’ el to say , “ The moment you hear the sound of the shofar , then start proclaiming , ‘ Avshalom is king in Hevron. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	11	With Avshalom went
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	200	men from Yerushalayim who had been invited ; they went innocently , knowing nothing about the scheme .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	12	Avshalom sent for Achitofel the Giloni , David ’ s counselor , to come from his town Giloh and be with him while offering the sacrifices . The conspiracy grew strong , because the number of people favoring Avshalom kept increasing .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	13	A messenger came to David saying , “ The men of Isra ’ el have aligned themselves with Avshalom. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	14	David said to all his servants with him in Yerushalayim , “ Get up ! We must flee ! Otherwise none of us will escape from Avshalom . Hurry , and leave ; or he will soon overtake us , attack us and put the city to the sword. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	16	So the king set out , and all his household after him . The king left ten women who were concubines to care for the palace .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	17	The king set out with all the people after him , but they waited at the last house
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	18	for all his servants to pass by him in review ; all the K ’ reti and P ’ leti and all the Gittim (
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	600	men who had accompanied him from Gat ) passed in review before the king .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	19	Then the king said to Ittai the Gitti , “ You too ? Why are you going with us ? Go back , and stay with your king , since you are both a foreigner and in exile from your own place .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	20	You arrived only yesterday ; should I ask you to wander around with us ? There ’ s no telling where I may go . Return , and take your kinsmen back with you . Grace and truth be with you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	21	But Ittai answered the king , “ As Adonai lives , and as my lord the king lives , wherever my lord the king may be , whether for death or for life , your servant will be there too. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	22	“ Go , move along , ” said David to Ittai ; and Ittai the Gitti moved on , accompanied by all his men and the little ones with him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	23	The whole country wept and wailed as all the people left . When the king crossed Vadi Kidron , all the people crossed , too , heading toward the desert road .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	24	Tzadok also came , accompanied by all the L ’ vi ’ im bearing the ark for the covenant of God . They set the ark of God down , but Evyatar went up until all the people had finished leaving the city .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	25	The king said to Tzadok , “ Carry the ark of God back into the city . If I find favor in Adonai ’ s sight , he will bring me back and show me both it and the place where it is kept .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	26	But if he says , ‘ I am displeased with you , ’ then — here I am ; let him do to me whatever seems good to him. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	27	The king then said to Tzadok the cohen , “ Do you see ? Return to the city in peace , your two sons with you — Achima ‘ atz your own son and Y ’ honatan the son of Evyatar .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	28	I will wait on the desert plains until a message with new information comes from you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	29	So Tzadok and Evyatar carried the ark of God back to Yerushalayim and stayed there .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	30	David continued up the road to the Mount of Olives , weeping as he went up , head covered and barefoot ; and all the people with him had their heads covered and wept as they went up .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	31	One of them told David , “ Achitofel is among the conspirators with Avshalom. ” David said , “ Adonai , please ! Turn Achitofel ’ s advice into foolishness ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	32	When David reached the top of the ascent , where it was customary to worship God , Hushai the Arki came to meet him with his tunic torn and earth on his head .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	33	David said to him , “ If you go on with me , you will become a burden to me .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	34	But if you go back to the city and tell Avshalom , ‘ King , I will be your servant ; just as I was your father ’ s servant in the past , so I will now be your servant ’ — then you will be able to frustrate Achitofel ’ s advice for me .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	35	You have Tzadok and Evyatar the cohanim there with you . So whatever you hear from the king ’ s house , you tell to Tzadok and Evyatar the cohanim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	36	Their two sons , Achima ‘ atz the son of Tzadok and Y ’ honatan the son of Evyatar , are there with them ; through them send me everything you hear. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	15	37	So Hushai David ’ s friend came into the city when Avshalom was about to enter Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	2	The king said to Tziva , “ What do you mean by these ? ” Tziva replied , “ The donkeys are for the king ’ s household to ride on ; the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat ; and the wine is for those who collapse in the desert to drink. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	16	Hushai the Arki , David ’ s friend , came to Avshalom and said to him , “ Long live the king ! Long live the king ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	200	loaves of bread ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	100	pieces of summer fruit and a skin of wine .
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	3	The king asked , “ Where is your master ’ s [ grand ] son ? ” Tziva answered the king , “ He ’ s staying in Yerushalayim , because he said , ‘ Today the house of Isra ’ el will restore my father ’ s kingship to me. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	4	The king said to Tziva , “ Everything that belongs to M ’ fivoshet is now yours. ” Tziva answered , “ I bow down before you ; may I find favor in your sight , my lord , king. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	5	When King David arrived at Bachurim , there came out from there a man from Sha ’ ul ’ s family named Shim ‘ i the son of Gera ; and he came out pronouncing curses
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	6	and throwing stones at David and all King David ’ s servants ; even though all the people , including his bodyguard , surrounded him right and left .
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	7	When Shim ‘ i cursed , he said , “ Get out of here ! Get out of here , you killer , you good-for-nothing !
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	8	Adonai has brought back on you all the blood of the house of Sha ’ ul . You usurped his kingship , but Adonai has handed over the kingdom to Avshalom your son . Now your own evil has overtaken you , because you are a man of blood ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	9	Avishai the son of Tz ’ ruyah said to the king , “ Why allow this dead dog to curse my lord the king ? Just let me go over and remove his head ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	10	The king said , “ Do you sons of Tz ’ ruyah and I have anything in common ? Let him curse . If Adonai tells him , ‘ Curse David , ’ who has the right to ask , ‘ Why are you doing it ? ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	11	David then said to Avishai and all his servants , “ Look , my own son , who came from my own body , seeks my life . So how much more now this Binyamini ! Let him alone ; and let him curse , if Adonai told him to .
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	12	Maybe Adonai will notice how I ’ m treating him , and Adonai will reward me with good instead of his curses. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	13	So David and his men went on their way , while on the opposite hillside Shim ‘ i kept pace with him , cursing , throwing stones and flinging dust as he went .
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	14	The king and all the people with him arrived exhausted , so he rested there .
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	15	Meanwhile Avshalom and all the people , the men of Isra ’ el , came to Yerushalayim ; Achitofel was with him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	17	Avshalom asked Hushai , “ Is this how you show kindness to your friend ? Why didn ’ t you go with your friend ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	18	Hushai replied , “ No , but whomever Adonai and this people and all the men of Isra ’ el choose , his I will be ; and with him I will stay .
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	19	Moreover , whom should I serve ? Shouldn ’ t I serve in the presence of his son ? Just as I have served in your father ’ s presence , so will I be in your presence. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	20	Avshalom said to Achitofel , “ Give your advice as to what we should do. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	21	Achitofel answered Avshalom , “ Go in , and sleep with your father ’ s concubines , the ones he left to take care of the palace . All Isra ’ el will hear that your father utterly despises you , and this will strengthen the position of all those who are on your side. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	22	So they set up a tent for Avshalom on the roof of the palace ; and Avshalom went in to sleep with his father ’ s concubines in the sight of all Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	16	23	In those days Achitofel ’ s advice was regarded as highly as if someone had sought out the word of God ; it was this way with Achitofel ’ s advice both to David and to Avshalom .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	2	I ’ ll fall on him unexpectedly when he ’ s tired and powerless . I ’ ll frighten him , all the people with him will flee , and I ’ ll attack only the king .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	17	Y ’ honatan and Achima ‘ atz were staying at ‘ Ein-Rogel ; a female servant was to go and tell them , and they in turn were to go and tell King David — for it would not do to have them seen entering the city .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	3	Then I will bring back to you all the people ; and when they have all returned , except the one you are seeking , all the people will be at peace. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	4	What he said pleased Avshalom and all the leaders of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	5	Then Avshalom said , “ Now call also Hushai the Arki , and let ’ s give equal hearing to what he has to say. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	6	When Hushai appeared before Avshalom , Avshalom said to him , “ Achitofel has said such-and-such . Should we do what he says ? If not , you tell us. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	7	Hushai said to Avshalom , “ The advice Achitofel has given this time is not good .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	8	You know , ” continued Hushai , “ that your father and his men are powerful men , and that they are as bitter as a bear deprived of her cubs in the wild . Moreover , your father is a military man , and he won ’ t camp with the rest of the people —
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	9	right now he ’ s hidden in a pit or somewhere . So what will happen is this : when they begin their attack , and whoever hears about it says , ‘ A slaughter is taking place among Avshalom ’ s followers , ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	10	then even the strongest among them , someone whose courage is that of a lion , will completely collapse ! For all Isra ’ el knows that your father is a powerful man , and those with him are powerful men .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	11	Rather , I advise that you summon all Isra ’ el to come to you , from Dan to Be ’ er-Sheva , numbering as many as sand grains on the seashore ; and then you go to battle , yourself .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	12	In this way we ’ ll come upon him wherever he is , and we ’ ll fall on him as the dew falls on the ground ; of him and all the men with him we won ’ t leave even one alive .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	13	If he withdraws into a city , then all Isra ’ el will bring up ropes to that city , and we will drag it into the riverbed until not even a pebble is left. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	14	Avshalom and all the men of Isra ’ el said , “ The advice of Hushai the Arki is better than the advice of Achitofel ” — for Adonai had determined to frustrate the good advice of Achitofel , so that Adonai could bring disaster on Avshalom .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	15	Then Hushai said to Tzadok and Evyatar the cohanim , “ Achitofel gave such-and-such advice to Avshalom and the leaders of Isra ’ el , but I advised so and so .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	16	Now therefore send quickly and tell David , “ Don ’ t stay tonight in the desert plains ; but , whatever it takes , move on from there ! Otherwise , the king and all the people with him will be engulfed. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	18	But a boy saw them and told Avshalom ; so both of them took off quickly and came to the house of a man in Bachurim who had a cistern in his courtyard ; and they went down into it .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	19	His wife spread a covering over the cistern ’ s opening and scattered drying grain on it , so that nothing showed .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	20	Avshalom ’ s servants came to the woman at the house and asked , “ Where are Achima ‘ atz and Y ’ honatan ? ” The woman answered them , “ They ’ ve crossed the stream. ” After searching and not finding them , they returned to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	21	After they had left , the two climbed out of the cistern and went and told King David , “ Get up and cross the river , because Achitofel has given such-and-such advice against you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	22	David and all the people with him got up and crossed the Yarden ; by dawn every one of them had crossed the Yarden .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	23	When Achitofel saw that his advice was not being followed , he saddled his donkey , set out , and went home to his own city . After setting his house in order , he hanged himself ; he died and was buried in his father ’ s tomb .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	24	David had reached Machanayim by the time Avshalom and all the men of Isra ’ el crossed the Yarden .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	25	Avshalom had put ‘ Amasa in charge of the army in place of Yo ’ av . ‘ Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Yitra the Isra ’ eli , who had had sexual relations with Avigal the daughter of Nachash , Tz ’ ruyah ’ s sister and Yo ’ av ’ s mother .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	26	Isra ’ el and Avshalom pitched camp in the land of Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	27	After David had arrived in Machanayim , Shovi the son of Nachash , from Rabbah of the people of ‘ Amon ; Machir the son of ‘ Ammi ’ el from Lo-D ’ var and Barzillai the Gil ‘ adi from Roglim
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	28	brought beds , basins , clay pots , wheat , barley , flour , roasted grain , beans , lentils , roasted millet ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	17	29	honey , curdled milk , sheep and cheese made of cow ’ s milk for David and the people with him to eat ; because they said , “ These people are hungry , tired and thirsty from the desert . ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	2	Then David dispatched the people , a third of them under the command of Yo ’ av , a third under Avishai the son of Tz ’ ruyah , Yo ’ av ’ s brother , and a third under Ittai the Gitti ; and the king said to the people , “ I will also go out with you , myself. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	18	In his own lifetime Avshalom had taken and raised for himself the pillar which stands in the King ’ s Valley ; because he said , “ I don ’ t have a son to preserve the memory of my name. ” So he named the pillar after himself , and it ’ s called Avshalom ’ s Monument to this day .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	3	But the people replied , “ Don ’ t go out ; because if we flee , they won ’ t care about us . Even if half of us die , they won ’ t care about us . But you are worth ten thousand of us ; so it is better now that you stay in the city and be ready if we need help. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	4	The king answered them , “ I will do whatever you think best. ” So the king stood at the side of the gate , while all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	5	The king gave orders to Yo ’ av , Avishai and Ittai , “ For my sake , deal gently with young Avshalom. ” All the people were listening when the king gave all the commanders this order concerning Avshalom .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	6	So the people went out into the field against Isra ’ el ; the battle took place in the forest of Efrayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	7	The people of Isra ’ el were defeated there by David ’ s servants ; there was a terrible slaughter that day of 20,000 men .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	8	For the battle there was spread all over the countryside ; the forest devoured more people that day than did the sword .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	9	Avshalom happened to meet some of David ’ s servants . Avshalom was riding his mule , and as the mule walked under the thick branches of a big terebinth tree , his head got caught in the terebinth , so that he was left hanging between earth and sky , as the mule went on from under him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	10	Someone saw it and told Yo ’ av , “ I saw Avshalom hanging in a terebinth. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	11	Yo ’ av asked the man who told him , “ Here now , you saw it ; so why didn ’ t you strike him to the ground then and there ? I would have had to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt besides. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	12	The man replied to Yo ’ av , “ Even if I were to get a thousand pieces of silver , I still wouldn ’ t raise my hand against the son of the king ! After all , while we were listening , the king ordered you , Avishai and Ittai , ‘ Be careful that no one touches young Avshalom. ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	13	Or , if I had pretended that I didn ’ t know , the king would have known otherwise anyway ; and you wouldn ’ t have interceded for me either. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	14	Yo ’ av said , “ I can ’ t waste time arguing with you ! ” He took three darts in his hand and rammed them through Avshalom ’ s heart while he was still alive , hanging from the terebinth .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	15	Then Yo ’ av ’ s ten young armor-bearers surrounded Avshalom , struck him and killed him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	16	Yo ’ av sounded the shofar , and the people returned from pursuing Isra ’ el , because Yo ’ av held back the troops .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	17	They took Avshalom and threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled a big heap of stones over him . All Isra ’ el fled , each one to his tent .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	19	Then Achima ‘ atz the son of Tzadok said , “ Let me run now and bring news to the king that Adonai has judged in his favor by releasing him from his enemies. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	20	Yo ’ av said to him , “ You are not to be the one to bring the news today ; you can convey news another day ; but today you will not bring news , because the king ’ s son is dead. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then Yo ’ av said to the Ethiopian , “ Go , tell the king what you saw. ” The Ethiopian bowed to Yo ’ av , then ran off .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	22	But Achima ‘ atz the son of Tzadok said again to Yo ’ av , “ Come what may , please let me also run after the Ethiopian. ” Yo ’ av answered , “ Why do you want to run , my son ? You won ’ t receive any reward for bringing the news. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	23	“ I don ’ t care — whatever happens , I want to run. ” So he said to him , “ Run. ” Then Achima ‘ atz ran by the road through the desert flats and outran the Ethiopian .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	24	David was sitting between the two gates . A watchman went up to the roof of the gate and out onto the wall , raised his eyes , looked , and saw there a man running by himself .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	25	The watchman cried out and told the king . The king said , “ If he ’ s alone , he has good news to tell. ” As he ran along and came close ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	26	the watchman saw another man running and called to the gatekeeper , “ There ’ s another man running by himself. ” The king said , “ He too must have good news. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	27	The watchman said , “ The first one runs like Achima ‘ atz the son of Tzadok. ” The king said , “ He ’ s a good man , he comes with good news. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	28	Achima ‘ atz called to the king , “ Shalom , ” prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground and said , “ Blessed be Adonai your God , who has handed over the men who rebelled against my lord the king. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	29	The king asked , “ Is everything all right with young Avshalom ? ” Achima ‘ atz answered , “ When Yo ’ av sent the king ’ s servant and me your servant , I saw a big commotion ; but I didn ’ t know what it was. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	30	The king said , “ Go , and stand over there. ” So he went and stood there .
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	31	Then up came the Ethiopian , and the Ethiopian said , “ There ’ s good news for my lord the king , for Adonai has judged in your favor and rid you of all those who rebelled against you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	18	32	The king asked the Ethiopian , “ Is everything all right with young Avshalom ? ” The Ethiopian answered , “ May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rebel against you in order to harm you be as that young man is . ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	2	) Thus the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people , for the people heard it said that day that the king was grieving for his son ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	19	) and said to the king , “ May my lord not hold me guilty of a crime . Don ’ t remember the wrong your servant did on the day my lord the king left Yerushalayim . May the king not take it to heart !
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	1	) Yo ’ av was told , “ The king is weeping , mourning for Avshalom. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	3	) so that the people entered the city furtively that day , the way that people who are ashamed creep away when fleeing a battlefield .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	4	) Meanwhile , the king covered his face and cried aloud , “ Oh , my son Avshalom ! Oh , Avshalom , my son , my son ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	5	) Yo ’ av went inside to the king and said , “ Today you made all your servants feel ashamed . They saved your life today , and the lives of your sons , daughters , wives and concubines .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	6	) But you love those who hate you and hate those who love you . Today you said that princes and servants mean nothing to you — for I can see today that it would have pleased you more if Avshalom had lived today , and we had all died !
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	7	) Now get up , go out and speak heart-to-heart with your servants . For I swear by Adonai that if you don ’ t go out , not one man will stay here with you tonight — and that will be worse for you than all the misfortunes you have suffered from your youth until now. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	8	) So the king got up and sat in the city gateway ; and when all the people were told , “ Now the king is sitting in the gate , ” they came before the king . Meanwhile , Isra ’ el had fled , each man to his tent ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	9	) and throughout all the tribes of Isra ’ el there was dissension among all the people . They were saying , “ The king delivered us from the power of our enemies , and he saved us from the power of the P ’ lishtim ; but now he has fled the land to escape Avshalom .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	10	) However , Avshalom , whom we anointed to rule us , is dead in battle . So now , why doesn ’ t anyone suggest bringing the king back ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	11	) King David sent this message to Tzadok and Evyatar the cohanim : “ Ask the leaders of Y ’ hudah , ‘ Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace ? The king has already heard that all Isra ’ el wants to return him to his palace .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	12	) You are my kinsmen , my flesh and bone ; so why are you the last to bring back the king ? ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	13	) Also tell ‘ Amasa , ‘ You are my flesh and bone . May God bring terrible curses on me and worse ones yet if from now on you are not permanent commander of my army instead of Yo ’ av. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	14	) Thus he turned the hearts of all the men of Y ’ hudah around as if they were one man , so that they sent a message to the king , “ Come back , you and all your servants ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	15	) The king started back and arrived at the Yarden , while Y ’ hudah came to Gilgal in order to meet the king and bring the king over the Yarden .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	16	) Shim ‘ i the son of Gera , the Binyamini from Bachurim , hurried and came down with the men of Y ’ hudah to meet King David .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	17	) There were a thousand men of Binyamin with him , also Tziva the servant of the house of Sha ’ ul with his fifteen sons and twenty servants ; and they rushed into the Yarden ahead of the king
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	18	) to ferry the king ’ s household across and do whatever else the king wanted done . Shim ‘ i the son of Gera fell down before the king when he was ready to cross the Yarden
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	20	) For your servant knows that I have sinned . Therefore , look — I am the first one of all the house of Yosef to come today and go down to meet my lord the king. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	21	) Avishai the son of Tz ’ ruyah answered , “ Shouldn ’ t Shim ‘ i be put to death for this ? After all , he cursed Adonai ’ s anointed ruler ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	22	) But David said , “ What do I have in common with you , you sons of Tz ’ ruyah ? Why have you become my adversaries today ? Should anyone in Isra ’ el be put to death today ? Don ’ t I know that today I am king over Isra ’ el ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	23	) Then the king said to Shim ‘ i , “ You will not be put to death , ” and the king swore it to him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	24	) M ’ fivoshet the son of Sha ’ ul came down to meet the king . He hadn ’ t cared for his legs , trimmed his beard or washed his clothes from the day the king had left until the day he came home in peace .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	25	) When he came to Yerushalayim to meet the king , the king said to him , “ Why didn ’ t you go with me , M ’ fivoshet ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	26	) He answered , “ My lord king , my servant deceived me . I your servant had said , ‘ I will saddle a donkey for myself to ride on and go with the king , ’ since your servant is lame .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	27	) But he slandered me your servant to my lord the king . However , my lord the king is like an angel of God ; so do whatever seems right to you .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	28	) For all my father ’ s household deserved death at the hand of my lord the king ; nevertheless you placed your servant with those who eat at your own table . I deserve nothing more ; so why should I come crying any more to the king ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	29	) The king said to him , “ Why speak any more about these matters of yours ? I say : you and Tziva , divide the land. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	30	) M ’ fivoshet said to the king , “ Indeed , let him take it all ; for me it ’ s enough that my lord the king has come home in peace. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	31	) Barzillai the Gil ‘ adi had come down from Roglim and passed on to the Yarden with the king to bring him across the Yarden .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	32	) Barzillai was a very old man , eighty years old ; he had provided for the king ’ s needs when he was staying at Machanayim ; for he was a wealthy man .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	33	) The king said to Barzillai , “ Come on across with me , and I will provide for your needs with me in Yerushalayim. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	34	) Barzillai said to the king , “ How much longer can I live , that I should go up with the king to Yerushalayim ?
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	35	) I am now eighty years old . Can I tell good from bad ? Can your servant even taste what he eats or drinks ? Can I hear the voice of men and women singing any more ? Why should your servant burden my lord the king ?
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	36	) Your servant only wants to cross the Yarden with the king ; why should the king reward this so generously ?
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	37	) Please , just let your servant go back and die in my own city , near the grave of my father and mother . But here is your servant Khimham ; let him cross with my lord the king ; and do for him whatever seems good to you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	38	) The king answered , “ Khimham will cross with me , and I will do for him whatever seems good to you . Whatever you ask of me , I will do for you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	39	) So all the people crossed the Yarden ; and the king crossed too . The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him ; then he returned to his home .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	40	) The king crossed over to Gilgal , and Khimham crossed with him . All the people of Y ’ hudah brought the king across , as did half the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	41	) Now all the men of Isra ’ el came to the king and said to him , “ Why have our kinsmen , the men of Y ’ hudah , stolen you away and brought the king and his household across the Yarden , and all David ’ s men with him ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	42	) All the men of Y ’ hudah answered the men of Isra ’ el , “ Because the king is our close relative . Why are you angry about this ? Have we eaten anything at the king ’ s expense ? Has any gift been given to us ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	43	) The men of Isra ’ el answered the men of Y ’ hudah , “ We have ten shares in the king ; also we have more right in David than you . So why did you despise us ? Weren ’ t we the first to suggest bringing our king back ? ” But the men of Y ’ hudah spoke more vehemently than the men of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	19	44	(
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	2	All the men of Isra ’ el left off following David and went after Sheva the son of Bikhri . But the men of Y ’ hudah stuck with their king , from the Yarden to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	20	Yo ’ av answered , “ Heaven forbid ! Heaven forbid that I should swallow or destroy anything !
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	3	When David arrived at his palace in Yerushalayim , the king took the ten women who were his concubines , whom he had left to care for the palace , and put them under guard . He provided for their needs but never slept with them again . They were kept in confinement until the day of their death , living like widows with their husband still alive .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	4	The king said to ‘ Amasa , “ Summon the men of Y ’ hudah to come to me within three days ; and you , be here too. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	5	‘ Amasa went to summon the men of Y ’ hudah but took longer than the time he had been given .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	6	David said to Avishai , “ Sheva the son of Bikhri is going to do us more harm than Avshalom . Take your lord ’ s servants and pursue him , so that he won ’ t take over fortified cities and escape us. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	7	With him went Yo ’ av ’ s men , the K ’ reti , the P ’ leti and all the experienced soldiers ; they left Yerushalayim in pursuit of Sheva the son of Bikhri .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	8	On arrival at the big rock in Giv ‘ on , ‘ Amasa came to meet them . Yo ’ av was wearing his battle clothes , over which he had girded a belt with a sheathed sword ; but as he came forward it fell out .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	9	Yo ’ av said to ‘ Amasa , “ Is it going well with you , my brother ? Then , with his right hand , Yo ’ av took ‘ Amasa by the beard to kiss him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	10	‘ Amasa took no notice of the sword in Yo ’ av ’ s hand , so Yo ’ av stabbed him in the groin . His insides poured out on the ground , and he died without being stabbed a second time . Yo ’ av and Avishai his brother continued in pursuit of Sheva the son of Bikhri .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	11	One of Yo ’ av ’ s young men standing by Yo ’ av said , “ Whoever is on Yo ’ av ’ s side , whoever is for David — let him follow Yo ’ av. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	12	‘ Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road ; so that as the troops came up , they all halted there . When the man saw that all the people were standing still , he dragged ‘ Amasa off the road into the field and threw a cloak over him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	13	Once he had been removed from the road , all the troops went on after Yo ’ av , to pursue Sheva the son of Bikhri .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	14	Sheva went through all the tribes of Isra ’ el , to Avel and Beit-Ma ‘ akhah , and to all the Berim ; they assembled and followed him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	15	Yo ’ av ’ s troops came and put him under siege in Avel of Beit-Ma ‘ akhah — they put up a ramp in the moat against the city wall ; and all the people with Yo ’ av battered the wall in order to bring it down .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	16	Then a wise woman in the city shouted , “ Listen ! Listen ! Please tell Yo ’ av , ‘ Come over here , so that I can speak with you. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	17	He approached her , and the woman asked , “ Are you Yo ’ av ? ” He answered , “ I am. ” She said to him , “ Listen to what your servant has to say. ” He answered , “ I ’ m listening. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	18	Then she said , “ In the old days they used to say , ‘ They will ask advice at Avel ’ ; and that would end the discussion .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	19	We are among those in Isra ’ el who are peaceful and faithful . Why are you destroying a city and a mother in Isra ’ el ? Why swallow up the inheritance of Adonai ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	21	That ’ s not how it is . Rather , a man from the hills of Efrayim , Sheva the son of Bikhri , has raised his hand against the king , against David . Just turn him over to me , and I will leave the city. ” The woman said to Yo ’ av , “ All right , his head will be thrown to you over the wall. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	22	Then the woman went to all the people with her wise plan . They cut off the head of Sheva the son of Bikhri and threw it out to Yo ’ av . So he sounded the shofar , and they left the city , sending each man to his tent ; while Yo ’ av returned to the king in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	23	Once again Yo ’ av was commander over the whole army of Isra ’ el , while B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada was over the K ’ reti and P ’ leti ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	24	Adoram was in charge of forced labor , Y ’ hoshafat the son of Achilud was secretary of state ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	25	Sh ’ va was recorder , Tzadok and Evyatar were cohanim ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	20	26	and ‘ Ira the Ya ’ iri was David ’ s cohen .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	2	The king summoned the Giv ‘ onim and said to them — these Giv ‘ onim were not part of the people of Isra ’ el but from the remnant of the Emori ; and the people of Isra ’ el had sworn to them ; but Sha ’ ul , in his zeal for the people of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah , had sought to exterminate them —
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	21	When he mocked Isra ’ el , Y ’ honatan the son of Shim ‘ ah David ’ s brother killed him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	3	David said to the Giv ‘ onim , “ What should I do for you ? With what should I make atonement , so that you will be able to bless Adonai ’ s heritage ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	4	The Giv ‘ onim said to him , “ Our dispute with Sha ’ ul can ’ t be resolved with silver or gold ; and we don ’ t have the right to put anyone in Isra ’ el to death. ” He said , “ So , what do you say that I should do for you ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	5	They answered the king , “ The man who ruined us , who schemed against us so that we would cease to exist anywhere in Isra ’ el ’ s territory —
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	6	have seven of his male descendants handed over to us , and we will put them to death by hanging before Adonai in Giv ‘ ah of Sha ’ ul , whom Adonai chose. ” The king said , “ I will hand them over. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	7	But the king spared M ’ fivoshet , the son of Y ’ honatan the son of Sha ’ ul , because of the oath before Adonai between David and Y ’ honatan the son of Sha ’ ul .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	8	The king took the two sons of Ritzpah the daughter of Ayah , whom she bore to Sha ’ ul , Armoni and M ’ fivoshet ; and the five sons of Mikhal the daughter of Sha ’ ul , whom she bore to Adri ’ el the son of Barzillai the Mecholati ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	9	and handed them over to the Giv ‘ onim , who hanged them on the hill before Adonai . All seven died ; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest season , at the beginning of the barley harvest .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	10	Ritzpah the daughter of Ayah took sackcloth , spread it out toward a cliff for herself and stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until water was poured out on the bodies from the sky , not letting the birds land on them during the day or the wild animals at night .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	11	David was told what Ritzpah the daughter of Ayah , the concubine of Sha ’ ul , had done .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	12	So David went and took the bones of Sha ’ ul and the bones of Y ’ honatan his son from the men of Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad , who had stolen them from the open square of Beit-Sh ’ an , where the P ’ lishtim had hanged them at the time the P ’ lishtim had killed Sha ’ ul at Gilboa ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	13	and he brought up from there the bones of Sha ’ ul and the bones of Y ’ honatan his son . They also gathered the bones of those who had been hanged .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	14	Then they buried the bones of Sha ’ ul and Y ’ honatan his son in the territory of Binyamin in Tzela , in the tomb of Kish his father ; they did everything the king ordered . Only after that was God prevailed on to show mercy to the land .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	15	Once again the P ’ lishtim made war on Isra ’ el . David went down with his servants and fought against the P ’ lishtim , but David began to get tired .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	16	Yishbi-B ’ nov , one of the sons of the giant , said that he would kill David ; his spear weighed seven pounds , and he was wearing new armor .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	17	But Avishai the son of Tz ’ ruyah came to David ’ s rescue by striking the P ’ lishti and killing him . Then David ’ s men swore to him , “ You must no longer go out with us to battle , in order not to quench the lamp of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	18	A while after this there was again war with the P ’ lishtim , at Gov . Sibkhai the Hushati killed Saf , one of the sons of the giant .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	19	There was more war with the P ’ lishtim at Gov ; and Elchanan the son of Ya ‘ arei-Orgim , the Beit-Lachmi , killed Golyat the Gitti , who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver ’ s beam .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	20	There was again war at Gat , where there was a belligerent man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot — twenty-four in all — and he too was a son of the giant .
CJB	2%20Samuel	21	22	These four were sons of the giant in Gat ; they fell at the hands of David and his servants .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	2	He said : “ Adonai is my Rock , my fortress and deliverer ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	22	“ For I have kept the ways of Adonai , I have not done evil by leaving my God ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	3	the God who is my Rock , in whom I find shelter , my shield , the power that saves me , my stronghold and my refuge . My savior , you have saved me from violence .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	4	I call on Adonai , who is worthy of praise ; and I am saved from my enemies .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	5	“ For death ’ s breakers were closing over me , the floods of B ’ liya ‘ al terrified me ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	6	the ropes of Sh ’ ol were wrapped around me , the snares of death lay there before me .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	7	In my distress I called to Adonai ; yes , I called to my God . Out of his temple he heard my voice , and my cry entered his ears .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	8	“ Then the earth quaked and shook , the foundations of heaven trembled . They were shaken because he was angry .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	9	Smoke arose in his nostrils ; and from his mouth , devouring fire , with coals blazing from it .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	10	He lowered heaven and came down with thick darkness under his feet .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	11	He rode on a keruv and flew , he was seen on the wings of the wind .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	12	He made darkness his canopy around him , thick clouds in the skies dense with water .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	13	From the brightness before him , fiery coals flamed out .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	14	“ Adonai thundered from heaven , Ha ‘ Elyon sounded his voice .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	15	He sent out arrows and scattered them ; with lightning he routed them .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	16	The channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were exposed at Adonai ’ s rebuke , at the blast of breath from his nostrils .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	17	“ He sent from on high , he took me and pulled me out of deep water ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	18	he rescued me from my powerful enemy , from those who hated me , for they were stronger than I .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	19	They came against me on my day of calamity , but Adonai was my support .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	20	“ He brought me out to an open place ; he rescued me , because he took pleasure in me .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	21	Adonai rewarded me for my uprightness , he repaid me because my hands were clean .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	23	for all his rulings were before me , I did not depart from his regulations .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	24	I was pure-hearted toward him and kept myself from my sin .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	25	“ Hence Adonai repaid me for my uprightness , according to my purity in his view .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	26	With the merciful , you are merciful ; with the champion of purity , you are pure ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	27	with the honest , you are honest ; but with the crooked you are cunning .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	28	People afflicted , you save ; but when your eyes are on the haughty , you humble them .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	29	“ For you , Adonai , are my lamp ; Adonai lights up my darkness .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	30	With you I can run through a whole troop of men , with my God I can leap a wall .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	31	“ As for God , his way is perfect , the word of Adonai has been tested by fire ; he shields all who take refuge in him .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	32	For who is God but Adonai , and who is a Rock but our God ?
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	33	“ God is my strength and protection ; he makes my way go straight .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	34	He makes me swift and sure-footed as a deer and enables me to stand on my high places .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	35	He trains my hands for war until my arms can bend a bow of bronze ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	36	You give me your shield , which is salvation ; your answers make me great .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	37	You lengthen the steps I can take , yet my ankles do not turn .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	38	“ I pursued my enemies and wiped them out , without turning back until they were destroyed .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	39	I destroyed them , crushed them ; they can ’ t get up ; they have fallen under my feet .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	40	“ For you braced me with strength for the battle and bent down my adversaries beneath me .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	41	You made my enemies turn their backs in flight , so that I could destroy those who hate me .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	42	“ They looked , but there was no one to help , even to Adonai , but he didn ’ t answer .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	43	I pulverized them like dust on the ground , pounded and stamped on them like mud in the streets .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	44	“ You also freed me from the quarrels of my people . You kept me to be the head of the nations ; a people I did not know now serve me .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	45	Foreigners come cringing to me ; the moment they hear of me , they obey me .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	46	Foreigners lose heart as they stagger from their fortresses .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	47	“ Adonai is alive ! Blessed is my Rock ! Exalted be God , the Rock of my salvation ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	48	the God who gives me vengeance and makes peoples submit to me .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	49	He brings me out from my enemies . You raise me over those who rebel against me , you rescue me from violent men .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	50	“ So I give thanks to you , Adonai , among the nations ; I sing praises to your name .
CJB	2%20Samuel	22	51	He is a tower of salvation for his king ; he displays grace to his anointed , to David and his descendants forever . ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	2	“ The Spirit of Adonai spoke through me , his word was on my tongue .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	23	He had more honor than the thirty , but he did not achieve the status of the first three . David put him in command of his personal guard .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	3	The God of Isra ’ el spoke ; the Rock of Isra ’ el said to me , ‘ A ruler over people must be upright , ruling in the fear of God ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	4	like the morning light at sunrise on a cloudless day that makes the grass on the earth sparkle after a rain. ’
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	5	“ For my house stands firm with God — he made an everlasting covenant with me . It is in order , fully assured , that he will bring to full growth all my salvation and every desire .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	6	“ But the ungodly are like thorn bushes to be pushed aside , every one of them . They can not be taken in one ’ s hand ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	7	To touch them one uses pitchfork or spear-shaft , and then only to burn them where they lie. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	8	Following are the names of David ’ s warrior-heroes : Yoshev-Bashevet the Tach ’ kmoni , chief of the three , also known as ‘ Adino the ‘ Etzni ; he is the one who came against
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	800	men , whom he killed in a single encounter .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	9	After him was El ‘ azar the son of Dodo the son of Achochi , one of the three warriors with David when they put their lives in jeopardy against the P ’ lishtim who were there assembled for battle , while the men of Isra ’ el had gone away .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	10	He stood firm and attacked the P ’ lishtim until his hand went into spasm , so that he couldn ’ t let go of his sword . Adonai accomplished a great victory that day ; but the people didn ’ t return until he had finished , and then only to plunder the bodies of the dead .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	11	After him was Shammah the son of Age the Harari . The P ’ lishtim had assembled at Lechi , where there was a plot of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	12	But he stood in the middle of the plot and defended it , killing the P ’ lishtim ; and Adonai brought about a great victory .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	13	During harvest season three of the thirty leaders went down and came to David at the cave of ‘ Adulam when a company of P ’ lishtim had set up camp in the Refa ’ im Valley .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	14	At that time David was in the fortress , and the garrison of the P ’ lishtim was in Beit-Lechem .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	15	David had a craving and said , “ I wish someone could give me water to drink from the well by the gate of Beit-Lechem ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	16	The three warrior-heroes broke through the army of the P ’ lishtim , drew water from the well by the gate of Beit-Lechem , took it and brought it to David . But he wouldn ’ t drink it . Instead , he poured it out to Adonai
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	17	and said , “ Adonai ! Heaven forbid that I should do such a thing ! Am I to drink the blood of men who went and put their lives in jeopardy ? ” — and he would not consent to drink it . These are the things the three warrior-heroes did .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	18	Avishai the brother of Yo ’ av , the son of Tz ’ ruyah , was chief of these three . He raised his spear against
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	300	men and killed them ; thus he had a reputation even among the three .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	19	He had the most honor of these three and was therefore made their leader ; however , he did not achieve the status of the first three .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	20	B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada , the son of a valiant man of Kavtze ’ el , was a man of many exploits . He struck down two lion-hearted men of Mo ’ av . One day when it was snowing , he went down into a pit and killed a lion .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	21	Here is how he killed an Egyptian , a man of intimidating appearance : the Egyptian had a spear in his hand , and he went down to him with only a stick , seized the spear from the Egyptian ’ s hand and killed him with his own spear .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	22	These are things that B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada did that earned him a name among the three warrior-heroes .
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	24	‘ Asah ’ el the brother of Yo ’ av was one of the thirty , Elchanan the son of Dodo of Beit-Lechem ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	25	Shammah the Harodi , Elika the Harodi ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	26	Heletz the Palti , ‘ Ira son of ‘ Ikesh from T ’ koa ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	27	Avi ‘ ezer from ‘ Anatot , M ’ vunai the Hushati ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	28	Tzalmon the Achochi , Mahrai the N ’ tofati ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	29	Helev the son of Ba ‘ anah the N ’ tofati , Ittai the son of Rivai from Giv ‘ ah , of the people of Binyamin ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	30	B ’ nayahu from Pir ‘ aton , Hiddai from the vadis of Ga ‘ ash ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	31	Avi- ‘ Alvon the ‘ Arvati , ‘ Azmavet the Barchumi ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	32	Elyachba the Sha ‘ alvoni , of the sons of Yashen , Y ’ honatan ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	33	Shammah the Harari , Achi ’ am the son of Sharar the Arari ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	34	Elifelet the son of Achasbai the son of the Ma ‘ akhati , Eli ‘ am the son of Achitofel from Giloh ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	35	Hetzrai from Karmel , Pa ‘ arai the Arbi ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	36	Yig ’ al the son of Natan of Tzovah , Bani the Gadi ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	37	Tzelek the ‘ Amoni , Nachrai the Be ’ eroti , armor-bearer for Yo ’ av the son of Tz ’ ruyah ,
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	38	‘ Ira the Yitri , Garev the Yitri , and
CJB	2%20Samuel	23	39	Uriyah the Hitti — thirty-seven in all .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	2	The king said to Yo ’ av the commander of the army , who was with him , “ Go systematically through all the tribes of Isra ’ el , from Dan to Be ’ er-Sheva ; and take a census of the population ; so that I can know how many people there are. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	24	But the king said to Aravnah , “ No ; I insist on buying it from you at a price . I refuse to offer to Adonai my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing. ” So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for one-and-a-quarter pounds of silver shekels .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	3	Yo ’ av said to the king , “ May Adonai your God add to the people a hundredfold , no matter how many there are ; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it . But why does my lord the king take pleasure in doing this ? ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	4	However , the king ’ s word prevailed against Yo ’ av and the army officers . So Yo ’ av and the army officers went out from the king ’ s presence to take a census of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	5	They crossed the Yarden and pitched camp in ‘ Aro ‘ er , to the south of the city in the Vadi of Gad ; went on to Ya ‘ zer ;
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	6	came to Gil ‘ ad and continued to the land of Tachtim-Hodshi . Then they arrived at Dan-Ya ‘ an , went around to Tzidon
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	7	and came to the stronghold of Tzor . They went on to the cities of the Hivi and of the Kena ‘ ani , and finished in the south of Y ’ hudah , at Be ’ er-Sheva .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	8	When they were done going through all the land , they came back to Yerushalayim ; it had taken nine months and twenty days .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	9	Yo ’ av reported the results of the census to the king : there were in Isra ’ el 800,000 valiant men who could handle a sword , while the men of Y ’ hudah numbered 500,000 .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	10	But after he had taken the census , David was conscience-stricken . David said to Adonai , “ I have greatly sinned in what I have done . But now , Adonai , please ! Put aside your servant ’ s sin , for I have done a very foolish thing. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	11	When David got up in the morning , this word of Adonai came to the prophet Gad , David ’ s seer :
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	12	“ Go and say to David that this is what Adonai says : ‘ I am giving you a choice of three punishments . Choose one of them , and I will execute it against you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	13	Gad came to David and told him ; he said : “ Do you want seven years of famine in your land ? or do you want to flee before your enemies for three months while they pursue you ? or do you want three days of plague in your land ? Think about it , and tell me what to answer the one who sent me. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	14	David said to Gad , “ This is very hard for me . Let us fall into the hand of Adonai , because his mercies are great , rather than have me fall into the hand of man. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	15	So Adonai sent a plague on Isra ’ el from that morning until the end of the specified time ; 70,000 of the people died between Dan and Be ’ er-Sheva .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	16	But when the angel stretched out his hand toward Yerushalayim to destroy it , Adonai changed his mind about causing such distress and said to the angel destroying the people , “ Enough ! Now withdraw your hand. ” The angel of Adonai was at the threshing-floor of Aravnah the Y ’ vusi .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	17	David spoke to Adonai when he saw the angel striking the people ; he said , “ Here , I have sinned , I have done wrong . But these sheep , what have they done ? Please ! Let your hand be against me and against my father ’ s family ! ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	18	Gad came to David that day and said to him , “ Go , set up an altar to Adonai on the threshing-floor of Aravnah the Y ’ vusi. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	19	David went up and did what Gad had said , as Adonai had ordered .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	20	Aravnah looked out and saw the king and his servants coming toward him . Aravnah went out and prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	21	Then Aravnah said , “ Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? ” David said , “ To buy your threshing-floor , in order to build an altar to Adonai , so that the plague will be lifted from the people. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	22	Aravnah said to David , “ Let my lord the king take and offer up anything that seems good to him . Here are the oxen for the burnt offering ; you can use the threshing-sledges and the yokes for the oxen as firewood .
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	23	All this , O king , Aravnah gives to the king. ” Then Aravnah said to the king , “ May Adonai your God accept you. ”
CJB	2%20Samuel	24	25	Then David built an altar to Adonai there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . After this , Adonai took pity on the land and lifted the plague from Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	1	King David grew old , the years took their toll , and he couldn ’ t get warm even when they covered him with bedclothes .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	2	His servants said to him , “ Let us try to find a young virgin for my lord the king . She can wait on the king and be a companion for him , and she can lie next to you , so that my lord the king will get some heat. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	3	After looking through all of Isra ’ el ’ s territory for a beautiful girl , they found Avishag the Shunamit and brought her to the king .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	4	The girl was very beautiful and became a companion for the king . She took care of him , but the king did not have sexual relations with her .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	5	Adoniyah the son of Haggit was beginning to claim that he would be king ; to this end he organized chariots and horsemen , with fifty men to run ahead of him .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	6	( His father had never in his life confronted him by asking , “ Why are you behaving this way ? ” Moreover , he was a very handsome man ; he was born next after Avshalom . )
CJB	1%20Kings	1	7	He conferred with Yo ’ av the son of Tz ’ ruyah and Evyatar the cohen ; and they both supported Adoniyah .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	8	But Tzadok the cohen , B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada , Natan the prophet , Shim ‘ i , Re ‘ i and David ’ s elite guard were not on Adoniyah ’ s side .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	9	One day Adoniyah killed sheep , oxen and fattened calves at the Stone of Zochelet , by ‘ Ein-Rogel . He summoned all his brothers the king ’ s sons , and all the men of Y ’ hudah the king ’ s servants ;
CJB	1%20Kings	1	10	but he did not summon Natan the prophet , B ’ nayah , the elite guard or Shlomo his brother .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	11	Natan went to Bat-Sheva the mother of Shlomo and said , “ Haven ’ t you heard that Adoniyah the son of Haggit has become king without the knowledge of David our lord ?
CJB	1%20Kings	1	12	Now , come , please let me give you advice , so that you can save both your own life and that of your son Shlomo .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	13	Go , get in to see King David , and say to him , ‘ My lord , king , didn ’ t you swear to your servant , “ Your son Shlomo will be king after me ; he will sit on my throne ” ? So why is Adoniyah king ? ’
CJB	1%20Kings	1	14	Right then , while you are still talking with the king , I will also come in after you and confirm what you are saying. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	15	Bat-Sheva went in to the king in his room . ( The king was very old ; Avishag the Shunamit was in attendance on the king . )
CJB	1%20Kings	1	16	Bat-Sheva bowed , prostrating herself to the king . The king asked , “ What do you want ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	17	She answered him , “ My lord , you swore by Adonai your God to your servant , ‘ Your son Shlomo will be king after me ; he will sit on my throne. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	1	18	But now , here is Adoniyah ruling as king ; and you , my lord the king , don ’ t know anything about it .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	19	He has killed oxen , fattened calves and sheep in great numbers ; and he has summoned all the sons of the king , Evyatar the cohen and Yo ’ av the commander of the army ; but he didn ’ t summon Shlomo your servant .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	20	As for you , my lord the king , all Isra ’ el is watching you ; they are waiting for you to tell them who is to sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	21	If you don ’ t , then , when my lord the king sleeps with his ancestors , I and my son Shlomo will be considered criminals. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	22	Right then , while she was still talking with the king , Natan the prophet entered .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	23	They told the king , “ Natan the prophet is here. ” After coming into the king ’ s presence , he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	24	Natan said , “ My lord king , did you say , ‘ Adoniyah is to be king after me ; he will sit on my throne ’ ?
CJB	1%20Kings	1	25	For he has gone down today and killed oxen , fattened calves and sheep in great numbers ; and he has summoned all the king ’ s sons , the commanders of the army and Evyatar the cohen ; right now they are eating and drinking in his presence and proclaiming , ‘ Long live King Adoniyah ! ’
CJB	1%20Kings	1	26	But he didn ’ t summon me your servant , or Tzadok the cohen , or B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada or your servant Shlomo .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	27	Is this authorized by my lord the king without your having told your servant who would sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	28	King David answered by saying , “ Summon Bat-Sheva to me. ” She entered the king ’ s presence and stood before the king .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	29	Then the king swore an oath : “ As Adonai lives , who has delivered me from all adversity ,
CJB	1%20Kings	1	30	as I swore to you by Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , ‘ Your son Shlomo will be king after me ; he will sit on my throne in my place , ’ so will I do today. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	31	Bat-Sheva bowed with her face to the ground , prostrating herself to the king , and said , “ Let my lord King David live forever. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	32	King David said , “ Summon Tzadok the cohen , Natan the prophet and B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada. ” They came before the king .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	33	The king said to them , “ Take with you the servants of your lord , have Shlomo my son ride on my own mule and bring him down to Gichon .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	34	There Tzadok the cohen and Natan the prophet are to anoint him king over Isra ’ el . Sound the shofar and say , “ Long live King Shlomo ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	35	Then escort him back ; he is to come and sit on my throne ; for he is to take my place as king . I have appointed him to rule over Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	36	B ’ nayah responded to the king by saying , “ Amen ! May Adonai , the God of my lord the king , confirm it !
CJB	1%20Kings	1	37	Just as Adonai has been with my lord the king , so may he be with Shlomo and make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	38	So Tzadok the cohen , Natan the prophet , B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada and the K ’ reti and P ’ leti went down , had Shlomo ride on King David ’ s mule and brought him to Gichon .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	39	Tzadok the cohen took the horn of olive oil out of the tent and anointed Shlomo . They sounded the shofar , and all the people shouted , “ Long live King Shlomo ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	40	All the people escorted him back , playing flutes and rejoicing greatly , so that the earth shook with the sound .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	41	Adoniyah and all his guests heard it while they were finishing their meal ; but it was Yo ’ av who , when he heard the blast on the shofar , asked , “ That noise — what ’ s the meaning of this uproar in the city ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	42	While he was still speaking , there came Yonatan the son of Evyatar the cohen . Adoniyah said , “ Come in ! You ’ re a worthy man , so you must be bringing good news ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	43	Yonatan answered Adoniyah , “ The truth is , our lord King David has made Shlomo king .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	44	Moreover , the king sent with him Tzadok the cohen , Natan the prophet , B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada and the K ’ reti and P ’ leti ; they had him ride on the king ’ s mule ;
CJB	1%20Kings	1	45	and Tzadok the cohen and Natan the prophet anointed him king in Gichon . Then they escorted him back from there rejoicing , so that the city is in an uproar ; this is the noise you ’ ve been hearing .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	46	Moreover , Shlomo is now sitting on the throne of the kingdom .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	47	More than that , the king ’ s servants came and blessed our lord King David with these words : ‘ May God make the name of Shlomo better than your name and his throne greater than your throne , ’ after which the king bowed down on the bed .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	48	Finally , the king said , ‘ Blessed be Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , who has given someone to sit on my throne today , when my own eyes can see it. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	49	At this all Adoniyah ’ s guests grew frightened ; they got up , everyone going his own way .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	50	Adoniyah too was afraid because of Shlomo ; he got up , went and took hold of the horns of the altar .
CJB	1%20Kings	1	51	Shlomo was told , “ Here , Adoniyah is terrified of King Shlomo ; he has grabbed hold of the horns of the altar and is saying , ‘ First let King Shlomo swear to me that he will not have his servant executed. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	52	Shlomo said , “ If he will demonstrate that he is a worthy man , not a hair of his will fall to the earth . But if he is found making trouble , he will die. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	1	53	So King Shlomo sent , and they brought him down from the altar . He came and prostrated himself before King Shlomo ; and Shlomo said to him , ‘ Go on home . ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	2	2	“ I am going the way of all the earth . Therefore , be strong ; show yourself a man .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	3	Observe the charge of Adonai your God to go in his ways and keep his regulations , mitzvot , rulings and instructions in accordance with what is written in the Torah of Moshe ; so that you will succeed in all you do and wherever you go .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	4	If you do , Adonai will fulfill what he promised me when he said , ‘ If your children pay attention to how they live , conducting themselves before me honestly with all their heart and being , you will never lack a man on the throne of Isra ’ el. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	2	5	“ Moreover , you are aware of what Yo ’ av the son of Tz ’ ruyah did to me , that is , what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Isra ’ el , Avner the son of Ner and ‘ Amasa the son of Yeter — he killed them , shedding the blood of war in peacetime , putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and the shoes on his feet .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	6	Therefore , act according to your wisdom ; don ’ t let his gray head go down to the grave in peace .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	7	“ But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gil ‘ adi . Include them with those who eat at your table , because they came and stood with me when I was fleeing from Avshalom your brother .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	8	“ Finally , you have with you Shim ‘ i the son of Gera the Binyamini , from Bachurim . He laid a terrible curse on me when I was on my way to Machanayim ; but he came down to meet me at the Yarden ; so I swore to him by Adonai that I would not have him put to death with the sword .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	9	Now , however , you should not let him go unpunished . You are a wise man , and you will know what you should do to him — you will bring his gray head down to the grave with blood. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	10	Then David slept with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	11	David had ruled Isra ’ el for forty years — seven years in Hevron and thirty-three years in Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	12	Shlomo sat on the throne of David his father ; and his rule had become firmly established ,
CJB	1%20Kings	2	13	when Adoniyah the son of Haggit came to Bat-Sheva the mother of Shlomo . She asked , “ Have you come as a friend ? ” He answered , “ Yes , as a friend. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	14	Then he continued , “ I have something to say to you. ” She said , “ Go on. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	15	He said , “ You know that the kingdom should have been mine , that all Isra ’ el was looking to me to be their ruler . No matter ; the kingdom has turned around and become my brother ’ s , because Adonai gave it to him .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	16	But now I ask one favor of you ; don ’ t deny me. ” “ Go on , ” she said .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	17	He said , “ Please speak to Shlomo the king — for he won ’ t say ‘ No ’ to you — and ask him to give me Avishag the Shunamit as my wife. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	18	Bat-Sheva said , “ All right , I will speak to the king on your behalf. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	19	So Bat-Sheva went to King Shlomo to speak to him on behalf of Adoniyah . The king rose to meet her and bowed down to her . Then he sat down on his throne and had a throne set up for the king ’ s mother , so that she sat at his right .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	20	She said , “ I am asking one small favor of you ; don ’ t deny me. ” The king said to her , “ Ask , mother ; I won ’ t deny you. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	21	She said , “ Let Avishag the Shunamit be given to Adoniyah your brother as his wife. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	22	King Shlomo answered his mother , “ Why are you asking Avishag the Shunamit for Adoniyah ? Ask the kingdom for him too ! After all , he ’ s my older brother ! Yes , for him , and for Evyatar the cohen and for Yo ’ av the son of Tz ’ ruyah ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	23	Then King Shlomo swore by Adonai , “ May God do terrible things to me and worse if Adoniyah hasn ’ t condemned himself to death with this request !
CJB	1%20Kings	2	24	Now therefore , as Adonai lives , who has established me , put me on the throne of David my father and set up a dynasty for me , as he promised , Adoniyah will certainly be put to death today. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	25	King Shlomo commissioned B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada , and he struck him down , so that he died .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	26	To Evyatar the cohen the king said , “ You , get yourself to ‘ Anatot , to your own fields . You deserve to die ; but I won ’ t put you to death just now ; since you did carry the ark of Adonai Elohim before David my father ; and you suffered together with my father in everything he suffered. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	27	So Shlomo forced Evyatar out of his task as cohen to Adonai , so that what Adonai had said in Shiloh about the family of ‘ Eli might be fulfilled .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	28	When the news came to Yo ’ av , he fled to the tent of Adonai and took hold of the horns of the altar ; for Yo ’ av had given his support to Adoniyah , even though he had not supported Avshalom .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	29	King Shlomo was told , “ Yo ’ av has fled to the tent of Adonai ; he ’ s there by the altar. ” Shlomo sent B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada with the order , “ Go , strike him down. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	30	B ’ nayah came to the tent of Adonai and said to him , “ The king says : leave ! ” He answered , “ No , I ’ d rather die here. ” B ’ nayah brought the message back to the king , “ This is what Yo ’ av said to me. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	31	The king answered him , “ Do what he said — strike him down , and bury him . In this way you will take away from me and my father ’ s family the blood which Yo ’ av shed for no reason .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	32	Adonai will bring his blood back on his own head , because he struck down two men more righteous and better than he — he killed them with the sword without my father David ’ s awareness : Avner the son of Ner , commander of the army of Isra ’ el , and ‘ Amasa the son of Yeter , commander of the army of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	33	In this way their blood will return on the head of Yo ’ av and his descendants forever ; but for David , his descendants , his family and his throne there will be peace forever from Adonai. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	34	So B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada went up , struck him down and killed him ; he was buried in his own house in the desert .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	35	The king put B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada in charge of the army instead of him , and the king replaced Evyatar with Tzadok the cohen .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	36	The king summoned Shim ‘ i and said to him , “ Build yourself a house in Yerushalayim , and live there ; don ’ t go outside the city walls .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	37	Know for a fact that on the day you go out and cross Vadi Kidron , you will certainly die ; your blood will be on your own head. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	38	Shim ‘ i answered the king , “ What you have said is good ; as my lord the king has said , so will your servant do. ” So Shim ‘ i lived in Yerushalayim for a long time .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	39	But after three years , two of Shim ‘ i ’ s slaves ran away and went to Akhish son of Ma ‘ akhah , king of Gat . They told Shim ‘ i , “ Your slaves are in Gat. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	40	So Shim ‘ i set out , saddled his donkey and went to Akhish in Gat to look for his slaves ; then Shim ‘ i returned , bringing his slaves from Gat .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	41	Shlomo was told that Shim ‘ i had gone from Yerushalayim to Gat and back .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	42	The king summoned Shim ‘ i and said to him , “ Didn ’ t I have you swear by Adonai and forewarn you by telling you , ‘ Know for a fact that on the day you leave and go anywhere outside the city , you will certainly die ’ ? and you answered me , ‘ What you ’ re saying is good ; I hear it. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	2	43	Why , then , haven ’ t you kept the oath of Adonai and the mitzvah I charged you with ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	44	Moreover , the king said to Shim ‘ i , “ You know in your own heart all the terrible things you did to David my father ; therefore Adonai will bring back your wickedness on your own head .
CJB	1%20Kings	2	45	But King Shlomo will be blessed , and the throne of David will be established before Adonai forever. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	2	46	So the king gave the order to B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada , and he went out and struck him down , so that he died . Thus the kingdom was established in Shlomo ’ s hands .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	3	3	Shlomo loved Adonai , living according to the regulations set forth by David his father ; nevertheless , he sacrificed and made offerings on the high places .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	2	The people , however , were still sacrificing on the high places , because no house had yet been built for the name of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	4	One time the king went to Giv ‘ on to sacrifice there , because that was the main high place . Shlomo offered a thousand burnt offerings on the altar there .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	5	At Giv ‘ on Adonai appeared to Shlomo in a dream at night ; God said , “ Tell me what I should give you. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	3	6	Shlomo said , “ You showed your servant David my father much grace , as he lived before you honestly and righteously , having an upright heart with you . You preserved this great grace for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne , as is the case today .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	7	So now , Adonai my God , you have made your servant king in the place of David my father ; but I am a mere child — I don ’ t know how to lead !
CJB	1%20Kings	3	8	Moreover your servant is among your people , whom you chose , a great people so numerous that they can not be counted .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	9	Therefore , give your servant an understanding heart able to administer justice to your people , so that I can discern between good and bad — for who is equal to judging this great people of yours ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	3	10	What Shlomo had said in making this request pleased Adonai .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	11	God said to him , “ Because you have made this request instead of asking long life or riches for yourself , or your enemies ’ death , but rather asked for yourself understanding to discern justice ;
CJB	1%20Kings	3	12	I am doing what you requested . I am giving you a wise and understanding heart , so that there has never been anyone like you , nor will there ever again be anyone like you .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	13	I am also giving you what you didn ’ t ask for , riches and honor greater than that of any other king throughout your life .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	14	More than that , if you will live according to my ways , obeying my laws and mitzvot like your father David , I will give you a long life. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	3	15	Shlomo awoke and found it had been a dream . But he went to Yerushalayim , stood before the ark for the covenant of Adonai and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings . He also made a feast for all his servants .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	16	After this , there came to the king two women who were prostitutes . After presenting themselves to him ,
CJB	1%20Kings	3	17	one of the women said , “ My lord , I and this woman live in the same house ; and when she was in the house , I gave birth to a baby .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	18	Three days after I gave birth , this woman also gave birth . We were there together ; there was no one else with us in the house except the two of us .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	19	During the night this woman ’ s child died , because she rolled over on top of it .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	20	So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from next to me , while your servant was sleeping , and put it in her arms ; and she laid her dead child in my arms .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	21	When I awoke in the morning to feed my child from my breast , there it was , dead . But when I took a closer look later in the morning , why , it wasn ’ t my son at all — not the one I gave birth to ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	3	22	The other woman broke in , “ No ! The living one is my son , and the dead one is your son ! ” The first one said , “ No ! The dead one is your son and the living one is my son ! ” This is how they spoke in the presence of the king .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	23	Then the king said , “ This woman says , ‘ The living one is my son ; your son is the dead one ’ ; while the other says , ‘ No , the dead one is your son , and the living one is my son. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	3	24	Bring me a sword , ” said the king . They brought a sword to the king .
CJB	1%20Kings	3	25	The king said , “ Cut the living child in two ; give half to the one and half to the other. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	3	26	At this , the woman to whom the living child belonged addressed the king , because she felt so strongly toward her son : “ Oh , my lord , give her the living child ; you mustn ’ t kill it ! ” But the other one said , “ It will be neither yours nor mine . Divide it up ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	3	27	Then the king answered , “ Give the living child to the first woman , don ’ t kill it , because she is its mother. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	3	28	All Isra ’ el heard of the decision the king had made and held the king in awe , for they saw that God ’ s wisdom was in him , enabling him to render justice properly .
CJB	1%20Kings	4	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	4	4	B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada , commander of the army ; Tzadok and Evyatar , cohanim ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	2	and these were his high officials : ‘ Azaryah the son of Tzadok , the cohen ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	3	Elichoref and Achiyah the sons of Shisha , secretaries ; Y ’ hoshafat the son of Achilud , secretary of state ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	5	‘ Azaryah the son of Natan , chief administrator ; Zavud the son of Natan , the king ’ s trusted counselor ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	6	Achishar , in charge of the palace ; Adoniram the son of ‘ Avda , in charge of forced labor .
CJB	1%20Kings	4	7	Shlomo had twelve officers over all Isra ’ el who were in charge of providing food and supplies for the king and his household ; each one was in charge of provisions for one month out of the year .
CJB	1%20Kings	4	8	They were : the son of Hur , in the hills of Efrayim ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	9	the son of Deker , in Makatz , Sha ‘ albim , Beit-Shemesh and Eilon-Beit-Hanan ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	10	the son of Hesed , in Arubot ; he also had charge of Sokhoh and all the territory of Hefer ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	11	the son of Avinadav , in all the area of Dor ; he had Tafat the daughter of Shlomo as his wife ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	12	Ba ‘ ana the son of Achilud , in Ta ‘ anakh , Megiddo , and all Beit-Sh ’ an by Tzartan below Yizre ‘ el , from Beit-Sh ’ an to Avel-M ’ cholah , as far as beyond Yokme ‘ am ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	13	the son of Gever , in Ramot-Gil ‘ ad ; he was in charge of the villages of Ya ’ ir the son of M ’ nasheh in Gil ‘ ad and in charge of the region of Argov in Bashan , sixty large cities with walls and bronze bars ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	14	Achinadav the son of ‘ Iddo , in Machanayim ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	15	Achima ‘ atz , in Naftali ; he also took Basmat the daughter of Shlomo as his wife ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	16	Ba ‘ ana the son of Hushai , in Asher and in Alot ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	17	Y ’ hoshafat the son of Paruach , in Yissakhar ;
CJB	1%20Kings	4	18	Shim ‘ i the son of Ela , in Binyamin ; and
CJB	1%20Kings	4	19	Gever the son of Uri , in the land of Gil ‘ ad , the country of Sichon king of the Emori and ‘ Og king of Bashan . Over all these , there was one administrator in the land .
CJB	1%20Kings	4	20	Y ’ hudah and Isra ’ el were as numerous as sand grains on the seashore ; they ate , drank and enjoyed themselves .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	1	) Hiram king of Tzor sent his servants to Shlomo , because he had heard that they had anointed him king in his father ’ s place , and Hiram had always loved David .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	5	) So now I intend to build a house for the name of Adonai my God , in keeping with what Adonai said to David my father , ‘ Your son , whom I will put on your throne in your place , will be the one to build the house for my name. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	5	2	) Shlomo returned this message to Hiram :
CJB	1%20Kings	5	150	bushels of fine flour ,
CJB	1%20Kings	5	310	bushels of meal ,
CJB	1%20Kings	5	3	) “ You know that David my father wasn ’ t able to build a house for the name of Adonai his God , because of the wars that beset him from every side , until Adonai put his enemies under the soles of my feet .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	4	) But now Adonai my God has given me rest on every side ; there is neither adversary nor calamity .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	6	) Therefore , order your people to cut down cedar trees from the L ’ vanon for me . My servants will be with your servants . I will pay your servants according to everything you say ; for you know that we have no one among us as skilled in felling trees as the Tzidonim. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	5	7	) When Hiram heard Shlomo ’ s message , he was very happy and said , “ Blessed be Adonai today , who has given David a wise son to rule this great people. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	5	8	) Then Hiram sent Shlomo this message : “ I have heard the message you sent me , and I will do everything you want concerning cedar logs and cypress logs .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	9	) My servants will bring them down from the L ’ vanon to the sea . I will make them into rafts to go by sea to whatever place you tell me and will have them broken up there , and you will receive them . You will compensate me by providing food for my household. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	5	10	) So Hiram gave Shlomo all the cedar logs and cypress logs he wanted ;
CJB	1%20Kings	5	11	) and Shlomo gave Hiram 100,000 bushels of wheat as food for his household and a thousand gallons of oil from pressed olives — this is what Shlomo gave Hiram each year .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	12	) Adonai gave Shlomo wisdom , as he had promised him ; and there was peace between Hiram and Shlomo — the two of them formed an alliance together .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	13	) King Shlomo conscripted 30,000 men from all Isra ’ el for forced labor .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	14	) He sent them to the L ’ vanon in monthly relays of 10,000 ; they would stay a month in the L ’ vanon and two months at home . Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	15	) Shlomo had 70,000 men to carry loads and another 80,000 stonecutters in the hills ,
CJB	1%20Kings	5	16	) besides Shlomo ’ s 3,300 supervisors who were in charge of the people doing the work .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	17	) The king gave orders ; and they quarried large stones , expensive stones , to lay the foundation of the house with cut stone .
CJB	1%20Kings	5	18	) Shlomo ’ s and Hiram ’ s builders , along with the men from G ’ val , worked the stones and prepared the timber and stones for building the house .

CJB	1%20Kings	6	6	The lowest floor of the annex was eight-and-three-quarters feet wide , the middle floor ten-and-a-half feet wide and the third floor twelve-and-a-quarter feet wide ; for he had made the outer part of the wall of the house step-shaped , so that the beams of the annex would not have to be attached to the house walls .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	2	The house which King Shlomo built for Adonai was
CJB	1%20Kings	6	105	feet long , thirty-five feet wide and fifty-two-and-a-half feet high .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	3	The hall fronting the temple of the house was thirty-five feet long , the same as the width of the house itself , so that its seventeen-and-a-half-foot width extended frontward from the house .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	4	The windows he made for the house were wide on the inside and narrow on the outside .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	5	Against the wall of the house he built an annex all the way around ; it went all the way around the walls of the house , including both the temple and the sanctuary .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	7	For the house , when under construction , was built of stone prepared at the quarry ; so that no hammer , chisel or iron tool of any kind was heard in the house while it was being built .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	8	The entrance to the lowest floor was on the south side of the house ; a spiral staircase went up to the middle floor and on to the third .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	9	So he built the house , and after finishing it , he put its roof on — cedar planks over beams .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	10	Each floor of the annex surrounding the house was eight-and-three-quarters feet high and was attached to the house with beams of cedar .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	11	Then this word of Adonai came to Shlomo :
CJB	1%20Kings	6	12	“ Concerning this house which you are building : if you will live according to my regulations , follow my rulings and observe all my mitzvot and live by them , then I will establish with you my promise that I made to David your father —
CJB	1%20Kings	6	13	I will live in it among the people of Isra ’ el , and I will not abandon my people Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	6	14	So Shlomo finished building the house .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	15	The insides of the walls of the house he built with boards of cedar : from the floor of the house to the joists of the ceiling he covered them on the inside with wood , and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	16	The thirty-five-foot back portion of the house he built with boards of cedar from the floor to the joists and reserved this part of the house to be a sanctuary , the Especially Holy Place ;
CJB	1%20Kings	6	17	while the rest of the house , that is , the temple in front , was seventy feet long .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	18	The cedar covering the house was carved with gourds and open flowers ; all was cedar ; no stone was visible .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	19	In the inner part of the house he set up the sanctuary , so that the ark for the covenant of Adonai could be placed there .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	20	This sanctuary was thirty-five feet long , wide and high ; and it was overlaid with pure gold . In front of it he set an altar , which he covered with cedar .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	21	Shlomo overlaid the interior of the house with pure gold and had chains of gold placed before the sanctuary , which itself he overlaid with gold .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	22	The entire house he overlaid with gold until it was completely covered with it . He also overlaid with gold the entire altar that belonged to the sanctuary .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	23	Inside the sanctuary he made two k ’ ruvim of olive-wood , each seventeen-and-a-half feet high .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	24	Each of the two wings of one of the k ’ ruvim was eight-and-three quarters feet long , so that the distance from the end of one wing to the end of the other was seventeen-and-a-half feet .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	25	Likewise the [ wingspread of the ] other keruv was seventeen-and-a-half feet ; both k ’ ruvim were identical in shape and size .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	26	The height of the one keruv was seventeen-and-a-half feet , likewise that of the other .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	27	He set the k ’ ruvim in the inner house ; the wings of the k ’ ruvim were stretched out , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other keruv touched the other wall ; their wings touched each other in the middle of the house .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	28	He overlaid the k ’ ruvim with gold .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	29	All around the walls of the house , both inside the sanctuary and outside it , he carved figures of k ’ ruvim , palm trees and open flowers .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	30	He overlaid the floor of the house with gold , both inside the sanctuary and outside it .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	31	For the entrance to the sanctuary he made doors of olive-wood , set within a five-sided door-frame .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	32	On the two olive-wood doors he carved figures of k ’ ruvim , palm trees and open flowers . He overlaid the doors with gold , forcing the gold into the shapes of the k ’ ruvim and palm trees as well .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	33	For the entrance to the temple he also made doorposts of olive-wood , set within a rectangular door-frame ,
CJB	1%20Kings	6	34	and two doors of cypress-wood ; the two leaves of the one door were folding , as were the two leaves of the other .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	35	On them he carved k ’ ruvim , palm trees and open flowers , overlaying them with gold fitted to the carved work .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	36	He built the inner courtyard with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	37	The foundation of the house of Adonai was laid in the fourth year , in the month of Ziv .
CJB	1%20Kings	6	38	In the eleventh year , in the month of Bul , which is the eighth month , all parts of the house were completed exactly as designed . Thus he was seven years building it .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	7	7	He made the Hall of the Throne his place for dispensing justice , that is , the Hall of Judgment ; it was covered with cedar from floor to ceiling .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	2	For he built the House of the L ’ vanon Forest
CJB	1%20Kings	7	175	feet long , eighty-seven-and-a-half feet wide and fifty-two-and-a-half feet high , on four rows of cedar posts , with cedar beams on the posts .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	3	It had a roof made of cedar and supported by beams lying on forty-five posts , fifteen in a row .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	4	There were three rows of window openings , placed so that the windows on facing walls were opposite each other at all three levels .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	5	All the doors and doorways were rectangular and opposite each other at all three levels .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	6	He made the columned hall eighty-seven-and-a-half feet long and fifty-two-and-a-half feet wide , with a columned , corniced porch in front of it .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	8	His own living quarters , in the other courtyard , set back from the Hall , were similarly designed . He also made a house like this Hall for Pharaoh ’ s daughter , whom Shlomo had taken as his wife .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	9	All these buildings were made of expensive stone blocks , cut to measure and finished by saws on the inner surfaces as well as the outer ones . These stones were used from the foundation to the eaves and outward from the buildings all the way to the Great Courtyard .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	10	The foundation was of expensive stone blocks , very large ones — stones fourteen to eighteen feet long .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	11	Above these were costly stones , cut to measure , and cedar-wood .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	12	The surrounding Great Courtyard had three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams like the inner courtyard of the house of Adonai and the courtyard by the hall of the house .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	13	King Shlomo sent for Hiram and brought him from Tzor .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	14	He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naftali , but his father was from Tzor , a bronze-worker filled with wisdom , understanding and skill for all kinds of bronze craftsmanship . He came to King Shlomo and did all his bronzework .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	15	He made the two bronze columns , each one thirty-one-and-a-half feet high and twenty-one feet in circumference .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	16	He made two capitals of melted bronze to set on the tops of the columns ; each capital was eight-and-three-quarters feet high ;
CJB	1%20Kings	7	17	he also made checker-work nets and chained wreaths , seven for the top of each capital .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	18	When he made the columns , he made two rows of pomegranates to put at the top of each column around the netting covering its capital .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	19	The capitals on the columns in the hall had shapes like lilies and were seven feet high .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	20	As for the capitals on the two columns , there were
CJB	1%20Kings	7	200	pomegranates in rows around each capital near the molding by the netting .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	21	He erected the columns in the hall of the temple ; on erecting the right column he gave it the name “ Yakhin , ” and on erecting the left column he named it “ Bo ‘ az. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	7	22	On the tops of the columns were shapes like lilies ; thus the work of the columns was finished .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	23	He made the cast metal “ Sea ” circular , seventeen-and-a-half feet from rim to rim , eight-and-three quarter feet high and fifty-two-and-a-half feet in circumference .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	24	Under its rim , three hundred gourds encircled it in two rows ; they were cast when the Sea was cast .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	25	It rested on twelve oxen , three looking north , three looking west , three looking south and three looking east , all with their hindquarters toward the center . The Sea was set on top of them .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	26	It was a handbreadth thick , its rim was made like the rim of a cup , like the flower of a lily ; and its capacity was 11,000 gallons .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	27	He made ten bronze trolleys , each one seven feet long , seven feet wide , and five-and-a-quarter feet high .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	28	They were designed with panels that were set between the corner-posts ,
CJB	1%20Kings	7	29	and on the panels between the corner-posts were lions , oxen and k ’ ruvim . The corner-posts above were similarly designed . Below the lions and oxen were wreaths of hammered work .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	30	Every trolley had four bronze wheels and bronze axles , and its four legs each had cast supports which were under the basin , with wreaths next to each .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	31	The opening of the stand into which the basin was inserted was eighteen inches high ; the stand was round , resembling a pedestal , and it was two-and-a-half feet in diameter . On the stand were carvings , and the outside was square , not round .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	32	The four wheels were under the panels , and the axles for the wheels were attached to the trolleys ; each wheel was two-and-a-half feet .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	33	The wheels were made like chariot wheels ; their axles , rims , spokes and hubs were all cast metal .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	34	There were four supports at the four corners of each trolley ; the supports were attached to the trolley itself .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	35	In the top of the trolley was a circular support ten-and-a-half inches high , and the trolley ’ s corner-posts and panels were attached to its top .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	36	On the sides of the panels and on its corners he carved k ’ ruvim , lions and palm trees , according to the amount of space each required , with wreaths surrounding .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	37	According to this design he made the ten trolleys ; all of them were cast from a single mold , so that they had the same size and shape .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	38	He made ten bronze basins ; each basin ’ s capacity was
CJB	1%20Kings	7	220	gallons and had a diameter of seven feet ; there was a basin for each of the ten trolleys .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	39	He arranged five of the trolleys on the right side of the house and five on the left side . The Sea he placed on the right side of the house , toward the southeast .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	40	Hiram made the ash pots , shovels and sprinkling basins . With that , Hiram completed all the work he had done for King Shlomo in the house of Adonai —
CJB	1%20Kings	7	41	the two columns , the two moldings of the capitals on top of the columns , the two nettings covering the two moldings of the capitals atop the columns ,
CJB	1%20Kings	7	42	the
CJB	1%20Kings	7	400	pomegranates for the two nettings , two rows of pomegranates for each netting , to cover the two moldings of the capitals atop the columns ,
CJB	1%20Kings	7	43	the ten trolleys , the ten basins on the trolleys ,
CJB	1%20Kings	7	44	the one Sea , the twelve oxen under the Sea ,
CJB	1%20Kings	7	45	the ash pots , the shovels and the sprinkling basins . All these articles that Hiram made for King Shlomo in the house of Adonai were of burnished bronze .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	46	The king cast them in the plain of the Yarden , in the clay ground between Sukkot and Tzartan .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	47	Shlomo did not weigh any of these objects , because there were so many of them ; thus the total weight of the bronze could not be determined .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	48	Shlomo made all the objects that were inside the house of Adonai : the gold altar ; the table of gold on which the showbread was displayed ;
CJB	1%20Kings	7	49	the menorahs — five on the right and five on the left in front of the sanctuary — of pure gold ; the flowers , lamps and tongs of gold ;
CJB	1%20Kings	7	50	the cups , snuffers , basins , incense pans and fire pans of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both those for the doors of the inner house , the Especially Holy Place , and those for the doors of the house , that is , of the temple .
CJB	1%20Kings	7	51	Thus all the work that King Shlomo did in the house of Adonai was finished . After this , Shlomo brought in the gifts which David his father had dedicated — the silver , the gold and the utensils — and put them in the treasuries of the house of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	8	8	The poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the sanctuary , but they could not be seen from outside ; they are there to this day .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	2	All the men of Isra ’ el assembled before King Shlomo at the festival in the month of Etanim , the seventh month .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	3	All the leaders of Isra ’ el came . The cohanim took the ark
CJB	1%20Kings	8	4	and brought up the ark of Adonai , the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils that were in the tent ; these are what the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im brought up .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	5	King Shlomo and the whole community of Isra ’ el assembled in his presence were with him in front of the ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen in numbers beyond counting or recording .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	6	The cohanim brought the ark for the covenant of Adonai in to its place inside the sanctuary of the house , to the Especially Holy Place , under the wings of the k ’ ruvim .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	7	For the k ’ ruvim spread out their wings over the place for the ark , covering the ark and its poles from above .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	9	There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moshe put there at Horev , when Adonai made the covenant with the people of Isra ’ el at the time of their leaving the land of Egypt .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	10	When the cohanim came out of the Holy Place , the cloud filled the house of Adonai ,
CJB	1%20Kings	8	11	so that , because of the cloud , the cohanim could not stand up to perform their service ; for the glory of Adonai filled the house of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	12	Shlomo said , “ Adonai said he would live in thick darkness .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	13	But I have built you a magnificent house , a place where you can live forever. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	8	14	Then the king turned around and blessed the whole community of Isra ’ el . The whole community of Isra ’ el stood
CJB	1%20Kings	8	15	as he said : “ Blessed be Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , who spoke to my father David with his mouth and fulfilled his promise with his hand . He said ,
CJB	1%20Kings	8	16	‘ Since the day I brought my people Isra ’ el out of Egypt , I chose no city from any of the tribes of Isra ’ el in which to build a house , so that my name might be there ; but I did choose David to be over my people Isra ’ el. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	8	17	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Adonai the God of Isra ’ el ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	18	but Adonai said to David my father , ‘ Although it was in your heart to build a house for my name , and you did well that it was in your heart ,
CJB	1%20Kings	8	19	nevertheless you will not build the house . Rather , you will father a son , and it will be he who will build the house for my name. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	8	20	Now Adonai has fulfilled this spoken word of his ; for I have succeeded my father and sit on the throne of Isra ’ el , as Adonai promised ; and I have built the house for the name of Adonai the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	21	And there I have made a place for the ark containing the covenant of Adonai , which he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	8	22	Then Shlomo stood before the altar of Adonai in the presence of the whole community of Isra ’ el , spread out his hands toward heaven ,
CJB	1%20Kings	8	23	and said , “ Adonai , God of Isra ’ el , there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below . You keep covenant with your servants and show them grace , provided they live in your presence with all their heart .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	24	You have kept your promise to your servant David , my father ; you spoke with your mouth and fulfilled it with your hand ; so it is today .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	25	Now therefore , Adonai , God of Isra ’ el , keep what you promised to your servant David , my father , when you said , ‘ You will never lack a man in my presence to sit on the throne of Isra ’ el , if only your children are careful about what they do , so that they live in my presence , just as you have lived in my presence. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	8	26	Now therefore , God of Isra ’ el , please let your word , which you spoke to your servant David , my father , be confirmed .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	27	“ But can God actually live on the earth ? Why , heaven itself , even the heaven of heavens , can not contain you ; so how much less this house I have built ?
CJB	1%20Kings	8	28	Even so , Adonai my God , pay attention to your servant ’ s prayer and plea , listen to the cry and prayer that your servant is praying before you today ,
CJB	1%20Kings	8	29	that your eyes will be open toward this house night and day — toward the place concerning which you said , ‘ My name will be there ’ — to listen to the prayer your servant will pray toward this place .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	30	Yes , listen to the plea of your servant , and also that of your people Isra ’ el when they pray toward this place . Hear in heaven where you live ; and when you hear , forgive !
CJB	1%20Kings	8	31	“ If a person sins against a fellow member of the community , and he is made to swear under oath , and he comes and swears before your altar in this house ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	32	then hear in heaven , act , and judge your servants , condemning the wicked , so that his way of life devolves on his own head , and vindicating the one who is right , giving him what his righteousness deserves .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	33	“ When your people Isra ’ el sin against you and in consequence are defeated by an enemy ; then if they turn back to you , acknowledge your name , and pray and make their plea to you in this house ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	34	hear in heaven , forgive the sin of your people Isra ’ el , and bring them back to the land you gave to their ancestors .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	35	“ When they sin against you , and in consequence the sky is shut , so that there is no rain ; then , if they pray toward this place , acknowledge your name and turn from their sin when you have brought them low ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	36	hear in heaven , forgive the sin of your servants and of your people Isra ’ el — since you keep teaching them the good way by which they should live — and send down rain on your land , which you have given your people as their inheritance .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	37	“ If there is famine in the land , or blight , windstorm , mildew , locusts or shearer-worms ; or if their enemy comes to the land and besieges them in any of their cities — no matter what kind of plague or sickness it is ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	38	then , regardless of what prayer or plea anyone among all your people Isra ’ el makes — for each individual will know what is plagueing his own conscience — and the person spreads out his hands toward this house ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	39	hear in heaven where you live , and forgive , and act , and , since you know what is in each one ’ s heart , give each person what his conduct deserves ( because you , and only you , know all human hearts ) ,
CJB	1%20Kings	8	40	so that they will fear you throughout the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	41	“ Also the foreigner who does not belong to your people Isra ’ el — when he comes from a distant country because of your reputation
CJB	1%20Kings	8	42	( for they will hear of your great reputation , your mighty hand and your outstretched arm ) , when he comes and prays toward this house ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	43	then hear in heaven where you live , and act in accordance with everything about which the foreigner is calling to you ; so that all the peoples of the earth will know your name and fear you , as does your people Isra ’ el , and so that they will know that this house which I have built bears your name .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	44	“ If your people go out to fight against their enemy , no matter by which way you send them , and they pray to Adonai toward the city you chose , toward the house I built for your name ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	45	then , in heaven , hear their prayer and plea , and uphold their cause .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	46	“ If they sin against you — for there is no one who doesn ’ t sin — and you are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy , so that they carry them off captive to the land of their enemy , whether far away or nearby ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	47	then , if they come to their senses in the land where they have been carried away captive , turn back and make their plea to you in the land of those who carried them off captive , saying , ‘ We sinned , we acted wrongly , we behaved wickedly , ’
CJB	1%20Kings	8	48	if , in the land of their enemies who carried them off captive , they return to you with all their heart and being and pray to you toward their own land , which you gave to their ancestors , toward the city you chose and toward the house I have built for your name ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	49	then , in heaven where you live , hear their prayer and plea , uphold their cause ,
CJB	1%20Kings	8	50	and forgive your people who have sinned against you — forgive their transgressions which they have committed against you , and give them compassion in the sight of their captors , so that they will show compassion toward them ;
CJB	1%20Kings	8	51	for they are your people , your inheritance , whom you brought out of Egypt , out of the flames of the iron furnace .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	52	“ May your eyes be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Isra ’ el , so that you will hear them whenever they cry out to you .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	53	For you made a distinction between them and all the peoples of the earth by making them your inheritance , as you said through Moshe your servant when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt , Adonai Elohim. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	8	54	When Shlomo had finished praying all this prayer and plea to Adonai , he got up from in front of the altar of Adonai , where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven ,
CJB	1%20Kings	8	55	stood up , and raised his voice to bless the whole community of Isra ’ el . He said ,
CJB	1%20Kings	8	56	“ Blessed be Adonai , who has given rest to his people Isra ’ el , in accordance with everything he promised . Not one word has failed of his good promise , which he made through Moshe his servant .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	57	May Adonai our God be with us , as he was with our ancestors . May he never leave us or abandon us .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	58	In this way he will incline our hearts toward him , so that we will live according to his ways and observe his mitzvot , laws and rulings which he ordered our fathers to obey .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	59	May these words of mine , which I have used in my plea before Adonai , be present with Adonai our God day and night , so that he will uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Isra ’ el day by day .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	60	Then all the peoples of the earth will know that Adonai is God ; there is no other .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	61	So be wholehearted with Adonai our God , living by his laws and observing his mitzvot , as you are doing today. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	8	62	Then the king , together with all Isra ’ el , offered sacrifices before Adonai .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	63	For the sacrifice of peace offerings which Shlomo offered to Adonai , he offered 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep . Thus the king and all the people of Isra ’ el dedicated the house of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	64	The same day , the king consecrated the center of the courtyard in front of the house of Adonai , because he had to offer the burnt offering , the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings there . For the bronze altar before Adonai was too small to receive the burnt offering , the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	65	So Shlomo celebrated the festival at that time . All Isra ’ el , a huge gathering [ that had come all the way ] from the entrance of Hamat to the Vadi [ of Egypt ] , celebrated with him before Adonai our God for seven days and then for seven more days — fourteen days in all .
CJB	1%20Kings	8	66	On the eighth day he sent the people away . They blessed the king and returned to their tents full of joy and glad of heart for all the goodness Adonai had shown to David his servant and to Isra ’ el his people .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	9	9	But the answer will be , ‘ It ’ s because they abandoned Adonai their God , who brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt , and took hold of other gods , worshipping and serving them ; this is why Adonai brought all these calamities on them. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	9	2	Adonai appeared to Shlomo a second time , as he had appeared to him in Giv ‘ on .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	3	Adonai said to him , “ I have heard your prayer and your plea that you made before me : I am consecrating this house which you built and placing my name there forever ; my eyes and heart will always be there .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	4	As for you , if you will live in my presence , as did David your father , in pureness of heart and uprightness , doing everything I have ordered you to do , and observing my laws and rulings ;
CJB	1%20Kings	9	5	then I will establish the throne of your rulership over Isra ’ el forever , just as I promised David your father when I said , ‘ You will never lack a man on the throne of Isra ’ el. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	9	6	But if you turn away from following me , you or your children , and do not observe my mitzvot and regulations which I have set before you , and go and serve other gods , worshipping them ;
CJB	1%20Kings	9	7	then I will cut off Isra ’ el from the land I have given them . This house , which I consecrated for my name , I will eject from my sight ; and Isra ’ el will become an example to avoid and an object of scorn among all peoples .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	8	This house , now so exalted — everyone passing by will gasp in shock at the sight of it and will ask , ‘ Why has Adonai done this to this land and to this house ? ’
CJB	1%20Kings	9	10	At the end of twenty years , during which time Shlomo had built the two buildings , the house of Adonai and the royal palace ,
CJB	1%20Kings	9	11	King Shlomo gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of the Galil ( recall that Hiram the king of Tzor had supplied Shlomo with cedar and cypress logs and with all the gold Shlomo wanted ) .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	12	Hiram came over from Tzor to see the cities Shlomo had given him , but he was not satisfied with them .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	13	He said , “ What kind of cities are these which you have given me , my brother ? ” So they have been called the land of Kabul [ good for nothing ] till this day .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	14	( Hiram had sent the king four tons of gold . )
CJB	1%20Kings	9	15	Following is the account of the forced labor levied by King Shlomo for building the house of Adonai , his own palace , the Millo , the wall of Yerushalayim , and the cities of Hatzor , Megiddo and Gezer .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	16	Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , taken Gezer , burned it to the ground and killed the Kena ‘ ani living in the city ; then he had given it as a dowry for his daughter , Shlomo ’ s wife .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	17	So Shlomo rebuilt Gezer ; he also built Lower Beit-Horon ,
CJB	1%20Kings	9	18	Ba ‘ alat , Tadmor in the desert , in the land ,
CJB	1%20Kings	9	19	as well as all the cities that Shlomo had for storing supplies , the cities for his chariots , the cities for his horsemen , and the other buildings Shlomo wanted to build for himself in Yerushalayim , in the L ’ vanon and throughout the land he ruled .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	20	All the people still left from the Emori , Hitti , P ’ rizi , Hivi , and Y ’ vusi , who were not part of the people of Isra ’ el ,
CJB	1%20Kings	9	21	that is , their descendants remaining after them in the land , whom the people of Isra ’ el were not able to destroy completely — from them Shlomo levied his forced laborers ; as it is to this day .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	22	But Shlomo did not raise any of his forced labor from the people of Isra ’ el ; rather , they were the soldiers , his servants , administrators and commanders , and the officials in charge of his chariots and horsemen .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	23	There were
CJB	1%20Kings	9	550	chief officers over Shlomo ’ s work , in charge of the workers .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	24	Pharaoh ’ s daughter came up from the City of David to her house , which Shlomo had built for her . After that he built the Millo .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	25	Three times a year Shlomo offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for Adonai , offering incense with them on the altar before Adonai . So he finished the house .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	26	King Shlomo built a fleet of ships in ‘ Etzyon-Gever , by Elot on the shore of the Sea of Suf in the land of Edom .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	27	Hiram sent some of his own servants , experienced sailors who understood the sea , to serve with Shlomo ’ s servants .
CJB	1%20Kings	9	28	They went to Ofir and took from there gold , fourteen tons of it , which they brought back to King Shlomo .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	10	10	Then she gave the king four tons of gold , a huge amount of spices , and precious stones ; never again did there arrive such an abundance of spices as those the queen of Sh ’ va gave to King Shlomo .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	2	She arrived in Yerushalayim accompanied by a very great retinue , including camels bearing spices and gold in great abundance , and precious stones . When she appeared before Shlomo she spoke with him about everything on her heart ,
CJB	1%20Kings	10	3	and Shlomo answered all her questions ; nothing was hidden from the king that he could not explain to her .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	4	After the queen of Sh ’ va had seen all Shlomo ’ s wisdom , the palace he had built ,
CJB	1%20Kings	10	5	the food at his table , the manner of seating his officials , the manner in which his staff served him , how they were dressed , his personal servants and his burnt offering which he offered in the house of Adonai , it left her breathless .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	6	She said to the king , “ What I heard in my own country about your deeds and your wisdom is true ,
CJB	1%20Kings	10	7	but I couldn ’ t believe the report until I came and saw for myself . Actually , they didn ’ t tell me even the half of it — your wisdom and prosperity surpass the reports I heard .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	8	How happy your people must be , how happy these servants of yours who are always here attending you and get to hear your wisdom !
CJB	1%20Kings	10	9	Blessed be Adonai your God , who took pleasure in you to put you on the throne of Isra ’ el . Because of Adonai ’ s eternal love for Isra ’ el , he has made you king , to administer judgment and justice fairly. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	10	11	Hiram ’ s fleet which had brought gold from Ofir now brought in from Ofir a large quantity of sandalwood and precious stones .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	12	The king used the sandalwood to make columns for the house of Adonai and for the royal palace , and also lyres and lutes for the singers . No sandalwood like it has come or been seen to this day .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	13	King Shlomo gave the queen of Sh ’ va everything she wanted , whatever she asked , in addition to the presents he gave her on his own initiative . After this , she returned and went back to her own country , she and her servants .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	14	The weight of the gold Shlomo received annually came to twenty-two tons of gold ,
CJB	1%20Kings	10	15	besides that which came from sales taxes , customs duties and assessments collected by all the kings of the mixed peoples and by the district governors .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	16	King Shlomo made
CJB	1%20Kings	10	200	large shields of hammered gold ; fifteen pounds of gold went into one shield .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	17	He made
CJB	1%20Kings	10	300	more shields of hammered gold , with three-and-three-quarters pounds going into one shield ; the king put these in the House of the L ’ vanon Forest .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	18	The king also made a large throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	19	The throne had six steps , a back with a rounded top , arms on either side of the seat , two lions standing beside the arms ,
CJB	1%20Kings	10	20	and twelve more lions standing on each side of the six steps . Nothing like it had ever been made in any kingdom .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	21	All King Shlomo ’ s drinking vessels were of gold ; and all the utensils in the House of the L ’ vanon Forest were of pure gold ; none was of silver , for in Shlomo ’ s time it was regarded as having little value .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	22	The king had a fleet of large “ Tarshish ” ships along with Hiram ’ s fleet ; once every three years the “ Tarshish ” fleet came in , bringing gold , silver , ivory , apes and peacocks .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	23	So King Shlomo surpassed all the kings on earth in both wealth and wisdom .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	24	All the earth sought to have an audience with Shlomo , in order to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	25	Each one brought his present — articles of silver , articles of gold , clothing , armor , spices , horses and mules ; and this continued year after year .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	26	Shlomo amassed chariots and horsemen ; he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen ; he assigned them to the chariot cities and to the king in Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	27	The king made silver in Yerushalayim as common as stones , and he made cedars as abundant as sycamore-fig trees are in the Sh ’ felah .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	28	Shlomo ’ s horses had been brought from Egypt and from Keveh , with the king ’ s agents having bought them from the dealers in Keveh at the going price .
CJB	1%20Kings	10	29	A chariot from Egypt cost fifteen pounds of silver shekels and a horse three-and-three quarters pounds [ of shekels ] ; all the kings of the Hittim and the kings of Aram purchased them at these prices through Shlomo ’ s agents .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	11	11	So Adonai said to Shlomo , “ Since this is what has been in your mind , and you haven ’ t kept my covenant and my regulations which I ordered you to obey , I will tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	2	nations about which Adonai had said to the people of Isra ’ el , “ You are not to go among them or they among you , because they will turn your hearts away toward their gods. ” But Shlomo was deeply attached to them by his love .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	3	He had
CJB	1%20Kings	11	700	wives , all princesses , and
CJB	1%20Kings	11	300	concubines ; and his wives turned his heart away .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	4	For when Shlomo became old , his wives turned his heart away toward other gods ; so that he was not wholehearted with Adonai his God , as David his father had been .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	5	For Shlomo followed ‘ Ashtoret the goddess of the Tzidoni and Milkom the abomination of the ‘ Amoni .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	6	Thus Shlomo did what was evil in Adonai ’ s view and did not fully follow Adonai , as David his father had done .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	7	Shlomo built a high place for K ’ mosh the abomination of Mo ’ av on the hill on front of Yerushalayim , and another for Molekh the abomination of the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	8	This is what he did for all his foreign wives , who then offered and sacrificed to their gods .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	9	So Adonai grew angry with Shlomo , because his heart had turned away from Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , who had appeared to him twice
CJB	1%20Kings	11	10	and given him orders concerning this matter that he should not follow other gods . But he didn ’ t obey Adonai ’ s orders .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	12	However , for David your father ’ s sake I won ’ t do it while you are alive , but I will tear it away from your son .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	13	Even then , I won ’ t tear away all the kingdom ; I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Yerushalayim , which I have chosen. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	11	14	Then Adonai raised up an adversary against Shlomo , Hadad the Edomi , of the royal line of Edom .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	15	Back when David had been in Edom , and Yo ’ av the commander of the army had gone up to bury the dead , having killed every male in Edom
CJB	1%20Kings	11	16	( for Yo ’ av and all Isra ’ el had stayed there six months , until he had eliminated every male in Edom ) ,
CJB	1%20Kings	11	17	Hadad had fled , he and a number of Edomi servants of his father ’ s with him , and gone into Egypt ; at the time Hadad had been but a small boy .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	18	On their way , they passed through Midyan and arrived in Pa ’ ran , took with them men from Pa ’ ran , and went on into Egypt , to Pharaoh king of Egypt . He gave Hadad a house , saw to it that he had food and gave him land .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	19	Hadad became a great favorite of Pharaoh , so that he gave him his own wife ’ s sister in marriage , that is , the sister of Tachp ’ neis the queen .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	20	The sister of Tachp ’ neis bore him G ’ nuvat his son , and Tachp ’ neis brought him up in Pharaoh ’ s own house , so that G ’ nuvat was in Pharaoh ’ s house along with Pharaoh ’ s sons .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	21	When Hadad in Egypt heard that David slept with his ancestors and Yo ’ av the commander of the army was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , “ Let me leave , so that I can return to my own country. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	11	22	Pharaoh asked him , “ But what have you lacked with me that makes you want just now to go to your own country ? ” “ Nothing in particular , ” he replied , “ but let me leave , anyway. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	11	23	God raised up another adversary against Shlomo , Rezon the son of Elyada , who had fled from his lord Hadad ‘ ezer king of Tzovah
CJB	1%20Kings	11	24	when David killed the men from Tzovah . Rezon rallied men to himself and became the leader of a band of marauders ; they went to Dammesek and settled there , while he became king of Dammesek .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	25	He remained an adversary as long as Shlomo lived , causing difficulties in addition to those of Hadad . He detested Isra ’ el and ruled Aram .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	26	Also Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , an Efrati from Tz ’ redah , whose mother ’ s name was Tz ’ ru ‘ ah , one of Shlomo ’ s servants , rebelled against the king .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	27	Here is the reason he rebelled against the king : Shlomo was building the Millo and closing the breach in [ the wall of ] the City of David his father .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	28	Now this Yarov ‘ am was a strong , energetic man ; and Shlomo , seeing how serious the young man was , made him supervisor over all the work being done by the tribe of Yosef .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	29	Once , during this period , when Yarov ‘ am had gone out of Yerushalayim , the prophet Achiyah from Shiloh spotted him traveling . Achiyah was wearing a new cloak , and the two of them were alone in open country .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	30	Achiyah took hold of his new cloak that he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	31	Then he said to Yarov ‘ am , “ Take ten pieces for yourself ! For here is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ I am going to tear the kingdom out of Shlomo ’ s hand , and I will give ten tribes to you .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	32	But he will keep one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Yerushalayim , the city I have chosen from all the tribes of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	33	I will do this because they have abandoned me and worshipped ‘ Ashtoret the goddess of the Tzidoni , K ’ mosh the god of Mo ’ av and Milkom the god of the people of ‘ Amon . They haven ’ t lived according to my ways , so that they could do what was right in my view and obey my regulations and rulings , as did David his father .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	34	Nevertheless , I will not take the entire kingdom away from him ; but I will make him prince as long as he lives , for the sake of David my servant , whom I chose , because he obeyed my mitzvot and regulations .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	35	However , I will take the kingdom away from his son and give ten tribes of it to you .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	36	To his son I will give one tribe , so that David my servant will always have a light burning before me in Yerushalayim , the city I chose for myself as the place to put my name .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	37	I will take you , and you will rule over everything you want ; you will be king over Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	38	Now if you will listen to all that I order you , live according to my ways and do what is right in my view , so that you observe my regulations and mitzvot , as David my servant did ; then I will be with you , and I will build you a lasting dynasty , as I built for David ; and I will give Isra ’ el to you .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	39	For this [ offense ] I will trouble David ’ s descendants , but not forever. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	11	40	Because of this Shlomo tried to kill Yarov ‘ am ; but Yarov ‘ am roused himself , fled to Egypt , to Shishak king of Egypt , and stayed in Egypt until the death of Shlomo .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	41	Other activities of Shlomo , all he accomplished and his wisdom are recorded in the Annals of Shlomo .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	42	The length of Shlomo ’ s reign in Yerushalayim over all Isra ’ el was forty years .
CJB	1%20Kings	11	43	Then Shlomo slept with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David his father , and Rechav ‘ am his son became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	12	12	So Yarov ‘ am and all the people came to Rechav ‘ am the third day , as the king had requested by saying , “ Come to me again the third day ” ;
CJB	1%20Kings	12	2	When Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat heard of it — for he was still in Egypt , where he had fled from Shlomo ; so Yarov ‘ am was living in Egypt ;
CJB	1%20Kings	12	3	but they sent and summoned him — Yarov ‘ am and the whole community of Isra ’ el came and said to Rechav ‘ am ,
CJB	1%20Kings	12	4	“ Your father laid a harsh yoke on us . But if you will lighten the harsh service we had to render your father and ease his heavy yoke that he put on us , we will serve you. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	12	5	He said to them , “ Leave me alone for three days , then come back to me. ” So the people left .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	6	King Rechav ‘ am consulted the older men who had been in attendance on Shlomo his father during his lifetime and asked , “ What advice would you give me as to how to answer these people ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	12	7	They said to him , “ If you will start today being a servant to these people — if you will serve them , be responsive to them and give them favorable consideration , then they will be your servants forever. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	12	8	But he didn ’ t take the advice the older men gave him ; instead he consulted the young men he had grown up with , who were now his attendants .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	9	He asked them , “ What advice would you give me , so that we can give an answer to these people who said to me , ‘ Lighten the yoke that your father laid on us ’ ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	12	10	The young men he had grown up with said to him , “ These people who said to you , ‘ Your father made our yoke heavy ; but you , make it lighter for us ’ — here ’ s the answer you should give them : ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father ’ s waist !
CJB	1%20Kings	12	11	Yes , my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , but I will make it heavier ! My father controlled you with whips , but I will control you with scorpions ! ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	12	13	and the king answered the people harshly . Abandoning the advice the older men had given him ,
CJB	1%20Kings	12	14	he addressed them according to the advice of the young men and said , “ My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add to your yoke ! My father controlled you with whips , but I will control you with scorpions ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	12	15	So the king didn ’ t listen to the people ; and that was something Adonai brought about , so that he could fulfill his word , which Adonai had spoken through Achiyah from Shiloh to Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	16	When all Isra ’ el saw that the king wasn ’ t listening to them , the people answered the king , “ Do we have any share in David ? We have no heritage in the son of Yishai ! Go to your tents , Isra ’ el ! Care for your own house , David ! ” So Isra ’ el left for their tents .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	17	But as for the people of Isra ’ el living in the cities of Y ’ hudah , Rechav ‘ am ruled over them .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	18	King Rechav ‘ am then sent Adoram , who was in charge of forced labor ; but all Isra ’ el stoned him to death . King Rechav ‘ am managed to mount his chariot and flee to Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	19	Isra ’ el has been in rebellion against the dynasty of David to this day .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	20	On hearing that Yarov ‘ am had returned , all Isra ’ el summoned him to the assembly and proclaimed him king over all Isra ’ el . No one followed the dynasty of David except the tribe of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	21	When Rechav ‘ am arrived in Yerushalayim , he assembled all the house of Y ’ hudah and the tribe of Binyamin , 180,000 select soldiers , to fight the house of Isra ’ el and bring the rulership back to Rechav ‘ am the son of Shlomo .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	22	But this word from God came to Sh ’ ma ‘ yah the man of God :
CJB	1%20Kings	12	23	“ Speak to Rechav ‘ am the son of Shlomo , king of Y ’ hudah , to all the house of Y ’ hudah and Binyamin and to the rest of the people ; tell them
CJB	1%20Kings	12	24	that this is what Adonai says : ‘ You are not to go up and fight your brothers the people of Isra ’ el ! Every man is to go back home , because this is my doing. ’ ” They paid attention to the word of Adonai and turned back , as Adonai had told them to do .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	25	Then Yarov ‘ am built up Sh ’ khem in the hills of Efrayim and lived there . After that , he left and built up P ’ nu ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	26	Nevertheless Yarov ‘ am said to himself , “ Now the rulership will return to the house of David .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	27	For if these people continue going up to offer sacrifices in the house of Adonai in Yerushalayim , their hearts will turn back to their lord , Rechav ‘ am king of Y ’ hudah . Then they will kill me and return to Rechav ‘ am king of Y ’ hudah. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	12	28	After seeking advice , the king made two calves of gold and said to the people , “ You have been going up to Yerushalayim long enough ! Here are your gods , Isra ’ el , who brought you out of the land of Egypt ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	12	29	He placed one in Beit-El and the other in Dan ,
CJB	1%20Kings	12	30	and the affair became a sin , for the people went to worship before the one [ in Beit-El and ] all the way to Dan [ to worship the other ] .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	31	He also set up temples on the high places and made cohanim from among all the people , even though they were not descended from Levi .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	32	Yarov ‘ am instituted a festival in the eighth month , on the fifteenth day of the month , similar to the festival held in Y ’ hudah ; he went up to the altar in Beit-El to sacrifice to the calves he had made ; and he placed in Beit-El the cohanim he had appointed for the high places .
CJB	1%20Kings	12	33	He went up to the altar which he had set up in Beit-El on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , in the month which he had chosen on his own , and instituted a festival for the people of Isra ’ el ; he went up to the altar to burn incense .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	13	13	He then said to his sons , “ Saddle the donkey for me. ” So they saddled the donkey for him ; and , riding on it ,
CJB	1%20Kings	13	2	And by the word from Adonai he cried out against the altar : “ Altar , altar , here is what Adonai says : ‘ A son will be born to the house of David ; his name will be Yoshiyahu ; and on you he will sacrifice the cohanim of the high places who burn incense on you ! They will burn human bones on you ! ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	3	That same day he also gave a sign : “ Here is the sign which Adonai has decreed : “ ‘ The altar will be split apart ; the ashes on it will be scattered about. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	4	When the king heard what the man of God said , how he denounced the altar in Beit-El , Yarov ‘ am took his hand away from the altar and said , “ Seize him ! ” But his hand , the one he had stretched out against him , shriveled up ; so that he could not draw it back to himself .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	5	Also the altar was split apart , and the ashes scattered from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	6	The king then responded to the man of God . “ Ask now the favor of Adonai your God , ” he said , “ and pray for me , that my hand will be restored to me. ” The man of God prayed to Adonai , and the king ’ s hand was restored to him and became as it had been before .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	7	The king then said to the man of God , “ Come home with me , and refresh yourself , and I will give you a reward .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	8	But the man of God replied to the king , “ Even if you give me half your household , I will not accept your hospitality ; nor will I eat food or drink water in this place .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	9	For this is the order I received through the word of Adonai : ‘ Don ’ t eat food or drink water , and don ’ t return by the road you took when you came. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	10	So he went another way and did not return by the road by which he had come to Beit-El .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	11	Now there lived an old prophet in Beit-El ; and one of his sons came and told him all the things the man of God had done that day in Beit-El ; also they told their father what he had said to the king .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	12	Their father asked them , “ Which way did he go ? ” For his sons had seen what road the man of God from Y ’ hudah had taken .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	14	he went after the man of God . He found him sitting under a pistachio tree and said to him , “ Are you the man of God who came from Y ’ hudah ? ” He answered , “ I am. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	15	Then he said to him , “ Come home with me and eat some food. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	16	He replied , “ I can not return with you or partake of your hospitality , nor will I eat food or drink water with you in this place ;
CJB	1%20Kings	13	17	because it was said to me by the word of Adonai , ‘ You are not to eat food or drink water there , and you are not to go back by the way you came. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	18	The other said to him , “ I too am a prophet , just like you ; and an angel spoke to me by the word of Adonai and said , ‘ Bring him back with you to your house , so that he can eat food and drink water. ’ ” But he was lying to him .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	19	So he went back with him and did eat food and drink water in his house .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	20	As they were sitting at the table , the word of Adonai came to the prophet who had brought him back ;
CJB	1%20Kings	13	21	and he cried to the man of God who had come from Y ’ hudah , “ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ Since you rebelled against the word of Adonai and didn ’ t obey the mitzvah Adonai your God gave you ,
CJB	1%20Kings	13	22	but came back and ate food and drank water in the place where he warned you not to eat food or drink water , your corpse will not arrive at the tomb of your ancestors. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	23	After he had eaten food and drunk , he saddled the donkey for the prophet he had brought back .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	24	But after he had gone , a lion encountered the man of God on the road and killed him . His corpse lay there in the road , with the donkey and the lion standing next to it .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	25	In time , people passed by and saw the corpse lying in the road with the lion standing next to it ; and they came and told about it in the city where the old prophet lived .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	26	When the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard about it , he said , “ It is the man of God who rebelled against the word of Adonai ; this is why Adonai handed him over to the lion to tear him to pieces and kill him , in keeping with the word Adonai spoke to him. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	27	To his sons he said , “ Saddle the donkey for me , ” and they saddled it .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	28	He went and found his corpse lying in the road , with the donkey and the lion standing next to the corpse ; the lion had neither eaten the corpse nor attacked the donkey .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	29	The prophet picked up the corpse of the man of God , laid it on the donkey and brought it back to the city where he lived , to mourn and bury him .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	30	He laid the corpse in his own burial cave , and they mourned him — “ Oh ! My brother ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	31	After burying him he said to his sons , “ When I die , put me in the burial cave where the man of God is buried ; lay my bones next to his bones .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	32	For the thing he cried by the word of Adonai against the altar in Beit-El and against all the temples on the high places near the cities of Shomron will surely happen. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	13	33	After this , Yarov ‘ am did not turn back from his evil way but continued appointing cohanim for the high places from among all the people ; he consecrated anyone who wanted to be a cohen of the high places .
CJB	1%20Kings	13	34	This brought sin to the house of Yarov ‘ am that would eventually cut it off and destroy it from the face of the earth .

CJB	1%20Kings	14	14	Moreover , Adonai will raise up for himself a king over Isra ’ el who at that time will cut off the house of Yarov ‘ am . And what will God do now ?
CJB	1%20Kings	14	2	Yarov ‘ am said to his wife , “ Please come , and disguise yourself , so that you won ’ t be recognized as Yarov ‘ am ’ s wife , and go to Shiloh . Achiyah the prophet is there , the one who said that I would be king over these people .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	3	Take with you ten loaves of bread , some cakes and a jug of honey ; and go to him . He will tell you what will happen to the boy. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	14	4	Yarov ‘ am ’ s wife did this ; she set out , went to Shiloh and arrived at the house of Achiyah . Now Achiyah could not see , because his eyes were dim with age .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	5	Adonai had told Achiyah , “ Yarov ‘ am ’ s wife is on her way to you to ask about her son , who is ill. You are to tell her thus and thus ; moreover , when she comes , she will be pretending she is another woman. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	14	6	When Achiyah heard the sound of her feet as she came in the door , he said , “ Enter , wife of Yarov ‘ am ! Why pretend you are someone else ? I ’ ve been given bad news for you .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	7	Go , tell Yarov ‘ am that this is what Adonai says : ‘ I raised you up from among the people , made you prince over my people Isra ’ el ,
CJB	1%20Kings	14	8	tore the kingdom away from the dynasty of David and gave it to you . In spite of this , you have not been like my servant David , who obeyed my mitzvot and followed me with all his heart , so that he could do only what I regarded as right .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	9	Rather , you have committed more evil than anyone before you ! You went and made other gods for yourself and images of cast metal to make me angry , but me you shoved behind your back !
CJB	1%20Kings	14	10	Therefore , I will now bring disaster on the house of Yarov ‘ am . I will cut off every male of Yarov ‘ am ’ s line , whether a slave or free in Isra ’ el ; I will sweep away the house of Yarov ‘ am as completely as when someone sweeps away dung until it ’ s all gone .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	11	If someone from the line of Yarov ‘ am dies in the city , the dogs will eat him ; if he dies in the countryside , the vultures will eat him . For Adonai has said it. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	14	12	So get up and go home ; when your feet enter the city , the boy will die .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	13	All Isra ’ el will mourn him , and they will bury him ; he is the only one of Yarov ‘ am ’ s line who will lie in a grave , because he alone in the house of Yarov ‘ am has in him an element of good toward Adonai the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	15	Adonai will strike Isra ’ el until it shakes like a reed in the water ; he will uproot Isra ’ el from this good land , which he gave to their ancestors , and scatter them beyond the [ Euphrates ] River ; because they made sacred poles for themselves , thus making Adonai angry .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	16	He will give up on Isra ’ el because of the sins of Yarov ‘ am , which he committed himself , and with which he made Isra ’ el sin as well. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	14	17	Yarov ‘ am ’ s wife got up , left and went to Tirtzah . The moment she reached the threshold of the house , the boy died .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	18	All Isra ’ el buried him and mourned him , in keeping with the word of Adonai spoken through his servant Achiyah the prophet .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	19	Other activities of Yarov ‘ am , how he fought and how he ruled are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	20	Yarov ‘ am ’ s reign lasted twenty-two years ; then he slept with his ancestors , and Nadav his son became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	21	Rechav ‘ am the son of Shlomo was reigning in Y ’ hudah . Rechav ‘ am was forty-one years old when he began to rule ; and he ruled seventeen years in Yerushalayim , the city Adonai had chosen from all the tribes of Isra ’ el to bear his name ; his mother ’ s name was Na ‘ amah the ‘ Amonit .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	22	Y ’ hudah did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective ; they made him angry because of their sins , which were worse than any their ancestors had committed .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	23	For they erected high places , standing-stones and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	24	Also there were male and female cult-prostitutes in the land attached to these shrines , doing all the disgusting things which the nations did that Adonai had expelled ahead of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	25	In the fifth year of King Rechav ‘ am , Shishak king of Egypt attacked Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	26	He took the treasures in the house of Adonai and the treasures in the royal palace — he took everything , including all the gold shields Shlomo had made .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	27	To replace them , King Rechav ‘ am made shields of bronze , which he entrusted to the commanders of the contingent guarding the gate to the royal palace .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	28	Whenever the king went to the house of Adonai , the guard would get the shields ; later they would return them to the guardroom .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	29	Other activities of Rechav ‘ am and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	30	But there was continual war between Rechav ‘ am and Yarov ‘ am .
CJB	1%20Kings	14	31	Rechav ‘ am slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David ; his mother ’ s name was Na ‘ amah the ‘ Amonit . Then Aviyam his son became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	15	15	He brought into the house of Adonai all the articles his father had consecrated , also the things he himself had consecrated — silver , gold and utensils .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	2	He ruled three years in Yerushalayim ; his mother ’ s name was Ma ‘ akhah the daughter of Avishalom .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	3	He committed all the sins his father had committed before him ; he was not wholehearted with Adonai his God , as David his forefather had been .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	4	Nevertheless , for David ’ s sake Adonai his God gave him a lamp burning in Yerushalayim by establishing his son after him and making Yerushalayim secure .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	5	For David had done what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective ; he had not turned away from anything he had ordered him to do , as long as he lived , except in the matter of Uriyah the Hitti .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	6	There was war between Rechav ‘ am and Yarov ‘ am as long as he lived .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	7	Other activities of Aviyam and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah . But there was war between Aviyam and Yarov ‘ am .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	8	Aviyam slept with his ancestors , and they buried him in the City of David . Then Asa his son became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	9	It was in the twentieth year of Yarov ‘ am king of Isra ’ el that Asa began his reign over Y ’ hudah .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	10	He ruled forty-one years in Yerushalayim ; his [ grand ] mother ’ s name was Ma ‘ akhah the daughter of Avishalom .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	11	Asa did what was right from the perspective of Adonai , as David his ancestor had done .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	12	He rid the land of cult-prostitutes and removed all the idols his ancestors had made .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	13	He also deposed Ma ‘ akhah from her position as queen mother , because she had made a disgusting image as an asherah . Asa cut down this image of hers and burned it in Vadi Kidron .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	14	But the high places were not removed . Nevertheless , Asa was wholehearted with Adonai throughout his life .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	16	There was war between Asa and Ba ‘ sha king of Isra ’ el as long as they both lived .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	17	Ba ‘ sha attacked Y ’ hudah , and he fortified Ramah to prevent anyone ’ s leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	18	Then Asa took all the silver and gold left among the treasures of the house of Adonai and among the treasures of the royal palace ; and , entrusting them to his servants , King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of Tavrimmon , the son of Hezyon , king of Aram , who lived in Dammesek , with this message :
CJB	1%20Kings	15	19	“ There is a covenant between me and you , which existed already between my father and your father . Here , I am sending you a present of silver and gold ; go , and break your covenant with Ba ‘ sha king of Isra ’ el , so that he will leave me alone. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	15	20	Ben-Hadad did as King Asa asked — he sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Isra ’ el , attacking ‘ Iyon , Dan , Avel-Beit-Ma ‘ akhah , all of Kinn ’ rot and all the land of Naftali .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	21	As soon as Ba ‘ sha heard of it , he stopped building Ramah and stayed in Tirtzah .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	22	King Asa then issued a proclamation requiring every man in Y ’ hudah , with no exception , to come and carry off the stones and timber Ba ‘ sha had used to fortify Ramah . With them King Asa fortified Geva of Binyamin and Mitzpah .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	23	The other activities of Asa , all his power , all his accomplishments and the cities he fortified are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah . But in his old age he suffered from a disease in his legs .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	24	Asa slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David his ancestor . Then Y ’ hoshafat his son became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	25	It was in the second year of Asa king of Y ’ hudah that Nadav the son of Yarov ‘ am began his reign over Isra ’ el , and he ruled Isra ’ el two years .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	26	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of his father and the sin through which he had made Isra ’ el sin .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	27	Ba ‘ sha the son of Achiyah , from the descendants of Yissakhar , conspired against him ; and Ba ‘ sha attacked him at Gib ’ ton , which belonged to the P ’ lishtim ; for at the time Nadav and all Isra ’ el were besieging Gib ’ ton .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	28	It was in the third year of Asa king of Y ’ hudah that Ba ‘ sha killed Nadav and became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	29	As soon as he had become king he killed off the entire house of Yarov ‘ am , destroying every living soul and leaving not one survivor . This was in keeping with what Adonai had said through his servant Achiyah from Shiloh ;
CJB	1%20Kings	15	30	it was the punishment for the sins Yarov ‘ am had committed and through which he had made Isra ’ el sin , thereby angering Adonai the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	31	Other activities of Nadav and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	32	There was war between Asa and Ba ‘ sha king of Isra ’ el as long as they both lived .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	33	It was in the third year of Asa king of Y ’ hudah that Ba ‘ sha the son of Achiyah began his reign over all Isra ’ el in Tirtzah , and his rule lasted twenty-four years .
CJB	1%20Kings	15	34	He did what was wrong from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of Yarov ‘ am and committing the sin through which he had made Isra ’ el sin .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	16	16	The troops in their camp heard it said that Zimri had plotted and killed the king , whereupon that same day , there in the camp , all Isra ’ el made ‘ Omri , the commander of the army , king over Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	2	“ I raised you up out of the dust and made you prince over my people Isra ’ el . But you have lived in the same way as Yarov ‘ am and caused my people Isra ’ el to sin , so that their sinning has made me angry .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	3	Therefore I will sweep away Ba ‘ sha and his house completely ; I will make your house like the house of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	4	If someone from the line of Ba ‘ sha dies in the city , the dogs will eat him ; if he dies in the countryside , the vultures will eat him. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	16	5	Other activities of Ba ‘ sha , his accomplishments and his power are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	6	Ba ‘ sha slept with his ancestors , and Elah his son became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	7	Through the prophet Yehu the son of Hanani the word of Adonai was proclaimed against Ba ‘ sha and his house both because he did so much evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , angering him with his actions and becoming like the house of Yarov ‘ am , and because he killed [ Nadav ] .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	8	It was in the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Y ’ hudah that Elah the son of Ba ‘ sha began his reign over all Isra ’ el in Tirtzah , and he ruled for two years .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	9	His servant Zimri , commander of half of his chariots , plotted against him . Finally , one time when Elah was in Tirtzah , drinking himself senseless in the house of Artza , administrator of the palace in Tirtzah ,
CJB	1%20Kings	16	10	Zimri entered , struck him down and killed him . This was in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Y ’ hudah ; Zimri then took Elah ’ s place as king .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	11	At the beginning of his reign , as soon as he took over the throne , he killed off the entire house of Ba ‘ sha ; he left not a single male , neither of his relatives nor of his friends .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	12	Thus Zimri eliminated all the house of Ba ‘ sha , in keeping with the word of Adonai spoken against Ba ‘ sha through Yehu the prophet . This word had been spoken
CJB	1%20Kings	16	13	because of all of Ba ‘ sha ’ s sins and the sins of Elah his son , which they committed and with which they made Isra ’ el sin , thereby angering Adonai the God of Isra ’ el with their worthless idols .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	14	Other activities of Elah and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	15	It was in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Y ’ hudah that Zimri ruled for seven days in Tirtzah . At that time , the army was besieging Gib ’ ton , which belonged to the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	17	‘ Omri and all Isra ’ el with him withdrew from Gib ’ ton and besieged Tirtzah .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	18	When Zimri saw that the city had been captured , he went into the citadel of the royal palace and burned down the royal palace over him , so that he died .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	19	This came about because of the sins he committed in doing what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , in living as Yarov ‘ am had lived , and in sinning by making Isra ’ el sin .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	20	Other activities of Zimri and his conspiracy are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	21	At this point the people of Isra ’ el divided into two factions . Half of the people went after Tivni the son of Ginat to make him king , while the other half followed ‘ Omri .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	22	But the faction supporting ‘ Omri won out over that of Tivni the son of Ginat ; so Tivni died , and ‘ Omri became king .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	23	It was in the thirty-first year of Asa king of Y ’ hudah that ‘ Omri began his reign over Isra ’ el , and he ruled for twelve years , six of them in Tirtzah .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	24	He bought Mount Shomron from Shemer for
CJB	1%20Kings	16	132	pounds of silver . On the mountain he built a city , which he named Shomron after Shemer , who had owned the mountain .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	25	‘ Omri did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , outdoing all his predecessors in wickedness ;
CJB	1%20Kings	16	26	for he lived entirely in the manner of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , committing the sins with which he made Isra ’ el sin , thereby angering Adonai the God of Isra ’ el with their worthless idols .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	27	Other activities of ‘ Omri and the power he demonstrated are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	28	Then ‘ Omri slept with his ancestors and was buried in Shomron , and Ach ’ av his son became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	29	It was in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Y ’ hudah that Ach ’ av the son of ‘ Omri began his rule over Isra ’ el ; Ach ’ av the son of ‘ Omri ruled twenty-two years over Isra ’ el in Shomron .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	30	Ach ’ av the son of ‘ Omri did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , outdoing all his predecessors [ in wickedness ] .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	31	But then , as if it had been a trifling thing for him to commit the sins of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , he took as his wife Izevel the daughter of Etba ‘ al king of the Tzidonim , and went and served Ba ‘ al and worshipped him .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	32	He erected an altar for Ba ‘ al in the house of Ba ‘ al , which he had built in Shomron .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	33	Ach ’ av also set up the asherah ; indeed , Ach ’ av did more to anger Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , than all the kings of Isra ’ el preceding him .
CJB	1%20Kings	16	34	It was during his time that Hi ’ el of Beit-El rebuilt Yericho . He laid its foundation at the cost of his firstborn son Aviram and erected its gates at the cost of his youngest son S ’ guv . This was in keeping with the word of Adonai spoken through Y ’ hoshua the son of Nun .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	17	17	A while later , the son of the woman whose house it was fell ill ; his illness grew increasingly serious until his breathing stopped .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	2	Then the word of Adonai came to him :
CJB	1%20Kings	17	3	“ Leave here , turn to the east , and hide in Vadi K ’ rit near the Yarden .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	4	You are to drink from the stream , and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	5	So he went and acted according to the word of Adonai — he went and lived in Vadi K ’ rit near the Yarden .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	6	The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning , and bread and meat in the evening ; and he drank from the stream .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	7	After a while the stream dried up , because there was no rain in the land .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	8	Then this word of Adonai came to him :
CJB	1%20Kings	17	9	“ Get up ; go to Tzarfat , a village in Tzidon ; and live there . I have ordered a widow there to provide for you. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	10	So he set out and went to Tzarfat . On reaching the gate of the city , he saw a widow there gathering sticks . He called out to her , “ Please bring a little water in a container for me to drink. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	11	As she was going to get it , he called after her , “ Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	12	She answered , “ As Adonai your God lives , I have nothing baked , only a handful of meal in a pot and a little oil in the jug . Here I am , gathering a couple sticks of wood , so that I can go and cook it for myself and my son . After we have eaten that , we will die. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	13	Eliyahu said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Go ; and do what you said ; but first , use a little of it to make me a small loaf of bread ; and bring it out to me . After that , make food for yourself and your son .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	14	For this is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ The pot of meal will not get used up , nor will there fail to be oil in the jug , until the day Adonai sends rain down on the land. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	15	She went and acted according to what Eliyahu had said ; and she , he and her household had food to eat for a long time .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	16	The pot of meal did not get used up , nor did there fail to be oil in the jug , in fulfillment of the word of Adonai spoken through Eliyahu .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	18	She said to Eliyahu , “ What do you have against me , you man of God ? Did you come to me just to remind me how sinful I am by killing my son ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	19	“ Give me your son , ” he said to her . Taking him from her lap , he carried him into the room upstairs where he was staying and laid him on his own bed .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	20	Then he cried out to Adonai : “ Adonai my God ! Have you brought also this misery on the widow I ’ m staying with by killing her son ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	21	He stretched himself out on the child three times and cried out to Adonai : “ Adonai my God , please ! Let this child ’ s soul come back into him ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	22	Adonai heard Eliyahu ’ s cry , the child ’ s soul came back into him , and he revived .
CJB	1%20Kings	17	23	Eliyahu took the child , brought him down from the upstairs room into the house and gave him to his mother ; and Eliyahu said , “ See ? Your son is alive. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	17	24	The woman replied to Eliyahu , “ Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of Adonai that you speak is the truth . ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	18	18	He answered , “ I haven ’ t troubled Isra ’ el , you have , you and your father ’ s house , by abandoning Adonai ’ s mitzvot and following the ba ‘ alim .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	2	When Eliyahu went to present himself to Ach ’ av , the famine in Shomron had become severe .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	3	Ach ’ av called ‘ Ovadyah , who was in charge of the palace . Now ‘ Ovadyah greatly revered Adonai ;
CJB	1%20Kings	18	4	for example , when Izevel was murdering Adonai ’ s prophets , ‘ Ovadyah took a hundred prophets , hid them in two caves , fifty in each , and supplied them with food and water .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	5	Ach ’ av said to ‘ Ovadyah , “ Go throughout the land , and check all the springs and vadis ; maybe we can find grass somewhere , so that we can keep the horses and mules alive and not lose all the animals. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	6	So they divided between them the territory to be visited ; Ach ’ av went one way by himself , and ‘ Ovadyah went another way by himself .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	7	‘ Ovadyah was on the road when suddenly Eliyahu encountered him . ‘ Ovadyah recognized him , fell on his face and said , “ Is it really you , my lord Eliyahu ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	8	He answered , “ Yes , it is I ; go , tell your master , ‘ Eliyahu is here. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	9	‘ Ovadyah replied , “ How have I sinned , that you would hand your servant over to Ach ’ av to kill me ?
CJB	1%20Kings	18	10	As Adonai your God lives , there can ’ t be a single nation or kingdom where my master hasn ’ t sent to search you out ; and in each kingdom or nation where they said , ‘ He isn ’ t here , ’ he made them take an oath that they hadn ’ t found you .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	11	Now you say , ‘ Go tell your master , “ Eliyahu is here. ” ’
CJB	1%20Kings	18	12	But as soon as I leave you , the Spirit of Adonai will carry you off to I don ’ t know where ; so that when I come and tell Ach ’ av , and he can ’ t find you , he will kill me . But I your servant have revered Adonai from my youth —
CJB	1%20Kings	18	13	wasn ’ t my lord told what I did when Izevel killed Adonai ’ s prophets , how I hid a hundred of Adonai ’ s prophets by fifties in caves and supplied their food and water ?
CJB	1%20Kings	18	14	Now you say , ‘ Go tell your master , “ Look , Eliyahu is here. ” ’ Why , he ’ ll kill me ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	15	Eliyahu said , “ As Adonai-Tzva ’ ot lives , before whom I stand , I will present myself to him today. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	16	So ‘ Ovadyah went , found Ach ’ av and told him ; and Ach ’ av went to meet Eliyahu .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	17	When Ach ’ av saw Eliyahu , Ach ’ av said to him , “ Is it really you , you troubler of Isra ’ el ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	19	Now order all Isra ’ el to assemble before me on Mount Karmel , along with the
CJB	1%20Kings	18	450	.
CJB	1%20Kings	18	400	prophets of the asherah who eat at Izevel ’ s table. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	20	Ach ’ av sent word to all the people of Isra ’ el and assembled the prophets together on Mount Karmel .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	21	Eliyahu stepped forward before all the people and said , “ How long are you going to jump back and forth between two positions ? If Adonai is God , follow him ; but if it ’ s Ba ‘ al , follow him ! ” The people answered him not a word .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	22	Then Eliyahu said to the people , “ I , I alone , am the only prophet of Adonai who is left , while Ba ‘ al ’ s prophets number
CJB	1%20Kings	18	23	Let them give us two young bulls , and they can choose the bull they want for themselves . Then let them cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood but put no fire under it . I will prepare the other bull , lay it on the wood and put no fire under it .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	24	Then , you , call on the name of your god ; and I will call on the name of Adonai ; and the God who answers with fire , let him be God ! ” All the people answered , “ Good idea ! Agreed ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	25	Then Eliyahu said to the prophets of Ba ‘ al , “ Choose one bull for yourselves , and prepare it first ; because there are many of you . Then call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	26	They took the bull that was given to them , prepared it and called on the name of Ba ‘ al from morning till noon — “ Ba ‘ al ! Answer us ! ” But no voice was heard ; and no one answered , as they jumped around on the altar they had made .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	27	Around noon Eliyahu began ridiculing them : “ Shout louder ! After all , he ’ s a god , isn ’ t he ? Maybe he ’ s daydreaming , or he ’ s on the potty , or he ’ s away on a trip . Maybe he ’ s asleep , and you have to wake him up. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	28	So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and knives , as their custom was , until blood gushed out all over them .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	29	By now it was afternoon , and they went on ranting and raving until it was time for the evening offering . But no voice came , no one answered , no one paid any attention .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Eliyahu said to all the people , “ Come here to me. ” All the people came up to him , as he set about repairing the altar of Adonai that had been broken down .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	31	Eliyahu took twelve stones , in keeping with the number of tribes of the sons of Ya ‘ akov , to whom the word of Adonai had come , saying , “ Your name is to be Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	32	With the stones he built an altar in the name of Adonai . Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough for half a bushel of grain .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	33	He arranged the wood , cut up the bull and laid it on the wood .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	34	Then he said , “ Fill four pots with water , and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood. ” They did it . “ Do it again , ” he said , and they did it again . “ Do it a third time , ” he said , and they did it a third time .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	35	By now the water was flowing around the altar , and it had filled the trench .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	36	Then , when it came time for offering the evening offering , Eliyahu the prophet approached and said , “ Adonai , God of Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Isra ’ el , let it be known today that you are God in Isra ’ el , and that I am your servant , and that I have done all these things at your word .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	37	Hear me , Adonai , hear me , so that this people may know that you , Adonai , are God , and that you are turning their hearts back to you. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	38	Then the fire of Adonai fell . It consumed the burnt offering , the wood , the stones and the dust ; and it licked up the water in the trench .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	39	When all the people saw it , they fell on their faces and said , “ Adonai is God ! Adonai is God ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	40	Eliyahu said to them , “ Seize the prophets of Ba ‘ al ! Don ’ t let one of them escape ! ” They seized them ; and Eliyahu brought them down to Vadi Kishon and killed them there .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	41	Then Eliyahu said to Ach ’ av , “ Get up , eat , and drink , because I hear the sound of heavy rain. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	42	Ach ’ av went up to eat and drink , while Eliyahu went up to the top of the Karmel . He bowed down to the ground and put his face between his knees .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	43	“ Now , ” he said to his servant , “ go up , and look out toward the sea. ” He went up , looked , and said , “ There ’ s nothing there. ” Seven times he said , “ Go again. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	44	The seventh time , the servant said , “ Now there ’ s a cloud coming up out of the sea , no bigger than a man ’ s hand. ” Eliyahu said , “ Go up , and say to Ach ’ av , ‘ Prepare your chariot , and get down the mountain before the rain stops you ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	18	45	A little later , the sky grew black with clouds and wind ; and heavy rain began falling ; as Ach ’ av , riding in his chariot , made for Yizre ‘ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	18	46	The hand of Adonai was on Eliyahu ; he tucked up his clothing and ran ahead of Ach ’ av to the entrance of Yizre ‘ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	19	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	19	19	So he left and found Elisha the son of Shafat . He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen ; he himself was behind the twelfth . Eliyahu went over to him and threw his cloak on him .
CJB	1%20Kings	19	2	Then Izevel sent a messenger to say to Eliyahu , “ May the gods do terrible things to me and worse ones besides if by this time tomorrow I haven ’ t taken your life , just as you took theirs ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	3	On seeing that , he got up and fled for his life . When he arrived in Be ’ er-Sheva , in Y ’ hudah , he left his servant there ;
CJB	1%20Kings	19	4	but he himself went a day farther into the desert , until he came to a broom tree . He sat down under it and prayed for his own death . “ Enough ! ” he said . “ Now , Adonai , take my life . I ’ m no better than my ancestors. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	5	Then he lay down under the broom tree and went to sleep . Suddenly , an angel touched him and said to him , “ Get up and eat ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	6	He looked , and there by his head was a cake baked on the hot stones and a jug of water . He ate and drank , then lay down again .
CJB	1%20Kings	19	7	The angel came again , a second time , touched him and said , “ Get up and eat , or the journey will be too much for you. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	8	He got up , ate and drank , and , on the strength of that meal , traveled forty days and nights until he reached Horev the mountain of God .
CJB	1%20Kings	19	9	There he went into a cave and spent the night . Then the word of Adonai came to him ; he said to him , “ What are you doing here , Eliyahu ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	10	He answered , “ I have been very zealous for Adonai the God of armies , because the people of Isra ’ el have abandoned your covenant , broken down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword . Now I ’ m the only one left , and they ’ re coming after me to kill me too. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	11	He said , “ Go outside , and stand on the mountain before Adonai ” ; and right then and there , Adonai went past . A mighty blast of wind tore the mountains apart and broke the rocks in pieces before Adonai , but Adonai was not in the wind . After the wind came an earthquake , but Adonai was not in the earthquake .
CJB	1%20Kings	19	12	After the earthquake , fire broke out ; but Adonai was not in the fire . And after the fire came a quiet , subdued voice .
CJB	1%20Kings	19	13	When Eliyahu heard it , he covered his face with his cloak , stepped out and stood at the entrance to the cave . Then a voice came to him and said , “ What are you doing here , Eliyahu ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	14	He answered , “ I have been very zealous for Adonai the God of armies ; because the people of Isra ’ el have abandoned your covenant , broken down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword . Now I ’ m the only one left , and they ’ re after me to kill me too. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	15	Adonai said to him , “ Go back by way of the Dammesek Desert . When you get there , anoint Haza ’ el to be king over Aram .
CJB	1%20Kings	19	16	Also anoint Yehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Isra ’ el , and anoint Elisha the son of Shafat of Avel-M ’ cholah to be prophet after you .
CJB	1%20Kings	19	17	Yehu will kill whoever escapes the sword of Haza ’ el , and Elisha will kill whoever escapes the sword of Yehu .
CJB	1%20Kings	19	18	Still , I will spare seven thousand in Isra ’ el , every knee that hasn ’ t bent down before Ba ‘ al and every mouth that has not kissed him. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	20	He left the oxen , ran after Eliyahu and said , “ Please let me kiss my father and mother good-bye ; then I will follow you. ” He answered , “ Go ; but return , because of what I did to you. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	19	21	Elisha stopped following him . Then he took the yoke of oxen , slaughtered them , cooked their meat over the wooden yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people to eat . Then he got up , went after Eliyahu and became his servant .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	20	20	and each one killed his man . Aram fled , and Isra ’ el pursued them . Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of the cavalry .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	2	He sent messengers inside the city to Ach ’ av king of Isra ’ el
CJB	1%20Kings	20	3	to say to him , “ Here is the message from Ben-Hadad : ‘ Your silver and gold are mine , also your wives and your best children are mine. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	4	The king of Isra ’ el answered , “ Just as you say , my lord , king ; I am yours , along with everything I own. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	5	The messengers returned and said , “ Here is Ben-Hadad ’ s response : ‘ I sent you a message to hand over your silver , gold , wives and children to me .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	6	But I am going to send my servants to you tomorrow around this time ; they will ransack your house and the houses of your servants ; and whatever they see that they like they will seize and remove. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	7	Then the king of Isra ’ el summoned all the leaders of the land and said , “ Please take notice ! Do you see how this man is trying to make trouble ? First he demanded my wives , children , silver and gold ; and I denied him nothing. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	8	All the leaders and all the people said to him , “ Don ’ t listen , and don ’ t agree. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	9	So he said to Ben-Hadad ’ s messengers , “ Tell my lord the king , ‘ I will do all that you asked of me the first time , but this I can not do. ” The messengers left and brought word back to him .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	10	Ben-Hadad then sent this message to him : “ May the gods do terrible things to me and worse ones as well if there ’ s enough dust in Shomron to give each of my followers a handful ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	11	The king of Isra ’ el answered , “ Tell him : ‘ He who is putting on his armor shouldn ’ t boast as if he were taking it off ! ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	12	It happened that Ben-Hadad received this message when he was drinking , he and his kings , in the field-barracks . He ordered his servants : “ Take up your battle positions ! ” So they got ready to attack the city .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	13	At that moment a prophet approached Ach ’ av king of Isra ’ el and said , “ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ Have you seen this vast army ? I am going to give you victory over them today . Then you will know that I am Adonai ! ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	14	Ach ’ av asked , “ Who will defeat them ? ” He answered , “ This is what Adonai says : ‘ The young men who serve the district governors. ’ ” He asked , “ Who will start the fighting ? ” and he answered , “ You will. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	15	He counted the district governors ’ young men ; there were
CJB	1%20Kings	20	232	. After that , he counted all the people , all the people of Isra ’ el ; there were 7,000 .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	16	They set out at noon . Ben-Hadad was drinking himself senseless in the field-barracks , he and the kings , the thirty-two kings who were his allies .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	17	The district governors ’ men went out first . Ben-Hadad sent for information , and they reported , “ Men have come out from Shomron. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	18	He said , “ Whether they have come out for peace or for war , take them alive. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	19	So the district governors ’ men left the city , followed by the army ;
CJB	1%20Kings	20	21	The king of Isra ’ el went out and attacked the horses and chariots , inflicting a massive defeat on Aram .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	22	Afterwards , the prophet approached the king of Isra ’ el and said to him , “ Go , regroup your forces , and think carefully what to do , for next year at this time the king of Aram will renew his attack. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	23	Meanwhile , the servants of the king of Aram said to him , “ Their God is a God of the hills ; that ’ s why they were stronger than we were . But if we fight them on level ground , we will certainly be stronger than they are .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	24	Also do this : remove all the kings from their commands , and put professional officers in their place .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	25	Then recruit an army as big as the army you lost , horse for horse and chariot for chariot . We will attack them on level ground , and we will certainly be stronger than they. ” He heeded what they said and acted accordingly .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	26	At the same time the following year , Ben-Hadad mustered the army of Aram and went up to Afek to attack Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	27	The army of Isra ’ el , already mobilized and supplied , went to meet them ; but the army of Isra ’ el , encamped opposite them , looked like two herds of goats ; while Aram filled the land .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	28	At this point , a man of God approached and said to the king of Isra ’ el , “ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ Because Aram said that Adonai is a God of the hills but not a God of the valleys , I will hand over to you this entire huge army . Then you will know that I am Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	29	They remained in camp opposite each other for seven days . On the seventh day , the battle began ; and the people of Isra ’ el killed 100,000 soldiers of Aram in a single day .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	30	The rest fled to Afek , into the city ; and the wall fell on 27,000 of the men who were left . Ben-Hadad fled into the city and took refuge in an inside room .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	31	His servants said to him , “ Here now , we have heard that the kings of the house of Isra ’ el are merciful kings . If it ’ s all right with you , let ’ s put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads , and go out to the king of Isra ’ el . Maybe he will spare your life. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	32	So they put sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads , went to the king of Isra ’ el and said , “ Your servant Ben-Hadad says , ‘ Please spare my life. ’ ” And he answered , “ He ’ s still alive ? He is my brother. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	33	The men took this as a promising indication and seized on it to say , “ Yes , Ben-Hadad is your brother. ” Then Ach ’ av said , “ Go , and bring him here. ” Ben-Hadad went out to him , and Ach ’ av had him climb up into his chariot .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	34	Ben-Hadad said to him , “ I will return the cities my father took from your father . Also you can set up markets for trade in Dammesek , as my father did in Shomron. ” “ If you put this covenant in writing , ” said Ach ’ av , “ I will set you free. ” So he made a covenant with him and set him free .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	35	One of the members of the prophets ’ guild said to another one , by the word of Adonai , “ Hit me ! ” But the man refused to hit him .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	36	Then he said to him , “ Because you didn ’ t listen to the voice of Adonai , the moment you leave me , a lion will kill you. ” No sooner had he left him than a lion found him and killed him .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	37	The prophet went to another man and said , “ Hit me ! ” The man struck him a blow and wounded him .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	38	The prophet left and waited for the king by the road , disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	39	As the king passed by , he called out to the king and said , “ Your servant was on his way into the thick of the fighting when someone turned , brought a man to me and said , ‘ Guard this man ! If he is missing , you will pay for his life with yours ; or else you will pay sixty-six pounds of silver. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	20	40	But while your servant was busy with one thing and another , he disappeared. ” The king of Isra ’ el said to him , “ So that is your sentence ; you have pronounced it on yourself. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	41	Quickly he removed the bandage from his eyes , and the king of Isra ’ el recognized him as one of the prophets .
CJB	1%20Kings	20	42	Then he said to the king , “ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ Because you have let escape the man I had given over to be destroyed , you will pay with your life for his life and with your people for his people. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	20	43	The king of Isra ’ el returned home to Shomron resentful and depressed .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	21	21	‘ Here , ’ [ says Adonai , ] ‘ I am bringing disaster on you ! I will sweep you away completely ; I will cut off from Ach ’ av every male , whether a slave or free in Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	2	Ach ’ av spoke to Navot and said , “ Give me your vineyard , so that I can have it as my vegetable garden , because it ’ s close to my palace . In exchange I will give you a better vineyard ; or , if you prefer , I will give you its monetary value. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	3	But Navot said to Ach ’ av , “ Adonai forbid that I should give you my ancestral heritage ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	4	Ach ’ av went home resentful and depressed at what Navot the Yizre ‘ eli had said to him , since he had said , “ I won ’ t give you my ancestral heritage. ” He lay down on his bed , turned his face away and refused to eat .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	5	Izevel his wife went and said to him , “ Why are you so depressed that you refuse to eat ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	6	He answered her , “ Because I spoke to Navot the Yizre ‘ eli and said to him , “ Sell me your vineyard for money ; or else , if you prefer , I will give you another vineyard for it ” ; but he answered , “ I won ’ t give you my vineyard. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	7	“ Are you the king of Isra ’ el or not ? ” asked his wife Izevel . “ Get up , eat some food , and cheer up ! I will give you the vineyard of Navot the Yizre ‘ eli. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	8	So she wrote letters in Ach ’ av ’ s name , sealed them with his seal and sent the letters to the leaders and notables of the city where Navot lived .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	9	In the letters she wrote , “ Proclaim a fast , and give Navot the seat of honor among the people .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	10	Have two good-for-nothing men sit opposite him , and have them accuse him publicly of cursing God and the king . Then take him outside and stone him to death. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	11	The leaders and notables of the city he lived in did as Izevel had written in the letters she sent to them .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	12	They proclaimed a fast and gave Navot the seat of honor among the people .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	13	The two good-for-nothing men came in and sat opposite him , and these scoundrels publicly accused Navot , saying , “ Navot cursed God and the king. ” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death ,
CJB	1%20Kings	21	14	then sent a message to Izevel , “ Navot has been stoned to death. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	15	When Izevel heard that Navot had been stoned to death , she said to Ach ’ av , “ Get up , and take possession of the vineyard that Navot the Yizre ‘ eli refused to sell you , because Navot is no longer alive ; he is dead. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	16	When Ach ’ av heard that Navot was dead , he set out to go down to the vineyard of Navot the Yizre ‘ eli , to take possession of it .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	17	But the word of Adonai came to Eliyahu from Tishbe :
CJB	1%20Kings	21	18	“ Get up , go down to meet Ach ’ av king of Isra ’ el , who lives in Shomron . Right now he is in the vineyard of Navot ; he has gone down there to take possession of it .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	19	This is what you are to say to him : ‘ Here is what Adonai says : “ You have committed murder , and now you are stealing the victim ’ s property ! ” ’ Also say to him , ‘ Here is what Adonai says : “ In the very place where dogs licked up the blood of Navot , dogs will lick up your blood — yours ! ” ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	20	Ach ’ av said to Eliyahu , “ My enemy ! You ’ ve found me ! ” He answered , “ Yes , I have found you ; because you have given yourself over to do what is evil from Adonai ’ s perspective .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	22	I will make your house like the house of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat and like the house of Ba ‘ sha the son of Achiyah for provoking my anger and leading Isra ’ el into sin. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	21	23	Adonai also said this about Izevel : ‘ The dogs will eat Izevel by the wall around Yizre ‘ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	24	If someone from the line of Ach ’ av dies in the city , the dogs will eat him ; if he dies in the countryside , the vultures will eat him. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	21	25	Truly , there was never anyone like Ach ’ av . Stirred up by his wife Izevel , he gave himself over to do what is evil from Adonai ’ s perspective .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	26	His behavior in following idols was grossly abominable ; he did everything the Emori had done , whom Adonai expelled ahead of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	27	Ach ’ av , on hearing these words , tore his clothes , put sackcloth on himself and fasted . He slept in the sackcloth and went about dejectedly .
CJB	1%20Kings	21	28	Then the word of Adonai came to Eliyahu from Tishbe :
CJB	1%20Kings	21	29	“ Do you see how Ach ’ av has humbled himself before me ? Since he has humbled himself before me , I will not bring this evil during his lifetime ; but during his son ’ s lifetime I will bring the evil on his house . ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	1	Kings
CJB	1%20Kings	22	22	Adonai asked , ‘ How ? ’ and he answered , ‘ I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets. ’ Adonai said , ‘ You will succeed in enticing him . Go , and do it. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	22	2	Then , in the third year , Y ’ hoshafat the king of Y ’ hudah came down to the king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	3	The king of Isra ’ el said to his servants , “ Are you aware that Ramot-Gil ‘ ad belongs to us ; yet , we ’ re doing nothing to recover it from the king of Aram ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	4	He said to Y ’ hoshafat , “ Will you go with me to attack Ramot-Gil ‘ ad ? ” Y ’ hoshafat answered the king of Isra ’ el , “ I ’ m with you all the way ; think of my troops and horses as yours. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	5	But Y ’ hoshafat said to the king of Isra ’ el , “ First , we should seek the word of Adonai. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	6	So the king of Isra ’ el assembled the prophets , about
CJB	1%20Kings	22	400	men . “ Should I attack Ramot-Gil ‘ ad ? ” he asked them , “ Or should I hold off ? ” They said , “ Attack ! Adonai will hand it over to the king. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	7	But Y ’ hoshafat said , “ Besides these , isn ’ t there a prophet of Adonai here that we can consult ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	8	The king of Isra ’ el said to Y ’ hoshafat , “ Yes , there is still one man through whom we can consult Adonai , Mikhay ’ hu the son of Yimlah ; but I hate him , because he doesn ’ t prophesy good things for me , but bad ! ” Y ’ hoshafat replied , “ The king shouldn ’ t say such a thing. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	9	Then the king of Isra ’ el called an officer and said , “ Quickly ! Bring Mikhay ’ hu the son of Yimlah. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	10	Now the king of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hoshafat the king of Y ’ hudah were each sitting on his throne , dressed in their royal robes , on a threshing-floor at the entrance to the gate of Shomron ; and all the prophets were there , prophesying in their presence .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	11	Tzidkiyah the son of Kena ‘ anah had made himself some horns out of iron and said , “ This is what Adonai says : ‘ With these you will gore Aram until they are destroyed. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	12	All the prophets prophesied the same thing : “ Go up and attack Ramot-Gil ‘ ad . You will succeed , for Adonai will hand it over to the king. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	13	The messenger who had gone to call Mikhay ’ hu said to him , “ Here , now , the prophets are unanimously predicting success for the king . Please let your word be like the word of one of them — say something good. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	14	But Mikhay ’ hu answered , “ As Adonai lives , whatever Adonai says to me is what I will say. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	15	When he reached the king , the king asked him , “ Mikhay ’ hu , should we go up and attack Ramot-Gil ‘ ad ; or should we hold off ? ” He answered , “ Go up , you will succeed , Adonai will hand it over to the king. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	16	The king said to him , “ How many times do I have to warn you to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of Adonai ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	17	Then he said , “ I saw all Isra ’ el scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd ; and Adonai said , ‘ These men have no leader ; let everyone go home in peace. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	18	The king of Isra ’ el said to Y ’ hoshafat , “ Didn ’ t I tell you that he wouldn ’ t prophesy good things about me , but bad ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	19	Mikhay ’ hu continued : “ Therefore hear the word of Adonai . I saw Adonai sitting on his throne with the whole army of heaven standing by him on his right and on his left .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	20	Adonai asked , ‘ Who will entice Ach ’ av to go up to his death at Ramot-Gil ‘ ad ? ’ One of them said , ‘ Do it this way , ’ and another , ‘ Do it that way. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	22	21	Then a spirit stepped up , stood in front of Adonai and said , ‘ I will entice him. ’
CJB	1%20Kings	22	23	So now Adonai has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours ; meanwhile , Adonai has ordained disaster for you. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	24	Then Tzidkiyah the son of Kena ‘ anah came up , slapped Mikhay ’ hu in the face and said , “ And how did the Spirit of Adonai leave me to speak to you ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	25	Mikhay ’ hu said , “ You ’ ll find out the day you go into an inside room , trying to hide. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	26	The king of Isra ’ el said , “ Seize Mikhay ’ hu , and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and Yo ’ ash the king ’ s son .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	27	Say , ‘ The king says to put this man in prison ; and feed him only bread and water , and not much of that , until I return in peace. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	28	Mikhay ’ hu said , “ If you return in peace at all , Adonai has not spoken through me ! ” Then he added , “ Did you hear me , you peoples , all of you ? ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	29	So the king of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hoshafat the king of Y ’ hudah went up to Ramot-Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	30	The king of Isra ’ el said to Y ’ hoshafat , “ I will disguise myself and go into battle ; but you , put on your robes. ” So the king of Isra ’ el disguised himself and went into battle .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	31	Now the king of Aram had ordered the thirty-two chariot commanders , “ Don ’ t attack anyone of either high or low rank , only the king of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	32	So when the chariot commanders saw Y ’ hoshafat they said , “ This must be the king of Isra ’ el , ” and turned to attack him . But Y ’ hoshafat gave a yell ,
CJB	1%20Kings	22	33	so that the chariot commanders saw that he wasn ’ t the king of Isra ’ el and stopped pursuing him .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	34	However , one soldier shot an arrow at random and struck the king of Isra ’ el between his lower armor and his breastplate . So the king said to his chariot-driver , “ Turn the reins , and take me out of the fighting ; I ’ m collapsing from my wounds. ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	35	But the fighting grew fiercer that day ; and they propped the king upright in his chariot facing Aram until he died , in the evening , with the blood streaming from his wound onto the floor of the chariot .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	36	Around sundown , a cry spread through the ranks : “ Every man to his own town ! Every man to his own land ! ”
CJB	1%20Kings	22	37	So the king died and was brought to Shomron , and they buried the king in Shomron .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	38	They washed the chariot at the Pool of Shomron where the prostitutes bathed , and the dogs licked up his blood , in keeping with the word Adonai had spoken .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	39	Other activities of Ach ’ av ’ s reign , all his accomplishments , the ivory palace he built and all the cities he built are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	40	So Ach ’ av slept with his ancestors , and Achazyah his son became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	41	Y ’ hoshafat the son of Asa began his reign over Y ’ hudah in the fourth year of Ach ’ av king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	42	Y ’ hoshafat was thirty-five years old when he began to rule , and he ruled twenty-five years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was ‘ Azuvah the daughter of Shilchi .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	43	He lived in the manner of Asa his father and did not turn away from it , doing what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective ;
CJB	1%20Kings	22	44	) Y ’ hoshafat made peace with the king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	45	) Other activities of Y ’ hoshafat , all his power that he demonstrated and how he made war are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	46	) He rid the land of the male and female cult-prostitutes remaining from the time of his father Asa .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	47	) There had previously been no king in Edom , but now a deputy was made king .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	48	) Y ’ hoshafat built some large “ Tarshish ” ships to go to Ofir for gold , but they didn ’ t make the voyage , because they were wrecked at ‘ Etzyon-Gever .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	49	) Achazyah the son of Ach ’ av suggested to Y ’ hoshafat that his men should go to sea with Y ’ hoshafat ’ s men , but Y ’ hoshafat would not agree .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	50	) So Y ’ hoshafat slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David his ancestor , and Y ’ horam his son became king in his place .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	51	) Achazyah the son of Ach ’ av began his reign over Isra ’ el in Shomron in the seventeenth year of Y ’ hoshafat king of Y ’ hudah , and he ruled two years over Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	52	) He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , living in the manner of his father , his mother and Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , by which he led Isra ’ el into sin .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	53	) He also served Ba ‘ al and worshipped him ; and he made Adonai the God of Isra ’ el angry , in keeping with everything his father had done .
CJB	1%20Kings	22	54	(
CJB	2%20Kings	1	2	When Achazyah fell through a latticed window of his upper room in Shomron and lay injured , he sent messengers and said to them , “ Go , consult Ba ‘ al-Z ’ vuv the god of ‘ Ekron , and ask whether I will recover from this injury. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	1	1	After Ach ’ av ’ s death Mo ’ av rebelled against Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	1	3	But an angel of Adonai said to Eliyahu from Tishbe , “ Get up , and intercept the messengers of the king of Shomron , and ask them , ‘ Is it because there ’ s no God in Isra ’ el that you ’ re on your way to consult Ba ‘ al-Z ’ vuv the god of ‘ Ekron ?
CJB	2%20Kings	1	4	Therefore Adonai says , “ You will never leave the bed you are lying on ; you will certainly die. ” ’ ” Then Eliyahu left .
CJB	2%20Kings	1	5	The messengers returned to Achazyah , and he asked them , “ Why have you come back ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	1	6	They answered him , “ A man came to meet us . He told us to go and return to the king who sent us , and tell him , ‘ Here is what Adonai says : “ Is it because there ’ s no God in Isra ’ el that you ’ re sending to consult Ba ‘ al-Z ’ vuv the god of ‘ Ekron ? Therefore you will never leave the bed you are lying on ; you will certainly die. ” ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	1	7	He asked them , “ The man who came to meet you and told you these things , what kind of a man was he ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	1	8	“ He was a hairy man , ” they answered him , “ with a leather belt around his waist. ” He said , “ It was Eliyahu from Tishbe. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	1	9	Then the king sent a commander of fifty to Eliyahu , together with his fifty men . Eliyahu was sitting at the top of a hill . The commander climbed up to him and said , “ Man of God , the king says to come down. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	1	10	Eliyahu answered the commander of fifty , “ If I am in fact a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and burn you up , along with your fifty men. ” Fire came down from heaven , and it burned up him and his fifty men .
CJB	2%20Kings	1	11	The king sent him another commander of fifty , together with his fifty men . He said to him , “ Man of God , the king says , ‘ Come down immediately ! ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	1	12	Eliyahu answered them , “ If I am in fact a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and burn you up , along with your fifty men. ” Fire came down from heaven , and it burned up him and his fifty men .
CJB	2%20Kings	1	13	The king sent a third commander of fifty , with his fifty men . The third commander of fifty climbed up , approached Eliyahu and fell on his knees before him . He pleaded with him : “ Man of God , please ! Have some regard for my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours !
CJB	2%20Kings	1	14	I know that fire came down from heaven and burned up the two other commanders with their fifty men ; but now , have some regard for my life. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	1	15	The angel of Adonai said to Eliyahu , “ Go down with him ; don ’ t be afraid of him. ” So he got up and went down with him to the king .
CJB	2%20Kings	1	16	Eliyahu said to the king , “ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ You sent messengers to consult Ba ‘ al-Z ’ vuv the god of ‘ Ekron . Is it because there ’ s no God in Isra ’ el you can consult ? Therefore , you will never leave the bed you are lying on ; you will certainly die. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	1	17	So he died , in keeping with the word of Adonai spoken through Eliyahu . Y ’ horam began to rule in place of him during the second year of Y ’ horam the son of Y ’ hoshafat king of Y ’ hudah , because he had no son .
CJB	2%20Kings	1	18	Other activities of Achazyah are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	2	when Eliyahu said to Elisha , “ Please wait here , because Adonai has sent me all the way to Beit-El. ” But Elisha said , “ As Adonai lives , and as you live , I will not leave you. ” So they went down to Beit-El .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	3	The guild prophets of Beit-El came out to Elisha and said to him , “ Do you know that Adonai is taking your master away from you today ? ” “ Yes , I know , ” he answered ; “ say no more. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	2	4	Eliyahu said to him , “ Elisha , please wait here , because Adonai has sent me to Yericho. ” He replied , “ As Adonai lives , and as you live , I will not leave you. ” So they came to Yericho .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	5	The guild prophets of Yericho approached Elisha and said to him , “ Do you know that Adonai is taking your master away from you today ? ” “ Yes , I know , ” he answered ; “ say no more. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	2	6	Eliyahu said to him , “ Please wait here , because Adonai has sent me to the Yarden. ” He replied , “ As Adonai lives , and as you live , I will not leave you. ” So the two of them went on .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	7	Fifty of the guild prophets went and stood watching them from a distance , while they stood by the Yarden .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	8	Then Eliyahu took his cloak , rolled it up and struck the water with it ; and the water divided itself to the left and to the right ; so that they crossed on dry ground .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	9	After they had crossed , Eliyahu said to Elisha , “ Tell me what I can do for you before I am taken away from you. ” Elisha said , “ Please ! Let a double share of your spirit be on me ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	2	10	He replied , “ You have requested a hard thing . Nevertheless , if you see me when I am taken from you , you will get what you asked for ; but if not , you won ’ t. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	2	11	Suddenly , as they were walking on and talking , there appeared a fiery chariot with horses of fire ; and as it separated the two of them from each other , Eliyahu went up into heaven in a whirlwind .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	12	Elisha saw it and cried out , “ My father ! My father ! The chariots and horsemen of Isra ’ el ! ” Then he lost sight of him . Seizing his clothes , he tore them in half .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	13	Then he picked up Eliyahu ’ s cloak , which had fallen off him . Standing on the bank of the Yarden ,
CJB	2%20Kings	2	14	he took the cloak that had fallen off Eliyahu , struck the water and said , “ Where is Adonai , the God of Eliyahu ? ” But when he actually did strike the water , it divided itself to the left and to the right ; then Elisha crossed over .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	15	When the guild prophets of Yericho saw him in the distance , they said , “ The spirit of Eliyahu does rest on Elisha. ” Advancing to meet him , they prostrated themselves on the ground before him
CJB	2%20Kings	2	16	and said to him , “ Here now , your servants include fifty strong men . Please let them go and look for your master , in the event that the Spirit of Adonai has taken him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley. ” He answered , “ Don ’ t send them. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	2	17	But they kept pressing him until finally , embarrassed , he said to send them . So they sent fifty men . For three days they searched , but they didn ’ t find him .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	18	On returning to him where he was waiting in Yericho , he said to them , “ I told you not to go , didn ’ t I ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	2	19	The men of the city said to Elisha , “ My lord can see that this is a pleasant city to live in ; but the water is bad , so that the ground is causing miscarriages. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	2	20	“ Bring me a new jug , ” he said , “ and put salt in it. ” They brought it to him .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	21	He went out to the source of the water , threw salt into it and said , “ This is what Adonai says : ‘ I have healed this water ; it will no longer cause death or miscarrying. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	2	22	The water was healed and has remained healed to this day , in keeping with Elisha ’ s spoken word .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	23	Elisha left to go up to Beit-El . As he was on his way up the road , some boys came out of the town and began making fun of him . “ Go on up , baldy ! Go on up , baldy ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	2	24	He looked behind him , saw them and put a curse on them in the name of Adonai ; whereupon two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys .
CJB	2%20Kings	2	25	He went on from there to Mount Karmel and then returned to Shomron .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	2	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective ; but he was not as bad as his father and mother , because he got rid of Ba ‘ al ’ s standing-stone which his father had made .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	3	Nevertheless , he clung to the sins of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , with which he had led Isra ’ el into sin ; he never turned away from them .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	4	Mesha king of Mo ’ av was a sheep-breeder , and he used to send the king of Isra ’ el the wool of 100,000 lambs and of 100,000 rams as tribute .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	5	But after Ach ’ av died , the king of Mo ’ av rebelled against the king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	6	Y ’ horam left Shomron and mustered all Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	7	He also went and sent this word to Y ’ hoshafat king of Y ’ hudah : “ The king of Mo ’ av has rebelled against me . Will you join me in attacking Mo ’ av ? ” He answered , “ I will join in the attack — I ’ m with you all the way ; think of my people and horses as yours .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	8	Which route should we take ? ” he added . “ The road through the desert of Edom , ” answered Y ’ horam .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	9	So the king of Isra ’ el set out , along with the king of Y ’ hudah and the king of Edom . After a roundabout journey of seven days , there was no water for either the army or the animals following them .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	10	“ This is terrible ! ” exclaimed the king of Isra ’ el . “ Has Adonai called these three kings together only to hand them over to Mo ’ av ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	3	11	But Y ’ hoshafat said , “ Isn ’ t there a prophet of Adonai here through whom we can consult Adonai ? ” One of the servants of the king of Isra ’ el answered , “ Elisha the son of Shafat is here , the one who used to pour water on Eliyahu ’ s hands. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	3	12	Y ’ hoshafat said , “ The word of Adonai is with him. ” So the king of Isra ’ el , Y ’ hoshafat and the king of Edom went down to consult him .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	13	Elisha said to the king of Isra ’ el , “ What do you and I have in common ? Go , consult your father ’ s prophets and your mother ’ s prophets ! ” But the king of Isra ’ el answered him , “ No , because Adonai has called these three kings together to hand them over to Mo ’ av. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	3	14	Elisha said , “ As Adonai-Tzva ’ ot lives , before whom I stand , if I didn ’ t respect the fact that Y ’ hoshafat the king of Y ’ hudah is here , I wouldn ’ t even look in your direction or take notice of you .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	15	But now , bring me a musician. ” As the musician played , the hand of Adonai fell on Elisha ;
CJB	2%20Kings	3	16	and he said , “ Adonai says to dig until this valley is full of trenches .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	17	For here is what Adonai says : ‘ You won ’ t see wind , and you won ’ t see rain . Nevertheless the valley will be filled with water ; and you will drink — you , your cattle and your other animals .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	18	That ’ s an easy thing to do , from Adonai ’ s perspective . He will also hand Mo ’ av over to you .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	19	You will conquer every fortified city and every choice town , you will chop down every good tree , stop up every well and ruin every good field with stones. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	3	20	The next morning , around the time for making the offering , water came from the direction of Edom , and the countryside was filled with water .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	21	When all Mo ’ av heard that the kings had come up to attack them , every man was summoned , from the youngest capable of bearing arms to older ones , and stationed on the border .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	22	They rose early in the morning , when the sun was shining on the water . Mo ’ av , when they saw the water in the distance looking as red as blood ,
CJB	2%20Kings	3	23	said , “ That ’ s blood ! The kings must have quarreled , and their soldiers killed each other . Mo ’ av ! To the plunder ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	3	24	When they arrived at the camp of Isra ’ el , Isra ’ el launched an attack , so that Mo ’ av fled before them . But they advanced on Mo ’ av and struck it .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	25	They made ruins of the cities . Each man threw his stone on every good field , covering it . They stopped up all the wells . They chopped down all the good trees . Finally , all that remained was Kir-Hareset behind its stone wall , with the slingers surrounding and attacking it .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	26	When the king of Mo ’ av saw that the fighting was too much for him , he took with him
CJB	2%20Kings	3	700	men armed with swords and tried to break through to the king of Edom ; but they couldn ’ t do it .
CJB	2%20Kings	3	27	Then he took his firstborn son , who was to have succeeded him as king , and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall . Following this , such great anger came upon Isra ’ el that they left him and went back to their own land .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	2	Elisha asked her , “ What should I do for you ? Tell me , what do you have in the house ? ” She answered , “ Your servant has nothing in the house but a flask of oil. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	4	Then go in ; shut the door , with you and your sons inside ; and pour oil into all those containers ; and as they are filled , put them aside. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	3	Then he said , “ Go , and borrow containers from all your neighbors , empty containers ; and don ’ t borrow just a few !
CJB	2%20Kings	4	5	So she left him and shut the door on herself and her sons . They brought her the containers while she poured .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	6	When the containers were full , she said to her son , “ Bring me another container ” ; but he answered , “ There isn ’ t another container. ” Then the oil stopped flowing .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	7	She came and told the man of God ; and he said , “ Go , sell the oil , and pay your debt ; then you and your sons can live on what ’ s left. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	8	One day Elisha visited Shunem , and a well-to-do woman living there pressed him to stay and eat a meal . After this , whenever he came through , he stopped there for a meal .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	9	She said to her husband , “ I can see that this is a holy man of God who keeps stopping at our place .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	10	Please , let ’ s build him a little room on the roof . We ’ ll put a bed and a table in it for him , and a stool and a candlestick . Then , whenever he comes to visit us , he can stay there. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	11	One day Elisha came to visit there , and he went into the upper room to lie down .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	12	He said to Geichazi his servant , “ Call this Shunamit. ” He called her ; and when she arrived ,
CJB	2%20Kings	4	13	he said to him , “ Tell her this : ‘ You have shown us so much hospitality ! What can I do to show my appreciation ? Do you want me to say anything to the king for you ? or to the commander of the army ? ” She answered , “ I ’ m happy living as I do , among my own people. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	14	He said , “ What , then , is to be done for her ? ” Geichazi answered , “ There ’ s one thing — she doesn ’ t have a son ; and her husband is old .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	15	Elisha said , “ Call her. ” After he called her , she stood in the doorway .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	16	He said , “ Next year , when the season comes around , you will be holding a son. ” “ No , my lord , ” she answered . “ Man of God , don ’ t lie to your servant ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	17	But the woman conceived and gave birth to a son the following year when the season came around , just as Elisha had said to her .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	18	When the child was old enough , he went out one day to be with his father , who was with the reapers .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	19	Suddenly he cried out to his father , “ My head ! My head hurts ! ” He said to his servant , “ Carry him back to his mother. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	20	When he had taken him and brought him to his mother , he lay on her lap until noon ; and then he died .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	21	She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God , shut the door on him and went out .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	22	She called to her husband and said , “ Please send me one of the servants with a donkey . I must get to the man of God as fast as I can ; I ’ ll come straight back. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	23	He asked , “ Why are you going to him today ? It isn ’ t Rosh-Hodesh and it isn ’ t Shabbat. ” She said , “ It ’ s all right. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	24	Then she saddled the donkey and ordered her servant , “ Drive as fast as you can ; don ’ t slow down for me unless I say so. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	25	She set out and came to the man of God on Mount Karmel . When the man of God saw her in the distance , he said to Geichazi his servant , “ Look , here comes that Shunamit .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	26	Run now to meet her , and ask her , “ Is everything all right with you ? with your husband ? with the child ? ” She answered , “ Everything is all right. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	27	But when she reached the man of God on the hill , she grabbed his feet . Geichazi came up to push her away , but the man of God said , “ Leave her alone . She is in great distress , but Adonai has hidden from me what it is , he hasn ’ t told me. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	28	Then she said , “ Did I ask my lord for a son ? Didn ’ t I say not to deceive me ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	29	Then Elisha said to Geichazi , “ Get dressed for action , take my staff in your hand , and be on your way . If you meet anyone , don ’ t greet him ; if anyone greets you , don ’ t answer ; and lay my staff on the child ’ s face. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	30	The mother of the child said , “ As Adonai lives , and as you live , I will not leave you . He got up and followed her .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	31	Geichazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the child ’ s face , but there was no sound or sign of life . So he went back to Elisha and told him , “ The child didn ’ t wake up. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	32	When Elisha reached the house , there the child was , dead and laid on the bed .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	33	He went in , shut the door on the two of them and prayed to Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	34	Then he got up on the bed and lay on top of the child , putting his mouth on his mouth , his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands . As he stretched himself out on the child , its flesh began to grow warm .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	35	Then he went down , walked around in the house awhile , went back up and stretched himself out on the child again . The child sneezed seven times , then opened his eyes .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	36	Elisha called Geichazi and said , “ Call this Shunamit. ” So he called her ; and when she came in to him , he said , “ Pick up your son. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	37	She entered , fell at his feet and prostrated herself on the floor . Then she picked up her son and went out .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	38	Elisha went back to Gilgal . At the time , there was a famine in the land . The guild prophets were sitting before him , and he said to his servant , “ Put the big pot on the fire , and boil some soup for the prophets. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	39	One of them went out to the field to gather vegetables and came upon a wild vine , from which he filled the front of his cloak with wild squash . On returning he cut them up and put them into the stew ; they didn ’ t know what they were .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	40	Then they poured it out for the men to eat ; but on tasting it , they cried , “ Man of God ! There ’ s death in that pot ! ” And they couldn ’ t eat it .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	41	But he said , “ Bring some flour. ” He threw it in the pot , then said , “ Pour it out for the people to eat. ” This time there was nothing harmful in the pot .
CJB	2%20Kings	4	42	A man came from Ba ‘ al-Shalishah bringing the man of God twenty loaves of bread made from the barley firstfruits and fresh ears of grain in his sack . Elisha said , “ Give this to the people to eat. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	43	His servant said , “ How am I to serve this to a hundred men ? ” But he said , “ Give it to the people to eat ; for Adonai says that they will eat and have some left over. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	4	44	So he served them , and they ate and had some left over , as Adonai had said .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	2	Now on one of their raids into Isra ’ el ’ s territory , Aram carried away captive a little girl , who became a servant for Na ‘ aman ’ s wife .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	5	The king of Aram said , “ Go now , and I will send a letter to the king of Isra ’ el. ” He set out , taking with him
CJB	2%20Kings	5	3	She said to her mistress , “ I wish my lord could go to the prophet in Shomron ! He could heal his tzara ‘ at. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	4	Na ‘ aman went in and told his lord , “ The girl from the land of Isra ’ el said such-and-such. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	660	pounds of silver , 6,000 pieces of gold and ten changes of clothes .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	6	He brought the king of Isra ’ el the letter , which said , “ When this letter reaches you , you will see that I have sent my servant Na ‘ aman to you , so that you can heal his tzara ‘ at. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	7	When the king of Isra ’ el finished reading the letter , he tore his clothes . “ Am I God , able to kill and make alive , ” he asked , “ so that he sends me a man to heal of tzara ‘ at ? You can see that he is only seeking an excuse to quarrel with me. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	8	But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Isra ’ el had torn his clothes , he sent a message to the king : “ Why did you tear your clothes ? Just have him come to me , and he will know that there is a prophet in Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	9	So Na ‘ aman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha ’ s house .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	10	Elisha sent a messenger to him , who said , “ Go , and bathe in the Yarden seven times . Your skin will become as it was , and you will be clean. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	11	But Na ‘ aman became angry and left , saying , “ Here now ! I thought for certain that he would come out personally , that he would stand , call on the name of Adonai his God and wave his hand over the diseased place and thus heal the person with tzara ‘ at .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	12	Aren ’ t Amanah and Parpar , the rivers of Dammesek , better than all the water in Isra ’ el ? Why can ’ t I bathe in them and be clean ? ” So he turned and went off in a rage .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	13	But his servants approached him and said , “ My father ! If the prophet had asked you to do something really difficult , wouldn ’ t you have done it ? So , doesn ’ t it make even more sense to do what he says , when it ’ s only , ‘ Bathe , and be clean ’ ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	14	So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Yarden , as the man of God had said to do ; and his skin was restored and became like the skin of a child ; and he became clean .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	15	Then , with his whole retinue , he returned to the man of God , went and stood before him , and said , “ Well , I ’ ve learned that there is no God in all the earth except in Isra ’ el ; therefore , please accept a present from your servant. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	16	But Elisha answered , “ As Adonai lives , before whom I stand , I will not accept it. ” And despite his urging him to take it , he refused .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	17	So Na ‘ aman said , “ If you won ’ t take it , then please let your servant be given as much earth as two mules can carry ; because from now on , your servant will offer neither burnt offerings nor sacrifices to other gods , but only to Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	18	Except this , and may Adonai forgive your servant for it : when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there , and he leans on my hand , and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon — when I bow down , may Adonai forgive your servant for this. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	19	Elisha said to him , “ Go in peace. ” Na ‘ aman had gone only a short distance from him ,
CJB	2%20Kings	5	20	when Geichazi , the servant of Elisha the man of God , said to himself , “ Here , my master has made it easy on this Arami Na ‘ aman by not accepting from him what he brought . As Adonai lives , I ’ ll run after him and get at least something from him. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	21	So Geichazi hurried off after Na ‘ aman . When Na ‘ aman saw someone running after him , he got down from his chariot to meet him and asked , “ Is everything all right ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	22	“ Yes , ” he replied . “ My master sent me with this message : ‘ Two young men have just now come to me , guild prophets from the hills of Efrayim . Would you be kind enough to give them a talent of silver [ sixty-six pounds ] and two changes of clothes ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	5	23	“ By all means , take two talents ! ” said Na ‘ aman , pressing him . He tied up the two talents of silver in two bags and gave them , with the two changes of clothes , to two of his servants , who carried them ahead of Geichazi .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	24	On reaching the hill , he took the bags from them and put them away in the house . Then he let the men go , and they left .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	25	He went in and stood before his master . Elisha asked , “ Where have you been , Geichazi ? ” “ Your servant hasn ’ t gone anywhere , ” he said .
CJB	2%20Kings	5	26	Elisha said to him , “ Wasn ’ t my heart there with you when the man left his chariot to meet you ? Is this a time to receive silver and clothing — and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and male and female slaves ?
CJB	2%20Kings	5	27	Therefore Na ‘ aman ’ s tzara ‘ at will cling to you and your descendants forever. ” He left Elisha ’ s presence with tzara ‘ at as white as snow .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	2	Please allow us to go to the Yarden ; each of us will collect a log there , and we ’ ll build a place there for us to live. ” He answered , “ Go ahead. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	6	The man of God asked , “ Where did it fall ? ” He showed him the place . Then Elisha cut a stick , threw it in there , and the iron axe-head floated to the surface .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	3	But one of them said , “ Please , won ’ t you come with your servants ? ” He answered , “ All right , I will ” ;
CJB	2%20Kings	6	4	so he went with them . When they arrived at the Yarden , they cut down trees ;
CJB	2%20Kings	6	5	but as one was felling a tree trunk , the head of his axe fell in the water . “ Oh , no ! ” he cried . “ My master , it was a borrowed one ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	7	“ Lift it out , ” he said . So he put out his hand and took it .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	8	Now the king of Aram went to war against Isra ’ el ; and in consulting his servants he said , “ I ’ ll set up my ambush camp in such-and-such a place. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	9	The man of God sent this message to the king of Isra ’ el : “ Be careful not to go past such-and-such a place , because Aram will attack there. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	10	So the king of Isra ’ el sent men to the place the man of God had told him and warned him about , and he took special precautions there . This happened more than once or twice ,
CJB	2%20Kings	6	11	and it greatly upset the king of Aram . He called his servants and said to them , “ Tell me which of you is betraying us to the king of Isra ’ el ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	12	One of his servants replied , “ It ’ s not that , my lord , king . Rather , Elisha , the prophet who is in Isra ’ el , tells the king of Isra ’ el the words you speak privately in your own bedroom ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	13	He said , “ Go and see where he is , so that I can send and bring him here. ” They told him , “ He ’ s in Dotan. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	14	So he sent horses , chariots and a large army there ; they came by night and surrounded the city .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	15	The servant of the man of God got up early in the morning ; on going outside , he saw an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city . His servant said to him , “ Oh , my master , this is terrible ! What are we going to do ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	16	He answered , “ Don ’ t be afraid — those who are with us outnumber those who are with them ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	17	Elisha prayed , “ Adonai , I ask you to open his eyes , so that he can see. ” Then Adonai opened the young man ’ s eyes , and he saw : there before him , all around Elisha , the mountain was covered with horses and fiery chariots .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	18	When they came down to him , Elisha prayed to Adonai , “ Please strike these people blind ” ; and he struck them blind , as Elisha had asked .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	19	Next , Elisha told them , “ You ’ ve lost your way , and this isn ’ t even the right city . Follow me , and I ’ ll take you to the man you ’ re looking for. ” Then he led them to Shomron .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	20	On their arrival in Shomron , Elisha said , “ Adonai , open the eyes of these men , so that they can see. ” Adonai opened their eyes , and they saw : there they were , in the middle of Shomron .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	21	When the king of Isra ’ el saw them , he asked Elisha , “ My father , should I attack them ? Should I attack them ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	22	He answered , “ Don ’ t attack them ! You wouldn ’ t even attack prisoners you had captured with your own sword and bow , would you ? So give them food to eat and water to drink , and let them return to their master. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	23	So he provided well for them ; and after they had eaten and drunk , he sent them away ; and they returned to their master . After that , no more raiding parties entered the land of Isra ’ el from Aram .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	24	But some time afterwards , Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered all his army , went up and laid siege to Shomron .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	25	At the time , there was a severe famine in Shomron ; and they maintained their siege until a donkey ’ s head sold for eighty pieces of silver and half a pint of doves ’ dung for five pieces of silver .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	26	As the king of Isra ’ el was passing by on the wall , a woman cried out to him , “ Help , my lord , king ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	27	He said , “ If Adonai isn ’ t helping you , how do you expect me to help you ? There isn ’ t any grain , and there isn ’ t any wine. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	28	Then the king asked her , “ What ’ s troubling you ? ” She answered , “ This woman said to me , ‘ Give me your son , so that we can eat him today ; and we ’ ll eat my son tomorrow. ’
CJB	2%20Kings	6	29	So we boiled my son and ate him . The next day I said to her , ‘ Give your son , so that we can eat him , ’ but she has hidden her son. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	30	When the king heard what the woman said , he tore his clothes . At the time , he was passing by on the wall ; and when the people looked , they saw him there with sackcloth against his skin .
CJB	2%20Kings	6	31	Then he said , “ May God do terrible things to me , and worse ones too , if the head of Elisha the son of Shafat remains on his body by day ’ s end. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	32	Elisha was sitting in his house , and the leaders were sitting there with him . The king sent a messenger ahead , but before he arrived , Elisha said to the leaders , “ Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to remove my head ? Look , when the messenger comes , close the door and keep it shut against him . You can hear his master ’ s footsteps following right behind him ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	6	33	While he was still speaking , the messenger arrived with this message from the king : “ Here , this evil is from Adonai . Why should I wait for Adonai any longer ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	2	The servant on whose arm the king was leaning answered the man of God : “ Why , this couldn ’ t happen even if Adonai made windows in heaven ! ” Elisha answered , “ All right , you yourself will see it with your own eyes ; but you won ’ t eat any of it ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	7	So they jumped up and fled in the twilight , leaving their tents , horses , donkeys and the whole camp just as it was , and ran for their lives .
CJB	2%20Kings	7	3	Now there were four men with tzara ‘ at at the entrance to the city gate , and they said to each other , “ Why should we sit here till we die ?
CJB	2%20Kings	7	4	If we say , ‘ We ’ ll enter the city , then the city has been struck by the famine , so we ’ ll die there . And if we sit still here , we ’ ll also die . So let ’ s go and surrender to the army of Aram ; if they spare our lives , we will live ; and if they kill us , we ’ ll only die. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	5	They got up during the twilight to go to the camp of Aram . But when they reached the outskirts of the camp of Aram , they saw no one !
CJB	2%20Kings	7	6	For Adonai had caused the army of Aram to hear the sound of chariots and horses ; it sounded like a huge army ; and they said to each other , “ The king of Isra ’ el must have hired the kings of the Hitti and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	8	When these men with tzara ‘ at reached the outskirts of the camp , they entered one of the tents , ate and drank ; then took some silver , gold and clothing ; and went and hid it . Next they returned and entered another tent , took stuff from there , and went and hid it .
CJB	2%20Kings	7	9	But finally they said to each other , “ What we are doing is wrong . At a time of good news like this , we shouldn ’ t keep it to ourselves . If we wait even till morning , we will earn only punishment ; so come on , let ’ s go and tell the king ’ s household. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	10	So they came and shouted to the gatekeepers of the city and told them the news : “ We went to the camp of Aram , and no one was there , no human voice — just the horses and donkeys tied up , and the tents left in place. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	11	The gatekeepers called and told it to the king ’ s household inside .
CJB	2%20Kings	7	12	Then the king got up in the night ; he said to his servants , “ I ’ ll tell you what Aram has done to us . They know that we ’ re hungry , so they ’ ve gone outside the camp and hidden in the countryside , saying , ‘ When they come out of the city , we ’ ll take them alive and then get inside the city. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	13	One of his servants answered , “ I suggest letting some men take five of the remaining horses that are left in the city — they ’ re like everything else in Isra ’ el that remains , like everything else in Isra ’ el , practically finished — and we ’ ll send and see. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	14	So they took two chariots with horses , and the king sent after the army of Aram , saying , “ Go , and see. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	15	They went after them all the way to the Yarden , and found the entire distance strewn with clothing and other articles Aram had thrown away in their haste . The messengers returned and told the king .
CJB	2%20Kings	7	16	Then the people went out and ransacked the camp of Aram — with the result that six quarts of fine flour was sold for only a shekel and half a bushel of barley for a shekel , in keeping with what Adonai had said .
CJB	2%20Kings	7	17	The king put the servant on whose arm he had leaned in charge of the gate , and the people trampled him down in the gateway , so that he died , as the man of God had said he would , who spoke when the king came to him .
CJB	2%20Kings	7	18	For the man of God had said to the king , “ Tomorrow by this time six quarts of barley will sell for only a shekel and half a bushel of fine flour for a shekel [ in the market ] at the gate of Shomron ” ;
CJB	2%20Kings	7	19	the servant had answered the man of God , “ Why , this couldn ’ t happen even if Adonai made windows in heaven ! ” and Elisha had said , “ All right , you yourself will see it with your own eyes ; but you won ’ t eat any of it ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	7	20	That is exactly what happened to him , because the people trampled him down in the gateway , so that he died .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	2	The woman acted at once and did as the man of God had said — she went with her household and stayed in the land of the P ’ lishtim for seven years .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	8	The king said to Haza ’ el , “ Take with you a gift , go meet the man of God and consult Adonai through him ; ask if I will recover from this illness. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	3	At the end of seven years the woman returned from the land of the P ’ lishtim and sought an audience with the king to claim her house and land .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	4	The king was talking with Geichazi the servant of the man of God . “ Tell me , ” he said , “ all the great things Elisha has done. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	5	Just as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead person to life , at that very moment the woman whose son he had restored to life came to the king with her claim for her house and land . Geichazi said , “ My lord , king , this is the woman ; and this is her son , the one Elisha restored to life. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	6	On being asked by the king , the woman verified it . At this , the king appointed a special officer and charged him , “ Restore everything that belongs to her , including the income her fields have produced from the day she left them until now. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	7	Elisha went to Dammesek . Ben-Hadad the king of Aram was ill ; and he was told , “ The man of God has come here. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	9	Haza ’ el went to meet him , taking with him a gift that included everything good Dammesek had , forty camel-loads . He came , stood before him and said , “ Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to you ; he asks , ‘ Will I recover from this illness ? ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	10	Elisha answered , “ Go and say to him , ‘ You will surely recover ’ — even though Adonai has shown me that he will surely die. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	11	Then the man of God fixed his gaze on him for so long that Haza ’ el became embarrassed ; finally Elisha began to cry .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	12	Haza ’ el asked , “ Why is my lord crying ? ” He answered , “ Because I know the disasters you will bring on the people of Isra ’ el — you will set their fortresses on fire , you will kill their young men with the sword , you will dash their little ones to pieces and rip their pregnant women apart. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	13	Haza ’ el said , “ But what is your servant ? Nothing but a dog ! How could he do anything of such magnitude ? ” Elisha answered , “ Adonai has shown me that you will be king over Aram. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	14	Then he left Elisha and returned to his master , who asked him , “ What did Elisha say to you ? ” “ He told me you would surely recover. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	8	15	The next day he took a blanket , dipped it in water and spread it on his face , so that he died ; and Haza ’ el took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	16	It was when Yoram the son of Ach ’ av king of Isra ’ el was in the fifth year of his reign that Y ’ horam the son of Y ’ hoshafat began his rule over Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	17	He was thirty-two years old when he began to rule , and he ruled eight years in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	18	He lived after the example of the kings of Isra ’ el , as did the house of Ach ’ av ; because he had married Ach ’ av ’ s daughter ; he did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	19	However , Adonai was unwilling to destroy Y ’ hudah , because of his servant David ; inasmuch as he had promised to give him and his children a lamp that would burn forever .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	20	During his time Edom revolted against Y ’ hudah and set up its own king .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	21	In response , Yoram crossed to Tza ‘ ir with all his chariots . At night he and his chariot commanders set out and attacked Edom who had surrounded him ; then the people fled to their tents .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	22	Nevertheless , since that day Edom has remained free of Y ’ hudah ’ s domination . Livnah revolted at the same time .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	23	Other activities of Yoram and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	24	Yoram slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David , and Achazyah his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	25	It was in the twelfth year of Yoram the son of Ach ’ av king of Isra ’ el that Achazyah the son of Y ’ horam king of Y ’ hudah began his reign .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	26	Achazyah was twenty-two years old when he began to rule , and he ruled for one year in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was ‘ Atalyahu the daughter of ‘ Omri king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	27	He lived after the example of the house of Ach ’ av ; he did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , as had the house of Ach ’ av ; for he was a son-in-law in the house of Ach ’ av .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	28	With Yoram the son of Ach ’ av he went to war against Haza ’ el king of Aram at Ramot-Gil ‘ ad , and the Aramim wounded Yoram .
CJB	2%20Kings	8	29	King Yoram returned to Yizre ‘ el to be healed of the wounds which the Aramim had inflicted on him at Ramah while fighting Haza ’ el king of Aram . Achazyah the son of Y ’ horam , king of Y ’ hudah , went down to visit Yoram the son of Ach ’ av in Yizre ‘ el , because he was not feeling well .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	2	When you get there , look for Yehu the son of Y ’ hoshafat , the son of Nimshi . Enter , have him step away from his companions , and take him to an inside room .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	9	I will make the house of Ach ’ av like the house of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat and like the house of Ba ‘ sha the son of Achiyah .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	3	Then take the flask of oil , pour it on his head , and say , ‘ This is what Adonai says : “ I have anointed you king over Isra ’ el. ” ’ After that , open the door ; and get away from there as fast as you can. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	4	So the young prophet left for Ramot-Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	5	When he arrived , he found the senior army officers sitting there . He said , “ I have a message for you , commander. ” Yehu asked , “ For which one of us ? ” “ For you , commander , ” he said .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	6	Yehu got up and went into the house . Then the prophet poured the oil on his head and said to him , “ This is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ I have anointed you king over the people of Adonai , over Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	7	You will attack the house of Ach ’ av your master , so that I can avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and of all the servants of Adonai , blood shed by Izevel .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	8	The entire house of Ach ’ av will perish ; I will cut off from Ach ’ av every male , whether a slave or free in Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	10	Moreover , the dogs will eat Izevel in the dumping-ground of Yizre ‘ el , and there will be no one to bury her. ’ ” Then he opened the door and fled .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	11	Yehu returned to the servants of his lord , and one of them said to him , “ Is everything all right ? Why did this meshugga come to you ? ” He answered them , “ You know the kind and how they babble. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	12	They said , “ You ’ re being evasive . Come on , tell us the truth. ” Then he said , “ This is exactly what he said to me and how he said it : ‘ Here is what Adonai says : “ I have anointed you king over Isra ’ el. ” ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	13	At this , they hurried each one to take his cloak and put it under Yehu at the top of the stairs . Then they blew the shofar and proclaimed , “ Yehu is king ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	14	Yehu the son of Y ’ hoshafat , the son of Nimshi , formed a conspiracy against Yoram . ( At the time , Yoram was guarding Ramot-Gil ‘ ad , he and all Isra ’ el , because of Haza ’ el king of Aram ;
CJB	2%20Kings	9	15	but Yoram himself had returned to Yizre ‘ el to recover from the wounds Aram had inflicted on him when fighting Haza ’ el king of Aram . ) “ If you agree , ” said Yehu , “ then don ’ t allow anyone to leave town and take the news to Yizre ‘ el. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	16	So Yehu , riding in a chariot , went to Yizre ‘ el , for Yoram was laid up there . Achazyah king of Y ’ hudah had come down to visit Yoram .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	17	The lookout standing on the watchtower in Yizre ‘ el saw Yehu ’ s troops approaching and said , “ I see some troops coming. ” Yoram said , “ Have a horseman go to meet him and ask , “ Are you coming in peace ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	18	So a man on horseback went to meet him and said , “ The king asks if you are coming in peace. ” Yehu answered , “ Peace ? What business is that of yours ? Turn around , and get behind me ! ” The watchman reported , “ The messenger reached them , but he isn ’ t coming back. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	19	So he sent out a second man on horseback , who , on coming to him , said , “ The king asks if you are coming in peace. ” Yehu answered , “ Peace ? What business is that of yours ? Turn around , and get behind me ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	20	The watchman reported , “ He reached them , but he isn ’ t coming back . Also , it looks like the driving of Yehu Nimshi ’ s [ grand ] son — he ’ s driving like a maniac ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	21	“ Harness my chariot ! ” ordered Yoram . They got it ready . Then Yoram king of Isra ’ el and Achazyah king of Y ’ hudah , each in his chariot , went out to meet Yehu . They met him in the field of Navot the Yizre ‘ eli .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	22	When Yoram saw Yehu he said , “ Are you coming in peace , Yehu ? ” He answered , “ Peace ? With your mother Izevel continuing all her cult prostitution and witchcraft ? What a question ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	23	Yoram wheeled around and fled , shouting , “ Treachery , Achazyah ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	24	Yehu drew his bow with all his strength and struck Yoram between the shoulder-blades ; the arrow went through his heart , and he collapsed in his chariot .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	25	“ Pick him up , ” said Yehu to Bidkar his servant , “ and throw him into the field of Navot the Yizre ‘ eli ; for remember how , when you and I were riding together after Ach ’ av his father , Adonai pronounced this sentence against him :
CJB	2%20Kings	9	26	‘ Adonai says : “ Yesterday I saw the blood of Navot and the blood of his sons. ” Adonai also says : “ I will pay you back in this field. ” ’ Therefore , pick him up ; and throw him into the field , in keeping with what Adonai said. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	27	But when Achazyah the king of Y ’ hudah saw this , he fled on the road past Beit-HaGan . Yehu pursued him and ordered , “ Strike him too in his chariot ! ” [ So they struck him ] at the Gur ascent , near Yivle ‘ am . He fled to Megiddo , but there he died .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	28	His servants carried him in a chariot to Yerushalayim and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	29	It was in the eleventh year of Yoram the son of Ach ’ av that Achazyah had begun his rule over Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	30	When Yehu reached Yizre ‘ el , and Izevel heard of it , she put on eye make-up , fixed her hair and looked out the window .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	31	As Yehu came through the city gate , she asked , “ Are you here in peace , you Zimri , you murderer of your master ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	32	Looking up at the window he said , “ Who is on my side ? Who ? ” Two or three officers looked out toward him .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	33	He said , “ Throw her down ! ” So they threw her down . Some of her blood splashed onto the wall and the horses , and she was trampled underfoot .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	34	He went in , ate and drank , and then said , “ Deal with this accursed woman — bury her , because she ’ s a king ’ s daughter. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	9	35	They went to bury her but found no more of her than her skull , feet and hands .
CJB	2%20Kings	9	36	So they came back and told him . He said , “ This is what Adonai said through his servant Eliyahu from Tishbe : ‘ In the field of Yizre ‘ el the dogs will eat the flesh of Izevel ;
CJB	2%20Kings	9	37	Izevel ’ s corpse in the field of Yizre ‘ el will be like dung on the ground , unrecognizable as Izevel . ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	2	“ You have with you your master ’ s sons , also chariots and horses , as well as fortified cities and armor . So , as soon as this letter reaches you ,
CJB	2%20Kings	10	10	Understand , then , that no part of Adonai ’ s word which Adonai spoke concerning the dynasty of Ach ’ av falls to the ground ; because Adonai has done what he said through his servant Eliyahu. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	3	choose the best and most suitable of your master ’ s sons , set him on his father ’ s throne and fight for your master ’ s dynasty. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	4	They were panic-stricken and said , “ If the other two kings couldn ’ t withstand him , how will we ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	5	So the administrator of the palace , the governor of the city , the leaders and the children ’ s guardians sent this message to Yehu : “ We are your servants . We will do everything you ask us to ; we won ’ t appoint anyone king . Do as you see fit. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	6	He wrote a second letter to them , which said , “ If you are on my side , and if you are ready to obey my orders , then bring the heads of your master ’ s sons to me in Yizre ‘ el by this time tomorrow. ” Now the seventy sons of the king were with the prominent men who had raised them .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	7	When the letter reached them , they seized the king ’ s sons and killed them , all seventy of them , put their heads in baskets and sent them to Yehu in Yizre ‘ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	8	A messenger came and told him , “ They have brought the heads of the king ’ s sons. ” He said , “ Leave them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	9	When morning came , he went out , stood before the people and said , “ You are not responsible [ for the deaths of these men ] . Yes , I conspired against my master and killed him . But who killed all these ?
CJB	2%20Kings	10	11	So Yehu killed everyone who remained from the house of Ach ’ av in Yizre ‘ el , all his leading men , his close friends and his cohanim , until not one of them was left alive .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	12	Then he set out and went to Shomron . On the way he reached a shearing shed for shepherds ,
CJB	2%20Kings	10	13	where he encountered relatives of Achazyah king of Y ’ hudah . “ Who are you ? ” he asked . “ We ’ re relatives of Achazyah , ” they answered , “ and we ’ re going down to pay our respects to the families of the king and of the queen mother. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	14	“ Take them alive , ” said Yehu . They took them alive , forty-two men , slaughtered them and threw them into the shearing shed ’ s pit ; he spared not one of them .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	15	On leaving there , he happened upon Y ’ honadav the son of Rekhav coming toward him . He greeted him and said to him , “ Are you wholeheartedly with me , as I am with you ? ” “ Yes , ” answered Y ’ honadav . “ If so , give me your hand. ” He gave him his hand , and Yehu took him up into the chariot .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	16	He said , “ Come with me , and see how zealous I am for Adonai. ” So they had him ride in his chariot .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	17	On arriving in Shomron he put to death everyone that Ach ’ av still had in Shomron , until he had destroyed him , in keeping with the word of Adonai which he had spoken to Eliyahu .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	18	Next , Yehu assembled all the people and said to them , “ Ach ’ av served Ba ‘ al in limited measure , but Yehu will serve him with full zeal .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	19	Therefore summon all the prophets of Ba ‘ al to me , all his worshippers and all his priests . None of them is to be missing , because I am going to offer a great sacrifice to Ba ‘ al ; whoever is missing will not remain alive. ” But Yehu was setting a trap , in order to destroy the worshippers of Ba ‘ al .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	20	Yehu said , “ Proclaim a solemn assembly for Ba ‘ al , ” and they did so .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	21	Yehu sent throughout all Isra ’ el , and all the worshippers of Ba ‘ al came , so that there was not one man left that didn ’ t come . They entered the temple of Ba ‘ al , and the temple of Ba ‘ al was filled from one end to the other .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	22	To the man in charge of the wardrobe he said , “ Bring out robes for all the worshippers of Ba ‘ al ” ; and he brought them clothes .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	23	Yehu and Y ’ honadav the son of Rekhav entered the house of Ba ‘ al and said to the worshippers of Ba ‘ al , “ Search to see that none of the servants of Adonai is here with you , only worshippers of Ba ‘ al. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	24	Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings . But Yehu had chosen eighty men to remain outside . He said , “ If any of the men I am about to put in your hands escapes , it will be your life for his. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	25	As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering , Yehu said to the guards and officers , “ Go in , and kill them ; don ’ t let one of them get out. ” So they killed them with the sword ; then , after the guards and officers had thrown their bodies outside , they went into the temple of Ba ‘ al ’ s inner shrine ,
CJB	2%20Kings	10	26	brought out the pillars in the temple of Ba ‘ al and burned them .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	27	Finally , they broke down Ba ‘ al ’ s standing-stone and demolished the temple of Ba ‘ al , converting it into a latrine , which it still is today .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	28	Thus Yehu rid Isra ’ el of Ba ‘ al .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	29	However , Yehu did not turn away from the sins of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , with which he had led Isra ’ el into sin , the gold calves that were in Beit-El and Dan .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	30	Adonai said to Yehu , “ Because you did well in accomplishing what is right from my perspective , and have done to the house of Ach ’ av everything that was in my heart , your descendants down to the fourth generation will sit on the throne of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	10	31	But Yehu made no effort to live wholeheartedly according to the Torah of Adonai the God of Isra ’ el and did not turn away from the sins of Yarov ‘ am , with which he had led Isra ’ el into sin .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	32	It was during that period that Adonai began to dismember Isra ’ el . Haza ’ el attacked them throughout the territory of Isra ’ el
CJB	2%20Kings	10	33	east of the Yarden — all the land of Gil ‘ ad , the Gadi , Re ’ uveni and M ’ nashi , from ‘ Aro ‘ er by the Arnon River , including Gil ‘ ad and Bashan .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	34	Other activities of Yehu , all his accomplishments and all his power are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	35	Yehu slept with his ancestors , and they buried him in Shomron . Then Y ’ ho ’ achaz his son became king in his place .
CJB	2%20Kings	10	36	Yehu ruled over Isra ’ el in Shomron for twenty-eight years .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	2	But Y ’ hosheva the daughter of King Yoram , sister of Achazyah , took Yo ’ ash the son of Achazyah and stole him away from among the princes who were being slaughtered . She took him and his nurse , sequestered them in a bedroom , and hid them from ‘ Atalyah , so that he was not killed .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	11	The guards then took positions , each man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , alongside the altar , alongside [ the exterior of ] the house and around the king .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	3	He remained hidden with his nurse in the house of Adonai for six years ; during this time ‘ Atalyah ruled the land .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	4	In the seventh year Y ’ hoyada summoned the captains of hundred-man platoons , of both the Kari and the guard . He brought them into the house of Adonai , made an agreement with them and had them swear to it in the house of Adonai . Then he showed them the king ’ s son
CJB	2%20Kings	11	5	and gave them this instruction : “ Here is what you are to do : of you who come on duty on Shabbat , a third [ normally ] guards the royal palace ,
CJB	2%20Kings	11	6	a third is at the Sur Gate and a third is at the gate behind the guards . [ The first third ] is to continue guarding the palace and serve as a barrier ,
CJB	2%20Kings	11	7	while the other two groups of you who come on duty on Shabbat will guard the house of Adonai , where the king is .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	8	You are to surround the king , each man with his weapons in his hand . Anyone who penetrates the ranks is to be killed . Stay with the king whenever he leaves or enters. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	11	9	The captains over hundreds did exactly as Y ’ hoyada the cohen ordered . Each took his men , those coming on duty on Shabbat and those going off duty on Shabbat , and came to Y ’ hoyada the cohen .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	10	The cohen issued to the captains of hundreds the spears and shields that had been King David ’ s and were kept in the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	12	Then he brought out the king ’ s son , crowned him , gave him [ a copy of ] the testimony and thus made him king ; they anointed him , clapped their hands and shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	11	13	When ‘ Atalyah heard the shouting of the guard and the people , she entered the house of Adonai where the people were ,
CJB	2%20Kings	11	14	looked and saw the king standing there on the platform , in keeping with the rule , with the leaders and trumpeters next to the king . All the people of the land were celebrating and blowing the trumpets . At this ‘ Atalyah tore her clothes and cried , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	11	15	Y ’ hoyada the cohen ordered the captains of hundreds , the army officers , “ Escort her out past the ranks [ of guards ] ; but anyone who follows her , kill with the sword. ” For the cohen had said , “ She must not be put to death in the house of Adonai. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	11	16	So they took her by force and led her through the horses ’ entry to the royal palace , and there she was put to death .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	17	Y ’ hoyada made a covenant between Adonai , the king and the people , that they would be Adonai ’ s people , and [ a covenant ] between the king and the people .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	18	Then all the people of the land went to the house of Ba ‘ al and broke it down ; they completely smashed its altars and images and killed Mattan the priest of Ba ‘ al in front of the altars . Next , the cohen appointed officers over the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	19	He took the captains of hundreds , the Kari , the guards and all the people of the land ; and they brought the king down from the house of Adonai , going by way of the gate of the guards to the royal palace . There he sat on the throne of the kings .
CJB	2%20Kings	11	20	All the people of the land celebrated , and at last the city was quiet . That is how they killed ‘ Atalyah with the sword at the royal palace .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	2	) Y ’ ho ’ ash did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective throughout the lifetime of Y ’ hoyada the cohen , who instructed him .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	12	) on masons , stone-workers , timber , worked stone and everything else needed for repairing the damaged places in the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	1	) It was in the seventh year of Yehu that Y ’ ho ’ ash began to rule , and he ruled forty years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Tzivyah , from Be ’ er-Sheva .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	3	) Nevertheless the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and presented offerings on the high places .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	4	) Y ’ ho ’ ash said to the cohanim , “ All the funds for sacred purposes which are brought to the house of Adonai — the half-shekel tax , the taxes on persons in a man ’ s household , and all the offerings anyone voluntarily brings to the house of Adonai —
CJB	2%20Kings	12	5	) the cohanim are to receive from whoever personally makes contributions to them ; and they are to use these funds to repair the damaged parts of the house , wherever damage is found .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	6	) But twenty-three years into the reign of King Y ’ ho ’ ash , the cohanim had still not repaired the damaged places in the house .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	7	) So King Y ’ ho ’ ash summoned Y ’ hoyada the cohen and the other cohanim and said to them , “ Why aren ’ t you repairing the damaged places in the house ? Therefore , you are no longer to take money from those who contribute it personally to you ; you must hand it over to be used for repairing the damage in the house. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	12	8	) The cohanim agreed not to receive money from the people , and they would no longer be responsible for repairing the damage to the house .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	9	) Then Y ’ hoyada the cohen took a chest , drilled a hole in its lid and set it by the altar , on the right , as one enters the house of Adonai ; and the cohanim in charge of the entry put in it all the money brought into the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	10	) When they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest , the king ’ s secretary and the cohen hagadol would come up , count the money found in the house of Adonai and put it in bags .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	11	) Then they would give the weighed-out money to those supervising the work in the house of Adonai , who would use it to pay the carpenters and construction-workers doing the work in the house of Adonai ,
CJB	2%20Kings	12	13	) But none of the money brought into the house of Adonai was used to make silver cups , snuffers , bowls , trumpets or other articles of gold or silver for the house of Adonai ;
CJB	2%20Kings	12	14	) because they gave the money to those doing the work , thus restricting its use to repairing the damage in the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	15	) Moreover , they did not require an accounting from the supervisors given the money to pay the workers , because they dealt honestly .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	16	) Money from guilt offerings and sin offerings , however , was not brought into the house of Adonai ; it went to the cohanim .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	17	) Haza ’ el king of Aram went up and fought against Gat ; and after capturing it , Haza ’ el made his decision to attack Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	18	) Y ’ ho ’ ash king of Y ’ hudah took all the consecrated articles that Y ’ hoshafat , Y ’ horam and Achazyah , his ancestors , kings of Y ’ hudah , had dedicated , as well as his own consecrated articles and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of Adonai and of the royal palace , and sent them to Haza ’ el king of Aram , who then withdrew from Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	19	) Other activities of Yo ’ ash and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	20	) Then his servants got together , formed a conspiracy and murdered Yo ’ ash at Beit-Millo on the way down to Sila .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	21	) His servants Yozakhar the son of Shim ‘ at and Y ’ hozavad the son of Shomer struck him , so that he died . They buried him with his ancestors in the City of David , and Amatzyah his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	12	22	(
CJB	2%20Kings	13	2	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective ; he followed the sins of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , who made Isra ’ el sin ; and he never ceased committing those sins .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	13	Yo ’ ash slept with his ancestors , and Yarov ‘ am occupied his throne . Yo ’ ash was buried in Shomron with the kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	3	Adonai ’ s anger burned against Isra ’ el , and he kept handing them over to Haza ’ el king of Aram and Ben-Hadad the son of Haza ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	4	But Y ’ ho ’ achaz pleaded to Adonai , and Adonai listened to him , because he saw the oppression the king of Aram was inflicting on Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	5	So Adonai gave Isra ’ el a savior who freed them from the grip of Aram , so that the people of Isra ’ el could live in their tents , as they had before .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	6	Despite that , instead of turning from the sins of the house of Yarov ‘ am , who made Isra ’ el sin , they continued to live in this sinful way . Moreover , the asherah continued to stand in Shomron .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	7	The king of Aram destroyed Y ’ ho ’ achaz ’ s army , making them like chaff when grain is threshed , except for fifty horsemen , ten chariots and 10,000 foot soldiers .

CJB	2%20Kings	13	11	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective and did not turn from all the sins of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , who made Isra ’ el sin ; on the contrary , he lived in this sinful way .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	12	Other activities of Yo ’ ash , all his accomplishments and his power in fighting Amatzyah king of Y ’ hudah are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	14	Elisha was now ill with the disease from which he would eventually die . Yo ’ ash the king of Isra ’ el came down to visit him and wept over him ; he said , “ My father ! My father ! The chariots and horsemen of Isra ’ el ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	13	15	Elisha said to him , “ Bring a bow and arrows ” ; and he brought him a bow and arrows .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	16	He said to the king of Isra ’ el , “ Put your hand on the bow ” ; and he put his hand on it . Then Elisha laid his hands on the king ’ s hands
CJB	2%20Kings	13	17	and said , “ Open the east window. ” He opened it . Elisha said , “ Shoot ” ; and he shot . He said , “ Adonai ’ s arrow of victory , the arrow of victory against Aram ! You will defeat Aram completely at Afek ! ”
CJB	2%20Kings	13	18	He said , “ Take the arrows ” ; and he took them . He told the king of Isra ’ el , “ Strike the ground. ” He struck three times , then stopped .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	19	The man of God became angry with him ; he said , “ You should have struck five or six times ; then you would have defeated Aram completely . As it is , you will defeat Aram only three times. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	13	20	Elisha died , and they placed him in a burial cave . Now the raiding parties of Mo ’ av used to make yearly incursions into the land at the start of the year .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	21	Once it happened that just as they were burying a man , they spotted a raiding party ; so they threw the man ’ s body into Elisha ’ s burial cave ; and the moment the man touched the bones of Elisha , he revived and stood on his feet .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	22	Haza ’ el king of Aram oppressed Isra ’ el throughout the lifetime of Y ’ ho ’ achaz ;
CJB	2%20Kings	13	23	but Adonai was gracious , took pity on them and looked on them with favor , because of his covenant with Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov . He was not willing to destroy them , and to this day he has not banished them from his presence .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	24	Haza ’ el king of Aram died , and Ben-Hadad his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	13	25	Then Y ’ ho ’ ash the son of Y ’ ho ’ achaz captured from Ben-Hadad the son of Haza ’ el the cities which he had captured in war from Y ’ ho ’ achaz his father . Three times Yo ’ ash defeated him , thus recovering the cities of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	14	2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to rule , and he ruled for twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Y ’ ho ‘ adan , from Yerushalayim .

CJB	2%20Kings	14	3	He did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective , although not like David his ancestor ; he lived the same way as his father Yo ’ ash .
CJB	2%20Kings	14	4	However , the high places were not removed ; the people still sacrificed and offered on the high places .
CJB	2%20Kings	14	5	As soon as he had the kingdom firmly under his control , he put to death the servants of his who had murdered the king his father .
CJB	2%20Kings	14	6	But he did not put the children of the murderers to death , because of what is written in the scroll of the Torah of Moshe , as Adonai ordered when he said , “ Fathers are not to be executed for the children , nor are children to be executed for the fathers ; every person will be executed for his own sin. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	14	7	He slaughtered 10,000 men of Edom in the Salt Valley and captured Sela in the war , renaming it Yokte ’ el , as it is today .
CJB	2%20Kings	14	8	Then Amatzyah sent messengers to Y ’ ho ’ ash the son of Y ’ ho ’ achaz , son of Yehu , king of Isra ’ el , with this challenge : “ Come on , let ’ s have it out face-to-face. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	14	9	Y ’ ho ’ ash the king of Isra ’ el sent this reply to Amatzyah king of Y ’ hudah : “ Once , in the L ’ vanon , the thistle sent a message to the cedar : ‘ Give your daughter to my son in marriage. ’ But a wild animal passed by the thistle and squashed it .
CJB	2%20Kings	14	10	True , you have defeated Edom , and now you ’ re ambitious . So enjoy the glory , but stay home ! Why provoke calamity , to your own ruin , yours and Y ’ hudah ’ s too ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	14	11	But Amatzyah wouldn ’ t listen . So Y ’ ho ’ ash king of Isra ’ el went up ; and he and Amatzyah king of Y ’ hudah had it out face-to-face at Beit-Shemesh , which belongs to Y ’ hudah .

CJB	2%20Kings	15	20	He did this by taxing the wealthy men in Isra ’ el ; from each he required one-and-a-quarter pounds of silver to give to the king of Ashur . Then the king of Ashur turned around and left the land .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	21	Other activities of Menachem and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	22	Menachem slept with his ancestors , and P ’ kachyah his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	23	It was in the fiftieth year of ‘ Azaryah king of Y ’ hudah that P ’ kachyah the son of Menachem began his reign over Isra ’ el in Shomron ; he ruled for two years .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	24	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective ; he did not turn from the sins of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , who made Isra ’ el sin .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	25	Pekach the son of Remalyahu , one of his commanders , conspired against him . With Argov , Aryeh and fifty men from Gil ‘ ad , he assassinated him in the palace stronghold in Shomron . After killing him , he took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	26	Other activities of P ’ kachyah and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	27	It was in the fifty-second year of ‘ Azaryah king of Y ’ hudah that Pekach the son of Remalyah began to reign over Isra ’ el in Shomron ; his reign lasted twenty years .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	28	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective ; he did not turn from the sins of Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , who made Isra ’ el sin .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	29	During the time of Pekach king of Isra ’ el , Tiglat-Pil ’ eser king of Ashur came and conquered ‘ Iyon , Avel-Beit-Ma ‘ akhah , Yanoach , Kedesh , Hatzor , Gil ‘ ad , and the Galil — all the land of Naftali — and took them captive to Ashur .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	30	Hoshea the son of Elah conspired against Pekach the son of Remalyah , struck him , killed him and took his place as king in the twentieth year of Yotam the son of ‘ Uziyah .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	31	Other activities of Pekach and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	32	It was in the second year of Pekach the son of Remalyah , king of Isra ’ el , that Yotam the son of ‘ Uziyah king of Y ’ hudah began his reign .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	33	He was twenty-five years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for sixteen years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Yerusha the daughter of Tzadok .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	34	He did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of everything his father ‘ Uziyah had done .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	35	However , the high places were not taken away ; and the people still sacrificed and offered on the high places . He built the Upper Gate of the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	36	Other activities of Yotam and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	37	It was during this period that Adonai began sending against Y ’ hudah Retzin the king of Aram and Pekach the son of Remalyah .
CJB	2%20Kings	15	38	Yotam slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David his ancestor . Then Achaz his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	2	Achaz was twenty years old when he began to rule , and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim . But he did not do what was right from the perspective of Adonai his God , as David his ancestor had done .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	16	Uriyah the cohen acted in accordance with everything King Achaz ordered .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	3	Rather , he lived in the manner of the kings of Isra ’ el ; he even made his son pass through fire [ as a sacrifice ] , in keeping with the abominable practices of the pagans , whom Adonai had thrown out ahead of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	4	He also sacrificed and offered on the high places , on the hills and under any green tree .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	5	Then Retzin king of Aram and Pekach son of Remalyah , king of Isra ’ el , came up to fight against Yerushalayim . They put Achaz under siege , but they could not overcome him .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	6	It was at that time that Retzin king of Aram recovered Eilat for Aram and drove the Judeans from Eilat ; whereupon people from Edom came to Eilat to live , as they do to this day .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	7	Then Achaz sent messengers to Tiglat-Pil ’ eser king of Ashur with this message : “ I am your servant and your son . Come up , and save me from the king of Aram and the king of Isra ’ el , who are attacking me. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	16	8	Achaz took the silver and gold that was in the house of Adonai and in the treasuries of the royal palace and sent it as a present to the king of Ashur .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	9	The king of Ashur heeded him — the king of Ashur attacked Dammesek and captured it ; then he carried its people captive to Kir and killed Retzin .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	10	When King Achaz went to Dammesek to meet Tiglat-Pil ’ eser king of Ashur and saw the altar that was in Dammesek , he sent a drawing and model of the altar to Uriyah the cohen , with details of its construction and decoration .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	11	Then Uriyah the cohen built an altar exactly according to the design King Achaz had sent from Dammesek ; Uriyah the cohen had it ready by the time King Achaz returned from Dammesek .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	12	When the king arrived from Dammesek he saw the altar , and the king approached the altar and offered on it .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	13	He offered his burnt offering and his grain offering , poured out his drink offering and splashed the blood of his peace offerings on the altar .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	14	The bronze altar , which was before Adonai , he brought from in front of the house , from between his own altar and the house of Adonai , and put it on the north side of his own altar .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	15	Then King Achaz instructed Uriyah the cohen as follows : “ Henceforth , it is on the large altar that you are to offer the morning burnt offering , the evening grain offering , the king ’ s burnt offering and his grain offering , together with the burnt offering of all the people of the land , their grain offering and their drink offerings ; and you are to splash all the blood of the burnt offering against it and all the blood of the sacrifice . As for the bronze altar , I will take care of that. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	16	17	King Achaz removed the panels of the trolleys and took the basins off them ; he took the Sea off the bronze oxen supporting it and set it on the stone pavement ;
CJB	2%20Kings	16	18	and , because of the king of Ashur , he removed from the house of Adonai the colonnade used on Shabbat that had been built for it and the king ’ s entranceway outside it .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	19	Other activities of Achaz and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	16	20	Achaz slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David . Then Hizkiyahu his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	2	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , although he wasn ’ t as bad as the kings of Isra ’ el who had preceded him .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	17	They had their sons and daughters pass through fire [ as a sacrifice ] . They used divination and magic spells . And they gave themselves over to do what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , thereby provoking him ;
CJB	2%20Kings	17	3	Shalman ’ eser king of Ashur advanced against Hoshea , and Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	4	But the king of Ashur found that Hoshea was conspiring [ against him ] — he had sent messengers to So the king of Egypt and not paid his tribute to the king of Ashur , as he had previously done every year . For this the king of Ashur imprisoned him , putting him in chains .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	5	Then the king of Ashur invaded all the land , advanced on Shomron and put it under siege for three years .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	6	In the ninth year of Hoshea , the king of Ashur captured Shomron . He carried Isra ’ el away captive to Ashur , resettling them in Halach , in Havor on the Gozan River and in the cities of the Medes .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	7	This came about because the people of Isra ’ el had sinned against Adonai their God , who had brought them out of the land of Egypt , out from under the domination of Pharaoh king of Egypt . They feared other gods
CJB	2%20Kings	17	8	and lived by the customs of the nations that Adonai had expelled ahead of the people of Isra ’ el and by those of the kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	9	The people of Isra ’ el secretly did things that were not right , according to Adonai their God . They built high places for themselves wherever they lived , from the watchtower to the fortified city .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	10	They set up standing-stones and sacred poles for themselves on any high hill and under any green tree .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	11	Then they would make offerings on all the high places , like the nations Adonai had expelled ahead of them , and would do wicked things to provoke the anger of Adonai ;
CJB	2%20Kings	17	12	moreover , they served idols , something Adonai had expressly told them not to do .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	13	Adonai had warned Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah in advance through every prophet and seer , “ Turn from your evil ways ; and obey my mitzvot and regulations , in accordance with the entire Torah which I ordered your ancestors to keep and which I sent to you through my servants the prophets. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	17	14	Nevertheless , they refused to listen but made themselves as stubborn as their ancestors , who did not put their trust in Adonai their God .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	15	Thus they rejected his laws ; his covenant , which he had made with their ancestors ; and the solemn warnings he had given them . Instead they pursued worthless things and became worthless themselves , imitating the nations around them , whom Adonai had ordered them not to emulate .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	16	They abandoned all the mitzvot of Adonai their God . They made cast metal images for themselves , two calves . They made an asherah . They worshipped the whole army of heaven . They served Ba ‘ al .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	18	so that Adonai , by now very angry with Isra ’ el , removed them from his sight . None was left except the tribe of Y ’ hudah alone .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	19	( However , neither did Y ’ hudah obey the mitzvot of Adonai their God ; rather they lived according to the customs of Isra ’ el . )
CJB	2%20Kings	17	20	Yes , Adonai came to despise all the descendants of Isra ’ el . He caused them trouble and handed them over to plunderers , until finally he threw them out of his sight .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	21	He tore Isra ’ el away from the house of David . They made Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat king ; and Yarov ‘ am drew Isra ’ el away from following Adonai and made them commit a great sin .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	22	The people of Isra ’ el followed the example of all the sins that Yarov ‘ am had committed and did not turn away from them ,
CJB	2%20Kings	17	23	until Adonai removed Isra ’ el out of his sight , as he had said he would through all his servants the prophets . Thus Isra ’ el was carried away captive from their own land to Ashur , and it remains so to this day .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	24	The king of Ashur brought people from Bavel , Kutah , ‘ Ava , Hamat and S ’ farvayim and settled them in the cities of Shomron in place of the people of Isra ’ el ; they took possession of Shomron and lived in its cities .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	25	When they first came to live there , they did not fear Adonai . Therefore Adonai sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	26	So they said to the king of Ashur , “ The nations you carried away and settled in the cities of Shomron are not familiar with the rules for worshipping the God of the land . Therefore he has sent lions among them ; and they are there , killing them ; because they ’ re not familiar with the rules for worshipping the God of the land. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	17	27	In response , the king of Ashur gave this order : “ Take back one of the cohanim you brought from there . Have him go and live there , and have him teach them the rules for worshipping the God of the land. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	17	28	So one of the cohanim they had carried away captive from Shomron came and lived in Beit-El , and he taught them how they should fear Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	29	Nevertheless , every nation made gods of their own and put them in the temples on the high places which the Shomronim had made , every nation in the cities where they lived .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	30	Thus the people from Bavel made Sukkot-B ’ not , those from Kutah made Nergal , those from Hamat made Ashima ,
CJB	2%20Kings	17	31	the ‘ Avim made Nivchaz and Tartak , and the S ’ farvim burned up their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adramelekh and ‘ Anamelekh the gods of S ’ farvayim .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	32	So they feared Adonai , while at the same time they appointed for themselves priests from among themselves to preside at the high places , and they would sacrifice for them in the temples on the high places .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	33	They both feared Adonai and served their own gods in the manner customary among the nations from which they had been taken away .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	34	To this day they continue to follow their former [ pagan ] customs . They do not fear Adonai . They do not follow the regulations , rulings , Torah or mitzvah which Adonai ordered the descendants of Ya ‘ akov , to whom he gave the name Isra ’ el ,
CJB	2%20Kings	17	35	with whom Adonai had made a covenant and charged them , “ Do not fear other gods or bow down to them , serve them or sacrifice to them .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	36	On the contrary , you are to fear Adonai , who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm . Worship him , and sacrifice to him .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	37	You are to observe forever the laws , rulings , Torah and mitzvah which he wrote for you . You are not to fear other gods ,
CJB	2%20Kings	17	38	and you are not to forget the covenant I made with you . No , you must not fear other gods
CJB	2%20Kings	17	39	but must fear Adonai your God ; then he will rescue you from the power of all your enemies. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	17	40	However , they didn ’ t listen , but followed their old [ pagan ] practices .
CJB	2%20Kings	17	41	So these nations mixed fearing Adonai with serving their carved idols ; likewise their children ; and to this day , their descendants do the same as their ancestors did .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	2	He was twenty-five years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Avi the daughter of Z ’ kharyah .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	18	They summoned the king , but those answering the call were Elyakim the son of Hilkiyahu , who was in charge of the household , Shevnah the general secretary and Yo ’ ach the son of Asaf the foreign minister .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	3	He did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of everything David his ancestor had done .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	4	He removed the high places , smashed the standing-stones , cut down the asherah and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moshe had made ; because in those days the people of Isra ’ el were making offerings to it , calling it N ’ chushtan . *
CJB	2%20Kings	18	5	He put his trust in Adonai the God of Isra ’ el ; after him there was no one like him among all the kings of Y ’ hudah , nor had there been among those before him .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	6	For he clung to Adonai and did not leave off following him , but obeyed his mitzvot , which Adonai had given Moshe .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	7	So Adonai was with him . Wherever he went out to battle , he did well . He rebelled against the king of Ashur and refused to be his vassal .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	8	He drove the P ’ lishtim back to ‘ Azah and laid waste to their territory from the watchtower to the fortified city .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	9	It was in the fourth year of King Hizkiyahu , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah , king of Isra ’ el , that Shalman ’ eser king of Ashur advanced against Shomron and laid siege to it .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	10	At the end of three years they captured it — that is , Shomron was captured in the sixth year of Hizkiyahu , which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	11	The king of Ashur carried Isra ’ el away captive to Ashur and settled them in Halach , in Havor on the Gozan River and in the cities of the Medes .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	12	This happened because they did not heed the voice of Adonai their God , but violated his covenant , everything that Moshe the servant of Adonai had ordered them to do , and would neither hear it nor do it .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	13	In the fourteenth year of King Hizkiyahu , Sancheriv king of Ashur advanced against all the fortified cities of Y ’ hudah and captured them .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	14	Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah sent this message to the king of Ashur at Lakhish : “ I have done wrong . If you will go away from me , I will pay whatever penalty you impose on me. ” The king of Ashur imposed on Hizkiyahu a penalty of ten tons of silver and a ton of gold .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	15	Hizkiyahu gave him all the silver that could be found in the house of Adonai and in the treasuries of the royal palace .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	16	It was at that time that Hizkiyahu stripped the gold from the doors of the sanctuary of Adonai and from the doorposts which Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah himself had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Ashur .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	17	From Lakhish the king of Ashur sent Tartan , Rav-Saris and Rav-Shakeh to King Hizkiyahu in Yerushalayim with a large army . They advanced and came to Yerushalayim . Upon arrival , they came and positioned themselves by the aqueduct from the Upper Pool , which is by the road to the Launderers ’ Field .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	19	Rav-Shakeh addressed them : “ Tell Hizkiyahu : ‘ Here is what the great king , the king of Ashur , says : “ What makes you so confident ?
CJB	2%20Kings	18	20	Do you think that mere spoken words constitute strategy and strength for battle ? In whom , then , are you trusting when you rebel against me like this ?
CJB	2%20Kings	18	21	Now look ! Relying on Egypt is like using a broken stick as a staff — when you lean on it , it punctures your hand . That ’ s what Pharaoh king of Egypt is like for anyone who puts his trust in him .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	22	But if you tell me , ‘ We trust in Adonai our God , ’ then isn ’ t he the one whose high places and altars Hizkiyahu has removed , telling Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim , ‘ You must worship before this altar in Yerushalayim ’ ?
CJB	2%20Kings	18	23	All right , then , make a wager with my lord the king of Ashur : I will give you two thousand horses if you can find enough riders for them .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	24	How then can you repulse even one of my master ’ s lowest-ranked army officers ? Yet you are relying on Egypt for chariots and riders !
CJB	2%20Kings	18	25	Do you think I have come up to this place to destroy it without Adonai ’ s approval ? Adonai said to me , ‘ Attack this land , and destroy it ’ ! ” ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	18	26	Elyakim the son of Hilkiyahu , Shevnah and Yo ’ ach said to Rav-Shakeh , “ Please speak to your servants in Aramaic , since we understand it ; don ’ t speak with us in Hebrew while the people on the wall are listening. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	18	27	But Rav-Shakeh answered them , “ Did my master send me to deliver my message just to your master and yourselves ? Didn ’ t he send me to address the men sitting on the wall , who , like you , are going to eat their own dung and drink their own urine ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	18	28	Then Rav-Shakeh stood up and , speaking loudly in Hebrew , said : “ Hear what the great king , the king of Ashur , says !
CJB	2%20Kings	18	29	This is what the king says : ‘ Don ’ t let Hizkiyahu deceive you , because he won ’ t be able to save you from the power of the king of Ashur .
CJB	2%20Kings	18	30	And don ’ t let Hizkiyahu make you trust in Adonai by saying , “ Adonai will surely save us ; this city will not be given over to the king of Ashur. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	18	31	Don ’ t listen to Hizkiyahu. ’ For this is what the king of Ashur says : ‘ Make peace with me , surrender to me . Then every one of you can eat from his vine and fig tree and drink the water in his own cistern ;
CJB	2%20Kings	18	32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land with grain and wine , a land with bread and vineyards , a land with olive trees and honey ; so that you can live and not die . So don ’ t listen to Hizkiyahu ; he is only deluding you when he says , “ Adonai will save us. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	18	33	Has any god of any nation ever saved his land from the power of the king of Ashur ?
CJB	2%20Kings	18	34	Where are the gods of Hamat and Arpad ? Where are the gods of S ’ farvayim , Hena and ‘ Ivah ? Did they save Shomron from my power ?
CJB	2%20Kings	18	35	Where is the god of any country that has saved its country from my power , so that Adonai might be able to save Yerushalayim from my power ? ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	18	36	But the people kept still and didn ’ t answer him so much as a word ; for the king ’ s order was , “ Don ’ t answer him. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	18	37	Then Elyakim the son of Hilkiyah , who was in charge of the household , Shevnah the general secretary and Yo ’ ach the son of Asaf the foreign minister went to Hizkiyahu with their clothes torn and reported to him what Rav-Shakeh had said .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	2	He sent Elyakim , who was in charge of the household , Shevnah the general secretary and the leading cohanim , covered with sackcloth , to Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet , the son of Amotz .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	19	Now therefore , Adonai our God , please save us from his power — so that all the kingdoms on earth will know that you are Adonai , God — you only. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	19	3	They said to him , “ This is what Hizkiyahu says : ‘ Today is a day of trouble , rebuke and disgrace . Children are ready to be born , but there is no strength to bring them to birth .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	4	Maybe Adonai your God will hear all the words of Rav-Shakeh , whom his master the king of Ashur has sent to taunt the living God , and will rebuke the message which Adonai your God has heard . So pray for the remnant that is left. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	19	5	When King Hizkiyahu ’ s servants came to Yesha ‘ yahu ,
CJB	2%20Kings	19	6	he said to them , “ Tell your master that this is what Adonai says : ‘ Don ’ t be afraid of the words you heard the servants of the king of Ashur use to insult me .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	7	I will put a spirit in him that will make him hear a rumor and return to his own land ; then I will cause him to die by the sword in his own land. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	19	8	Rav-Shakeh returned and , having heard that the king of Ashur had left Lakhish , found him making war with Livnah .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	9	Then , on hearing it said that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia was on his way to fight him , the king of Ashur sent messengers to Hizkiyahu , telling them ,
CJB	2%20Kings	19	10	“ This is what you are to say to Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah : ‘ Don ’ t let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying , “ Yerushalayim will not be handed over to the power of the king of Ashur. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	19	11	You have heard what the kings of Ashur have done to all lands — they have completely destroyed them . So how will you be delivered ?
CJB	2%20Kings	19	12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them ? No , my ancestors destroyed them — Gozan , Haran , Retzef and the people of ‘ Eden who were in Tel ’ asar .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	13	Where is the king of Hamat ? the king of Arpad ? the king of the city of S ’ farvayim , of Hena and ‘ Ivah ? ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	19	14	Hizkiyahu took the letter from the messengers ’ hands and read it . Then Hizkiyahu went up to the house of Adonai and spread it out before Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	15	Hizkiyahu prayed as follows in the presence of Adonai : “ Adonai God of Isra ’ el , who dwells above the k ’ ruvim ! You alone are God of all the kingdoms on earth . You made heaven and earth .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	16	Turn your ear , Adonai , and hear ! Open your eyes , Adonai , and see ! Hear the words that Sancheriv sent to taunt the living God .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	17	It is true , Adonai , that the kings of Ashur have laid waste the nations and their lands
CJB	2%20Kings	19	18	and have thrown their gods into the fire . For those were non-gods , merely the product of people ’ s hands , wood and stone ; this is why they could destroy them .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	20	Then Yesha ‘ yahu the son of Amotz sent this message to Hizkiyahu : “ Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ You prayed to me against Sancheriv king of Ashur , and I have heard you. ’
CJB	2%20Kings	19	21	Here is Adonai ’ s answer concerning him : ‘ The virgin daughter of Tziyon despises you ; she laughs you to scorn . The daughter of Yerushalayim shakes her head at you .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	22	Whom have you taunted and insulted ? Against whom have you raised your voice and haughtily lifted your eyes ? The Holy One of Isra ’ el !
CJB	2%20Kings	19	23	“ ‘ Through your messengers you taunted Adonai . You said , “ With my many chariots I have ascended the mountain heights even in the far reaches of the L ’ vanon . I cut down its tall cedars and its best cypresses . I reached its remotest corners and its best forests .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	24	I dug [ wells ] in foreign lands , and I drank the water . The soles of my [ soldiers ’ ] feet dried up all the rivers of Egypt. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	19	25	“ ‘ Haven ’ t you heard ? Long ago I made it ; in antiquity I produced it ; and now I am making it happen : you are turning fortified cities into heaps of ruins ;
CJB	2%20Kings	19	26	while their inhabitants , shorn of power , are disheartened and ashamed , weak as grass , frail as plants , like grass on the rooftops or grain scorched by the east wind .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	27	“ ‘ But I know when you sit , when you leave , when you enter — and when you rage against me .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	28	And because of your rage against me , because of your pride that has reached my ears , I am putting my hook in your nose and my bridle on your lips ; and I will make you return by the way on which you came .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	29	“ ‘ This will be the sign for you : this year , you will eat the grain that grows of itself ; the second year , you will eat what grows from that ; but in the third year , you will sow , reap , plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	30	“ ‘ Meanwhile , the remnant of the house of Y ’ hudah that has escaped will again take root downward and bear fruit upward ;
CJB	2%20Kings	19	31	for a remnant will go out from Yerushalayim , those escaping will go out from Mount Tziyon . The zeal of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will accomplish this. ’
CJB	2%20Kings	19	32	“ Therefore this is what Adonai says concerning the king of Ashur : ‘ He will not come to this city or even shoot an arrow there ; he will not confront it with a shield or erect earthworks against it .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	33	By the way he came he will return ; he will not come to this city , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	34	‘ For I will defend this city and save it , both for my own sake and for my servant David ’ s sake. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	19	35	That night the angel of Adonai went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of Ashur . Early the next morning , there they were , all of them , corpses — dead .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	36	So Sancheriv king of Ashur left , went and returned to live in Ninveh .
CJB	2%20Kings	19	37	One day , as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisrokh his god , [ his sons ] Adramelekh and Shar ’ etzer struck him with the sword and escaped into the land of Ararat . So his son Esar-Hadon took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	20	2	Hizkiyahu turned his face toward the wall and prayed to Adonai :
CJB	2%20Kings	20	20	Other activities of Hizkiyahu , his power and how he built the pool and aqueduct to bring water into the city are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	20	3	“ I plead with you , Adonai , remember now how I have lived before you truly and wholeheartedly , and how I have done what you see as good. ” And he cried bitter tears .
CJB	2%20Kings	20	4	Before Yesha ‘ yahu had left the city ’ s middle courtyard , the word of Adonai came to him :
CJB	2%20Kings	20	5	“ Go back , and tell Hizkiyahu the prince of my people , that this is what Adonai , the God of David your ancestor , says : ‘ I have heard your prayer and seen your tears , and I will heal you . On the third day , you are to go up to the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	20	6	I will add fifteen years to your life . Also I will rescue you and this city from the power of the king of Ashur ; I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David ’ s sake. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	20	7	Then Yesha ‘ yahu said , “ Prepare a fig-plaster. ” They brought it and laid it on the inflammation , so that he would recover .
CJB	2%20Kings	20	8	Hizkiyahu said to Yesha ‘ yahu , “ What sign will there be that Adonai will heal me and that I will be able to go up to the house of Adonai on the third day ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	20	9	Yesha ‘ yahu said , “ Here is the sign for you from Adonai that Adonai will do what he said : do you want the shadow [ of the sundial ] to go forward ten intervals or backward ten intervals ?
CJB	2%20Kings	20	10	Hizkiyahu answered , “ It ’ s easy for the shadow to go down ten intervals . No , let the shadow return backward ten intervals. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	20	11	Yesha ‘ yahu called out to Adonai , and he brought the shadow on the sundial of Achaz ten intervals backward after it had gone down that far .
CJB	2%20Kings	20	12	B ’ rodakh-Bal ’ adan the son of Bal ’ adan , king of Bavel , heard that Hizkiyahu had been ill , so he sent a letter and a gift to him .
CJB	2%20Kings	20	13	Hizkiyahu listened to [ the messengers ] and showed them the building where he kept his treasures , including the silver , gold , spices and precious oils ; also the building where he kept his armor ; and everything in his treasury — there was nothing in his palace or in his entire domain that Hizkiyahu did not show them .
CJB	2%20Kings	20	14	Then Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet came to King Hizkiyahu and asked him , “ What did these men say ? Where did they come from ? ” Hizkiyahu answered , “ They came from a distant country , Bavel. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	20	15	Yesha ‘ yahu asked , “ What have they seen in your palace ? ” “ They have seen everything in my palace , ” said Hizkiyahu . “ There isn ’ t a thing among my treasures that I haven ’ t shown them. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	20	16	Yesha ‘ yahu said to Hizkiyahu , “ Hear what Adonai says :
CJB	2%20Kings	20	17	‘ The day will come when everything in your palace , along with everything your ancestors stored up until today , will be carried off to Bavel . Nothing will be left , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	20	18	‘ They will carry off some of your descendants , your own offspring ; and they will be made eunuchs serving in the palace of the king of Bavel. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	20	19	Hizkiyahu said to Yesha ‘ yahu , “ The word of Adonai which you have just told me is good. ” He thought , “ Isn ’ t it , though , if peace and truth continue at least through my lifetime ? ”
CJB	2%20Kings	20	21	Then Hizkiyahu slept with his ancestors , and M ’ nasheh his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	2	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the disgusting practices of the nations whom Adonai had expelled ahead of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	21	He followed entirely the manner of life of his father , serving the idols that his father served and worshipping them .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	3	For he rebuilt the high places Hizkiyahu his father had destroyed ; he erected altars for Ba ‘ al and made an asherah , as had Ach ’ av king of Isra ’ el ; and he worshipped all the army of heaven and served them .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	4	He erected altars in the house of Adonai , about which Adonai had said , “ In Yerushalayim I will put my name. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	21	5	He erected altars for all the army of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	6	He made his son pass through the fire [ as a sacrifice ] . He practiced soothsaying and divination and appointed mediums and persons who used spirit guides . He did much that was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , thus provoking him to anger .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	7	He set the carved image for the asherah he had made in the house concerning which Adonai had told David and Shlomo his son , “ In this house and in Yerushalayim , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Isra ’ el , I will put my name forever .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	8	Also I will not have the feet of Isra ’ el wander any longer out of the land which I gave their ancestors — if only they will take heed to obey every order I have given them and live in accordance with all the Torah that my servant Moshe ordered them to obey. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	21	9	But they did not take heed ; and M ’ nasheh misled them into doing even worse things than the nations Adonai had destroyed ahead of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	10	Adonai spoke this message through his servants the prophets :
CJB	2%20Kings	21	11	“ Because M ’ nasheh king of Y ’ hudah has done these disgusting things ; because he has done things more wicked than anything the Emori , who were there before him , did ; also because with his idols he made Y ’ hudah sin ;
CJB	2%20Kings	21	12	therefore here is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ I am going to bring such calamity on Yerushalayim and Y ’ hudah that the ears of all who hear of it will tingle .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	13	I will measure Yerushalayim with the same measuring cord that I used over Shomron , the same plumbline as for the house of Ach ’ av . I will scour Yerushalayim clean just as one scours a plate , scouring it and then turning it upside down .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	14	I will abandon the remnant of my heritage , delivering them into the power of their enemies — they will become prey and plunder for all their enemies ;
CJB	2%20Kings	21	15	because they have done what is evil from my perspective and have provoked me to anger from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt to this very day. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	21	16	Moreover , M ’ nasheh shed so much innocent blood that he flooded Yerushalayim from one end to the other — this in addition to his sin through which he caused Y ’ hudah to sin by doing what is evil from Adonai ’ s perspective .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	17	Other activities of M ’ nasheh , all his accomplishments and the sin he committed are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	18	Then M ’ nasheh slept with his ancestors and was buried in the garden of his own house , the Garden of ‘ Uza ; and Amon his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for two years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Meshulemet the daughter of Harutz from Yotvah .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	20	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , as had M ’ nasheh his father .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	22	He abandoned Adonai , the God of his ancestors , and did not live in Adonai ’ s way .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	23	Amon ’ s servants conspired against him and put the king to death in his own palace .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	24	But the people of the land put to death all those who had been part of the conspiracy against King Amon . Then the people of the land made Yoshiyahu his son king in place of him .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	25	Other activities of Amon and all he acomplished are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	21	26	Amon was buried in his tomb in the Garden of Uza , and Yoshiyahu his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	2	He did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective , living entirely in the manner of David his ancestor and turning away neither to the right nor to the left .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	22	Yoshiyahu was eight years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for thirty-one years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Y ’ didah the daughter of ‘ Adayah from Botzkat .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	3	In the eighteenth year of King Yoshiyahu , the king sent Shafan the son of Atzalyahu , the son of Meshulam , the secretary , to the house of Adonai after instructing him ,
CJB	2%20Kings	22	4	“ Go up to Hilkiyahu the cohen hagadol , and have him total the money that has been brought into the house of Adonai , which the doorkeepers have collected from the people .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	5	Then have them give it to the supervisors of the work being done in the house of Adonai ; they in turn are to use it to pay the laborers in the house of Adonai to repair damaged places in the building —
CJB	2%20Kings	22	6	the carpenters , construction-workers and stonemasons — and to purchase timber and worked stone for doing the repairs on the building. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	22	7	However , they did not require an accounting from the supervisors given the money to spend , because they dealt honestly .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	8	Hilkiyahu the cohen hagadol said to Shafan the secretary , “ I have found the scroll of the Torah in the house of Adonai. ” Hilkiyah gave the scroll to Shafan , who read it .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	9	Then Shafan the secretary went back to the king and gave the king this report : “ Your servants have poured out the money found in the house and handed it over to the people supervising the work in the house of Adonai. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	22	10	Shafan the secretary also told the king , “ Hilkiyah the cohen hagadol gave me a scroll. ” Then Shafan read it aloud before the king .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	11	After the king had heard what was written in the scroll of the Torah , he tore his clothes .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	12	Then the king issued this order to Hilkiyah the cohen , Achikam the son of Shafan , ‘ Akhbor the son of Mikhayah , Shafan the secretary and ‘ Asayah the king ’ s servant :
CJB	2%20Kings	22	13	“ Go ; and consult Adonai for me , for the people and for all Y ’ hudah in regard to what is written in this scroll which has been found . For Adonai must be furious at us , since our ancestors did not listen to the words written in this scroll and didn ’ t do everything written there that concerns us. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	22	14	So Hilkiyahu the cohen , Achikam , Akhbor , Shafan and ‘ Asayah went to Huldah the prophet , the wife of Shalum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harchas , keeper of the wardrobe — she lived in the Second Quarter of Yerushalayim — and spoke with her .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	15	She told them , “ Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says to tell the man who sent you to me
CJB	2%20Kings	22	16	that Adonai says this : ‘ I am going to bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants , every word in the scroll the king of Y ’ hudah has read ;
CJB	2%20Kings	22	17	because they have abandoned me and offered to other gods , in order to provoke me with everything they do . Therefore my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched. ’
CJB	2%20Kings	22	18	But you are to tell the king of Y ’ hudah , who sent you to consult Adonai , that Adonai the God of Isra ’ el also says this : ‘ In regard to the words you have heard ,
CJB	2%20Kings	22	19	because your heart was tender , and you humbled yourself before Adonai when you heard what I said against this place and its inhabitants — that they would become an object of astonishment and cursing — and have torn your clothes and cried before me , I have also heard you , says Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	22	20	Therefore I will gather you to your ancestors , you will go to your grave in peace , and your eyes will not see all the calamity I am going to bring on this place. ’ ” So they brought word back to the king .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	2	The king went up to the house of Adonai with all the men of Y ’ hudah , all those living in Yerushalayim , the cohanim , the prophets and all the people , both small and great ; and he read in their hearing everything written in the scroll of the covenant that had been found in the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	23	But in the eighteenth year of King Yoshiyahu this Pesach was observed to Adonai in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	3	The king stood on the platform and made a covenant in the presence of Adonai to live following Adonai , observing his mitzvot , instructions and regulations wholeheartedly and with all his being , so as to confirm the words of the covenant written in this scroll . All the people stood , pledging themselves to keep the covenant .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	4	Then the king ordered Hilkiyahu the cohen hagadol , the cohanim of the second rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the sanctuary of Adonai all the articles that had been made for Ba ‘ al , for the asherah and for the entire army of heaven ; and he burned them up outside Yerushalayim in the fields of Kidron and carried their ashes to Beit-El .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	5	He deposed the idolatrous priests the kings of Y ’ hudah had ordained to offer on the high places by the cities of Y ’ hudah and in the places surrounding Yerushalayim ; he also deposed those who offered to Ba ‘ al , the sun , the moon , the constellations and the whole army of heaven .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	6	He took the asherah from the house of Adonai to Vadi Kidron outside Yerushalayim and burned it in Vadi Kidron , stamped the ashes to powder and threw the powder onto the burial-ground for the common people .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	7	He smashed the houses of the cult prostitutes that were in the house of Adonai , where the women also wove garments for the asherah .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	8	He removed the cohanim from the cities of Y ’ hudah ; then , from Geva to Be ’ er-Sheva , he desecrated the high places where the cohanim had been making offerings . He also smashed the High Places of the Gates that were at the entrance of the Gate of Y ’ hoshua the governor of the city , on the left as one enters the city .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	9	But although the cohanim who had been at the high places did not come up to the altar of Adonai in Yerushalayim , nevertheless they did share matzah with their kinsmen .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	10	He desecrated the Tofet fire pit in the Ben-Hinnom Valley , so that no one could cause his son or daughter to pass through fire [ as a sacrifice ] to Molekh .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	11	He confiscated the horses which the kings of Y ’ hudah had given to the sun , at the entrance to the house of Adonai near the room of the officer N ’ tan-Melekh , in the side-courtyard ; and he burned up the chariots of the sun .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	12	The king smashed the altars on the roof of the upper room of Achaz , which the kings of Y ’ hudah had made , and the altars which M ’ nasheh had made in the two courtyards of the house of Adonai . He broke them into pieces and threw the rubble into Vadi Kidron .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	13	The king desecrated the high places facing Yerushalayim south of the Mount of Destruction , which Shlomo the king of Isra ’ el had built for ‘ Ashtoret the abomination of the Tzidonim , K ’ mosh the abomination of Mo ’ av and Milkom the abomination of the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	14	He smashed the standing-stones , chopped down the sacred poles and covered their remains with human bones .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	15	He smashed the altar that was at Beit-El and the high place made by Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , who caused Isra ’ el to sin . Yes , he smashed that altar and the high place ; he burned the high place , stamped the ashes to powder , and burned up the asherah .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	16	Then , as Yoshiyahu was turning around , he noticed the burial caves that were there on the mountain ; so he sent and had the bones taken out of the burial caves and burned them on the altar , thus desecrating it , in keeping with the word of Adonai which the man of God had proclaimed , foretelling that these things would happen .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	17	Then he asked , “ This monument here that I ’ m looking at , what is it ? ” The men of the city told him , “ It marks the burial cave of the man of God who came from Y ’ hudah and foretold the very things you have done to the altar of Beit-El. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	23	18	He replied , “ Let him be ; no one is to move his bones. ” So they left his bones undisturbed , along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Shomron .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	19	Yoshiyahu also removed all the shrines of the high places in the cities of Shomron , which the kings of Isra ’ el had made in order to provoke [ Adonai ] to anger , and treated them the same as in Beit-El .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	20	He put to death all the priests of those high places on the altars there , then burned human bones on them . Finally he returned to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	21	The king issued this order to all the people : “ Observe Pesach to Adonai your God , as written in this scroll of the covenant. ”
CJB	2%20Kings	23	22	For Pesach had not been so observed since the days when the judges ruled Isra ’ el — not during the times of any of the kings of Isra ’ el or of the kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	24	Yoshiyahu got rid of the mediums and the people using spirit guides , as well as the household gods , the idols and all the disgusting things spotted anywhere in Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim . He did this in order to establish the words of the Torah written in the scroll Hilkiyahu the cohen had found in the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	25	No previous king was like him ; because he turned to Adonai with all his heart , with all his being and with all his power , in accordance with all the Torah of Moshe ; nor did any king like him arise afterwards .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	26	Nevertheless , Adonai did not turn away from his fiercely raging , furious anger that burned against Y ’ hudah because of all the things M ’ nasheh had done to provoke him .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	27	Adonai said , “ Just as I removed Isra ’ el , I will also remove Y ’ hudah out of my sight ; and I will reject this city , which I chose , Yerushalayim , and the house concerning which I said , ‘ My name will be there. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Kings	23	28	Other activities of Yoshiyahu and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	29	During his time Pharaoh N ’ khoh king of Egypt went up toward the Euphrates River to attack the king of Ashur . King Yoshiyahu went out to oppose him ; but at Megiddo , Pharaoh spotted Yoshiyahu and killed him .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	30	His servants carried his dead body from Megiddo to Yerushalayim in a chariot and buried him in his own tomb . The people of the land took Y ’ ho ’ achaz the son of Yoshiyahu , anointed him , and made him king in his father ’ s place .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	31	Y ’ ho ’ achaz was twenty-three years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for three months in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Hamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu from Livnah .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	32	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of everything his ancestors had done .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	33	Pharaoh N ’ khoh imprisoned him at Rivlah in the land of Hamat , so that he would not be able to rule in Yerushalayim . He also imposed a penalty on the land of three-and-a-quarter tons of silver and sixty-six pounds of gold .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	34	Then Pharaoh N ’ khoh made Elyakim the son of Yoshiyahu king in place of Yoshiyahu his father and changed his name to Y ’ hoyakim . He also carried Y ’ ho ’ achaz off to Egypt , where he died .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	35	Y ’ hoyakim remitted the silver and gold to Pharaoh ; but in order to pay the money Pharaoh demanded , he had to levy a tax on the land . He taxed the people of the land , each according to his means , to pay the silver and gold to Pharaoh N ’ khoh .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	36	Y ’ hoyakim was twenty-five years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for eleven years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Z ’ vudah the daughter of P ’ dayah , from Rumah .
CJB	2%20Kings	23	37	He did what was evil from the perspective of Adonai , following the example of everything his ancestors had done .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	2	Adonai sent against him raiding parties from the Kasdim , Aram , Mo ’ av and the people of ‘ Amon ; he sent them against Y ’ hudah to destroy it , in keeping with the word of Adonai which he had spoken through his servants the prophets .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	24	It was in Y ’ hoyakim ’ s time that N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel invaded . Y ’ hoyakim became his vassal for three years , but then he turned against him and rebelled .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	3	Yes , it was at Adonai ’ s order that this happened to Y ’ hudah , in order to remove them from his sight because of the sins of M ’ nasheh and all he had done ,
CJB	2%20Kings	24	4	and also because of the innocent blood he had shed — for he had flooded Yerushalayim with innocent blood , and Adonai was unwilling to forgive .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	5	Other activities of Y ’ hoyakim and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	6	Then Y ’ hoyakim slept with his ancestors , and Y ’ hoyakhin his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	7	The king of Egypt did not leave his own land any more , because the king of Bavel had captured all the territory of the king of Egypt between the Vadi of Egypt and the Euphrates River .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	8	Y ’ hoyakhin was eighteen years old when he began his reign , and he ruled in Yerushalayim for three months . His mother ’ s name was N ’ chushta the daughter of Elnatan , from Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	9	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of everything his father had done .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	10	It was then that the officers of N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel marched on Yerushalayim and laid siege to the city .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	11	N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel himself went to the city while it was under siege ;
CJB	2%20Kings	24	12	and Y ’ hoyakhin king of Y ’ hudah went out to meet the king of Bavel — he , his mother , and his servants , princes and officers ; and the king of Bavel took him captive in the eighth year of his reign .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	13	He also carried away from there all the treasures in the house of Adonai and the treasures in the royal palace . He cut in pieces all the articles of gold which Shlomo king of Isra ’ el had made in the temple of Adonai , as Adonai had said would happen .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	14	He carried all Yerushalayim away captive — all the princes , all the bravest soldiers — 10,000 captives ; also all the craftsmen and metalworkers . No one was left but the poorest people of the land .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	15	Y ’ hoyakhin he carried off to Bavel ; likewise he carried off the king ’ s mother , the king ’ s wives , his officers and the main leaders of the land from Yerushalayim into captivity in Bavel .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	16	All the strong men — 7,000 of them , as well as 1,000 craftsmen and metalsmiths , all of them strong and trained for war — the king of Bavel brought captive to Bavel .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	17	The king of Bavel made Matanyah , Y ’ hoyakhin ’ s father ’ s brother , king in place of Y ’ hoyakhin and changed his name to Tzidkiyahu .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	18	Tzidkiyahu was twenty-one years old when he began to rule , and he ruled for eleven years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Hamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu , from Livnah .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	19	He did what was evil from the perspective of Adonai , following the example of everything Y ’ hoyakim had done .
CJB	2%20Kings	24	20	And it was because of Adonai ’ s anger that all these things happened to Yerushalayim and Y ’ hudah , until he had thrown them out of his presence . Tzidkiyahu rebelled against the king of Bavel ;
CJB	2%20Kings	25	2	The city remained under siege into the eleventh year of King Tzidkiyahu .
CJB	2%20Kings	25	25	But in the seventh month Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyah , the son of Elishama , of royal blood , came with ten men and assassinated G ’ dalyah and the Judeans and Kasdim who were with him in Mitzpah .
CJB	2%20Kings	25	3	On the ninth day of the [ fourth ] month , when the famine in the city was so severe that there was no food for the people of the land ,
CJB	2%20Kings	25	4	they broke through into the city . All the soldiers [ fled ] by night through the gate between the two walls , near the king ’ s garden . Because the Kasdim were surrounding the city , the king took the route through the ‘ Aravah .
CJB	2%20Kings	25	5	But the army of the Kasdim went in pursuit of the king and overtook him on the plains near Yericho ; all his troops deserted him .
CJB	2%20Kings	25	6	Then they took the king and brought him up to the king of Bavel in Rivlah , where they passed judgment on him .

CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	10	They put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his skull to the temple of Dagon .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	2	The P ’ lishtim pursued Sha ’ ul ; overtook him and his sons ; and the P ’ lishtim killed Y ’ honatan , Avinadav and Malkishua , the sons of Sha ’ ul .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	3	The fighting went hard against Sha ’ ul ; then the archers overtook and wounded him , so that he was in agony .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	4	Sha ’ ul said to his armor-bearer , “ Draw your sword and run me through with it . Otherwise , these uncircumcised men will come and make sport of me. ” But his armor-bearer refused ; he was too frightened . So Sha ’ ul took his sword and fell on it .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	5	When his armor-bearer saw that Sha ’ ul was dead , he too fell on his own sword and died .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	6	Thus Sha ’ ul , his three sons and all his household died together .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	7	When all the men of Isra ’ el who were in the valley saw them fleeing and that Sha ’ ul and his sons were dead , they abandoned their cities and fled ; then the P ’ lishtim came and lived in them .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	8	The following day , when the P ’ lishtim came to strip the dead , they found Sha ’ ul and his sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	9	They stripped him , then took his head and his armor and sent them all over the territory of the P ’ lishtim to carry the news to their idols and to the people .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	11	When everyone in Yavesh-Gil ‘ ad heard all that the P ’ lishtim had done to Sha ’ ul ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	12	all their warriors set out , took away the body of Sha ’ ul and the bodies of his sons , brought them to Yavesh , buried their bones under the pistachio tree in Yavesh and fasted seven days .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	13	So Sha ’ ul died for the transgression he committed against Adonai , because of the word of Adonai that he did not keep and because he sought the counsel of a spirit
CJB	1%20Chronicles	10	14	instead of consulting Adonai . Therefore Adonai put him to death and turned the rulership over to David the son of Yishai .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	11	here is the list of David ’ s warrior-heroes : Yashov ‘ am son of a Hakhmoni , the chief officer ; he is the one who raised his spear against
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	2	In the past , even when Sha ’ ul was king , it was you who led Isra ’ el ’ s military campaigns ; and Adonai your God said to you , ‘ You will shepherd my people Isra ’ el , and you will be chief over my people Isra ’ el. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	3	So all the leaders of Isra ’ el came to the king in Hevron ; and David made a covenant with them in Hevron in the presence of Adonai . Then they anointed David king over Isra ’ el , as Adonai had said through Sh ’ mu ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	4	David and all Isra ’ el went to Yerushalayim , also known as Y ’ vus ; and the Y ’ vusi , the inhabitants of that region , were there .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	5	The inhabitants of Y ’ vus taunted David by saying , “ You won ’ t get in here ! ” Nevertheless , David captured the stronghold of Tziyon , also known now as the City of David .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	6	David said , “ Whoever attacks the Y ’ vusi first will be commander-in-chief. ” Yo ’ av the son of Tz ’ ruyah attacked first and was made commander .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	7	David lived in the stronghold ; therefore they called it the City of David .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	8	David built up the city around it , starting at the Millo [ earth rampart ] and going on around ; while Yo ’ av repaired the rest of the city .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	9	David grew greater and greater , because Adonai-Tzva ’ ot was with him .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	10	These are David ’ s chief warriors , who , under his rulership , joined forces with him and with all Isra ’ el to make him king , as Adonai had said concerning Isra ’ el ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	300	men and killed them ; thus he had a reputation even among the three .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	12	After him was El ‘ azar the son of Dodo the Achochi , one of the three warriors .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	13	He was with David at Pas-Damim , where the P ’ lishtim had assembled for battle . There was a plot of ground full of barley ; and when the people fled from the P ’ lishtim ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	14	they stood in the middle of the plot and defended it , killing the P ’ lishtim ; and Adonai saved them with a great victory .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	15	Three of the thirty leaders went down to the rock and came to David during harvest season at the cave of ‘ Adulam when the army of the P ’ lishtim had set up camp in the Refa ’ im Valley .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	16	At that time David was in the fortress , and the garrison of the P ’ lishtim was in Beit-Lechem .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	17	David had a craving and said , “ I wish someone could give me water to drink from the well by the gate of Beit-Lechem ! ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	18	The three broke through the army of the P ’ lishtim , drew water from the well by the gate of Beit-Lechem , took it and brought it to David . But David would not drink it ; instead , he poured it out to Adonai
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	19	and said , “ My God forbid that I should do such a thing ! Am I to drink the blood of these men who went and put their lives in jeopardy ? They risked their lives to bring it ! ” — and he would not consent to drink it . These are the things the three warrior-heroes did .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	20	Avishai the brother of Yo ’ av was chief of these three . He raised his spear against
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	21	Of the three in the second rank he had the most honor and was therefore made their leader ; however , he did not achieve the status of the first three .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	22	B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada , the son of a valiant man of Kavtze ’ el , was a man of many exploits . He struck down two lion-hearted men of Mo ’ av . One day when it was snowing , he went down into a pit and killed a lion .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	23	Here is how he killed an Egyptian , a man who was very tall , seven-and-a-half feet : the Egyptian had a spear in his hand the size of a weaver ’ s beam ; he went down to him with only a stick , seized the spear from the Egyptian ’ s hand and killed him with his own spear .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	24	These are things that B ’ nayah the son of Y ’ hoyada did that earned him a name among the three warrior-heroes .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	25	He had more honor than the thirty , but he did not achieve the status of the first three . David put him in command of his personal guard .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	11	26	There were also these warrior-heroes : ‘ Asah ’ el the brother of Yo ’ av , Elchanan the son of Dodo , from Beit-Lechem ,

CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	7	) and Yo ‘ elah and Z ’ vadyah the sons of Yerocham from G ’ dor .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	8	) From the Gadi a number of strong , brave , trained fighting men defected to David at the fortress in the desert . They could handle shield and spear , they were as fierce as lions , and they were as fast as deer on the hills :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	9	) ‘ Ezer was the leader , ‘ Ovadyah was second , Eli ’ av third ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	10	) Mishmanah fourth , Yirmeyah fifth ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	11	) ‘ Atai sixth , Eli ’ el seventh ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	13	) Yirmeyah tenth , and Makhbanai eleventh .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	14	) These descendants of Gad were army commanders ; the least of them was worth a hundred , and the greatest worth a thousand .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	15	) These are the men who crossed the Yarden during the first month , when it had overflowed all its banks , and drove out all those who lived in the valleys , both to the east and to the west .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	16	) From the descendants of Binyamin and Y ’ hudah a number came to David at the fortress .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	17	) When David went out to meet them , he said , “ If you are coming to me in peace to help me , my heart will be bonded to yours . But if you are coming to betray me to my enemies , then , since I have done nothing wrong , may the God of our fathers see it and judge. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	18	) Then the Spirit covered ‘ Amasai the chief commander , and he said : “ We are yours , David ; on your side , son of Yishai ! Peace , peace to you , and peace to your helpers ; for your God helps you. ” David welcomed them and made them senior officers .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	19	) From M ’ nasheh some defected to David when he was about to go with the P ’ lishtim to fight against Sha ’ ul ; but they ended up not helping them ; because the rulers of the P ’ lishtim , after consultation , sent David away , saying , “ He will defect to his master Sha ’ ul at the cost of our heads. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	20	) As he was on his way to Ziklag , those who defected to him from M ’ nasheh included ‘ Adnach , Yozavad , Y ’ dia ‘ el , Mikha ’ el , Yozavad , Elihu and Tziltai , commanders of thousands from M ’ nasheh .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	21	) They helped David against the raiding band , for they were all strong , brave men who were commanders in the army .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	22	) Indeed , reinforcements to assist David reached him daily , until there was a great army , like the army of God .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	23	) Following are the numbers of those who came armed for war to David in Hevron , in order to transfer to him the kingdom of Sha ’ ul , according to what Adonai had said .

CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	28	) also Tzadok , a young man , strong and brave , with twenty-two commanders from his father ’ s family .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	29	) Of the descendants of Binyamin the kinsmen of Sha ’ ul , there were 3,000 ; for up until then , the majority of them had remained loyal to the house of Sha ’ ul .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	30	) Of the descendants of Efrayim , there were 20,800 strong , brave men , well known in their fathers ’ families .

CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	33	) Of Z ’ vulun , 50,000 men were fit for military service , experienced in war and able to use all kinds of weapons ; they were brave , and none was doubleminded .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	200	leaders , and all their kinsmen were under their command .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	34	) Of Naftali , there were 1,000 officers , and with them 37,000 troops having shields and spears .

CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	37	) On the other side of the Yarden , from the Re ’ uveni , the Gadi and the half-tribe of M ’ nasheh , there were 120,000 with all kinds of weapons for battle .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	38	) All these soldiers who were experienced in war came to Hevron wholeheartedly to make David king over all Isra ’ el , and all the rest from Isra ’ el were single-hearted in wanting to make David king .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	39	) They remained there with David for three days , eating and drinking , for their kinsmen had prepared for them .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	40	) Moreover , those who were near them — and even those as far as Yissakhar , Z ’ vulun and Naftali — brought food on donkeys , camels , mules and oxen : baked goods , fig cakes , clusters of raisins , wine , oil , and oxen and sheep in abundance ; for there was joy in Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	12	41	(
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	13	So David didn ’ t bring the ark into the City of David ; rather , David carried it aside into the house of ‘ Oved- ’ Edom the Gitti .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	2	Then David said to the entire assembly of Isra ’ el , “ If it seems good to you , and if it is the will of Adonai our God , let ’ s send messengers to the rest of our kinsmen in the land of Isra ’ el , and also to the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im in their cities with surrounding open land , asking them to join us ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	3	and let ’ s bring back the ark of our God to ourselves , since we didn ’ t go after it when Sha ’ ul was king. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	4	The whole assembly said they would do this , for in the view of all the people it seemed right .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	5	So David summoned all Isra ’ el to come together , from Shichor in Egypt all the way to the entrance of Hamat , to bring the ark of God from Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	6	David went up with all Isra ’ el to Ba ‘ alah , that is , Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim , which belonged to Y ’ hudah , to bring up from there the ark of God , Adonai , who is enthroned above the k ’ ruvim , bearing the Name .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	7	They set the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Avinadav , with ‘ Uza and Achyo , the sons of Avinadav , driving the cart .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	8	David and all Isra ’ el celebrated in the presence of God with all their strength , with songs , lyres , lutes , tambourines , cymbals and trumpets .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	9	When they arrived at Kidon ’ s threshing-floor , the oxen stumbled ; and ‘ Uza put out his hand to steady the ark .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	10	But Adonai ’ s anger blazed up against ‘ Uza , and he struck him down , because he had put out his hand and touched the ark , so that he died there before God .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	11	It upset David that Adonai had broken out against ‘ Uza ; that place has been called Peretz- ‘ Uza [ breaking-out of ‘ Uza ] ever since .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	12	That day , God frightened David ; he asked , “ How can I bring the ark of God to me ? ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	13	14	The ark of God stayed with the family of ‘ Oved- ’ Edom the Gitti in his house for three months ; and Adonai blessed the household of ‘ Oved- ’ Edom and all he had .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	14	David consulted God again , but God told him , “ Don ’ t attack them ! Turn away from them , and engage them opposite the balsam trees .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	2	David then knew that Adonai had set him up as king over Isra ’ el ; because , for the sake of his people Isra ’ el , his royal power had been greatly increased .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	3	David took more concubines and wives in Yerushalayim , and David became father of more sons and daughters .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	4	Here are the names of the children born to him in Yerushalayim : Shamua , Shovav , Natan , Shlomo ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	5	Yivchar , Elishua , Elpelet ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	6	Nogah , Nefeg , Yafia ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	7	Elishama , Be ‘ elyada and Elifelet .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	8	When the P ’ lishtim heard that David had been anointed king over all Isra ’ el , all the P ’ lishtim went up in search of David . On hearing of it , David went to attack them .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	9	Now the P ’ lishtim came and made a raid in the Refa ’ im Valley .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	10	David consulted God , asking , “ Should I attack the P ’ lishtim ? Will you hand them over to me ? ” Adonai answered David , “ Attack ; I will hand them over to you. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	11	So they went up to Ba ‘ al-P ’ ratzim , and David defeated them there . David said , “ God has broken through my enemies by my power like a river breaking through its banks. ” This is why they called the place Ba ‘ al-P ’ ratzim [ Lord of breaking through ] .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	12	The P ’ lishtim had left their gods there , so David gave an order , and they were burned up completely .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	13	The P ’ lishtim came up again and raided the valley .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	15	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees , move out , and attack ; because God has gone out ahead of you to defeat the army of the P ’ lishtim. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	16	David did as God had ordered him to do and pursued his attack on the army of the P ’ lishtim from Giv ‘ on to Gezer .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	14	17	So David ’ s reputation spread to all countries , and Adonai brought the fear of him on all nations .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	15	and the L ’ vi ’ im carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles on it , as Moshe had ordered , according to what Adonai had said .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	2	Then David said , “ No one but the L ’ vi ’ im should carry the ark of God , because Adonai chose them to carry the ark of Adonai and to serve him forever. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	3	David assembled all Isra ’ el in Yerushalayim to bring the ark of Adonai up to its place , which he had prepared for it .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	4	David gathered together the descendants of Aharon and the L ’ vi ’ im :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	5	from the descendants of K ’ hat : Uri ’ el the chief , and
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	120	of his kinsmen ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	6	from the descendants of M ’ rari : ‘ Asayah the chief , and
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	220	of his kinsmen ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	7	from the descendants of Gershom : Yo ’ el the chief , and
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	130	of his kinsmen ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	8	from the descendants of Elitzafan : Sh ’ ma ‘ yah the chief , and
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	200	of his kinsmen ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	9	from the descendants of Hevron : Eli ’ el the chief , and eighty of his kinsmen ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	10	and from the descendants of ‘ Uzi ’ el : ‘ Amminadav the chief , and
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	112	of his kinsmen .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	11	David called for Tzadok and Evyatar the cohanim and for the L ’ vi ’ im — Uri ’ el , ‘ Asayah , Yo ’ el , Sh ’ ma ‘ yah , Eli ’ el and ‘ Amminadav —
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	12	and said to them , “ You are the clan leaders of the L ’ vi ’ im . Consecrate yourselves , both you and your kinsmen , to bring the ark of Adonai the God of Isra ’ el up to the place I have prepared for it .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	13	It ’ s because you weren ’ t there the first time that Adonai our God broke out against us . We didn ’ t seek him out according to the rule. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	14	So the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of Adonai the God of Isra ’ el ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	16	David spoke to the chief of the L ’ vi ’ im to appoint their kinsmen to be singers making use of musical instruments — lutes , lyres and cymbals — to play loudly and raise sounds of joy .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	17	So the L ’ vi ’ im appointed Heman the son of Yo ’ el ; of his kinsmen , Asaf the son of Berekhyahu ; of the descendants of M ’ rari their kinsmen , Eitan the son of Kushayahu ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	18	and with them their second-degree kinsmen Z ’ kharyahu , Ben , Ya ‘ azi ’ el , Sh ’ miramot , Yechi ’ el , ‘ Uni , Eli ’ av , B ’ nayahu , Ma ‘ aseiyahu , Mattityahu , Elif ’ lehu , Mikneyahu , with ‘ Oved-Edom and Ye ‘ i ’ el the gatekeepers .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	19	The singers Heman , Asaf and Eitan were appointed to sound the bronze cymbals .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	20	Z ’ kharyahu , ‘ Azi ’ el , Sh ’ miramot , Yechi ’ el , ‘ Uni , Eli ’ av , Ma ‘ aseiyahu and B ’ nayahu were to play the lutes for ‘ alamot [ high-pitched music ? ] .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	21	Mattityahu , Elif ’ lehu , Mikneyahu , ’ Oved-Edom , Ye ‘ i ’ el and ‘ Azazyahu were to play lyres to lead the sh ’ minit [ low-pitched music ? ] .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	22	K ’ nanyahu , chief of the L ’ vi ’ im , was in charge of the singing ; he was put in charge of the singing because he was skillful at it .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	23	Berekhyahu and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	24	Sh ’ vanyahu , Yoshafat , N ’ tan ’ el , ‘ Amasai , Z ’ kharyahu , B ’ nayahu and Eli ‘ ezer the cohanim blew the trumpets in front of the ark of God . ‘ Oved-Edom and Yechiyah were gatekeepers for the ark .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	25	So David , the leaders of Isra ’ el and the commanders over thousands went to bring up the ark for the covenant of Adonai out from the house of ‘ Oved-Edom with joy .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	26	Since God was helping the L ’ vi ’ im who were carrying the ark for the covenant of Adonai , they sacrificed seven young bulls and seven rams .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	27	David , all the L ’ vi ’ im bearing the ark , the singers and K ’ nanyah the music leader for the singers were all wearing linen cloaks ; and David was also wearing a linen ritual vest .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	28	So all Isra ’ el brought up the ark for the covenant of Adonai with shouting ; blowing on shofars and trumpets ; and cymbals sounding with lutes and lyres .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	15	29	As the ark for the covenant of Adonai entered the City of David , Mikhal the daughter of Sha ’ ul , watching from the window , saw King David dancing and celebrating ; and she was filled with contempt for him .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	16	the covenant he made with Avraham ; the oath he swore to Yitz ’ chak
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	2	When David had finished offering the burnt offering and peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	3	Then he distributed to everyone in Isra ’ el , to everyone there , both men and women , a loaf of bread , a portion of meat and a raisin cake .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	4	He appointed certain L ’ vi ’ im to serve in front of the ark of Adonai , to celebrate , and to thank and praise Adonai the God of Isra ’ el :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	5	Asaf , the leader ; assisting him , Z ’ kharyah ; then Ye ‘ i ’ el , Sh ’ miramot , Yechi ’ el , Mattityahu , Eli ’ av , B ’ nayahu , ‘ Oved-Edom and Ye ‘ i ’ el playing lutes and lyres , while Asaf played cymbals .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	6	B ’ nayah and Yachzi ’ el the cohanim blew the trumpets continually before the ark for the covenant of God .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	7	It was on that same day that David first ordered that thanks be given to Adonai through Asaf and his kinsmen :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	8	Give thanks to Adonai ! Call on his name ! Make his deeds known among the peoples .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	9	Sing to him , sing praises to him ! Talk about all his wonders .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	10	Glory in his holy name ; let those seeking Adonai have joyful hearts .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	11	Seek Adonai and his strength ; always seek his presence .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	12	Remember the wonders he has done , his signs and his spoken judgments .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	13	You descendants of Isra ’ el his servant , you offspring of Ya ‘ akov , his chosen ones :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	14	he is Adonai our God , His judgments are everywhere on earth .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	15	Remember his covenant forever , the word he commanded to a thousand generations ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	17	and established as a law for Ya ‘ akov , for Isra ’ el as an everlasting covenant :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	18	“ To you I will give the land of Kena ‘ an as your allotted heritage. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	19	When you were but few in number , and not only few , but aliens there too ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	20	wandering from nation to nation , from this kingdom to that people ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	21	he allowed no one to oppress them . Yes , for their sakes he rebuked even kings :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	22	“ Don ’ t touch my anointed ones or do my prophets harm ! ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	23	Sing to Adonai , all the earth ! Proclaim his victory day after day !
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	24	Declare his glory among the nations , his wonders among all peoples !
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	25	For Adonai is great , and greatly to be praised ; he is to be feared more than all gods .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	26	For all the gods of the peoples are nothing , but Adonai made the heavens .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	27	In his presence are honor and majesty ; in his place , strength and joy .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	28	Give Adonai his due , you families from the peoples , give Adonai his due of glory and strength ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	29	give Adonai the glory due to his name ; bring an offering , and come into his presence . Worship Adonai in splendid , holy attire .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	30	Tremble before him , all the earth ! The world is firmly established , immovable .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	31	Let the heavens rejoice ; let the earth be glad ; let them say among the nations , “ Adonai is king ! ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	32	Let the sea roar , and everything in it ; let the fields exult , and all that is in them .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	33	Then the trees in the forest will sing before Adonai , because he has come to judge the earth .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	34	Give thanks to Adonai ; for he is good , for his grace continues forever .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	35	Say : “ Save us , God who can save us ! Gather and rescue us from the nations ; so that we can thank your holy name and glory in praising you .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	36	Blessed be Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , from eternity past to eternity future ! ” All the people said , “ Amen ! ” and praised Adonai .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	37	So , there before the ark for the covenant of Adonai , David left Asaf and his kinsmen to perform the service regularly before the ark , as each day ’ s work required ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	38	also ‘ Oved-Edom with their kinsmen , sixty-eight of them — ‘ Oved-Edom the son of Y ’ dutun and Hosah were gatekeepers .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	39	He left Tzadok the cohen with his kinsmen before the tabernacle of Adonai at the high place in Giv ‘ on
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	40	to offer burnt offerings to Adonai every morning and evening on the altar for burnt offerings , according to everything written in the Torah of Adonai , which he gave to Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	41	With them were Heman and Y ’ dutun and the rest who were chosen and assigned by name to give thanks to Adonai , because his grace continues forever .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	42	With them were Heman and Y ’ dutun to play trumpets and cymbals , also instruments for the songs about God ; while the sons of Y ’ dutun were assigned to the gate .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	16	43	Then the people all left for their homes , and David returned to bless his household .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	17	Yet in your view , God , even this was but a small thing ; so you have said that your servant ’ s dynasty will continue on into the distant future . You have regarded me , Adonai , God , as a man of high rank .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	2	Natan said to David , “ Go , do everything that is in your heart , for God is with you. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	3	But that same night the word of God came to Natan :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	4	“ Go , and tell David my servant that this is what Adonai says : ‘ You are not to build me a house to live in ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	5	because from the day I brought up Isra ’ el until today , I never lived in a house ; rather , I ’ ve gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	6	Everywhere I traveled with all Isra ’ el , did I ever speak a word to any of the judges of Isra ’ el , whom I ordered to shepherd my people Isra ’ el , asking , “ Why haven ’ t you built me a cedar-wood house ? ” ’
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	7	“ Therefore say to my servant David that this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ I took you from the sheep-yards , from following the sheep , to make you chief over my people Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	8	I have been with you wherever you went , I have destroyed all your enemies ahead of you ; and I am making your reputation like the reputations of the greatest people on earth .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	9	I will assign a place to my people Isra ’ el ; I will plant them there , so that they can live in their own place without being disturbed any more . The wicked will no longer devastate them , as they did at the beginning ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	10	and as they did from the time I ordered judges to be over my people Isra ’ el ; instead , I will subdue all your enemies . “ ‘ Moreover , I tell you that Adonai will make you a house .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	11	When your days come to an end and you go to be with your ancestors , I will establish one of your descendants to succeed you , one of your own sons ; and I will set up his rulership .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	12	He will build me a house , and I will establish his throne forever .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	13	I will be a father for him , and he will be a son for me ; I will not take my grace away from him , as I took it away from your predecessor .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	14	Rather , I will maintain him in my house and in my kingdom forever ; and his throne will be set up forever. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	15	Natan told David all of these words and described this entire vision .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	16	Then David went in , sat before Adonai and said , “ Who am I , Adonai , God , and what is my family , that has caused you to bring me this far ?
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	18	What more can David say to you about the honor you are bestowing on your servant ? For you know your servant intimately .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	19	Adonai , it is for your servant ’ s sake and in accordance with your own heart that you have done all this greatness and revealed all these great things .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	20	Adonai , there is no one like you , and there is no God besides you — everything we have heard confirms that .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	21	Who can be compared with your people Isra ’ el ? What other nation on earth did God set out to redeem and turn into a people for himself ? You made yourself a reputation by doing great and terrifying things , as you drove out the nations from before your people , whom you redeemed from Egypt .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	22	For you made your people Isra ’ el your people forever ; and you , Adonai , became their God .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	23	So now , Adonai , let the word that you spoke concerning your servant and his house be confirmed forever ; do what you have promised .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	24	May your name be confirmed and magnified forever ; so that it will be said , ‘ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is the God of Isra ’ el and the God for Isra ’ el , and the dynasty of David your servant will be set up in your presence. ’
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	25	For you , my God , have disclosed to your servant that you will build him a house . This is why your servant has the courage to pray to you .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	26	Now , Adonai , you are God ; and you have made this wonderful promise to your servant ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	17	27	and now it has pleased you to bless the family of your servant and thereby cause it to continue forever in your presence . For you , Adonai , have blessed , and it is blessed forever . ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	18	Some time afterwards , David attacked the P ’ lishtim and subdued them ; David took Gat and its villages out of the hands of the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	2	He also defeated Mo ’ av , so that the people of Mo ’ av became subjects of David and paid tribute .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	3	David , on his way to establish his dominion as far as the Euphrates River , also defeated Hadar ‘ ezer king of Tzovah near Hamat .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	4	David captured 1,000 chariots , 7,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers . He reserved enough horses for
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	100	chariots and disabled the rest .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	5	When the people of Aram from Dammesek came to the aid of Hadar ‘ ezer king of Tzovah , David killed 22,000 men of Aram .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	6	Then David put [ garrisons ] among the people of Aram in Dammesek ; Aram became subject to David and paid tribute . Adonai gave victory to David wherever he went .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	7	David took the gold shields which Hadar ‘ ezer ’ s servants were wearing and brought them to Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	8	From Tivchat and Kun , cities of Hadar ‘ ezer , King David took a great quantity of bronze , which Shlomo used to make the bronze “ Sea , ” the columns and various bronze articles .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	9	When To ‘ u king of Hamat heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadar ‘ ezer king of Tzovah ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	10	he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet and congratulate him on fighting and defeating Hadar ‘ ezer — for Hadar ‘ ezer had been at war with To ‘ u — and [ he sent ] all kinds of articles made of silver , gold and bronze ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	11	which King David dedicated to Adonai , along with the silver and gold that he had carried off from all the nations — from Edom , Mo ’ av , the people of ‘ Amon , the P ’ lishtim and ‘ Amalek .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	12	Moreover , Avishai the son of Tz ’ ruyah killed 18,000 men from Edom in the Salt Valley .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	13	David stationed garrisons in Edom , and all the people of Edom became subject to him . Adonai gave victory to David wherever he went .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	14	David ruled over all Isra ’ el ; he administered law and justice for all his people .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	15	Yo ’ av the son of Tz ’ ruyah was commander of the army , Y ’ hoshafat the son of Achilud was chief adviser ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	16	Tzadok the son of Achituv and Avimelekh the son of Evyatar were cohanim , Shavsha was secretary ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	18	17	B ’ nayahu the son of Y ’ hoyada was in charge of the K ’ reti and P ’ leti [ serving as the king ’ s bodyguards ] , and David ’ s sons were the king ’ s chief personal advisers .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	19	When all Hadar ‘ ezer ’ s servants saw that they had been defeated by Isra ’ el , they made peace with David and became his subjects ; and Aram would no longer help the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	2	David said , “ I will be kind to Hanun the son of Nachash , because his father showed grace to me. ” So David sent messengers to comfort him about his father . David ’ s servants entered the territory of the people of ‘ Amon to go to Hanun and comfort him ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	3	but the leaders of the people of ‘ Amon said to Hanun , “ Do you really think David is honoring your father by sending people to comfort you ? Haven ’ t his servants come to you in order to look the city over , overthrow it and reconnoiter the land ? ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	4	So Hanun took David ’ s servants , shaved them , cut off their clothes halfway up , at their hips , and then sent them away .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	5	Some people reported to David how the men had been treated . He sent a delegation to meet them , because the men had been deeply humiliated . The king said , “ Stay in Yericho until your beards have grown back , and then return. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	6	Aware that they had made themselves utterly abhorrent to David , Hanun and the people of ‘ Amon sent thirty-three tons of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram-Naharayim , Aram-Ma ‘ akhah and Tzovah .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	7	They hired 32,000 chariots , as well as the king of Ma ‘ akhah with his people , who came and pitched their camp in front of Meidva . Then the people of ‘ Amon assembled themselves from their cities and went out to fight .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	8	When David heard of it , he sent Yo ’ av with his entire army of trained soldiers .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	9	The army of ‘ Amon came out and went into battle formation at the city gate , while the kings who had come were alone in the countryside .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	10	When Yo ’ av saw that he would be fighting on two fronts , ahead and behind , he chose the best troops of Isra ’ el to deploy against Aram ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	11	while the rest of the army he put under the command of Avishai his brother to deploy against the army of ‘ Amon .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	12	He said , “ If Aram is too strong for me , you help me ; but if the army of ‘ Amon is too strong for you , then I will help you .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	13	Take courage , and let ’ s be strong for the sake of our people and the cities of our God . May Adonai do what seems good to him. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	14	So Yo ’ av and the people with him went to engage Aram in battle , and they fled before him .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	15	When the people of ‘ Amon saw that Aram had fled , they likewise fled before Avishai his brother and retreated into the city . Then Yo ’ av went to Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	16	When Aram saw that Isra ’ el had gotten the better of them , they sent messengers and brought out the people of Aram who lived beyond the [ Euphrates ] River , with Shofakh the commander of Hadar ‘ ezer ’ s army at their head .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	17	It was reported to David ; so he gathered all Isra ’ el together and crossed the Yarden to engage them . David deployed his forces for battle against Aram ; and after he had done so , fought them .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	19	18	But Aram fled before Isra ’ el ; David killed 7,000 chariot-drivers and 40,000 foot soldiers from Aram ; and he killed Shofakh the commander of the army .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	20	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	20	20	In the spring , at the time when kings go out to war , Yo ’ av led the army out in force and laid waste to the country of the people of ‘ Amon ; then he came and laid siege to Rabbah . But David stayed in Yerushalayim , while Yo ’ av attacked Rabbah and destroyed it .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	20	2	David took the crown off Malkam ’ s head and found it to weigh sixty-six pounds , with its gold and precious stones ; and it was placed on David ’ s head . He carried off great quantities of spoil from the city .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	20	3	In addition , he brought out the people who were in it and set them to work with saws , iron harrows and axes . This is what he did to all the cities of the people of ‘ Amon . Then David and all the people returned to Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	20	4	A while after this there was war at Gezer with the P ’ lishtim . Sibkhai the Hushati killed Sipai , one of the giants , and they were defeated .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	20	5	There was more war with the P ’ lishtim ; and Elchanan the son of Ya ’ ir killed Lachmi the brother of Golyat the Gitti , who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver ’ s beam .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	20	6	There was again war at Gat , where there was a very tall man whose fingers and toes numbered twenty-four , six [ fingers on each hand ] and six [ toes on each foot ] ; and he too was a son of the giant .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	20	7	When he mocked Isra ’ el , Y ’ honatan the son of Shim ‘ a David ’ s brother killed him .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	20	8	These were sons of the giant in Gat ; they fell at the hands of David and his servants .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	1	Chronicles 21:1 Hebrew : Satan
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	21	David approached Ornan . When Ornan looked and saw David , he went out from the threshing-floor and prostrated himself before David with his face to the ground .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	2	David said to Yo ’ av and the leaders of the people , “ Go , take a census of Isra ’ el from Be ’ er-Sheva to Dan ; then report to me , so that I can know how many of them there are. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	3	Yo ’ av said , “ May Adonai make his people a hundred times as many as they are now ! But , my lord the king , aren ’ t they all my lord ’ s servants in any case ? Why does my lord the king require this ? Why should he bring guilt upon Isra ’ el ? ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	4	Nevertheless , the king ’ s word prevailed against Yo ’ av . So Yo ’ av left and went through all Isra ’ el , after which he came to Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	5	Yo ’ av reported the results of the census to David : in Isra ’ el were 1,100,000 men who could handle a sword , while Y ’ hudah had 470,000 men who could handle a sword .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	6	But he didn ’ t count Levi and Binyamin among them , because the king ’ s order was hateful to Yo ’ av .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	7	God was displeased with this and therefore punished Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	8	David said to God , “ I have greatly sinned by doing this . But now , please ! Put aside your servant ’ s sin , for I have done a very foolish thing. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	9	Adonai spoke to Gad , David ’ s seer :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	10	“ Go and tell David that Adonai says , ‘ I am offering you a choice of three punishments : choose one of them , and I will execute it against you. ’ ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	11	Gad came to David and said to him , “ Take your choice :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	12	three years of famine ; or three months of being swept away by your enemies , while your enemies ’ sword overwhelms you ; or three days of Adonai ’ s sword — plague in the land , with the angel of Adonai destroying everywhere in Isra ’ el ’ s territory . Now think about what answer I should give to the one who sent me. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	13	David said to Gad , “ This is very hard for me . Let me fall into the hand of Adonai , because his mercies are very great , rather than have me fall into the hand of man. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	14	So Adonai sent a plague on Isra ’ el ; 70,000 of the people of Isra ’ el died .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	15	God also sent an angel to destroy Yerushalayim , but when he was about to carry out the destruction , Adonai saw it and changed his mind about causing such distress ; so he said to the destroying angel , “ Enough ! Now withdraw your hand. ” The angel of Adonai was standing at the threshing-floor of Ornan the Y ’ vusi .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	16	David raised his eyes and saw the angel of Adonai standing between the earth and the sky , and in his hand was a drawn sword stretched out over Yerushalayim . Then David and the leaders , wearing sackcloth , fell on their faces .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	17	David said to God , “ Wasn ’ t it I who ordered the census of the people ? Yes , I am the one who has sinned and done something very wicked . But these sheep , what have they done ? Please ! Let your hand be against me and my father ’ s family , but not against your people , striking them with this plague ! ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	18	Then the angel of Adonai ordered Gad to tell David to go and set up an altar to Adonai on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Y ’ vusi .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	19	David went up at Gad ’ s word , spoken in Adonai ’ s name .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	20	Ornan turned back and saw the angel , and his four sons who were with him hid themselves . As Ornan was threshing wheat ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	22	Then David said to Ornan , “ Let me have the parcel with this threshing-floor , so that I can build on it an altar to Adonai — I will pay you its full value — so that the plague will be lifted from the people. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	23	Ornan said to David , “ Take it for yourself , and let my lord the king do what seems good to him . I ’ m giving you the oxen for the burnt offerings , the threshing-sledges for firewood and the wheat for the grain offering — I ’ m giving it all. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	24	But King David said to Ornan , “ No ; I insist on buying it from you at the full price . I refuse to take what is yours for Adonai or offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	25	So David bought the place from Ornan for
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	600	shekels of gold by weight [ fifteen pounds ] .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	26	Then David built an altar to Adonai there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . He called on Adonai , who answered him from heaven by fire on the altar for burnt offerings .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	27	Adonai gave an order to the angel , and he put his sword back in its sheath .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	28	When David saw that Adonai had answered him at the threshing-floor of Ornan the Y ’ vusi , he sacrificed there .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	29	For at that time the tabernacle of Adonai , which Moshe had made in the desert , together with the altar for burnt offerings , were in the high place at Giv ‘ on .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	21	30	But David could not go into its presence to consult God , because the sword of the angel of Adonai had struck him with terror . Footnotes -

CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	22	Then David said , “ This is the house of Adonai , God ; and this is the altar Isra ’ el is to use for burnt offerings. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	2	David ordered that the foreigners in the land of Isra ’ el should be assembled , and he appointed stone-workers to shape stones for building the house of God .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	3	David prepared a large store of iron from which to make nails and clamps for the gateway doors and , a quantity of bronze too great to weigh ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	4	and cedar logs beyond numbering — because the Tzidonim and the people from Tzor brought cedar logs in abundance to David .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	5	David said , “ Shlomo my son is young and inexperienced , while the house to be built for Adonai must be so magnificent and splendid that its fame and glory will be known in every country ; so I will make preparations for him. ” Therefore David made extensive preparations before his death .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	6	Then he summoned Shlomo his son and charged him to build a house for Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	7	“ My son , ” said David to Shlomo , “ my heart was set on building a house for the name of Adonai my God .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	8	But a message from Adonai came to me , ‘ You have shed much blood and fought great wars . You are not to build a house for my name , because you have shed so much blood on the earth in my sight .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	9	But you will have a son who will be a man of rest . I will give him rest from all his enemies that surround him ; for his name is to be Shlomo , and during his reign I will give peace [ a ] and quiet to Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	10	It is he who will build a house for my name . He will be my son and I will be his father , and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Isra ’ el forever. ’
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	11	“ Now , my son , may Adonai be with you and give you success as you build the house of Adonai your God , in keeping with what he said about you .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	12	May Adonai give you common sense and understanding , and may he give you his orders concerning Isra ’ el , so that you will observe the Torah of Adonai your God .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	13	Then you will succeed , if you take care to obey the laws and rulings that Adonai ordered Moshe concerning Isra ’ el . Be strong , be bold ; don ’ t be afraid or become discouraged !
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	14	“ Now look : despite my difficulties , I have prepared for the house of Adonai 3,300 tons of gold , 33,000 tons of silver , and so much bronze and iron that it can ’ t be weighed . I ’ ve also prepared timber and stone , and you can add to it .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	15	Moreover , you have plenty of workers — quarrymen , stone-workers , lumbermen , and all kinds of skilled craftsmen to do whatever has to be done with
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	16	the gold , silver , bronze and iron — they ’ re beyond number . So get up , and get to work ! And may Adonai be with you. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	17	David also ordered all the leaders of Isra ’ el to help Shlomo his son :
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	18	“ Isn ’ t Adonai your God with you ? Hasn ’ t he given you rest on every side ? For he has put the inhabitants of the land under my power — the land has been subdued before Adonai and his people .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	22	19	Now set your heart and being on seeking Adonai your God . Get up , and build the sanctuary for Adonai , God . Then you can bring the ark for the covenant of Adonai and the holy articles of God into the house that will be built for the name of Adonai. ” Footnotes -

CJB	1%20Chronicles	23	24	These were the descendants of Levi , according to their clans , the heads of clans according to their listing in the register , who did the work for the service of the house of Adonai , those twenty years old and over .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	23	25	For David said , “ Adonai the God of Isra ’ el has given rest to his people , and he lives in Yerushalayim forever .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	23	26	The L ’ vi ’ im will no longer have to carry the tabernacle and all the equipment that goes with it for its service. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	23	27	For , according to David ’ s last instructions , the descendants of Levi twenty years old and over were to be counted .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	23	28	Their role was to assist the descendants of Aharon with the service of the house of Adonai in the courtyards and rooms , and with purification of all the holy articles — in other words , with the work needed to minister in the house of God .

CJB	1%20Chronicles	24	3	David , together with Tzadok from the descendants of El ‘ azar , and Achimelekh from the descendants of Itamar , arranged them in divisions for service .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	24	4	There were more men who were chiefs found among the descendants of El ‘ azar than among the descendants of Itamar ; therefore there were sixteen divisions of the descendants of El ‘ azar , headed by clan leaders , and eight divisions of the descendants of Itamar , according to their clans .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	24	5	They were assigned [ periods of service ] by lot , the one group equally with the other , since both the descendants of El ‘ azar and the descendants of Itamar had officers of the sanctuary and officers of God .

CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	2	Then David the king rose to his feet and said : “ My kinsmen and my people ! Listen to me ! I set my heart on building a house where the ark for the covenant of Adonai could remain at rest . It would have been God ’ s footstool , and I prepared to build it .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	3	But God said to me , ‘ You are not to build a house for my name , because you are a man of war , you have shed blood. ’
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	4	However , Adonai the God of Isra ’ el chose me out of my father ’ s whole family to be king over Isra ’ el forever ; for he chose Y ’ hudah to be the leader ; and in the house of Y ’ hudah , in the house of my father , and among the sons of my father , it was his pleasure to make me king over all Isra ’ el ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	5	and of all my sons — for Adonai has given me many sons — he has chosen Shlomo my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Adonai over Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	6	“ Moreover , he said to me , ‘ Shlomo your son will build my house and courtyards , for I have chosen him to be a son to me , and I will be a father to him .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	7	I will establish his kingdom forever , if he uses his strength to obey my mitzvot and abide by my rulings , as [ he is doing ] currently. ’
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	8	Now therefore , in the sight of all Isra ’ el , the community of Adonai , and in the hearing of our God , observe and seek out all the mitzvot of Adonai your God , so that you may continue to possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants after you forever .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	9	“ As for you , Shlomo my son , know the God of your father . Serve him wholeheartedly and with desire in your being ; for Adonai searches all hearts and understands all the inclinations of people ’ s thoughts . If you seek him , he will let himself be found by you ; but if you abandon him , he will reject you forever .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	10	See now that Adonai has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary ; so be strong , and do it ! ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	11	Then David gave Shlomo his son the designs for the hall [ of the temple ] , its buildings , its supply areas , its upper rooms , its inside rooms , and the place for the ark-cover ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	12	also the designs for everything he had been given by the Spirit — for the courtyards of the house of Adonai , for all the rooms surrounding it , for the storehouses in the house of God , for the storehouses for the holy articles ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	13	and for the areas set aside for the cohanim and the L ’ vi ’ im ; [ arrangements ] for the work involved in the service of the house of Adonai and for all the articles needed for the service of the house of Adonai ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	14	[ lists ] of the weights of gold needed for the gold items to be used for various purposes , and the weights of silver needed for the silver items to be used for various purposes —
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	15	the weight of the gold needed for the gold menorahs , the weight needed for each menorah and for its lamps ; and for the menorahs of silver , the weight of silver needed for each menorah and for its lamps , according to the way each menorah was to be used ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	16	also the gold by weight for the tables for the showbread , for each table ; and silver for the tables made of silver ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	17	the gold for the pure gold forks , basins and jars , and for the gold bowls by weight for each bowl ; also for the silver bowls by weight for each bowl ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	18	and for the incense altar , refined gold by weight ; and gold for the design of the chariot and the k ’ ruvim with their wings spread out to cover the ark for the covenant of Adonai .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	19	“ All this is in writing , as Adonai , with his hand on me , has given me good sense in working out these detailed plans. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	20	Then David said to Shlomo his son , “ Be strong , be bold , and do it ! Don ’ t be afraid or become discouraged ! For Adonai , God , my God , is with you . He will not fail you or abandon you until all the work for the service in the house of Adonai has been finished .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	28	21	See , there are the divisions of the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im for all the service in the house of God .

CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	1	Chronicles
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	29	The activities of David the king , from first to last , are written in the records of Sh ’ mu ’ el the seer , Natan the prophet and Gad the seer ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	2	Now I have used all my strength to prepare for the house of my God the gold needed for the articles of gold , the silver for the articles of silver , the bronze for the articles of bronze , the iron for the articles of iron , the wood for the articles of wood , onyx stones , gemstones to be set , brilliant stones of various colors , all kinds of precious stones , as well as marble in abundance .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	3	In addition , because my desire is set on the house of my God , since I have my own supply of gold and silver , I herewith give it to the house of my God — over and above everything I have prepared for the holy house —
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	4	ninety-nine tons of gold from the gold of Ofir and
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	231	tons of refined silver to be used for overlaying the walls of the houses .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	5	The gold is for whatever is to be made of gold , and the silver is for whatever is to be made of silver ; and they may be used for anything to be made by craftsmen . Therefore , who offers willingly to consecrate himself today to Adonai ? ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	6	Then the clan leaders , the leaders of the tribes of Isra ’ el , the captains of thousands and of hundreds , along with the supervisors over the king ’ s work offered willingly .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	7	They gave for the service of the house of God
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	165	tons of gold ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	330	tons of silver ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	594	tons of bronze and 3,300 tons of iron .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	8	Those who had precious stones gave them to the storehouse of the house of Adonai , supervised by Yechi ’ el the Gershuni .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	9	The people were filled with joy , because they had given willingly — wholeheartedly they had given willingly to Adonai ; and David the king too was completely filled with joy ,
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	10	as he blessed Adonai before the entire community : “ Blessed be you , Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el our father , forever and ever .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	11	Yours , Adonai , is the greatness , the power , the glory , the victory and the majesty ; for everything in heaven and on earth is yours . The kingdom is yours , Adonai ; and you are exalted as head over all .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	12	Riches and honor come from you , you rule everything , in your hand is power and strength , you have the capacity to make great and to give strength to all .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	13	Therefore , our God , we thank you and praise your glorious name .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	14	“ But who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to give so willingly in this way ? For all things come from you , so that we have given you what is already yours .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	15	For in your presence we are temporary residents , just passing through , as all our ancestors were — our days on earth are like a shadow , without hope .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	16	Adonai our God , all these supplies that we have prepared in order to build you a house for your holy name come from your own hand , all of it is already yours .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	17	I know also , my God , that you test the heart and take pleasure in integrity . As for myself , I have given all these things willingly , in the integrity of my heart ; and now , with joy , I have seen your people who are present here give willingly to you .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	18	Adonai , God of Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Isra ’ el our ancestors , guard forever the inclinations of the thoughts in the hearts of your people ; direct their hearts to you ;
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	19	and give to Shlomo my son wholeheartedness to obey your mitzvot , instructions and rules , to do all these things , and to build the palace for which I have made provision. ”
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	20	Then David said to all the community , “ Now bless Adonai your God. ” All the community blessed Adonai , the God of their ancestors , bowing their heads and prostrating themselves before Adonai and before the king .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	21	On the following day they presented sacrifices to Adonai and offered burnt offerings to Adonai — a thousand bulls , a thousand rams and a thousand lambs , with their drink offerings — and sacrifices in abundance for all Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	22	They ate and drank before Adonai that day with great joy . Then , for the second time , they made Shlomo the son of David king , anointing him before Adonai to be king , and Tzadok to be cohen .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	23	Shlomo sat on the throne of Adonai as king in place of David his father and prospered , and all Isra ’ el obeyed him .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	24	All the leaders , the warrior-heroes and likewise the sons of King David submitted themselves to Shlomo the king .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	25	Adonai gave Shlomo exceedingly great power , in full view of all Isra ’ el , and bestowed on him royal majesty such as had not been seen on any king before him in Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	26	Now David the son of Yishai ruled over all Isra ’ el .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	27	The duration of his reign over Isra ’ el was forty years ; he reigned seven years in Hevron , and he reigned thirty-three years in Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	28	Then he died , at a ripe old age , full of years , riches and honor ; and Shlomo his son reigned in his place .
CJB	1%20Chronicles	29	30	with all his reign and his power , and the events that he , Isra ’ el and the kingdoms of other countries experienced .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	2	Shlomo spoke to all Isra ’ el — to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , to the judges and to every leader in all Isra ’ el , the heads of clans .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	1	Shlomo the son of David grew stronger in his rulership ; Adonai his God was with him , making him greater and greater .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	3	Shlomo and the whole community with him went to the high place at Giv ‘ on , because in that place was God ’ s tent of meeting , which Moshe the servant of Adonai had made in the desert .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	4	But the ark of God David had brought up from Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim to the place he had prepared for it — he had set up a tent for it in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	5	The bronze altar crafted by B ’ tzal ’ el the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had been placed before the tabernacle of Adonai ; and there Shlomo and the community consulted him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	6	On the bronze altar at the tent of meeting Shlomo offered a thousand burnt offerings before Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	7	That night God appeared to Shlomo and said to him , “ Tell me what I should give you. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	8	Shlomo said to God , “ You showed much grace to your servant David my father and have made me king in his place .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	9	Now , Adonai , God , you have been faithful to your promise to David my father ; for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the grains of dust on the earth .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	10	So now , give me wisdom and knowledge ; so that I will be able to lead this people . For who is equal to judging this great people of yours ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	11	God said to Shlomo , “ Because you set your heart on this — because , instead of asking for riches , wealth , honor , the death of those who hate you , or long life , you asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself , so that you would be able to judge my people , over whom I made you king —
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	12	not only are wisdom and knowledge being given to you , but I will also give you riches , wealth and honor such as no king before you has ever had ; and no king after you will have as much. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	13	So Shlomo came away from the high place at Giv ‘ on , from in front of the tent of meeting , to Yerushalayim ; and he ruled over Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	14	Shlomo amassed chariots and horsemen ; he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen ; he placed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	15	The king made silver and gold in Yerushalayim as common as stones , and he made cedars as abundant as sycamore-fig trees in the Sh ’ felah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	16	Shlomo ’ s horses had been brought from Egypt and from Keve , with the king ’ s agents having bought them from the dealers in Keve at the going price .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	17	A chariot brought from Egypt cost fifteen pounds of silver shekels and a horse three-and-three quarters pounds [ of shekels ] ; all the kings of the Hittim and the kings of Aram purchased them at these prices through Shlomo ’ s agents .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	1	18	( 2:1 ) Shlomo then decided to build a house for the name of Adonai and a royal palace for himself .

CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	2	He began building in the fourth year of his reign , on the second day of the second month .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	3	These are the foundations Shlomo laid for building the house of God : the length in old-standard cubits was sixty cubits [
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	105	feet ] and the width twenty cubits [ thirty-five feet ] .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	4	The length of the hall fronting the house was the same as the house ’ s width , thirty-five feet and the height
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	210	[ feet ] ; and he overlaid it with pure gold .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	5	The larger house he covered with cypress-wood , which he overlaid with fine gold and embossed with palm trees and chains .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	6	He also decorated the building with precious stones and gold from Parvayim ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	7	overlaying the house and its beams , thresholds , walls and doors with gold and carving k ’ ruvim on the walls .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	8	Then he made the Especially Holy Place ; its length matched the width of the house , thirty-five feet , and its width was thirty-five feet . He overlaid it with twenty tons of fine gold .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	9	The weight of the nails was one-and-a-quarter pounds of gold , and he overlaid the upper rooms with gold .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	10	Inside the Especially Holy Place he made two k ’ ruvim of cast metal , and they overlaid them with gold .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	11	The wings of the k ’ ruvim were thirty-five feet long — the wing of the one keruv was eight-and-three-quarters feet long and touched the wall of the house ; the other wing was also eight-and-three-quarters feet long , so that it touched the wing of the other keruv .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	12	The wing of the other keruv was eight-and-three-quarters feet long , touching the wall of the house ; and the other wing was also eight-and-three-quarters feet long , touching the wing of the first keruv .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	13	The wings of these k ’ ruvim spread out over thirty-five feet . They stood on their feet with their faces turned inward .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	14	He made the curtain of blue , purple and crimson material and of fine linen , with a design of k ’ ruvim worked into it .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	15	In front of the house he made two columns sixty-one-and-a-quarter feet high , with a capital of eight-and-three-quarters feet on top of each .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	16	He made chains in the sanctuary and added them to the tops of the columns , and he made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	3	17	He erected the columns in front of the temple , one on the right and the other on the left ; the one on the right he called Yakhin , and the one on the left he called Bo ‘ az .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	2	He made the cast metal “ Sea ” circular , seventeen-and-a-half feet from rim to rim , eight-and-three quarters feet high and fifty-two-and-a-half feet in circumference .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	4	It rested on twelve oxen , three looking north , three looking west , three looking south and three looking east , all with their hindquarters toward the center . The Sea was set on top of them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	3	Below the rim a ring of ox-like figures encircled it , ten for every twenty-one inches all the way around the Sea . The oxen were in two rows ; they were cast when the Sea was cast .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	5	It was a handbreadth thick , its rim was made like the rim of a cup , like the flower of a lily ; and its capacity was 16,500 gallons .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	6	He also made ten basins for washing and put five on the right and five on the left . Items needed for the burnt offerings would be cleansed in these , but the Sea was for the cohanim to wash in .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	7	He made the ten menorahs of gold in accordance with their specifications and set them in the temple , five on the right and five on the left .

CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	13	and the

CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	14	He also made the trolleys , the basins on the trolleys ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	15	the one Sea , the twelve oxen under it ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	16	the ash pots , the shovels , the forks and all the other equipment for it . All these articles that Huram the master craftsman made for King Shlomo in the house of Adonai were of brilliant bronze .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	17	The king cast them in the plain of the Yarden , in the clay ground between Sukkot and Tz ’ redah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	18	Shlomo made so many of these objects that the total weight of the bronze could not be determined .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	19	Shlomo made all the objects that were inside the house of God : the gold altar ; the table on which the showbread was displayed ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	20	the menorahs with their lamps to burn in front of the sanctuary as specified , of pure gold ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	21	the flowers , lamps and tongs of gold , solid gold ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	4	22	and the snuffers , bowls , cups and fire pans of pure gold . As for the entryway to the house , the inner doors for the Especially Holy Place and the doors of the house ( that is , of the temple ) were of gold .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	2	Shlomo assembled all the leaders of Isra ’ el and all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the paternal clans of the people of Isra ’ el , to Yerushalayim , to bring the ark for the covenant of Adonai out of the City of David , also known as Tziyon .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	5	and brought up the ark , the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils that were in the tent ; these are what the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im brought up .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	3	All the people of Isra ’ el assembled before the king at the festival in the seventh month .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	4	All the leaders of Isra ’ el came . The L ’ vi ’ im took the ark
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	6	King Shlomo and the whole community of Isra ’ el who had assembled in his presence were in front of the ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen in numbers beyond counting or recording .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	7	The cohanim brought the ark for the covenant of Adonai in to its place inside the sanctuary of the house , to the Especially Holy Place , under the wings of the k ’ ruvim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	8	For the k ’ ruvim spread out their wings over the place for the ark , covering the ark and its poles from above .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	9	The poles were so long that their ends could be seen [ extending ] from the ark into the sanctuary , but they could not be seen from outside ; they are there to this day .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	10	There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets Moshe put there at Horev , when Adonai made the covenant with the people of Isra ’ el at the time of their leaving Egypt .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	11	When the cohanim came out of the Holy Place ( for all the cohanim who were present had consecrated themselves ; they didn ’ t keep to their divisions ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	12	also the L ’ vi ’ im who were the singers , all of them — Asaf , Heman , Y ’ dutun and their sons and relatives — dressed in fine linen , with cymbals , lutes and lyres , stood on the east side of the altar ; and with them
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	120	cohanim sounding trumpets ) ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	13	then , when the trumpeters and singers were playing in concord , to be heard harmoniously praising and thanking Adonai , and they lifted their voices together with the trumpets , cymbals and other musical instruments to praise Adonai : “ for he is good , for his grace continues forever ” — then , the house , the house of Adonai , was filled with a cloud ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	5	14	so that because of the cloud , the cohanim could not stand up to perform their service ; for the glory of Adonai filled the house of God .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	2	But I have built you a magnificent house , a place where you can live forever. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	6	But now I have chosen Yerushalayim , so that my name can be there ; and I have chosen David to be over my people Isra ’ el. ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	3	Then the king turned around and blessed the whole community of Isra ’ el . The whole community of Isra ’ el stood
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	4	as he said , “ Blessed be Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , who spoke to my father David with his mouth and fulfilled his promise with his hand . He said ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	5	‘ Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt , I chose no city from any of the tribes of Isra ’ el to build a house , so that my name might be there ; nor did I choose anyone to be the leader of my people Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	7	It was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Adonai the God of Isra ’ el ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	8	but Adonai said to David my father , ‘ Although it was in your heart to build a house for my name , and you did well that it was in your heart ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	9	nevertheless you will not build the house . Rather , you will father a son , and it will be he who will build the house for my name. ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	10	Now Adonai has fulfilled this spoken word of his ; for I have succeeded my father and sit on the throne of Isra ’ el , as Adonai promised ; and I have built the house for the name of Adonai the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	11	And there I have placed the ark containing the covenant of Adonai , which he made with the people of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	12	Then he stood before the altar of Adonai in the presence of the whole community of Isra ’ el , spread out his hands —
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	13	for Shlomo had made a bronze platform eight-and-three quarters feet long , eight-and-three-quarters feet wide and five-and-a-quarter feet high and had set it up in the middle of the courtyard . He stood on it , then got down on his knees before the whole community , spread out his hands toward heaven ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	14	and said , “ Adonai , God of Isra ’ el , there is no God like you in heaven or on earth . You keep covenant with your servants and show them grace , provided they live in your presence with all their heart .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	15	You have kept your promise to your servant David , my father ; you spoke with your mouth and fulfilled it with your hand ; so it is today .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	16	Now therefore , Adonai , God of Isra ’ el , keep what you promised to your servant David , my father , when you said , ‘ You will never lack a man in my presence to sit on the throne of Isra ’ el , if only your children are careful about what they do , so that they live by my Torah , just as you have lived in my presence. ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	17	Now therefore , Adonai , God of Isra ’ el , please let your word , which you spoke to your servant David , my father , be confirmed .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	18	“ But can God actually live with human beings on the earth ? Why , heaven itself , even the heaven of heavens , can not contain you ; so how much less this house I have built ?
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	19	Even so , Adonai my God , pay attention to your servant ’ s prayer and plea , listen to the cry and prayer that your servant is praying before you ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	20	that your eyes will be open toward this house day and night — toward the place where you said you would put your name — to listen to the prayer your servant will pray toward this place .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	21	Yes , listen to the pleas of your servant , and also those of your people Isra ’ el when they pray toward this place . Hear from where you live , from heaven ; and when you hear , forgive !
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	22	“ If a person sins against a fellow member of the community , and he is made to swear under oath , and he comes and swears before your altar in this house ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	23	then hear from heaven , act and judge your servants , paying back the wicked , so that his way of life devolves on his own head , and vindicating the one who is right , giving him what his righteousness deserves .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	24	“ If your people Isra ’ el sin against you and in consequence are defeated by an enemy ; then if they turn back to you , acknowledge your name , and pray and make their plea to you in this house ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	25	hear from heaven , forgive the sin of your people Isra ’ el , and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	26	“ When they sin against you , and in consequence the sky is shut , so that there is no rain ; then if they pray toward this place , acknowledge your name and turn from their sin when you have brought them low ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	27	hear in heaven , forgive the sin of your servants and of your people Isra ’ el — since you keep teaching them the good way by which they should live — and send down rain on your land , which you have given your people as their inheritance .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	28	“ If there is famine in the land , or blight , windstorm , mildew , locusts or shearer-worms ; or if their enemies besiege them in any of their cities — no matter what kind of plague or sickness it is ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	29	then , regardless of what prayer or plea anyone among all your people Isra ’ el makes — for each individual will know his own plague and his own pain — and the person spreads out his hands toward this house ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	30	then hear from heaven where you live , and forgive ; also , since you know what is in each one ’ s heart , give each person what his conduct deserves ( because you , and only you , know human hearts ) ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	31	so that they will fear you and therefore live according to your ways throughout the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	32	“ Also the foreigner who does not belong to your people Isra ’ el — when he comes from a distant country because of your great reputation , your mighty hand and your outstretched arm , when they come and pray toward this house ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	33	then hear from heaven , from where you live ; and act in accordance with everything about which the foreigner is calling to you ; so that all the peoples of the earth will know your name and fear you , as does your people Isra ’ el , and so that they will know that this house which I have built bears your name .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	34	“ If your people go out to fight their enemies , no matter by which way you send them , and they pray to you toward the city you chose and the house I built for your name ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	35	then , from heaven , hear their prayer and plea , and uphold their cause .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	36	“ If they sin against you — for there is no one who doesn ’ t sin — and you are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy , so that they carry them off captive to a land far away or nearby ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	37	then , if they come to their senses in the land where they have been carried away captive , turn back and make their plea to you in the land where they are being held captive , saying , ‘ We sinned , we acted wrongly , we behaved wickedly , ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	38	if , in the land where they were brought and are being held captive , they return to you with all their heart and being and pray to you toward their own land , which you gave to their ancestors , toward the city you chose and toward the house I have built for your name ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	39	then , from heaven , from where you live , hear their prayer and pleas , uphold their cause , and forgive your people who have sinned against you .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	40	“ Now , my God , please , let your eyes be open , and let your ears pay attention to the prayer being made in this place .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	41	“ Now go up , Adonai , God , to your place of rest , you and the ark through which you give strength . “ May your cohanim , Adonai , God , be clothed with salvation ; may those loyal to you take joy in good .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	6	42	“ Adonai , God , don ’ t turn away the face of your anointed one ; remember the mercies of your servant David . ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	2	so that the cohanim could not enter the house of Adonai ; because the glory of Adonai filled Adonai ’ s house .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	7	Shlomo also consecrated the center of the courtyard in front of the house of Adonai ; because he had to offer the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings there . For the bronze altar which Shlomo had made could not receive the burnt offering , the grain offering and the fat .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	3	All the people of Isra ’ el saw when the fire came down , and the glory of Adonai was on the house ; they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the flooring ; prostrating themselves , they gave thanks to Adonai , “ for he is good , for his grace continues forever. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	5	King Shlomo offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep . Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	6	The cohanim stood at their appointed stations , while the L ’ vi ’ im used the instruments that David the king had provided for making music to Adonai in order to “ give thanks to Adonai , for his grace continues forever , ” by means of the praises David had composed . Opposite them the cohanim sounded trumpets ; and all Isra ’ el stood up .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	8	So Shlomo celebrated the festival at that time for seven days , together with all Isra ’ el , an enormous gathering ; [ they had come all the way ] from the entrance of Hamat to the Vadi [ of Egypt ] .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	9	On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly , having observed the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	10	Then , on the twenty-third day of the seventh month , he sent the people away to their tents full of joy and glad of heart for all the goodness Adonai had shown to David , to Shlomo and to Isra ’ el his people .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	11	Thus Shlomo finished the house of Adonai and the royal palace . Everything that Shlomo had set his heart on making in the house of Adonai and in his own palace he accomplished successfully .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	12	Adonai appeared to Shlomo by night and said to him , “ I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	13	If I shut up the sky , so that there is no rain ; or if I order locusts to devour the land ; or if I send an epidemic of sickness among my people ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	14	then , if my people , who bear my name , will humble themselves , pray , seek my face and turn from their evil ways , I will hear from heaven , forgive their sin and heal their land .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	15	Now my eyes will be open and my ears will pay attention to the prayer made in this place .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	16	For now I have chosen and consecrated this house , so that my name can be there forever ; my eyes and heart will always be there .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	17	As for you , if you will live in my presence , as did David your father , doing everything I have ordered you to do , and keeping my laws and rulings ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	18	then I will establish the throne of your rulership , as I covenanted with David your father when I said , ‘ You will never lack a man to be ruler in Isra ’ el. ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	19	But if you turn away and abandon my regulations and mitzvot which I have set before you , and go and serve other gods , worshipping them ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	20	then I will pull them up by the roots out of the land I have given them . This house , which I consecrated for my name , I will eject from my sight ; and I will make it an example to avoid and an object of scorn among all peoples .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	21	This house , now so exalted — everyone passing by will be shocked at the sight of it and will ask , ‘ Why has Adonai done this to this land and to this house ? ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	7	22	But the answer will be , ‘ It ’ s because they abandoned Adonai the God of their ancestors , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and took hold of other gods , worshipping and serving them ; this is why [ Adonai ] brought all these calamities on them . ’ ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	2	Shlomo built up the cities which Huram had given to Shlomo and had the people of Isra ’ el live there .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	8	from their descendants remaining after them in the land , whom the people of Isra ’ el did not exterminate — from them Shlomo levied [ his forced laborers ] , as it is to this day .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	3	Then Shlomo attacked Hamat-Tzovah and defeated it .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	4	He built Tadmor in the desert and all the cities for storing supplies that he built in Hamat .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	5	He also built Upper Beit-Horon and Lower Beit-Horon , fortified cities with walls , gates and bars ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	6	Ba ‘ alat ; and all the cities that Shlomo had for storing supplies , all the cities for his chariots , the cities for his horsemen , and all the other buildings Shlomo wanted to build in Yerushalayim , in the L ’ vanon and throughout the land he ruled .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	7	As for all the people still left from the Hitti , Emori , P ’ rizi , Hivi , and Y ’ vusi , who were not part of Isra ’ el ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	9	But Shlomo did not raise any of his slaves from the people of Isra ’ el ; rather , these were the soldiers , his chief commanders , and the officials in charge of his chariots and horsemen .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	10	King Shlomo had
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	250	chief officers in charge of the people .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	11	Shlomo brought up Pharaoh ’ s daughter from the City of David to the house he had built for her ; because he said , “ No wife of mine is going to live in the house of David king of Isra ’ el , since the [ buildings ] where the ark of Adonai has been are holy. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	12	Then Shlomo offered burnt offerings to Adonai on the altar of Adonai that he had built in front of the vestibule ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	13	as each day required , offering according to the mitzvah of Moshe on Shabbats , at Rosh-Hodesh and at the designated times three times a year — the festivals of Matzah , Shavu ‘ ot and Sukkot .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	14	As David his father had ordered , he appointed the divisions of the cohanim for their service and the L ’ vi ’ im to their tasks — to praise and to perform their service in the presence of the cohanim according to each day ’ s requirements . He also appointed the gatekeepers by their divisions to be at every gate , for David the man of God had so ordered .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	15	They did not deviate from the king ’ s order to the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im in any matter or in regard to the supplies .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	16	All the work of Shlomo was organized in this way from the day ground was broken for the house of Adonai until everything had been accomplished , and the house of Adonai had been completed .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	17	Shlomo went to ‘ Etzyon-Gever and Elot on the shore of the sea in the land of Edom .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	8	18	Huram sent some of his servants with ships , and others that were experienced sailors who understood the sea ; they went with Shlomo ’ s servants to Ofir and took from there fifteen tons of gold , which they brought back to King Shlomo .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	2	and Shlomo answered all her questions ; nothing was hidden from the king that he could not explain to her .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	9	Then she gave the king four tons of gold , spices in great abundance , and precious stones ; there had never been spices like those the queen of Sh ’ va gave to King Shlomo .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	3	After the queen of Sh ’ va had seen Shlomo ’ s wisdom , the palace he had built ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	4	the food at his table , the manner of seating his officials , the manner in which his staff served him and how they were dressed , his personal servants and how they were dressed , and his manner of going up to the house of Adonai , it left her breathless .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	5	She said to the king , “ What I heard in my own country about your deeds and your wisdom is true ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	6	but I couldn ’ t believe the report until I came and saw for myself . Actually , they didn ’ t tell me even half of how great your wisdom is . In reality , you surpass the reports I heard .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	7	How happy your people must be , how happy these servants of yours who are always here attending you and get to hear your wisdom !
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	8	Blessed be Adonai your God , who took pleasure in you to put you on his throne , so that you could be king for Adonai your God . Because of your God ’ s love for Isra ’ el , to establish them forever , he has made you king over them , to administer law and judgment. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	10	Huram ’ s servants and Shlomo ’ s servants , who had brought the gold from Ofir , now brought sandalwood and precious stones .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	11	The king used the sandalwood to make walkways for the house of Adonai and for the royal palace , also lyres and lutes for the singers . None like these had been seen before in the land of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	12	King Shlomo gave the queen of Sh ’ va everything she wanted , whatever she asked , more than what she had brought to the king . After this , she returned and went back to her own country , she and her servants .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	13	The weight of the gold Shlomo received annually came to twenty-two tons ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	14	besides that which came from customs duties and sales taxes ; also all the Arab kings and regional governors brought gold and silver to Shlomo .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	15	King Shlomo made
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	200	large shields of hammered gold ; fifteen pounds of hammered gold went into one shield .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	16	He made
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	300	more shields of hammered gold , with seven-and-a-half pounds going into one shield ; the king put these in the House of the L ’ vanon Forest .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	17	The king also made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	18	The throne had six steps and a gold footstool ; these were fastened to the throne . There were arms on either side of the seat , two lions standing beside the arms ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	19	and twelve more lions standing on each side of the six steps . Nothing like it had ever been made in any kingdom .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	20	All King Shlomo ’ s drinking vessels were of gold ; and all the utensils in the House of the L ’ vanon Forest were of pure gold ; for in Shlomo ’ s time , silver was regarded as having little value .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	21	The king had ships that could go to Tarshish with Huram ’ s servants ; once every three years the “ Tarshish ” ships came in , bringing gold , silver , ivory , apes and peacocks .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	22	So King Shlomo surpassed all the kings on earth in both wealth and wisdom .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	23	All the kings on earth sought to have an audience with Shlomo , in order to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	24	Each one brought his present — articles of silver , articles of gold , clothing , armor , spices , horses and mules ; and this continued year after year .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	25	Shlomo also had 4,000 stalls of horses for his chariots and his 12,000 horsemen ; he assigned them to the chariot cities and to the king in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	26	He ruled over all the kingdoms from the [ Euphrates ] River through the land of the P ’ lishtim to the border of Egypt .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	27	The king made silver in Yerushalayim as common as stones , and he made cedars as abundant as sycamore-fig trees are in the Sh ’ felah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	28	They brought horses for Shlomo from Egypt and from all countries .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	29	Other activities of Shlomo , from beginning to end , are written in the records of Natan the prophet , in the prophecy of Achiyah of Shiloh and in the visions of Ye ‘ do the seer concerning Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	30	Shlomo reigned in Yerushalayim over all Isra ’ el for forty years .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	9	31	Then Shlomo slept with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David his father , and Rechav ‘ am his son became king in his place .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	2	When Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat heard of it , he returned from Egypt , where he had fled from Shlomo .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	10	The young men he had grown up with said to him , “ The people who said to you , ‘ Your father made our yoke heavy , but you , make it lighter for us ’ — here ’ s the answer you should give them : ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father ’ s waist !
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	3	They sent and summoned him , so Yarov ‘ am and all Isra ’ el came and said to Rechav ‘ am ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	4	“ Your father laid a harsh yoke on us . But if you will lighten the harsh service we had to render your father and ease his heavy yoke that he put on us , we will serve you. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	5	He said to them , “ Come back to me after three days. ” So the people left .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	6	King Rechav ‘ am consulted the older men who had been in attendance on Shlomo his father during his lifetime and asked , “ What advice would you give me as to how to answer these people ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	7	They said to him , “ If you will treat these people kindly , pleasing them and giving them favorable consideration , they will be your servants forever. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	8	But he didn ’ t take the advice the older men gave him ; instead he consulted the young men he had grown up with , who were now his attendants .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	9	He said to them , “ What advice would you give me , so that we can give an answer to these people who said to me , ‘ Lighten the yoke that your father laid on us ’ ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	11	Yes , my father burdened you with a heavy yoke , but I will make it heavier ! My father controlled you with whips , but I [ will control you ] with scorpions ! ’ ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	12	So Yarov ‘ am and all the people came to Rechav ‘ am the third day , as the king had requested by saying , “ Come to me again the third day ” ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	13	and the king answered them harshly . Abandoning the advice of the older men , King Rechav ‘ am
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	14	addressed them according to the advice of the young men and said , “ I will make your yoke heavy , and I will add to it ! My father controlled you with whips , but I will control you with scorpions ! ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	15	So the king didn ’ t listen to the people ; and that was something God brought about , so that Adonai could fulfill his word , which he had spoken through Achiyah from Shiloh to Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	16	When all Isra ’ el [ saw ] that the king wasn ’ t listening to them , the people answered the king , “ Do we have any share in David ? We have no heritage in the son of Yishai ! Everyone to your tents , Isra ’ el ! Care for your own house , David ! ” So all Isra ’ el left for their tents .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	17	But as for the people of Isra ’ el living in the cities of Y ’ hudah , Rechav ‘ am ruled over them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	18	King Rechav ‘ am then sent Hadoram , who was in charge of forced labor ; but the people of Isra ’ el stoned him to death . King Rechav ‘ am managed to mount his chariot and flee to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	10	19	Isra ’ el has been in rebellion against the dynasty of David to this day .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	2	But this word of Adonai came to Sh ’ ma ‘ yah the man of God :
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	11	He fortified the strongholds , appointed captains in charge of them and supplied them with food , olive oil and wine .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	3	“ Speak to Rechav ‘ am the son of Shlomo , king of Y ’ hudah , and to all Isra ’ el in Y ’ hudah and Binyamin ; tell them
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	4	that this is what Adonai says : ‘ You are not to go up and fight your brothers ! Every man is to go back home , because this is my doing. ’ ” They paid attention to the words of Adonai and turned back from attacking Yarov ‘ am .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	5	Rechav ‘ am lived in Yerushalayim and built cities for defense in Y ’ hudah —
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	6	he built Beit-Lechem , ‘ Eitam , T ’ koa ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	7	Beit-Tzur , Sokho , ‘ Adulam ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	8	Gat , Mareshah , Zif ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	9	Adorayim , Lakhish , ‘ Azekah ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	10	Tzor ‘ ah , Ayalon and Hevron ; these are fortified cities in Y ’ hudah and Binyamin .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	12	In every city he put shields and spears , making them very strong . Y ’ hudah and Binyamin stuck with him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	13	The cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im from wherever they lived throughout all Isra ’ el made themselves available to Rechav ‘ am .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	14	The L ’ vi ’ im left their pasture lands and property and came to Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim ; since Yarov ‘ am and his sons had thrown them out , not allowing them to function as cohanim for Adonai ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	15	and had appointed for himself cohanim for the high places and for the images of goat-demons and calves that he had made .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	16	Those from all the tribes of Isra ’ el who had set their hearts on seeking Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , followed them to Yerushalayim to sacrifice to Adonai , the God of their fathers .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	17	For three years they strengthened the kingdom of Y ’ hudah and made Rechav ‘ am the son of Shlomo strong , because for three years they followed the way of life of David and Shlomo .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	18	Rechav ‘ am married Machalat the daughter of Yerimot the son of David and Avichayil the daughter of Eli ’ av the son of Yishai ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	19	and she became the mother of his sons Ye ‘ ush , Sh ’ maryah and Zaham .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	20	After her , he married Ma ‘ akhah the daughter of Avshalom ; she became the mother of Aviyah , ‘ Atai , Ziza and Shlomit .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	21	Rechav ‘ am loved Ma ‘ akhah more than all his other wives and concubines — for he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines and was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	22	Rechav ‘ am appointed Aviyah the son of Ma ‘ akhah chief , the leader of his brothers , because he intended to make him king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	11	23	He was wise in his treatment of his sons , sending all of them throughout the territory of Y ’ hudah and Binyamin , to every fortified city , providing them with plenty of supplies and seeking for them many wives .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	2	In the fifth year of King Rechav ‘ am , Shishak king of Egypt attacked Yerushalayim , because they had acted faithlessly toward Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	12	After he humbled himself , the anger of Adonai turned away from him , so that he did not altogether destroy him ; moreover , some good things were found in Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	3	He came out of Egypt with 1,200 chariots , 60,000 horsemen and a numberless army including Luvim , Suki ’ im and Ethiopians .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	4	He captured the fortified cities of Y ’ hudah , then went to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	5	Now Sh ’ ma ‘ yah the prophet came to Rechav ‘ am and the leaders of Y ’ hudah who had gathered in Yerushalayim because of Shishak and said to them , “ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ Because you have abandoned me , I have abandoned you to the hands of Shishak. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	6	In response , the leaders of Isra ’ el and the king humbled themselves ; they said , “ Adonai is right. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	7	When Adonai saw that they had humbled themselves , this word of Adonai came to Sh ’ ma ‘ yah : “ Because they have humbled themselves , I will not destroy them but will grant them a measure of deliverance . My wrath will not be poured out on Yerushalayim through Shishak .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	8	However , they will become his slaves , so that they will come to appreciate the difference between serving me and serving earthly kingdoms. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	9	So Shishak king of Egypt attacked Yerushalayim . He took the treasures in the house of Adonai and the treasures in the royal palace — he took everything , including the gold shields Shlomo had made .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	10	To replace them , King Rechav ‘ am made shields of bronze , which he entrusted to the commanders of the contingent guarding the gate to the royal palace .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	11	Whenever the king went to the house of Adonai , the guard would come and get the shields ; later they would return them to the guardroom .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	13	So King Rechav ‘ am consolidated his rule in Yerushalayim . Rechav ‘ am was forty-one years old when he began his reign ; and he ruled seventeen years in Yerushalayim , the city Adonai had chosen from all the tribes of Isra ’ el to bear his name ; his mother ’ s name was Na ‘ amah the ‘ Amonit .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	14	He did what was evil , because he had not set his heart on seeking Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	15	The activities of Rechav ‘ am from beginning to end are written in the genealogically organized histories of Sh ’ ma ‘ yah the prophet and ‘ Iddo the seer . But there were continual wars between Rechav ‘ am and Yarov ‘ am .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	12	16	Rechav ‘ am slept with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David . Then Aviyah his son became king in his place .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	2	He ruled three years in Yerushalayim ; his mother ’ s name was Mikhayahu the daughter of Uri ’ el from Giv ‘ ah . There was war between Aviyah and Yarov ‘ am .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	13	But Yarov ‘ am prepared to ambush them from behind , so that the main body was ahead of Y ’ hudah , while the ambush was behind them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	3	Aviyah joined the battle with an army of valiant soldiers , 400,000 select troops ; while Yarov ‘ am took the field against him with 800,000 select troops who were valiant , strong men .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	4	Aviyah , standing on Mount Z ’ marayim , in the hills of Efrayim , cried , “ Yarov ‘ am and all Isra ’ el ! Listen to me !
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	5	Don ’ t you know that Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , gave rulership over Isra ’ el to David forever , to him and his descendants , by a covenant of salt [ which is unbreakable ] ?
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	6	Yet Yarov ‘ am the son of N ’ vat , servant to Shlomo the son of David , rose in rebellion against his lord .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	7	There rallied around him worthless brutes who were too strong for Rechav ‘ am the son of Shlomo to withstand when he was young and inexperienced .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	8	Now you expect to withstand the kingdom of Adonai in the hands of the descendants of David . Yes , there are a great number of you , and you have with you the gold calves that Yarov ‘ am made as gods for you .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	9	Yes , you drove out the cohanim of Adonai , the descendants of Aharon , and the L ’ vi ’ im ; and you made yourselves priests as do the peoples in other countries , so that anyone who comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams can become a priest of those non-gods .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	10	“ But we are different . Adonai is our God , and we have not abandoned him . We have cohanim performing the service for Adonai , descendants of Aharon . With the L ’ vi ’ im doing their work ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	11	they burn to Adonai every morning and evening burnt offerings and sweet incense ; they arrange the showbread on the pure table , and they prepare the gold menorah with its lamps to burn every evening . For we observe the order of Adonai our God . But you have abandoned him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	12	“ So look here ! God is with us , leading us and his cohanim with the battle trumpets to sound an alarm against you . People of Isra ’ el ! Don ’ t fight against Adonai , the God of your ancestors ; because you will not succeed. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	14	Thus when Y ’ hudah looked back , the battle had to be fought in front of them and behind them . They cried to Adonai , and the cohanim sounded the trumpets .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	15	Then the men of Y ’ hudah gave forth a shout , and as the men of Y ’ hudah shouted , God struck Yarov ‘ am and all Isra ’ el before Aviyah and Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	16	The people of Isra ’ el fled before Y ’ hudah , and God handed them over to them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	17	Aviyah and his army inflicted a great slaughter on them — 500,000 of Isra ’ el ’ s select soldiers fell dead .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	18	Thus the people of Isra ’ el were subdued that time , and the people of Y ’ hudah won the victory , because they relied on Adonai the God of their ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	19	Aviyah pursued Yarov ‘ am , taking from him the towns of Beit-El with its villages , Y ’ shanah with its villages and ‘ Efrayin with its villages .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	20	Yarov ‘ am did not recover his strength during the time of Aviyahu . Finally Adonai struck him , and he died .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	21	But Aviyahu grew strong ; he married fourteen wives and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	22	Other activities of Aviyah , together with his ways of doing things and his sayings , are recorded in the commentary of the prophet ‘ Iddo .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	13	23	( 14:1 ) Aviyah slept with his ancestors , and they buried him in the City of David . Then Asa his son became king in his place ; during his time the land was quiet for ten years .

CJB	2%20Chronicles	14	15	) They also attacked the tents of those tending the livestock and carried off sheep and camels in abundance . Then they returned to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	2	he went out to meet Asa and said to him , “ Listen to me , Asa , and all Y ’ hudah and Binyamin ! Adonai is with you , as long as you are with him ; if you seek him , you will find him ; but if you abandon him , he will abandon you !
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	15	All Y ’ hudah was full of joy at this oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart and had sought him with all their will ; and they found him , and Adonai gave them rest all around .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	3	For a long time Isra ’ el was without the true God , without a cohen who could teach , and without Torah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	4	But when , in their distress , they turned to Adonai the God of Isra ’ el and sought him , they found him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	5	In those times people going about their business were insecure , and great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	6	so that they were shattered to pieces , nation against nation and city against city , as God troubled them with every kind of distress .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	7	But you , be strong , and don ’ t slack off ; for your work will be rewarded. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	8	When Asa heard these words prophesied by ‘ Oded the prophet , it gave him courage to throw the disgusting things out of the whole land of Y ’ hudah and Binyamin and out of the cities he had captured in the hills of Efrayim ; he also renewed the altar of Adonai which was in front of the vestibule of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	9	Then he gathered all Y ’ hudah and Binyamin , along with those from Efrayim , M ’ nasheh and Shim ‘ on who were staying with him ( for they had defected to him in large numbers upon seeing that Adonai his God was with him ) .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	10	They assembled together at Yerushalayim in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa ’ s reign .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	11	That day they sacrificed to Adonai
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	700	oxen and 7,000 sheep from the spoil they had brought ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	12	and they entered into a covenant to seek Adonai , the God of their ancestors , with all their heart and with all their being ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	13	[ they also agreed ] that whoever refused to seek Adonai the God of Isra ’ el should be put to death , whether small or great , man or woman .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	14	They swore this to Adonai in a loud voice , with shouting and blowing of trumpets and shofars .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	16	Asa the king also deposed Ma ‘ akhah his [ grand ] mother from her position as queen mother , because she had made a disgusting image for an asherah . Asa cut down this image of hers , chopped it into tiny pieces and burned it in Vadi Kidron .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	17	But the high places were not removed from Isra ’ el . Nevertheless , Asa was wholehearted throughout his life .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	18	He brought into the house of God all the articles his father had consecrated , also the things he himself had consecrated — silver , gold and utensils .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	15	19	There was no more war through the thirty-fifth year of Asa ’ s reign .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	2	Then Asa removed silver and gold from the treasures of the house of Adonai and the royal palace ; and sent this message to Ben-Hadad king of Aram , who lived in Dammesek :
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	16	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa ’ s reign , Ba ‘ asha king of Isra ’ el attacked Y ’ hudah , and he fortified Ramah to prevent anyone ’ s leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	3	“ There is a covenant between me and you , as there was between my father and your father . Here , I am sending you silver and gold ; go , and break your covenant with Ba ‘ asha king of Isra ’ el , so that he will leave me alone. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	4	Ben-Hadad did as King Asa had asked — he sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Isra ’ el , attacking ‘ Iyon , Dan , Avel-Mayim and all the storage-cities of Naftali .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	5	As soon as Ba ‘ asha heard of it , he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	6	Asa the king took all Y ’ hudah and carried off the stones and timber which Ba ‘ asha had used to fortify Ramah . With them he fortified Geva and Mitzpah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	7	It was around then that Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Y ’ hudah and said to him , “ Because you relied on the king of Aram and didn ’ t rely on Adonai your God , the king of Aram ’ s army has escaped from your power .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	8	The army of the Ethiopians and Luvim was huge , wasn ’ t it ? How many chariots and horsemen did they have ? Yet because you relied on Adonai , he handed them over to you .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	9	For the eyes of Adonai move here and there throughout the whole earth , to show himself strong on behalf of those who are wholehearted toward him . You acted foolishly in this regard ; for from now on , you will have war. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	10	But Asa became angry at the seer ; in fact , because of his rage at him over this matter he threw him in prison . Moreover , at the same time , he mistreated some of the people .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	11	The activities of Asa from beginning to end are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah and Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign , Asa suffered from a disease in his legs . It was a very serious disease , yet even with this disease he did not seek out Adonai but turned to the physicians .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	13	Asa slept with his ancestors , dying in the forty-first year of his reign .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	16	14	They buried him in his own burial cave , which he had ordered cut for himself in the City of David . They laid him in a bed filled with sweet spices of various kinds , expertly compounded ; and a very great fire was kindled in his honor .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	2	by placing forces in all the fortified cities of Y ’ hudah , and by garrisoning troops in the territory of Y ’ hudah and in the cities of Efrayim that Asa his father had captured .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	17	From Binyamin : Elyada , a strong , brave man , and with him 200,000 equipped with bows and shields ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	3	Adonai was with Y ’ hoshafat , because he lived according to the first ways of his ancestor David , not seeking the ba ‘ alim ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	4	but seeking the God of his father and living by his mitzvot , not by what Isra ’ el did .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	5	Therefore Adonai consolidated his rulership ; all Y ’ hudah brought presents to Y ’ hoshafat , so that he had wealth and honor in abundance .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	6	In his heart he highly regarded Adonai ’ s ways ; moreover , he removed the high places and sacred poles from Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	7	In the third year of his reign he sent his leading men Ben-Chayil , ‘ Ovadyah , Z ’ kharyah , N ’ tan ’ el and Mikhayahu to teach in the cities of Y ’ hudah ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	8	with them were the L ’ vi ’ im Sh ’ ma ‘ yahu , N ’ tanyahu , Z ’ vadyahu , ‘ Asah ’ el , Sh ’ miramot , Y ’ honatan , Adoniyahu , Tuviyahu and Tov-Adoniyah , the L ’ vi ’ im ; and with them Elishama and Y ’ horam the cohanim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	9	They taught in Y ’ hudah , having a scroll of the Torah of Adonai with them ; they circulated through all the cities of Y ’ hudah , teaching among the people .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	10	A panic from Adonai seized all the kingdoms in the lands surrounding Y ’ hudah , so that they did not make war against Y ’ hoshafat .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	11	Some of the P ’ lishtim brought Y ’ hoshafat gifts and silver as tribute ; the Arabs too brought him flocks — 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	12	So Y ’ hoshafat grew increasingly powerful . In Y ’ hudah he built fortresses and storage cities .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	13	He had many projects in the cities of Y ’ hudah ; and in Yerushalayim he had warriors , strong brave men .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	14	Here is a listing of them by clans : from Y ’ hudah , the captains of thousands : ‘ Adnah the leader , and with him 300,000 strong , brave men ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	15	next to him Y ’ hochanan the leader , and with him 280,000 ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	16	next to him ‘ Amasyah the son of Zikhri , who volunteered to serve Adonai , and with him 200,000 strong , brave men .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	18	next to him Y ’ hozavad , and with him 180,000 prepared for war .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	17	19	These served the king , in addition to those the king assigned to the fortified cities throughout all Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	2	After some years he went down to Ach ’ av in Shomron . Ach ’ av slaughtered sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people with him , and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramot-Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	18	Mikhay ’ hu continued : “ Therefore , hear the word of Adonai . I saw Adonai sitting on his throne with the whole army of heaven standing on his right and on his left .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	3	Ach ’ av king of Isra ’ el said to Y ’ hoshafat king of Y ’ hudah , “ Will you go with me to Ramot-Gil ‘ ad ? ” He answered him , “ I ’ m with you all the way ; think of my troops as yours ; we will join you in this war. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	4	But Y ’ hoshafat said to the king of Isra ’ el , “ First , we should seek the word of Adonai. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	5	So the king of Isra ’ el assembled the prophets ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	400	men . “ Should we attack Ramot-Gil ‘ ad ? ” he asked them , “ Or should I hold off ? ” They said , “ Attack . God will hand it over to the king. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Y ’ hoshafat said , “ Besides these , isn ’ t there a prophet of Adonai here that we can consult ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	7	The king of Isra ’ el said to Y ’ hoshafat , “ Yes , there is still one man through whom we can consult Adonai ; but I hate him , because he never prophesies anything good for me , only bad ! It ’ s Mikhay ’ hu the son of Yimlah. ” Y ’ hoshafat replied , “ The king shouldn ’ t say such a thing. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	8	Then the king called an officer and said , “ Quickly ! Bring Mikhay ’ hu the son of Yimlah. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	9	Now the king of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hoshafat the king of Y ’ hudah were each sitting on his throne , dressed in their royal robes ; they were sitting in a threshing-floor at the entrance to the gate of Shomron ; and all the prophets were there , prophesying in their presence .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	10	Tzidkiyah the son of Kena ‘ anah had made himself some horns out of iron and said , “ This is what Adonai says : ‘ With these you will gore Aram until they are destroyed. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	11	All the prophets prophesied the same thing : “ Go up and attack Ramot-Gil ‘ ad . You will succeed , because Adonai will hand it over to the king. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	12	The messenger who had gone to call Mikhay ’ hu said to him , “ Here , now , the prophets are unanimously predicting success for the king . Please let your word be like one of theirs — say something good. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	13	But Mikhay ’ hu answered , “ As Adonai lives , whatever my God says is what I will say. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	14	When he reached the king , the king asked him , “ Mikhay ’ hu , should we go up and attack Ramot-Gil ‘ ad , or should we hold off ? ” He answered , “ Go up , you will succeed , they will be handed over to you. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	15	The king said to him , “ How many times do I have to warn you to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of Adonai ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	16	Then he said , “ I saw all Isra ’ el scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd ; and Adonai said , ‘ These men have no leader ; let everyone go home in peace. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	17	The king of Isra ’ el said to Y ’ hoshafat , “ Didn ’ t I tell you that he wouldn ’ t prophesy good things about me , but bad ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	19	Adonai asked , ‘ Who will entice Ach ’ av king of Isra ’ el to go up to his death at Ramot-Gil ‘ ad ? ’ One of them said , ‘ Do it this way , ’ and another , ‘ Do it that way. ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	20	Then a spirit stepped up , stood in front of Adonai and said , ‘ I will entice him. ’ Adonai asked , ‘ How ? ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	21	He answered , ‘ I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets. ’ Adonai said , ‘ You will succeed in enticing him . Go , and do it. ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	22	So now Adonai has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours ; meanwhile , Adonai has ordained disaster for you. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Then Tzidkiyah the son of Kena ‘ anah came up , slapped Mikhay ’ hu in the face and said , “ And how did the Spirit of Adonai leave me to speak to you ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	24	Mikhay ’ hu said , “ You ’ ll find out the day you go into an inside room , trying to hide. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	25	The king of Isra ’ el said , “ Seize Mikhay ’ hu , and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and Yo ’ ash the king ’ s son .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	26	Say , ‘ The king says to put this man in prison ; and feed him only bread and water , and not much of that , until I come back in peace. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	27	Mikhay ’ hu said , “ If you return in peace at all , Adonai has not spoken through me ! ” Then he added , “ Did you hear me , you peoples , all of you ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	28	So the king of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hoshafat the king of Y ’ hudah went up to Ramot-Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	29	The king of Isra ’ el said to Y ’ hoshafat , “ I will disguise myself and go into battle ; but you , put on your robes. ” So the king of Isra ’ el disguised himself and went into battle .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	30	Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders , “ Don ’ t attack anyone of either high or low rank , only the king of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	31	So when the chariot commanders saw Y ’ hoshafat they said , “ This is the king of Isra ’ el , ” and turned to attack him . But Y ’ hoshafat called out , and Adonai came to his aid — God moved them to leave him alone ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	32	so that when the chariot commanders saw that he wasn ’ t the king of Isra ’ el , they stopped pursuing him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	33	However , one soldier shot an arrow at random and struck the king of Isra ’ el between his lower armor and the breastplate . The king said to his chariot-driver , “ Turn the reins and take me out of the fighting ; I ’ m collapsing from my wounds. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	18	34	But the fighting grew fiercer that day ; and although the king of Isra ’ el propped himself upright in his chariot facing Aram until evening , around sunset he died .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	2	Yehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Y ’ hoshafat , “ Should you help the wicked and befriend those who hate Adonai ? Because of this , Adonai ’ s anger is upon you .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	19	Then Y ’ hoshafat the king of Y ’ hudah returned home to Yerushalayim in peace .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	3	Still , there is some good in you , in that you have removed the sacred poles from the land and have set your heart on seeking God. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	4	So Y ’ hoshafat lived in Yerushalayim and again circulated among the people from Be ’ er-Sheva to the hills of Efrayim , bringing them back to Adonai , the God of their ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	5	He appointed judges throughout the land in all the fortified cities of Y ’ hudah , city by city ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	6	and instructed the judges , “ Think about what you are doing : you are not dispensing justice by merely human standards but on behalf of Adonai ; he is with you when you deliver a verdict .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	7	Therefore , let the fear of Adonai be upon you ; be careful what you do ; for Adonai our God does not allow dishonesty , partiality or bribe-taking. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	8	In Yerushalayim Y ’ hoshafat appointed some of the L ’ vi ’ im , cohanim and clan heads of Isra ’ el to judge in matters concerning Adonai and in civil cases . After they had returned to Yerushalayim ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	9	he charged them , “ Here is what you are to do faithfully and wholeheartedly , in fear of Adonai :
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	10	when an issue comes before you from your brothers who live in their cities , whether it ’ s a case involving bloodshed or a question as to which teaching , mitzvah , law or ruling applies , you must warn them ; so that they won ’ t incur guilt toward Adonai and thereby bring anger on both you and your kinsmen . Do this , and you won ’ t incur guilt .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	19	11	Amaryahu the chief cohen is over you in all matters concerning Adonai , and Z ’ vadyahu the son of Yishma ‘ el , chief of the house of Y ’ hudah , in all the king ’ s matters . The officers of the L ’ vi ’ im are at your service . Be strong , and act , and may Adonai be with the good . ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	2	Y ’ hoshafat was told , “ A huge army from beyond the [ Dead ] Sea , from Aram , is on its way to fight you ; right now they are in Hatzatzon-Tamar ” ( that is , ‘ Ein-Gedi ) .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	20	The next morning , they rose early and went out into the T ’ koa Desert . As they left , Y ’ hoshafat stood and said , “ Listen to me , Y ’ hudah and you inhabitants of Yerushalayim ! “ Trust in Adonai your God , and you will be safe . Trust in his prophets , and you will succeed. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	3	Y ’ hoshafat was frightened , so he determined to seek Adonai . He proclaimed a fast throughout all Y ’ hudah ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	4	and Y ’ hudah assembled to seek help from Adonai ; they came from all the cities of Y ’ hudah to seek Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	5	Standing in front of the new courtyard in the house of Adonai , among those assembled from Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	6	he said : “ Adonai , God of our ancestors , you alone are God in heaven . You rule all the kingdoms of the nations . In your hand are power and strength , so that no one can withstand you .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	7	You , our God , drove out those living in the land ahead of your people Isra ’ el and gave it forever to the descendants of Avraham your friend .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	8	They lived in it , built you a sanctuary in it for your name , and said ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	9	‘ If calamity strikes us , such as war , judgment , disease or famine , we will stand before this house — that is , before you , since your name is in this house — and cry to you in our distress ; and you will hear us and rescue us. ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	10	“ So now , see : the people of ‘ Amon , Mo ’ av and Mount Se ‘ ir , whom you would not let Isra ’ el invade when they came out of the land of Egypt , so that they turned away from them and did not destroy them ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	11	are now repaying us [ evil ] ; they have come to throw us out of your possession , which you gave us as an inheritance .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	12	Our God ! Won ’ t you execute judgment against them ? For we haven ’ t strength enough to defeat this huge horde coming against us , and we don ’ t know what to do , but our eyes are on you. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	13	All Y ’ hudah stood before Adonai with their little ones , their wives and their children .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	14	Then , in the middle of the assembly , the Spirit of Adonai came upon Yachzi ’ el the son of Z ’ kharyahu , the son of B ’ nayah , the son of Ye ‘ i ’ el , the son of Matanyah the Levi , from the descendants of Asaf .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	15	He said , “ Listen , all Y ’ hudah , you who live in Yerushalayim and King Y ’ hoshafat : here is what Adonai is saying to you : ‘ Don ’ t be afraid or distressed by this great horde ; for the battle is not yours , but God ’ s .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	16	Tomorrow , go down against them . They will be coming up by the ascent of Tzitz , and you will find them at the end of the vadi , before the Yeru ’ el Desert .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	17	You won ’ t even need to fight this battle ! Just take your positions , Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim , stand still , and watch how Adonai will deliver you ! Don ’ t be afraid or distressed ; tomorrow , go out against them ; for Adonai is with you. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	18	Y ’ hoshafat bowed his head with his face to the ground ; while all Y ’ hudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim fell down before Adonai , worshipping Adonai ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	19	and the L ’ vi ’ im from the descendants of the K ’ hati and the descendants of the Korchi , stood up and praised Adonai the God of Isra ’ el at the top of their voices .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	21	After consulting with the people , he appointed those who would sing to Adonai and praise the splendor of his holiness as they went out ahead of the army , saying , “ Give thanks to Adonai , for his grace continues forever. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	22	Then , during the time when they were singing and praising , Adonai brought a surprise attack against the people of ‘ Amon , Mo ’ av and Mount Se ‘ ir who had come to fight Y ’ hudah ; and they were defeated .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	23	What happened was that the people of ‘ Amon and Mo ’ av began attacking those people who lived by Mount Se ‘ ir , to kill and destroy them completely ; and when they had finished off the people from Se ‘ ir , they set to work slaughtering one another .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	24	So when Y ’ hudah reached the watchtower overlooking the desert , they looked toward the horde ; and there in front of them were corpses fallen to the ground ; none had escaped .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	25	Y ’ hoshafat and his army came to take the spoil from them and found among them personal property in abundance and corpses with precious jewels , which they stripped off for themselves until they couldn ’ t carry any more . They took three days just to collect the spoil , there was so much .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	26	On the fourth day , they assembled in the Valley of B ’ rakhah [ blessing ] , where they blessed Adonai ; hence that place is called the Valley of B ’ rakhah to this day .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	27	Then they returned , everyone from Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim , with Y ’ hoshafat leading them joyfully back to Yerushalayim ; for Adonai had caused them to rejoice over their enemies .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	28	They came to Yerushalayim with lyres , lutes and trumpets and went to the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	29	A panic from God was on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that Adonai had fought against the enemies of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	30	So Y ’ hoshafat ’ s rule was a quiet one , because his God gave him rest all around .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	31	Y ’ hoshafat ruled over Y ’ hudah ; he was thirty-five years old when he began his reign , and he ruled twenty-five years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was ‘ Azuvah the daughter of Shilchi .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	32	He lived in the manner of Asa his father and did not turn away from it , doing what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	33	although the high places were not taken away , and the people had not yet set their hearts toward the God of their ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	34	Other activities of Y ’ hoshafat , from beginning to end , are written in the records of Yehu the son of Hanani , which have been inserted in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	35	It was after this that Y ’ hoshafat joined up with Achazyah king of Isra ’ el , who was acting very wickedly .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	36	He joined together with him to build large ships capable of going to Tarshish ; they made the ships in ‘ Etzyon-Gever .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	20	37	Then Eli ‘ ezer the son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against Y ’ hoshafat : “ Because you joined yourself with Achazyah , Adonai is wrecking your project. ” And the ships were wrecked , so that they couldn ’ t go to Tarshish .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	2	He had brothers who were sons of Y ’ hoshafat — ‘ Azaryah , Yechi ’ el , Z ’ kharyahu , ‘ Azaryahu , Mikha ’ el and Sh ’ fatyahu ; all these were sons of Y ’ hoshafat king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	21	Y ’ hoshafat slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David , and Y ’ horam his son became king in his place .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	3	Their father had given them lavish gifts of silver , gold and other items of value , as well as fortified cities in Y ’ hudah ; but he had given the kingdom to Y ’ horam , because he was the firstborn .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	4	But when Y ’ horam had taken control of his father ’ s kingdom and consolidated his rule , he put to the sword all his brothers and a number of the leading men in Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	5	He was thirty-two years old when he began his reign , and he ruled eight years in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	6	He lived after the example of the kings of Isra ’ el , as did the house of Ach ’ av ; because he had married Ach ’ av ’ s daughter ; he did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	7	However , Adonai was unwilling to destroy the house of David , because of the covenant he had made with David ; inasmuch as he had promised to give him and his children a lamp that would burn forever .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	8	During his time Edom revolted against Y ’ hudah and set up its own king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	9	Then Y ’ horam crossed with his commanders and all his chariots . Under cover of night , he and his chariot commanders attacked and defeated Edom , who had surrounded him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	10	Nevertheless , since that day Edom has remained free of Y ’ hudah ’ s domination . Livnah revolted against him at the same time , because he had abandoned Adonai the God of his ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	11	Moreover , he built high places in the hills of Y ’ hudah , caused the people living in Yerushalayim to prostitute themselves and drew Y ’ hudah away .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	12	A letter came to him from Eliyahu the prophet which said , “ Here is what Adonai , the God of David your ancestor , says : ‘ You have not lived by the examples of Y ’ hoshafat your father or Asa king of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	13	Instead you have lived by the example of the kings of Isra ’ el and have caused Y ’ hudah and the people living in Yerushalayim to prostitute themselves , just as the house of Ach ’ av caused [ Isra ’ el ] to prostitute themselves . Moreover , you killed your brothers from your father ’ s house , men better than you .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	14	Because of all this , Adonai is going to strike your people with a terrible disease , also your children , your wives and everything you have .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	15	You will be very ill from a disease in your intestines , until your intestines protrude , because of the effects of this disease , day after day. ’ ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	16	Then Adonai aroused against Y ’ horam the spirit of the P ’ lishtim and of the Arabs near the Ethiopians ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	17	and they came up to attack Y ’ hudah . They broke in and carried off all the personal property they could find in the royal palace , as well as his children and his wives ; so that no son was left to him except Y ’ ho ’ achaz his youngest son .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	18	After all this , Adonai struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	19	In time , after two years , his intestines protruded because of his disease , and he suffered a most painful death . His people kindled no fire for him , as had been done for his ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	21	20	He was thirty-two years old when he began his reign , he ruled in Yerushalayim for eight years , and he left without joy . They buried him in the City of David , but not in the tombs of the kings .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	2	Achazyah was forty-two years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for one year in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was ‘ Atalyahu the daughter of ‘ Omri .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	22	The people living in Yerushalayim made Achazyah his youngest son king in place of him , since the raiding party that had invaded the camp with the Arabs had killed all the older ones . So Achazyah the son of Y ’ horam king of Y ’ hudah reigned .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	3	He too lived after the example of the house of Ach ’ av , because his mother was his counselor in acting wickedly .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	4	So he did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , as had the house of Ach ’ av ; because , to his destruction , they were his counselors after his father died ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	5	and he lived his life by their advice . With Y ’ horam the son of Ach ’ av , king of Isra ’ el , he went to war against Haza ’ el king of Aram at Ramot-Gil ‘ ad , where the Aramim wounded Yoram .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	6	He returned to Yizre ‘ el to be healed of the wounds which they had inflicted on him at Ramah while fighting Haza ’ el king of Aram . Achazyah the son of Y ’ horam , king of Y ’ hudah , went down to visit Y ’ horam the son of Ach ’ av in Yizre ‘ el , because he was not feeling well .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	7	Through Achazyah ’ s visit to Yoram , God brought about his downfall . After he arrived , he accompanied Yoram against Yehu the son of Nimshi , whom Adonai had anointed to cut off the house of Ach ’ av .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	8	But it happened that when Yehu was executing judgment on the house of Ach ’ av , he found the leading men of Y ’ hudah and Achazyah ’ s nephews in attendance on Achazyah and killed them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	9	Then he went searching for Achazyah ; they caught him where he had been hiding in Shomron , brought him to Yehu and killed him . But [ his subjects ] buried him , because they said , “ He was the [ grand ] son of Y ’ hoshafat , who sought Adonai with all his heart. ” At this point there was no one in the house of Achazyah strong enough to rule the kingdom .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	10	When ‘ Atalyah the mother of Achazyah saw that her son was dead , she set about destroying the entire royal family of the house of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	11	But Y ’ hoshav ‘ at the daughter of the king took Yo ’ ash the son of Achazyah , stole him away from among the princes who were being slaughtered , and sequestered him and his nurse in a bedroom . Thus Y ’ hoshav ‘ at the daughter of King Y ’ horam , wife of Y ’ hoyada the cohen and sister of Achazyah , hid him from ‘ Atalyah , so that he was not killed .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	22	12	He remained hidden with them in the house of God for six years ; during this time ‘ Atalyah ruled the land .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	2	They canvassed Y ’ hudah and gathered the L ’ vi ’ im from all the cities of Y ’ hudah , together with the clan heads of Isra ’ el , and came to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	23	In the seventh year Y ’ hoyada took courage and formed a conspiracy with certain captains of hundred-man platoons — ‘ Azaryah the son of Yerocham , Yishma ‘ el the son of Y ’ hochanan , ‘ Azaryah the son of ‘ Oved , Ma ‘ aseiyahu the son of ‘ Adayahu and Elishafat the son of Zikhri .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	3	The whole assembly made an agreement with the king in the house of God . [ Y ’ hoyada ] addressed them : “ Here ! The king ’ s son will reign , as Adonai said in regard to the descendants of David !
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	4	Here is what you are to do : of you cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im who come on duty on Shabbat , a third are to guard the gates ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	5	a third the royal palace and a third the Gate of the Foundation ; while all the people are to remain in the courtyards of the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	6	No one is to enter the house of Adonai except the cohanim and those L ’ vi ’ im who are actually performing the service . These may enter , because they are holy ; but all the people are to observe Adonai ’ s order .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	7	The L ’ vi ’ im are to surround the king , each man with his weapons in his hand . Anyone who enters the house is to be killed . Stay with the king whenever he enters or leaves. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	8	The L ’ vi ’ im and all Y ’ hudah did exactly as Y ’ hoyada the cohen ordered . Each took his men , those coming on duty on Shabbat and those going off duty on Shabbat ( for Y ’ hoyada the cohen did not dismiss the divisions ) .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	9	Y ’ hoyada the cohen issued to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields that had been King David ’ s and were kept in the house of God .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	10	He then positioned all the people , each man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , alongside the altar , alongside [ the exterior of ] the house and around the king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	11	Then they brought out the king ’ s son , crowned him , gave him [ a copy of ] the testimony and thus made him king . Y ’ hoyada and his sons anointed him , and they shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	12	When ‘ Atalyah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king , she entered the house of Adonai where the people were ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	13	looked and saw the king standing there on his platform at the entrance , with the leaders and trumpeters next to the king . All the people of the land were celebrating and blowing the trumpets ; while the singers with their musical instruments were leading songs of praise . At this , ‘ Atalyah tore her clothes and cried , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	14	Y ’ hoyada the cohen brought out the captains of hundreds who were in charge of the army and said to them , “ Escort her out past the ranks [ of guards ] ; but anyone who follows her , let him be put to the sword. ” For the cohen had said , “ Do not put her to death in the house of Adonai. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	15	So they took her by force and led her by the horses ’ entry to the king ’ s palace , and there they put her to death .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	16	Y ’ hoyada made a covenant between himself , all the people and the king , that they would be Adonai ’ s people .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	17	Then all the people went to the house of Ba ‘ al and broke it down ; they smashed his altars and images and killed Mattan the priest of Ba ‘ al in front of the altars .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	18	Y ’ hoyada appointed officers for the house of Adonai under the supervision of the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im , whom David had assigned turns of duty in the house of Adonai , to offer the burnt offerings of Adonai , as written in the Torah of Moshe , with rejoicing and singing in keeping with David ’ s orders .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	19	He stationed guards at the gates of the house of Adonai , so that no one who was unclean in any respect could enter .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	20	He took the captains of hundreds , the men of rank , the rulers of the people and all the people of the land ; and they brought the king down from the house of Adonai , going through the Upper Gate to the royal palace , and seated the king on the royal throne .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	23	21	All the people of the land celebrated , and at last the city was quiet . That is how they killed ‘ Atalyah with the sword .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	2	Yo ’ ash did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective throughout the lifetime of Y ’ hoyada the cohen .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	24	Although the army of Aram attacked with only a small company of men , Adonai handed over a very great army to them , because they had abandoned Adonai the God of their ancestors . Thus they executed judgment against Yo ’ ash .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	3	Y ’ hoyada chose two wives for him , and he became the father of sons and daughters .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	4	Some time later , Yo ’ ash decided to restore the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	5	He gathered the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im and said to them , “ Go out to the cities of Y ’ hudah , and collect money each year from all Isra ’ el to repair the house of your God . See that you do this promptly. ” But when the L ’ vi ’ im procrastinated ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	6	the king summoned Y ’ hoyada the chief and said to him , “ Why haven ’ t you demanded that the L ’ vi ’ im bring in from Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim the tax prescribed by Moshe the servant of Adonai and by the community of Isra ’ el , for the tent of the testimony ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	7	For the sons of that wicked ‘ Atalyahu had broken up the house of God , and they had given all the consecrated things belonging to the house of Adonai to the ba ‘ alim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	8	Then , at the king ’ s order , they made a box and placed it outside the entrance to the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	9	They proclaimed throughout Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim that the tax Moshe the servant of God had imposed on Isra ’ el in the desert should be brought in for Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	10	All the leaders and all the people were glad to bring in their contributions and put them in the box , until it was full .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	11	When the box was brought to the king ’ s officials by the L ’ vi ’ im , and when they saw how much money there was , the king ’ s secretary and the chief cohen ’ s official came and emptied the box ; then they took it and returned it to its place . They did this daily , and they collected money in abundance .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	12	The king and Y ’ hoyada gave it to those in charge of taking care of the house of Adonai . They , in turn , hired stone-workers and carpenters to restore the house of Adonai , also iron- and bronze-workers to repair the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	13	The workers got on with their tasks , so that the restoration progressed well , until they had returned the house of God to its earlier condition and strengthened it .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	14	When they had finished , they brought the rest of the money to the king and Y ’ hoyada , and it was used to make equipment for the house of Adonai — articles for ministry , buckets , fire pans , and utensils of gold and silver . So they offered burnt offerings in the house of Adonai regularly throughout the time of Y ’ hoyada .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	15	But Y ’ hoyada grew old ; and when he was full of days , he died . He was
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	130	years old when he died .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	16	They buried him in the City of David among the kings , because he had served Isra ’ el , God and his house well .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	17	After Y ’ hoyada died , the leaders of Y ’ hudah came and prostrated themselves before the king . Then the king listened to them ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	18	and they abandoned the house of Adonai the God of their ancestors and served the sacred poles and the idols . In consequence of their guilt , [ God ’ s ] anger fell on Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	19	In spite of this , he sent them prophets to bring them back to Adonai ; they warned them , but they wouldn ’ t pay attention .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	20	The Spirit of God covered Z ’ kharyah the son of Y ’ hoyada the cohen ; he stood above the people and addressed them : “ Thus says God : ‘ Why are you transgressing the mitzvot of Adonai and courting disaster ? Because you have abandoned Adonai , he has abandoned you. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	21	But they conspired against him and stoned him to death at the order of the king in the courtyard of the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	22	Thus Yo ’ ash the king did not remember the kindness which Y ’ hoyada , [ Z ’ kharyah ’ s ] father , had done for him , but put his son to death . As he was dying he said , “ May Adonai see this and take vengeance ! ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	23	The following spring , the army of Aram came up against him . They attacked Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim , slaughtered all the people ’ s leaders and sent all their spoil to the king of Dammesek .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	25	After they had left him — and they left him seriously wounded — his own servants conspired against him because he had shed the blood of the sons of Y ’ hoyada the cohen ; and they killed him in his own bed . After he died , they buried him in the City of David , but they didn ’ t bury him in the tombs of the kings .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	26	Those who conspired against him were Zavad the son of Shim ‘ at the ‘ Amonit and Y ’ hozavad the son of Shimrit the Mo ’ avit .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	24	27	As for his sons , the heavy tribute imposed on him , and the rebuilding of the house of God , they are recorded in the commentary of the Annals of the Kings . Then Amatzyahu his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	2	He did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective , but not wholeheartedly .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	25	Amatzyahu the son of Yo ’ ash , king of Y ’ hudah , lived another fifteen years after the death of Yo ’ ash son of Y ’ ho ’ achaz king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	3	As soon as he had the kingdom firmly in his control , he put to death the servants of his who had assassinated the king his father .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	4	But he did not put their children to death ; rather , he acted according to what is written in the Torah , in the scroll of Moshe , as Adonai ordered when he said , “ Fathers are not to die for the children , nor are the children to die for the fathers ; every person will die for his own sin. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	5	Amatzyahu assembled Y ’ hudah together and put them in order by clans under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds — all Y ’ hudah and Binyamin . He registered everyone twenty years old and older , and found that there were 300,000 select troops able to go to war , capable of using spears and shields .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	6	He also hired 100,000 strong , brave men from Isra ’ el for three-and-a-third tons of silver .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	7	But a man of God came to him and said , “ King , don ’ t let the army of Isra ’ el go with you ; because Adonai is not with Isra ’ el or with any of the people of Efrayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	8	And if you do go , then no matter how fiercely you fight , God will cause you to fail before the enemy . For God has the power to help and to cause failure. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	9	Amatzyahu said to the man of God , “ But what do we do about the three-and-a-third tons [ of silver ] I paid for Isra ’ el ’ s army ? ” The man of God answered , “ Adonai can give you far more than that ! ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	10	Then Amatzyahu separated out the battalion that had come to him from Efrayim and told them to go back home — which made their anger burn hotly against Y ’ hudah , and they returned home enraged .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	11	Amatzyahu took courage , led his people out and went to the Salt Valley , where he killed 10,000 of the people of Se ‘ ir .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	12	The people of Y ’ hudah took another 10,000 away alive , brought them to the top of the Rock and threw them off the top of the Rock , so that they were all dashed to pieces .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	13	Meanwhile , the men in the army that Amatzyahu had sent back and hadn ’ t allowed to join him in battle fell on the cities of Y ’ hudah , all the way from Shomron to Beit-Horon , killed 3,000 of them and took much spoil .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	14	After Amatzyahu returned from the slaughter of the people from Edom , he brought the gods of the people of Se ‘ ir and set them up as his own gods , prostrating himself before them and offering incense to them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	15	As a result , the anger of Adonai blazed up against Amatzyah , and he sent him a prophet , who said to him , “ Why have you sought out the gods of those people , when they couldn ’ t even rescue their own people from you ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	16	But as [ the prophet ] was speaking to him , he interrupted him : “ Were you made an adviser to the king ? You had better stop before you get yourself killed ! ” So the prophet stopped , but he added , “ I know that God is planning to destroy you for having done this and for refusing to listen to my advice. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	17	Then , after taking counsel , Amatzyah king of Y ’ hudah sent a challenge to Yo ’ ash the son of Y ’ ho ’ achaz , the son of Yehu , king of Isra ’ el : “ Come on , let ’ s have it out face-to-face. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	18	Yo ’ ash the king of Isra ’ el sent this reply to Amatzyah king of Y ’ hudah : “ Once , in the L ’ vanon , the thistle sent a message to the cedar : ‘ Give your daughter to my son in marriage. ’ But a wild animal passed by the thistle and squashed it .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	19	You say you defeated Edom , which is true ; so you ’ re excited and itching for more glory . But now , stay home ! Why provoke calamity , to your own ruin , yours and Y ’ hudah ’ s too ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	20	But Amatzyah wouldn ’ t listen . And this was from God , so that he could hand them over [ to their enemies ] , because they had sought the gods of Edom .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	21	So Yo ’ ash king of Isra ’ el went up ; and he and Amatzyah king of Y ’ hudah had it out face-to-face at Beit-Shemesh , which belongs to Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	22	Y ’ hudah was defeated by Isra ’ el , and every man fled to his tent .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	23	Yo ’ ash king of Isra ’ el took Amatzyah king of Y ’ hudah , the son of Yo ’ ash the son of Y ’ ho ’ achaz , prisoner at Beit-Shemesh . Then he brought him to Yerushalayim and demolished the wall of Yerushalayim between the Gate of Efrayim and the Corner Gate , a section
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	600	feet long .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	24	[ He took ] all the gold and silver , all the articles he could find in the house of God , with ‘ Oved-Edom , and the treasures of the royal palace , together with hostages ; then he returned to Shomron .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	26	Other activities of Amatzyah , from beginning to end , are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah and Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	27	From the time that Amatzyahu turned away from following Adonai , they formed a conspiracy against him in Yerushalayim . So he fled to Lakhish ; but they followed him to Lakhish and killed him there .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	25	28	They brought his body back on horses and buried him with his ancestors in the City of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	2	He recovered Eilot for Y ’ hudah and rebuilt it ; it was after this that the king [ Amatzyahu ] slept with his ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	26	Meanwhile , all the people of Y ’ hudah had taken ‘ Uziyahu at the age of sixteen and made him king in place of his father Amatzyahu .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	3	‘ Uziyahu was sixteen years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for fifty-two years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Y ’ kholyahu , from Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	4	He did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of everything his father Amatzyahu had done .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	5	He consulted God during the lifetime of Z ’ kharyahu , who understood visions of God ; and as long as he consulted Adonai , God gave him success .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	6	He went out to fight the P ’ lishtim , breaking down the walls of Gat , Yavneh and Ashdod ; and he built cities in the area of Ashdod and among the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	7	God helped him against the P ’ lishtim , against the Arabs living in Gur-Ba ‘ al , and against the Me ‘ unim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	8	The ‘ Amonim brought tribute to ‘ Uziyahu , and his fame spread abroad as far as the Egyptian frontier , since he kept growing stronger .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	9	‘ Uziyahu built towers in Yerushalayim at the Corner Gate , at the Valley Gate and at the Angle , and fortified them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	10	He built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns , because he had much livestock , likewise in the Sh ’ felah and the coastal plain . He had farmers and vineyard-workers in the hills and in the fertile lands , because he loved the soil .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	11	‘ Uziyahu had a standing army of fit soldiers divided into units according to the census taken by the secretary Ye ‘ i ’ el and the officer Ma ‘ aseiyah , under the direction of Hananyah , one of the king ’ s officials .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	12	The total number of clan heads over these strong , brave men was 2,600 .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	13	They directed a trained army of 307,500 fighting men , a strong force supporting the king in war against the enemy .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	14	‘ Uziyahu equipped them , the whole army , with shields , spears , helmets , armor , bows and slingstones .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	15	In Yerushalayim he built devices designed by experts for the towers and angles , from which to shoot arrows and lob large stones . His fame spread far and wide , for he was miraculously helped , until he became strong .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	16	But when he was strong , he became arrogant , which caused him to become corrupt , so that he sinned against Adonai his God by going into the temple of Adonai to burn incense on the incense altar .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	17	‘ Azaryahu the cohen went in after him , and with him were eighty of Adonai ’ s cohanim , brave men .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	18	They stood up to ‘ Uziyahu the king ; they told him , “ It isn ’ t your job , ‘ Uziyahu , to burn incense to Adonai ! The job of burning incense belongs to the cohanim , the descendants of Aharon , who have been consecrated . Get out of the sanctuary ! You have trespassed , and Adonai , God , will not honor you for this. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	19	This made ‘ Uziyahu angry as he stood there with a censer in his hand ready to burn incense ; and in his anger at the cohanim , tzara ‘ at broke out on his forehead right in front of the cohanim in the house of Adonai beside the altar for incense .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	20	‘ Azaryahu the chief cohen and all the cohanim stared at him — there he was , with tzara ‘ at on his forehead ! Quickly they threw him out of there ; and indeed , he himself hurried to get out , because Adonai had struck him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	21	‘ Uziyahu the king had tzara ‘ at until his dying day ; he lived in a separate house because he had tzara ‘ at , and was not allowed into the house of Adonai . Meanwhile , Yotam the king ’ s son ran the king ’ s household and was regent over the people of the land .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	22	Other activities of ‘ Uziyahu , from beginning to end , were recorded by Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet , the son of Amotz .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	26	23	So ‘ Uziyahu slept with his ancestors , and they buried him with his ancestors in the graveyard belonging to the kings , because they said , “ He had tzara ‘ at. ” Then Yotam his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	27	2	He did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of everything his father ‘ Uziyah had done , except that he did not enter the temple of Adonai . Nevertheless , the people acted corruptly .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	27	27	Yotam was twenty-five years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for sixteen years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Yerushah the daughter of Tzadok .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	27	3	He built the Upper Gate of the house of Adonai and added considerably to the wall of the ‘ Ofel .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	27	4	He built cities in the hills of Y ’ hudah , and in the wooded areas he built forts and towers .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	27	5	He fought with the king of the people of ‘ Amon and defeated them . That year the people of ‘ Amon paid him tribute of three-and-a-third tons of silver , 50,000 bushels of wheat and 50,000 [ bushels ] of barley . The people of ‘ Amon paid him the same amount the second and third years also .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	27	6	Thus Yotam became strong , because he prepared his ways [ of doing things ] before Adonai his God .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	27	7	Other activities of Yotam , all his wars and his ways [ of doing things ] are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	27	8	He was twenty-five years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for sixteen years in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	27	9	Yotam slept with his ancestors and they buried him in the City of David . Then Achaz his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	2	Rather , he lived in the manner of the kings of Isra ’ el and made cast metal images for the ba ‘ alim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	28	Achaz was twenty years old when he began his reign , and he ruled sixteen years in Yerushalayim . But he did not do what was right from the perspective of Adonai , as David his ancestor had done .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	3	Moreover , he made offerings in the Ben-Hinnom Valley and even burned up his own children as sacrifices , in keeping with the horrible practices of the pagans , whom Adonai had thrown out ahead of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	4	He also sacrificed and offered on the high places , on the hills and under any green tree .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	5	Because of this , Adonai his God handed him over to the king of Aram ; they attacked him and carried off from his people a great number of captives , bringing them to Dammesek . In addition , he was handed over to the king of Isra ’ el , who inflicted on him a great massacre .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	6	For Pekach the son of Remalyah killed in Y ’ hudah 120,000 men in one day , all of them brave men , because they had abandoned Adonai , the God of their ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	7	And Zikhri , a champion from Efrayim , killed Ma ‘ aseiyah the king ’ s son , ‘ Azrikam the administrator of the household and Elkanah , who was second only to the king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	8	The people of Isra ’ el took captive from their kinsmen 200,000 wives , sons and daughters ; they also captured from them much spoil , which they brought to Shomron .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	9	But a prophet of Adonai named ‘ Oded was there ; he went out to meet the army coming to Shomron and said to them , “ Look , it ’ s because Adonai the God of your fathers was angry with Y ’ hudah that he has handed them over to you , and you have slaughtered them in a fury that has reached up to heaven .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	10	Now you intend to force the people from Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim into subjection as your slaves ; but haven ’ t you guilty deeds of your own that you committed against Adonai your God ?
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Therefore listen to me now ; and send the captives back , the people you have taken captive from your kinsmen ; because the fierce anger of Adonai is on you. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	12	At this , some of the leaders of the people of Efrayim — ‘ Azaryahu the son of Y ’ hochanan , Berekhyahu the son of Meshilemot , Y ’ chizkiyah the son of Shalum and ‘ Amasa the son of Hadlai — protested against those who were returning from the war ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	13	saying to them , “ Don ’ t bring the captives here , because you intend to do something that will bring guilt on us against Adonai . It will only add to our sins and guilt , for our guilt is great , and there is fierce anger against Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	14	So the armed soldiers left the captives and the spoil there with the leaders and the whole community ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	15	while the men named above took charge of the captives and from the spoil clothed those among them who were inadequately clothed , giving them garments and shoes , providing them food and drink and anointing them with oil . After placing all the weak among them on donkeys , they brought them to Yericho , the City of Date-Palms , to their kinsmen ; only then did they return to Shomron .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	16	It was at that time that King Achaz sent to the kings of Ashur to help him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	17	For again the people from Edom had come , attacking Y ’ hudah and carrying off captives .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	18	The P ’ lishtim too had invaded the cities in the Sh ’ felah and in the Negev of Y ’ hudah ; they had captured Beit-Shemesh , Ayalon , G ’ derot , Sokho with its villages , Timnah with its villages and Gimzo with its villages ; and they settled there .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	19	For Adonai brought Y ’ hudah low because of Achaz king of Isra ’ el , since he had caused disturbances in Y ’ hudah and acted very treacherously against Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	20	Tilgat-Piln ’ eser king of Ashur attacked and besieged Achaz instead of strengthening him —
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	21	even though Achaz had stripped the house of Adonai and the palaces of the king and princes and had given the plunder to the king of Ashur , it didn ’ t help him at all .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	22	During his time of distress this same King Achaz added to his treachery against Adonai
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	23	by sacrificing to the gods of Dammesek , who had attacked him , reasoning , “ The gods of the kings of Aram helped them , so I will sacrifice to them , and then they ’ ll help me. ” But they became the ruin of him and of all Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	24	Achaz collected the equipment from the house of God , broke to pieces the equipment from the house of God and sealed the doors of the house of Adonai ; then he made himself altars in every corner of Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	25	In every city of Y ’ hudah he made high places for offering to other gods , thus provoking Adonai the God of his ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	26	Other activities of Achaz and his ways [ of doing things ] , from beginning to end , are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah and Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	28	27	Achaz slept with his ancestors , and they buried him in the city , in Yerushalayim ; because they did not bring him to the tombs of the kings of Isra ’ el . Then Hizkiyahu his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	2	He did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of everything David his ancestor had done .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	29	When the offering was over , the king and everyone present with him bowed down and prostrated themselves .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	3	In the first month of the first year of his reign , he reopened the doors of the house of Adonai and repaired them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	4	Then he brought in the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im , assembled them in the open space to the east ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	5	and said to them , “ Listen to me , L ’ vi ’ im : consecrate yourselves now , consecrate the house of Adonai the God of your ancestors , and remove the filth from the Holy Place .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	6	For our ancestors acted treacherously , they did what is evil from the perspective of Adonai our God , they abandoned him , they turned their faces away from where Adonai lives and turned their backs on him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	7	They sealed the doors of the vestibule , put out the lamps and stopped burning incense and offering burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	8	“ Because of this , Adonai ’ s anger has settled on Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim ; and he has made them an object of horror , astonishment and mocking — as you can see with your own eyes .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	9	Here , our ancestors have fallen by the sword ; and on this account our sons , daughters and wives have gone into captivity .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	10	“ Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , so that his furious anger will turn away from us .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	11	My sons , now is not a time for being negligent ; for you are the ones Adonai chose to stand before him and serve him as his ministers , offering him incense. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	12	Then the L ’ vi ’ im set about the task — Machat the son of ‘ Amasai and Yo ’ el the son of ‘ Azaryahu from the descendants of the K ’ hati ; of the sons of M ’ rari , Kish the son of ‘ Avdi and ‘ Azaryahu the son of Yehallel ’ el ; of the Gershuni , Yo ’ ach the son of Zimah and ‘ Eden the son of Yo ’ ach ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	13	of the descendants of Elitzafan , Shimri and Ye ‘ i ’ el ; of the descendants of Asaf , Z ’ kharyahu and Matanyahu ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	14	of the descendants of Heman , Yechi ’ el and Shim ‘ i ; and of the descendants of Y ’ dutun , Sh ’ ma ‘ yah and ‘ Uzi ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	15	They gathered their kinsmen , consecrated themselves and , in keeping with the king ’ s order and Adonai ’ s words , went in to cleanse the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	16	The cohanim went in to cleanse the inner part of the house of Adonai ; all the unclean things they found in the sanctuary of Adonai they brought out into the courtyard of the house of Adonai , where the L ’ vi ’ im took and carried them out to Vadi Kidron .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	17	They began consecrating on the first day of the first month , and on the eighth day of the month they reached the vestibule of Adonai . Then they consecrated the house of Adonai in eight more days ; so that on the sixteenth day of the first month , they had finished .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	18	Then they went to Hizkiyahu the king in [ the palace ] and said , “ We have cleansed all the house of Adonai , including the altar for burnt offerings , with all its equipment , and the table for the showbread , with all its equipment .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	19	Moreover , we have reconditioned and consecrated all the articles that King Achaz threw out during his reign , when he was sinning ; and they are there , in front of the altar of Adonai. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	20	Next morning , Hizkiyahu the king got up early , gathered the leading men of the city and went up to the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	21	They brought seven bulls , seven rams , seven lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom , for the sanctuary and for Y ’ hudah ; and he ordered the cohanim to offer them on the altar of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	22	After slaughtering the bulls , the cohanim took the blood and splashed it against the altar . Next , they slaughtered the rams and splashed the blood against the altar and also slaughtered the lambs and splashed the blood against the altar .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	23	After bringing the male goats for the sin offering close to the king and the assembly and laying their hands on them ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	24	the cohanim slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar to make atonement for all Isra ’ el ; for the king had ordered that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be for all Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	25	He stationed the L ’ vi ’ im in the house of Adonai with cymbals , lyres and lutes , in keeping with the order of David , Gad the king ’ s seer and Natan the prophet ; for the mitzvah had come from Adonai through his prophets .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	26	The L ’ vi ’ im stood with the instruments of David and the cohanim with the trumpets .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	27	Hizkiyahu ordered that the burnt offering should be offered on the altar . The moment the burnt offering began , the song of Adonai also began , accompanied by the trumpets and the instruments of David king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	28	The whole assembly prostrated themselves , the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded ; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	30	Then Hizkiyahu the king and the leaders ordered the L ’ vi ’ im to sing praises to Adonai , using the words of David and of Asaf the seer . They sang praises until they were filled with joy , and they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	31	Hizkiyahu responded by saying , “ Now that you have consecrated yourselves to Adonai , come close , and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of Adonai . So the community brought in sacrifices and thank offerings , and as many as were willing volunteered burnt offerings .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	32	In all , the burnt offerings brought by the congregation totaled
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	70	bulls ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	100	rams and
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	200	lambs ; all these were for a burnt offering to Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	33	The consecrated gifts amounted to
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	600	oxen and 3,000 sheep .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	34	Only there weren ’ t enough cohanim to skin and butcher all the burnt offerings , so their colleagues the L ’ vi ’ im assisted them until the work was finished and the cohanim had consecrated themselves ( for the L ’ vi ’ im had been more diligent to consecrate themselves than the cohanim ) .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	35	Besides the abundance of burnt offerings , there was the fat of the peace offerings and drink offerings for each burnt offering . Thus the service of the house of Adonai was restored .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	29	36	Hizkiyahu and all the people rejoiced over what God had prepared for the people , since it had all happened so suddenly .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	2	For the king , his officials and the entire Yerushalayim community had agreed to keep the Pesach in the second month .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	30	Then Hizkiyahu sent to all Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah , and wrote letters also to Efrayim and M ’ nasheh , summoning them to the house of Adonai in Yerushalayim , to keep the Pesach to Adonai the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	3	They had not been able to observe it at the proper time because the cohanim had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number ; also the people had not assembled in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	4	The idea had seemed right to the king and to the whole community ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	5	so they issued a decree that it should be proclaimed throughout all Isra ’ el , from Be ’ er-Sheva to Dan , that they should come to keep the Pesach to Adonai the God of Isra ’ el at Yerushalayim ; for only a few had been observing it as prescribed .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	6	So runners went with the letters from the king and his officers throughout all Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah . They conveyed the king ’ s order : “ People of Isra ’ el ! Turn back to Adonai , the God of Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov ! Then he will return to those of you who remain , who escaped capture by the kings of Ashur .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	7	Don ’ t be like your ancestors , or like your kinsmen who sinned against Adonai the God of their ancestors , with the result that he allowed them to become an object of horror , as you see .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	8	Don ’ t be stiffnecked now , as your ancestors were . Instead , yield yourselves to Adonai ; enter his sanctuary , which he has made holy forever ; and serve Adonai your God ; so that his fierce anger will turn away from you .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	9	For if you turn back to Adonai , your kinsmen and children will find that those who took them captive will have compassion on them , and they will come back to this land . Adonai your God is compassionate and merciful ; he will not turn his face away from you if you return to him. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	10	So the runners passed from city to city through the territory of Efrayim and M ’ nasheh , as far as Z ’ vulun ; but the people laughed at them and made fun of them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	11	Nevertheless , some from Asher , M ’ nasheh and Z ’ vulun were humble enough to come to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	12	Also in Y ’ hudah the hand of God was at work , uniting their hearts to do what the king and the leaders had ordered in accordance with the word of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	13	Thus , many people assembled in Yerushalayim to keep the festival of Matzot in the second month , a huge crowd .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	14	First they set about removing the altars that were in Yerushalayim , and they also removed all the altars for incense and threw them in Vadi Kidron .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	15	Then they slaughtered the Pesach lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month . Ashamed of themselves , the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im had consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	16	Now they stood at their stations , as prescribed in the Torah of Moshe the man of God ; the cohanim splashed the blood given to them by the L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	17	For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves ; therefore the L ’ vi ’ im were responsible for slaughtering the Pesach lambs and consecrating them to Adonai on behalf of everyone who was not clean .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	18	For a large number of the people , especially from Efrayim , M ’ nasheh , Yissakhar and Z ’ vulun , had not cleansed themselves but ate the Pesach lamb anyway , despite what is written . For Hizkiyahu had prayed for them , “ May Adonai , who is good , pardon
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	19	everyone who sets his heart on seeking God , Adonai , the God of his ancestors , even if he hasn ’ t undergone the purification prescribed in connection with holy things. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	20	Adonai heard Hizkiyahu and healed the people .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	21	The people of Isra ’ el there in Yerushalayim observed the festival of Matzot for seven days with great joy ; while every day the L ’ vi ’ im and cohanim praised Adonai , singing to Adonai with the accompaniment of loud instruments .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	22	Hizkiyahu spoke encouragingly to all the L ’ vi ’ im who were well skilled in the service of Adonai . Thus they ate throughout the festival for the seven days , offering sacrifices of peace offerings and giving thanks to Adonai , the God of their ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	23	Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate for yet another seven days , and they observed those seven days too with joy .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	24	For Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah gave the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for offerings , while the leaders gave the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep ; and great numbers of cohanim consecrated themselves .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	25	All the people who had assembled from Y ’ hudah rejoiced , as did the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im , those assembled from Isra ’ el , and the foreigners who had come from the territory of Isra ’ el or who lived in Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	26	So there was great joy in Yerushalayim ; for since the time of Shlomo the son of David , king of Isra ’ el , there had been nothing like it in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	30	27	Then the cohanim , who were L ’ vi ’ im , stood up and blessed the people ; [ Adonai ] heard their voice , and their prayer came up to the holy place where he lives , heaven .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	2	Hizkiyahu re-established the divisions of the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im in accordance with the way the divisions had been before , with each man assigned his task , both the cohanim and the L ’ vi ’ im , for burnt offerings and for peace offerings , to serve , to give thanks and to praise at the gates of Adonai ’ s camp .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	31	After all this was over , all Isra ’ el who were there went out to the cities of Y ’ hudah and smashed the standing-stones , chopped down the sacred poles , and broke down the high places and altars throughout Y ’ hudah , Binyamin , Efrayim and M ’ nasheh , until they had destroyed them all . Then all the people of Isra ’ el returned to their own cities , each to his own possession .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	3	He determined a portion of the king ’ s property to be given for the burnt offerings , that is , for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for burnt offerings on Shabbats , Rosh-Hodesh and the designated times , as prescribed by the Torah of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	4	He also ordered the people living in Yerushalayim to contribute the portion meant for the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im , so that they would be submitting themselves to the Torah of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	5	As soon as the order was issued , the people of Isra ’ el gave in abundance from the firstfruits of the grain , wine , olive oil , honey and other agricultural produce ; they brought the required tenth and more .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	6	The people of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah living in the cities of Y ’ hudah also brought the required tenth of oxen and sheep and the required tenth of consecrated gifts that had been dedicated to Adonai their God , and piled them in heaps .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	7	They began accumulating these heaps in the third month and completed them in the seventh month .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	8	When Hizkiyahu and the leaders came and saw the heaps , they blessed Adonai and his people Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	9	When Hizkiyahu asked the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im about the heaps ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	10	‘ Azaryahu the chief cohen , from the house of Tzadok , answered him , “ Ever since the people began bringing offerings into the house of Adonai , we have had enough to eat and plenty left over ; for Adonai has blessed his people , and what is left over is this massive supply. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	11	Then Hizkiyahu ordered storerooms prepared in the house of Adonai . After preparing them ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	12	they faithfully brought in the offerings , the required tenths and the consecrated things . Konanyahu the Levi was put in charge of them , with Shim ‘ i his brother as his assistant .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	13	Hizkiyahu the king and ‘ Azaryahu the ruler of the house of God appointed Yechi ’ el , ‘ Azazyahu , Nachat , ‘ Asah ’ el , Yerimot , Yozavad , Eli ’ el , Yismachyah , Machat and B ’ nayahu as supervisors to serve under Konanyah and Shim ‘ i his brother .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	14	Kore the son of Yimnah the Levi , gatekeeper at the East Gate , was responsible for the voluntary offerings to God ; he had to distribute the offerings made to Adonai and the especially holy gifts .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	15	Under him were ‘ Eden , Minyamin , Yeshua , Sh ’ ma ‘ yahu , Amaryahu and Sh ’ khanyahu , in the cities of the cohanim , faithfully making the distributions to their kinsmen by divisions , to great and small alike .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	16	Every male three years and older entitled to enter the house of Adonai was given his daily share for performing his duties according to his division , regardless of how he was recorded in the genealogies .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	17	Likewise , those recorded in the genealogies of the cohanim by clans received shares , as did the L ’ vi ’ im twenty years and older who were performing their duties in their assigned divisions .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	18	When shares were assigned , all their little ones , wives , sons and daughters were also recorded in the genealogies , throughout the entire community ; for in their faithfulness to this task they consecrated themselves .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	19	Finally , shares were assigned to the descendants of Aharon , the cohanim , who lived in the pasture-lands surrounding their cities — in each city they were mentioned by name . Thus portions were distributed to all the males among the cohanim and to all whose genealogies showed that they belonged to the L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	20	This is what Hizkiyahu did throughout all Y ’ hudah . He accomplished things that were good , right and faithful before Adonai his God .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	31	21	Every project that he undertook in order to seek his God , whether in the service of the house of God or in connection with the Torah and the mitzvot , he did with all his heart ; and so he succeeded .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	2	When Hizkiyahu saw that Sancheriv had come and intended to attack Yerushalayim ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	32	Other activities of Hizkiyahu and his good deeds are recorded in the vision of Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet , the son of Amotz , and in the Annals of the Kings of Y ’ hudah and Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	3	he consulted his leading men and military advisers about sealing off the water in the springs outside the city . After gaining their support ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	4	a large crowd was gathered to block all the springs and the stream flowing through the countryside . They reasoned , “ Why should the kings of Ashur come and find an ample supply of water ? ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	5	Then , taking courage , he rebuilt all the broken sections of the wall , raised towers on it , built another wall outside that , strengthened the Millo in the City of David , and made a large quantity of spears and shields .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	6	He appointed military commanders over the people , then gathered them before him in the open space at the city gate and spoke these words of encouragement to them :
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	7	“ Be strong ! Take courage ! Don ’ t be afraid or distressed on account of the king of Ashur or all the horde he brings with him . For the One with us is greater than the one with him —
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	8	he has human strength , but we have Adonai our God to help us and fight our battles ! ” The people took heart at the words of Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	9	After this , while Sancheriv and all his army were besieging Lakhish , he sent his envoys to Yerushalayim , to Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah and to all Y ’ hudah who were there in Yerushalayim , with this message :
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	10	“ This is what Sancheriv king of Ashur says : ‘ What gives you the confidence that you can endure a siege against Yerushalayim ?
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Hasn ’ t Hizkiyahu deluded you ? Isn ’ t he condemning you to death by starvation and thirst when he says , “ Adonai our God will save us from the king of Ashur ” ?
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Isn ’ t this the same Hizkiyahu who removed [ your God ’ s ] high places and altars and ordered Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim to worship before one altar and offer sacrifices only on it ?
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	13	Don ’ t you realize what I and my ancestors have done to all the peoples of the other countries ? Were the gods of these nations able to do a thing to rescue their country from me ?
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	14	Who of all the gods of those nations that my ancestors completely destroyed was able to rescue his people from me ? How then will your God rescue you from me ?
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Don ’ t let Hizkiyahu mislead you or delude you this way , don ’ t believe him . For no god of any nation or kingdom has ever been able to rescue his people from me or my ancestors ; how much less will your God rescue you from me ! ’ ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	16	His envoys kept on speaking against Adonai , God ; and against his servant Hizkiyahu .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	17	He also wrote a letter insulting Adonai the God of Isra ’ el and speaking against him ; it said , “ Just as the gods of the nations of the other countries could not rescue their people from me , likewise Hizkiyahu ’ s God will not rescue his people from me. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	18	They were shouting loudly in the language of the Judeans to the people of Yerushalayim who were on the wall in order to terrify them and make them fearful , so that they could capture the city .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	19	They spoke about the God of Yerushalayim in the same way as about the gods of the other peoples of the earth , which are merely human artifacts .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	20	Because of this , Hizkiyahu the king and Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet , the son of Amotz , prayed and cried out to heaven .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	21	Then Adonai sent an angel , who cut down the valiant warriors , the leaders and the officers in the king of Ashur ’ s camp , so that he had to return shamefaced to his own country . When he entered the house of his god , his own sons , whom he himself had fathered , put him to death with the sword there .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	22	In this way Adonai rescued Hizkiyahu and those living in Yerushalayim from Sancheriv the king of Ashur and from everyone , caring for them in every respect .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	23	Many people brought gifts to Adonai in Yerushalayim and items of value to Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah , so that from then on he was regarded highly by all the nations .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	24	Around this time , Hizkiyahu became ill to the point of death . But he prayed to Adonai , who answered him , even giving him a sign .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	25	However , Hizkiyahu did not respond commensurately with the benefit done for him , because he had grown proud ; thus he brought anger on himself and on Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim as well .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	26	But Hizkiyahu then humbled himself for his pride , both he and the people living in Yerushalayim , so that Adonai ’ s anger did not strike them during Hizkiyahu ’ s lifetime .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	27	Hizkiyahu had vast riches and great honor . He provided himself with storage places for silver , gold , precious stones , spices , shields and all kinds of valuable articles ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	28	also storehouses for the harvest of grain , wine and olive oil ; and stalls for all kinds of livestock and pens for the flocks .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	29	He provided cities for himself and purchased flocks and herds in abundance , for God had made him extremely wealthy .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	30	It was this same Hizkiyahu who blocked the upper outlet of the Gichon Spring and diverted the water straight down on the west side of the City of David . Hizkiyahu succeeded in all that he did .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	31	However , in the matter of the ambassadors from the princes of Bavel , who sent to him to learn of the marvel that had taken place in the land , God left him by himself , in order to test him , so that he might know everything that was in his heart .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	32	33	Then Hizkiyahu slept with his ancestors , and they buried him by the path leading up to the tombs of the descendants of David . All Y ’ hudah and the people living in Yerushalayim honored him when he died , after which M ’ nasheh his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	2	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the disgusting practices of the nations whom Adonai had expelled ahead of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	33	M ’ nasheh was twelve years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for fifty-five years in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	3	For he rebuilt the high places which Hizkiyahu his father had smashed ; he erected altars for the ba ‘ alim , made sacred poles and worshipped all the army of heaven and served them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	4	He erected altars in the house of Adonai , concerning which Adonai had said , “ My name will be in Yerushalayim forever. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	5	He erected altars for all the army of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	6	He made his children pass through the fire [ as a sacrifice ] in the Ben-Hinnom Valley . He practiced soothsaying , divination and sorcery ; and he appointed mediums and persons who used spirit guides . He did much that was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , thus provoking him to anger .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	7	He set the carved image of the idol he had made in the house of God , concerning which God had told David and Shlomo his son , “ In this house and in Yerushalayim , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Isra ’ el , I will put my name forever .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	8	Also I will not remove the feet of Isra ’ el from the land I assigned your ancestors , if only they will take heed to obey every order I have given them , that is , all the Torah , laws and rulings that came through Moshe. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	9	M ’ nasheh caused Y ’ hudah and the people of Yerushalayim to go astray , so that they did even worse things than the nations whom Adonai destroyed ahead of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	10	Adonai spoke to M ’ nasheh and to his people , but they paid no attention .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	11	Therefore Adonai brought against them the commanders of the king of Ashur ’ s army . They took M ’ nasheh captive with hooks , bound him in chains and carried him off to Bavel .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	12	Then , when he was in distress , he began to appease the anger of Adonai , abjectly humbling himself before the God of his ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	13	He prayed to him ; and God was moved by his plea , paid attention to his entreaty and brought him back to Yerushalayim , to his kingly office . Then M ’ nasheh understood that Adonai really is God .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	14	After this he built an outer wall for the City of David on the west side of Gichon , in the valley , extending as far as the entrance at the Fish Gate ; it encompassed the ‘ Ofel , and he built it very high . He stationed army commanders in all the fortified cities of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	15	He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of Adonai and all the altars he had built on the hill of the house of Adonai and in Yerushalayim , and threw them out of the city .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	16	He repaired the altar of Adonai and offered on it sacrifices as peace offerings and for thanksgiving ; and he ordered Y ’ hudah to serve Adonai the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	17	However , the people continued sacrificing on the high places , although only to Adonai their God .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	18	Other activities of M ’ nasheh , his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Adonai the God of Isra ’ el are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	19	Also his prayer and how God was moved by his plea , all his sin and disloyalty , and the locations where he built high places and set up the sacred poles and carved images before he humbled himself are written in the History of the Seers .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	20	Then M ’ nasheh slept with his ancestors and was buried at his own house , and Amon his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for two years in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	22	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , as had M ’ nasheh his father . Amon sacrificed to all the carved images that M ’ nasheh his father had made , and served them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	23	He did not humble himself before Adonai , as M ’ nasheh his father had done ; rather , this Amon kept adding to his guilt .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	24	His servants conspired against him and put the king to death in his own palace .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	33	25	But the people of the land put to death all those who had been part of the conspiracy against King Amon . Then the people of the land made Yoshiyahu his son king in place of him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	2	He did what was right from Adonai ’ s perspective , living entirely in the manner of David his ancestor and turning away neither to the right nor to the left .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	34	Yoshiyahu was eight years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for thirty-one years in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	3	For in the eighth year of his reign , when he was still young , he began seeking after the God of David his father ; and in the twelfth year , he began cleansing Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim from the high places , the sacred poles , and the carved and cast metal images .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	4	In his presence they broke down the altars of the ba ‘ alim , and he chopped down the pillars for sun-worship mounted above them . He smashed the sacred poles and the carved and cast metal images , grinding them to dust , which he threw on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	5	He burned the bones of the priests on their altars , thus cleansing Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	6	He did likewise in the cities of M ’ nasheh , Efrayim , Shim ‘ on and even as far as Naftali , in their surrounding ruins .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	7	He broke down the altars , beat the sacred poles and carved images to powder and chopped down the pillars for sun-worship throughout all the land of Isra ’ el . Then he returned to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	8	In the eighteenth year of his reign , after he had cleansed the land and the house , he sent Shafan the son of Atzalyahu , Ma ‘ aseiyah the governor of the city and Yo ’ ach the son of Yo ’ achaz the recorder to repair the house of Adonai his God .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	9	They went to Hilkiyahu the cohen hagadol and handed over to him the money that had been brought into the house of God , which the L ’ vi ’ im who guarded the doors had collected from M ’ nasheh , Efrayim , the rest of Isra ’ el and all Y ’ hudah and Binyamin . Then they returned to Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	10	They gave it to the supervisors of the work being done in the house of Adonai ; and those doing the work in the house of Adonai used it to repair and restore the house —
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	11	that is , they gave it to the carpenters and construction-workers to purchase worked stone , timber for the crossbeams and roof beams for the houses which the kings of Y ’ hudah had destroyed .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	12	The men did the work faithfully . Their supervisors were Yachat and ‘ Ovadyahu , L ’ vi ’ im from the descendants of M ’ rari , also Z ’ kharyah and Meshulam from the descendants of the K ’ hatim to give direction ; and other L ’ vi ’ im , all of whom could accompany singing with musical instruments .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	13	They supervised those carrying the loads and everyone doing any kind of work ; and there were also L ’ vi ’ im who were secretaries , officials and gatekeepers .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	14	While bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of Adonai , Hilkiyahu the cohen found the scroll of the Torah of Adonai given by Moshe .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	15	Hilkiyahu said to Shafan the secretary , “ I have found the scroll of the Torah in the house of Adonai. ” Hilkiyahu gave the scroll to Shafan .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	16	Shafan the secretary brought the scroll to the king . Turning to the king , he gave him this report : “ Your servants are doing everything you ordered them to do .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	17	They have poured out the money found in the house of Adonai and handed it over to the supervisors and workers. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	18	Then Shafan the secretary told the king , “ Hilkiyahu the cohen hagadol gave me a scroll. ” Shafan read it aloud before the king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	19	After the king had heard what was written in the Torah , he tore his clothes .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	20	Then the king issued this order to Hilkiyahu , Achikam the son of Shafan , ‘ Avdon the son of Mikhah , Shafan the secretary and ‘ Asayah the king ’ s servant :
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	21	“ Go , and consult Adonai for me and for the people left in Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah in regard to what is written in this scroll which has been found . For Adonai must be furious at us , since our ancestors did not observe the word of Adonai and do everything written in this scroll. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	22	So Hilkiyahu and those the king had ordered went to Huldah the prophet , the wife of Shalum the son of Tok ’ hat , the son of Hasrat , keeper of the wardrobe — she lived in the Second Quarter of Yerushalayim — and spoke with her about this .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	23	She told them , “ Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says to tell the man who sent you to me
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	24	that Adonai says this : ‘ I am going to bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants , all the curses written in the scroll they read to the king of Y ’ hudah ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	25	because they have abandoned me and offered to other gods , in order to provoke me with everything they do . Therefore my anger is poured out on this place and will not be quenched. ’
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	26	“ But you are to tell the king of Y ’ hudah , who sent you to consult Adonai , that Adonai the God of Isra ’ el also says this : ‘ In regard to the words you have heard ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	27	because your heart was tender , and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants — you humbled yourself before me , tore your clothes and cried before me — I have also heard you , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	28	‘ Here , I will gather you to your ancestors ; you will go to your grave in peace ; and your eyes will not see all the calamity I am going to bring on this place and its inhabitants. ’ ” So they brought back word to the king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	29	Then the king summoned and assembled all the leaders of Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	30	The king went up to the house of Adonai with all the men of Y ’ hudah , those living in Yerushalayim , the cohanim , the L ’ vi ’ im and all the people , both great and small ; and he read in their hearing everything written in the scroll of the covenant that had been found in the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	31	The king stood in his place and made a covenant in the presence of Adonai to live following Adonai , observing his mitzvot , instructions and laws wholeheartedly and with all his being , so as to perform the words of the covenant written in this scroll .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	32	Then , after he had all the people in Yerushalayim and Binyamin stand in affirmation of it , the inhabitants of Yerushalayim acted in accordance with the covenant of God , the God of their ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	34	33	Yoshiyahu removed all the abominable idols from all the territories belonging to the people of Isra ’ el , and he made everyone in Isra ’ el serve Adonai their God . Throughout his lifetime , they did not stop following Adonai , the God of their ancestors .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	2	He assigned the cohanim to their posts and encouraged them to perform the service of the house of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	35	Yoshiyahu kept Pesach to Adonai in Yerushalayim . They slaughtered the Pesach lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	3	To the L ’ vi ’ im who were teaching all Isra ’ el and were holy for Adonai he said , “ Put the holy ark in the house which Shlomo the son of David , king of Isra ’ el , built ; after this , you will not have to carry it again . Now serve Adonai your God and his people Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	4	Organize yourselves by clans and duty divisions according to the arrangement written down by David king of Isra ’ el and Shlomo his son .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	5	Stand in the Holy Place according to the divisions of the clans of your kinsmen the ordinary people , with part of a clan of L ’ vi ’ im serving each clan [ of Isra ’ el ] .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	6	Then slaughter the Pesach lamb , consecrate yourselves , prepare what your kinsmen need , and act according to the word of Adonai given through Moshe. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	7	Yoshiyahu gave the ordinary people , to all who were present , 30,000 lambs and kids from the flock , all of them for Pesach offerings , and 3,000 bulls . These were from the king ’ s personal property .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	8	Also his leading men voluntarily gave to the people and to the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im . Hilkiyah , Z ’ kharyahu and Yechi ’ el , the rulers of the house of God , gave the cohanim 2,600 [ lambs and kids ] and
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	300	oxen for Pesach offerings .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	9	Konanyah , his brothers Sh ’ ma ‘ yah and N ’ tan ’ el , and Hashavyah , Ye ‘ i ’ el and Yozavad , the head L ’ vi ’ im , gave the L ’ vi ’ im 5,000 [ lambs and kids ] and
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	500	oxen for Pesach offerings .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	10	So the service was prepared ; the cohanim stood at their posts ; and the L ’ vi ’ im worked in their divisions , in keeping with the king ’ s order .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	11	They slaughtered the Pesach lamb ; the cohanim splashed [ the blood , which they received from the L ’ vi ’ im ] , and the L ’ vi ’ im skinned and butchered them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	12	They removed the portions to be burned , in order to give them to the divisions of the clans of the ordinary people to present to Adonai , as written in the scroll of Moshe . They did the same with the oxen .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	13	They roasted the Pesach lamb over fire , according to the rule ; while they boiled the holy offerings in pots , kettles and pans and carried them quickly to all the ordinary people .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	14	Afterwards , they prepared food for themselves and for the cohanim ; because the cohanim , the descendants of Aharon , were busy till nightfall offering the fat and the portions to be burned up ; this is why the L ’ vi ’ im prepared food both for themselves and for the cohanim the descendants of Aharon .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	15	The singers the sons of Asaf were at their posts , as ordered by David — Asaf , Heman and Y ’ dutun the king ’ s seer . The gatekeepers were at every gate , and they did not need to leave their posts , because their brothers the L ’ vi ’ im prepared [ food ] for them .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	16	Thus all the service of Adonai was prepared the same day for observing Pesach and offering burnt offerings on the altar of Adonai , in accordance with the order of King Yoshiyahu .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	17	The people of Isra ’ el who were present observed the Pesach at that time and the festival of Matzot for seven days .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	18	No Pesach like that had been kept in Isra ’ el since the days of Sh ’ mu ’ el the prophet , and none of the kings of Isra ’ el observe a Pesach such as Yoshiyahu observed , with the cohanim , L ’ vi ’ im , all Y ’ hudah , those of Isra ’ el who were present , and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	19	This Pesach was observed in the eighteenth year of Yoshiyahu .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	20	After all this , and after Yoshiyahu had restored the house , N ’ kho king of Egypt went up to attack Kark ’ mish by the Euphrates River . King Yoshiyahu went out to oppose him ;
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	21	but N ’ kho sent envoys to him with this message : “ Do I have a conflict with you , king of Y ’ hudah ? No , I am not coming today to attack you , but to attack the dynasty with whom I am at war . God has ordered to speed me along ; so don ’ t meddle with God , who is with me ; so that he won ’ t destroy you. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	22	Nevertheless , Yoshiyahu was determined to go after him . He disguised himself in order to fight against him and wouldn ’ t listen to what N ’ kho said , which was from the mouth of God . Then he went to fight in the Megiddo Valley .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	23	There archers shot King Yoshiyahu . The king said to his servants , “ Take me away , because I ’ m badly wounded. ”
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	24	So his servants took him out of the chariot , transferred him to his second chariot and brought him to Yerushalayim . But he died , and he was buried in the tombs of his ancestors . All Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim mourned Yoshiyahu .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	25	Yirmeyahu composed a lament for Yoshiyahu ; and all the men and women singers have sung of Yoshiyahu in their laments till this day . They made singing them a law in Isra ’ el , and they are recorded in the Laments .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	26	Other activities of Yoshiyahu and all his good deeds in keeping with what is written in the Torah of Adonai ,
CJB	2%20Chronicles	35	27	also his accomplishments from beginning to end , are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	2	Y ’ ho ’ achaz was twenty-three years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for three months in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	36	Then the people of the land took Y ’ ho ’ achaz the son of Yoshiyahu and made him king in his father ’ s place , in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	3	But the king of Egypt deposed him in Yerushalayim and imposed a penalty on the land of three-and-a-third tons of silver and sixty-six pounds of gold .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	4	Then the king of Egypt made Elyakim his brother king over Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim , changing his name to Y ’ hoyakim ; N ’ kho took Yo ’ achaz his brother and carried him off to Egypt .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	5	Y ’ hoyakim was twenty-five years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for eleven years in Yerushalayim . He did what was evil from the perspective of Adonai his God .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	6	N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel attacked him and bound him in chains to carry him off to Bavel .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	7	N ’ vukhadnetzar also carried the articles in the house of Adonai away to Bavel and put them in his temple in Bavel .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	8	Other activities of Y ’ hoyakim , including all the abominations he did publicly and those discovered later , are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah . Then Y ’ hoyakhin his son took his place as king .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	9	Y ’ hoyakhin was eight years old when he began his reign , and he ruled in Yerushalayim for three months and ten days . He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	10	In the spring , King N ’ vukhadnetzar sent and had him brought to Bavel together with the valuable articles from the house of Adonai , and made Tzedekyah his brother king over Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	11	Tzedekyah was twenty-one years old when he began his reign , and he ruled for eleven years in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	12	He did what was evil from the perspective of Adonai his God . He did not humble himself before Yirmeyahu the prophet speaking on behalf of Adonai .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	13	He also rebelled against King N ’ vukhadnetzar , who had made him swear loyalty to him by God ; instead , he became stiffnecked and hardhearted , refusing to turn to Adonai the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	14	In addition , the chief cohanim and the people grew increasingly unfaithful , following all the abominable practices of the other nations ; and they polluted the house of Adonai , which he had consecrated in Yerushalayim .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	15	Time after time , and frequently , Adonai , the God of their ancestors , sent word to them through his messengers ; because he had compassion on his people and on the place where he lived .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	16	But they ridiculed God ’ s messengers , treating his words with contempt and scoffing at his prophets , until the anger of Adonai rose up against his people to the extent that there was no longer any remedy .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	17	Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Kasdim , who put their young men to the sword in the house of their sanctuary . They had no compassion on either young men or young women , old men or gray-haired ; God handed all of them over to him .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	18	All the articles in the house of God , great and small ; the supplies in the house of Adonai ; and the supplies of the king and his leading men — all these he brought to Bavel .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	19	Then they burned down the house of God , broke down the wall of Yerushalayim , put to flames all its palaces and destroyed everything in it of worth .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	20	Those who had escaped the sword he carried off to Bavel , and they became slaves to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	21	Thus was fulfilled the word of Adonai spoken by Yirmeyahu , “ until the land has been paid her Shabbats ” — for as long as it lay desolate , it kept Shabbat , until seventy years had passed .
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	22	Now in the first year of Koresh king of Persia , so that the word of Adonai spoken by Yirmeyahu might be fulfilled , Adonai activated the spirit of Koresh king of Persia to proclaim throughout his entire kingdom , and put in writing as well :
CJB	2%20Chronicles	36	23	“ Here is what Koresh king of Persia says : Adonai , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms on earth , and he has charged me to build him a house in Yerushalayim , in Y ’ hudah . Whoever there is among you of all his people , may Adonai his God be with him ! He may go up . . . . ”
CJB	Ezra	1	1	In the first year of Koresh king of Persia , in order for the word of Adonai prophesied by Yirmeyahu to be fulfilled , Adonai stirred up the spirit of Koresh king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his whole kingdom , which he also put in writing , as follows :
CJB	Ezra	1	2	“ Here is what Koresh king of Persia says : Adonai , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms on earth ; and he has charged me to build him a house in Yerushalayim , in Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Ezra	1	3	Whoever there is among you of all his people , may his God be with him ! He may go up to Yerushalayim , in Y ’ hudah , and build the house of Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , the God who is in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	1	4	Let every survivor , no matter where he lives , be helped by his neighbors with silver , gold , goods and animals , in addition to the voluntary offering for the house of God in Yerushalayim. ”
CJB	Ezra	1	5	The heads of fathers ’ clans in Y ’ hudah and Binyamin , along with the cohanim , the L ’ vi ’ im , and indeed all whose spirit God had stirred , set out to go up and rebuild the house of Adonai in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	1	6	All their neighbors supported them by giving them articles of silver , gold , goods , animals , and valuables , besides all their voluntary offerings .
CJB	Ezra	1	7	In addition , Koresh the king brought out the vessels from the house of Adonai which N ’ vukhadnetzar had taken from Yerushalayim and put in the house of his god .
CJB	Ezra	1	8	Koresh king of Persia had Mitr ’ dat the treasurer bring them out and make an inventory of them for Sheshbatzar the prince of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Ezra	1	9	The list was as follows : |Gold basins||30| |Silver basins||1,000| |Knives||29| |10 Gold bowls||30| |Silver bowls of a different kind||410| |Other vessels||1,000|
CJB	Ezra	1	11	In all there were 5,400 articles of gold and silver . Sheshbatzar took all of them along when the exiles were brought up from Bavel to Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	2	2	they went with Z ’ rubavel , Yeshua , Nechemyah , S ’ rayah , Re ‘ elyah , Mordekhai , Bilshan , Mispar , Bigvai , Rechum and Ba ‘ anah .

CJB	Ezra	2	59	The following went up from Tel-Melach , Tel-Harsha , K ’ ruv , Adan and Immer ; but they could not state which fathers ’ clan they or their children belonged to , [ so it was not clear ] whether they were from Isra ’ el : |60 descendants of D ’ layah , | |descendants of Toviyah , and| |descendants of N ’ koda||652|
CJB	Ezra	2	61	and of the descendants of the cohanim : descendants of Havayah , descendants of Hakotz , and descendants of Barzillai , who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gil ‘ adi and was named after them .
CJB	Ezra	2	62	These tried to locate their genealogical records , but they weren ’ t found . Therefore they were considered defiled and were not allowed to serve as cohanim .
CJB	Ezra	2	63	The Tirshata told them not to eat any of the especially holy food until a cohen appeared who could consult the urim and tumim .
CJB	Ezra	2	64	The entire assembly numbered 42,360 —
CJB	Ezra	2	65	not including their male and female slaves , of whom there were 7,337 . They also had
CJB	Ezra	2	200	male and female singers .
CJB	Ezra	2	66	Their horses numbered
CJB	Ezra	2	736	; their mules ,
CJB	Ezra	2	245	;
CJB	Ezra	2	67	their camels ,
CJB	Ezra	2	435	; and their donkeys , 6,720 .
CJB	Ezra	2	68	Some of the heads of fathers ’ clans , when they came to the house of Adonai in Yerushalayim , made voluntary offerings for rebuilding the house of God on its site .
CJB	Ezra	2	69	According to their means they gave into the treasury for the work 61,000 gold darkmonim [ about two-thirds of a ton ] , 5,000 manim of silver [ just over three tons ] , and a hundred tunics for the cohanim .
CJB	Ezra	2	70	So the cohanim , the L ’ vi ’ im , some of the people , the singers , the gatekeepers and the temple servants lived in their towns and all Isra ’ el in their towns .
CJB	Ezra	3	3	They set up the altar on its former bases . Despite feeling threatened by the peoples of the [ surrounding ] countries ; they offered on it burnt offerings to Adonai , the morning and evening burnt offerings .
CJB	Ezra	3	2	Then Yeshua the son of Yotzadak with his fellow cohanim , and Z ’ rubavel the son of Sh ’ alti ’ el with his kinsmen , organized rebuilding the altar of the God of Isra ’ el ; so that they could offer burnt offerings on it , as is written in the Torah of Moshe the man of God .
CJB	Ezra	3	4	They observed the festival of Sukkot as written , offering daily the number of burnt offerings prescribed for each day ,
CJB	Ezra	3	5	and afterwards the regular burnt offering , the offerings for Rosh-Hodesh and those for all the designated times set apart for Adonai , as well as those of everyone who volunteered a voluntary offering to Adonai .
CJB	Ezra	3	6	From the first day of the seventh month , they began offering burnt offerings to Adonai , even though the foundation of Adonai ’ s temple had not yet been laid .
CJB	Ezra	3	7	They also gave money for the stone-workers and carpenters , as well as food , drink and olive oil for the people of Tzidon and Tzor bringing cedar logs from the L ’ vanon to the sea and on to Yafo , in accordance with the authorization granted by Koresh king of Persia .
CJB	Ezra	3	8	In the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Yerushalayim , in the second month , Z ’ rubavel the son of Sh ’ alti ’ el , Yeshua the son of Yotzadak , the rest of their kinsmen the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im , and all who had come out of exile to Yerushalayim began the project . They appointed the L ’ vi ’ im aged twenty and up to direct work in the house of Adonai .
CJB	Ezra	3	9	Yeshua and his sons and brothers , Kadmi ’ el and his sons , and Y ’ hudah ’ s sons together directed the workers in the house of God ; also the sons of Henadad , with their sons and their kinsmen the L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	Ezra	3	10	When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Adonai , the cohanim in their robes , with trumpets , and the L ’ vi ’ im the sons of Asaf , with cymbals , took their places to praise Adonai , as David king of Isra ’ el had instructed .
CJB	Ezra	3	11	They sang antiphonally , praising and giving “ thanks to Adonai , for he is good , for his grace continues forever ” toward Isra ’ el . All the people raised a great shout of praise to Adonai , because the foundation of the house of Adonai had been laid .
CJB	Ezra	3	12	But many of the cohanim , L ’ vi ’ im and heads of fathers ’ clans , the old men who had seen the first house standing on its foundation , wept out loud when they saw this house ; while others shouted out loud for joy —
CJB	Ezra	3	13	so that the people couldn ’ t distinguish the noise of the joyful shouting from the noise of the people ’ s weeping ; for the people were shouting so loudly that the noise could be heard at a great distance .
CJB	Ezra	4	4	Then the people of the land began discouraging the people of Y ’ hudah , in order to make them afraid to build .
CJB	Ezra	4	2	they approached Z ’ rubavel and the heads of fathers ’ clans and said to them , “ Let us build along with you ; for we seek your God , just as you do ; and we have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esar-Hadon king of Ashur , who brought us here. ”
CJB	Ezra	4	3	But Z ’ rubavel , Yeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers ’ clans in Isra ’ el answered them , “ You and we have nothing in common that you should join us in building a house for our God . We will build by ourselves for Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , as Koresh king of Persia ordered us to do. ”
CJB	Ezra	4	5	They also bribed officials to frustrate their plan throughout the lifetime of Koresh king of Persia and on into the reign of Daryavesh king of Persia .
CJB	Ezra	4	6	During the reign of Achashverosh , at the beginning of his reign , they brought a charge in writing against the people living in Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	4	7	Then , during the time of Artach ’ shashta , Bishlam , Mitr ’ dat , Tav ’ el and their other colleagues wrote Artach ’ shashta ; the letter was written in Aramaic , using Aramaic script .
CJB	Ezra	4	8	Rechum the district governor and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Yerushalayim to Artach ’ shashta the king as follows :
CJB	Ezra	4	9	“ From Rechum the district governor , Shimshai the secretary , their other colleagues , the judges , the officials , the Dina ’ im , the Afarsat ’ khim , the Tarp ’ lim , the Afarsim , the Ark ’ vim , the Bavlim , the Shushan ’ kayim , the Dehayim , the ‘ Elma ’ im ,
CJB	Ezra	4	10	the other nations whom the great and noble Asnapar deported and settled in Shomron , and the others who remain in the country beyond the [ Euphrates ] River. ”
CJB	Ezra	4	11	( This is the text of the letter they sent him . ) “ To Artach ’ shashta the king from his servants the people beyond the River :
CJB	Ezra	4	12	“ Let the king know that the Judeans who left you to come to us in Yerushalayim are building this rebellious and wicked city . They have finished the walls and are now digging the foundations .
CJB	Ezra	4	13	So let the king know that if this city is rebuilt and the walls are finished , they will refuse to pay tribute , tax or toll ; and this will reduce the royal revenue .
CJB	Ezra	4	14	Now , because we eat the king ’ s salt , and it is not right for us to see the king dishonored , we therefore are sending to inform the king ,
CJB	Ezra	4	15	so that a search can be made in the archives of your ancestors ; in these archives you will find and ascertain that this city is indeed a rebellious city , the bane of kings and provinces , and that sedition has been fostered there since ancient times — which is why this city was destroyed .
CJB	Ezra	4	16	We submit to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls are finished , you will soon lose possession of all territories beyond the River. ”
CJB	Ezra	4	17	The king sent this answer : “ To Rechum the district governor , Shimshai the secretary , their other colleagues living in Shomron , and the rest beyond the River : “ Shalom !
CJB	Ezra	4	18	“ The letter you sent us has now been translated for me .
CJB	Ezra	4	19	I ordered a search made , and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings , that rebellion and sedition have been fostered there ;
CJB	Ezra	4	20	also that there have been powerful kings over Yerushalayim who ruled all the territory beyond the River ; and tribute , taxes and tolls were paid to them .
CJB	Ezra	4	21	“ So now , order that these men stop work and that this city not be rebuilt until I order it .
CJB	Ezra	4	22	Take care not to neglect your duty ; otherwise the harm may increase , to the damage of the king. ”
CJB	Ezra	4	23	When the text of King Artach ’ shashta ’ s letter was read before Rechum , Shimshai the secretary and their colleagues , they hurried to Yerushalayim to the Judeans and stopped their work by force of arms .
CJB	Ezra	4	24	So the work on the house of God in Yerushalayim ceased ; it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of Daryavesh king of Persia .
CJB	Ezra	5	5	But the eye of their God was on the leaders of the Judeans , so they didn ’ t stop them until the matter could come before Daryavesh and a reply in writing be received .
CJB	Ezra	5	2	Then Z ’ rubavel the son of Sh ’ alti ’ el and Yeshua the son of Yotzadak began rebuilding the house of God in Yerushalayim ; with them were the prophets of God , helping them .
CJB	Ezra	5	3	No sooner had they begun , when Tatnai the governor of the territory beyond the [ Euphrates ] River , Sh ’ tar-Boznai and their colleagues came and asked them , “ Who gave you permission to rebuild this house and finish this wall ?
CJB	Ezra	5	4	What are the names of the men putting up this building ? ”
CJB	Ezra	5	6	Here is the text of the letter which Tatnai the governor of the territory beyond the River , Sh ’ tar-Boznai and their fellow officials beyond the River sent to Daryavesh the king ;
CJB	Ezra	5	7	they sent him a letter in which it was written : “ To Daryavesh the king , “ Complete shalom ! ”
CJB	Ezra	5	8	“ Let the king know that we went to the province of Y ’ hudah , to the house of the great God . It is being rebuilt with large stones , and timber is being set in the walls . This work is being done energetically , and it is making good progress under the direction
CJB	Ezra	5	9	of their leaders . We asked them , ‘ Who gave you permission to rebuild this house and finish this wall ? ’
CJB	Ezra	5	10	We also asked them their names , so that we could write you the names of the men in charge of them .
CJB	Ezra	5	11	“ They gave us this answer : ‘ We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth . We are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago , built and finished by a great king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezra	5	12	But because our ancestors provoked the God of heaven , he handed them over to N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel , the Kasdi ; he destroyed this house and carried the people off to Bavel .
CJB	Ezra	5	13	But in the first year of Koresh king of Bavel , Koresh the king gave authorization to rebuild this house of God .
CJB	Ezra	5	14	Moreover , the gold and silver articles belonging to the house of God , which N ’ vukhadnetzar had removed from the temple in Yerushalayim and brought to the temple of Bavel , Koresh the king took out of the temple in Bavel ; they were turned over to a man named Sheshbatzar , whom he had appointed governor .
CJB	Ezra	5	15	He said to him , “ Take these articles , go , put them in the temple in Yerushalayim , and let the house of God be rebuilt on its original site. ”
CJB	Ezra	5	16	So this same Sheshbatzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Yerushalayim ; it has been under construction ever since , and it isn ’ t finished yet .
CJB	Ezra	5	17	“ ‘ Now therefore , if it seems good to the king , let a search be made in the royal treasury there in Bavel to determine whether a decree was issued by Koresh the king to rebuild this house of God in Yerushalayim ; and let the king send us his decision concerning this matter . ’ ”
CJB	Ezra	6	6	“ Therefore , Tatnai governor of the territory beyond the River , Sh ’ tar-Boznai and your colleagues the officials beyond the River , stay away from there !
CJB	Ezra	6	2	and there was found at Achm ’ ta , in the palace which is in the province of Media , a scroll on which was written the following : “ Memorandum :
CJB	Ezra	6	3	“ In the first year of Koresh the king , Koresh the king issued this decree : ‘ Concerning the house of God in Yerushalayim , let the house be rebuilt , the place where they offer sacrifices ; and let its foundations be firmly laid . Its height is to be ninety feet and its breadth ninety feet ,
CJB	Ezra	6	4	with three rows of large stones and one row of new timber . The expenses are to be charged to the king ’ s treasury .
CJB	Ezra	6	5	Also let the gold and silver articles belonging to the house of God , which N ’ vukhadnetzar removed from the temple at Yerushalayim and brought to Bavel , be restored and returned to the temple in Yerushalayim , each item to its place ; and you are to put them in the house of God. ’
CJB	Ezra	6	7	Let the work of this house of God alone . Let the governor of the Judeans and the leaders of the Judeans rebuild this house of God on its site .
CJB	Ezra	6	8	“ Moreover , I herewith issue this order concerning how you are to assist these leaders of the Judeans in rebuilding this house of God : the expenses of these men are to be defrayed promptly from the royal funds , from the taxes collected beyond the River , so that the work can continue .
CJB	Ezra	6	9	Whatever they need — young bulls , rams and lambs — for burnt offerings to the God of heaven , wheat , salt , wine and olive oil , according to what the cohanim in Yerushalayim say , is to be given them daily without fail ;
CJB	Ezra	6	10	so that they can offer sacrifices with a fragrant aroma to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons .
CJB	Ezra	6	11	“ I also order that if anyone defies this order , a beam is to be pulled from his house ; and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it . His house is to be reduced to rubble .
CJB	Ezra	6	12	May the God who has caused his name to be there overthrow any king or people that tries to defy it and destroy this house of God in Yerushalayim . “ I , Daryavesh , have issued this order . Let it be carried out to the letter. ”
CJB	Ezra	6	13	Then Tatnai the governor of the territory beyond the [ Euphrates ] River , Sh ’ tar-Boznai and their colleagues obeyed strictly ; because Daryavesh the king had given the order to do so .
CJB	Ezra	6	14	The leaders of the Judeans made good progress with the rebuilding , thanks to the prophesying of Hagai the prophet and Z ’ kharyah the son of ‘ Iddo . They kept building until they were finished , in keeping with the command of the God of Isra ’ el and in accordance with the order of Koresh , Daryavesh and Artach ’ shashta king of Persia .
CJB	Ezra	6	15	This house was finished on the third day of the month Adar , in the sixth year of the reign of Daryavesh the king .
CJB	Ezra	6	16	The people of Isra ’ el , the cohanim , the L ’ vi ’ im and the other people from the exile joyfully dedicated this house of God .
CJB	Ezra	6	17	At the dedication of this house of God they offered
CJB	Ezra	6	100	young bulls ,
CJB	Ezra	6	200	rams ,
CJB	Ezra	6	400	lambs , and , as a sin offering for all Isra ’ el , twelve male goats , corresponding to the number of the tribes of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezra	6	18	Then they installed the cohanim in their divisions and the L ’ vi ’ im in their orders for the service of God in Yerushalayim , as written in the book of Moshe .
CJB	Ezra	6	19	The people from the exile kept Pesach on the fourteenth day of the first month .
CJB	Ezra	6	20	For the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im had purified themselves together ; all of them were pure . So they slaughtered the Pesach lambs for all the people from the exile and for their kinsmen the cohanim and for themselves .
CJB	Ezra	6	21	The people of Isra ’ el who had returned from the exile and all those who had renounced the filthy practices of the nations living in the land in order to seek Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , ate [ the Pesach lamb ]
CJB	Ezra	6	22	and joyfully kept the feast of matzah for seven days ; for Adonai had filled them with joy by turning the heart of the king of Ashur toward them , so that he assisted them in the work of the house of God , the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezra	7	7	In the seventh year of Artach ’ shashta the king , some of the people of Isra ’ el , and some of the cohanim , L ’ vi ’ im , singers , gatekeepers and temple servants went up to Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	7	2	the son of Shalum , the son of Tzadok , the son of Achituv ,
CJB	Ezra	7	3	the son of Amaryah , the son of ‘ Azaryah , the son of M ’ rayot ,
CJB	Ezra	7	4	the son of Z ’ rachyah , the son of ‘ Uzi , the son of Buki ,
CJB	Ezra	7	5	the son of Avishua , the son of Pinchas , the son of Eli ‘ ezer , the son of Aharon the cohen hagadol —
CJB	Ezra	7	6	this ‘ Ezra went up from Bavel . He was a scribe , expert in the Torah of Moshe , which Adonai the God of Isra ’ el had given ; and the king granted him everything he asked for , since the hand of Adonai his God was on him .
CJB	Ezra	7	8	[ ‘ Ezra ] arrived at Yerushalayim in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king .
CJB	Ezra	7	9	He began going up to Yerushalayim from Bavel on the first day of the first month and arrived on the first day of the fifth month , since the good hand of his God was on him .
CJB	Ezra	7	10	For ‘ Ezra had set his heart on studying and practicing the Torah of Adonai and teaching Isra ’ el the laws and rulings .
CJB	Ezra	7	11	Here is the letter that King Artach ’ shashta gave ‘ Ezra the cohen and Torah-teacher , the student of matters relating to Adonai ’ s mitzvot and his laws for Isra ’ el :
CJB	Ezra	7	12	“ From : Artach ’ shashta , king of kings “ To : ‘ Ezra the cohen , scribe of the law of the God of heaven , etc . : “ Herewith
CJB	Ezra	7	13	I decree that everyone in my realm who belongs to the people of Isra ’ el , including their cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im , who , of his own free will , chooses to go with you to Yerushalayim , should go .
CJB	Ezra	7	14	You are being sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire how the law of your God , of which you have expert knowledge , is being applied in Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	7	15	You are also to bring with you the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have voluntarily offered to the God of Isra ’ el , whose dwelling is in Yerushalayim ;
CJB	Ezra	7	16	together with all the silver and gold you receive throughout the province of Bavel and the voluntary offerings of the people and the cohanim that have been offered willingly for the house of their God in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	7	17	“ You are to spend this money carefully on young bulls , rams , and lambs , with their grain offerings and drink offerings ; and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	7	18	Whatever seems good to you and your kinsmen to do with the rest of the silver and gold , do it according to the will of your God .
CJB	Ezra	7	19	“ The articles given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver to the God of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	7	20	“ Whatever else may be needed for the house of your God that you have to supply , you may supply from the royal treasury .
CJB	Ezra	7	21	“ I , Artach ’ shashta the king , herewith order all the treasurers in the territory beyond the [ Euphrates ] River to do carefully anything ‘ Ezra the cohen , scribe of the law of the God of heaven , requires of you ,
CJB	Ezra	7	22	up to three-and-a-third tons of silver ,
CJB	Ezra	7	500	gallons of olive oil and unlimited amounts of salt .
CJB	Ezra	7	23	Whatever is ordered by the God of heaven is to be performed exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should wrath come against the realm of the king and his sons ?
CJB	Ezra	7	24	Moreover , we herewith proclaim to you that it will be illegal to impose tribute , taxes or tolls on any of the cohanim , L ’ vi ’ im , singers , gatekeepers , servants or laborers in this house of God .
CJB	Ezra	7	25	“ And you , ‘ Ezra , making use of the wisdom you have from your God , are to appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people in the territory beyond the River , that is , all who know the laws of your God ; and you are to teach those who don ’ t know them .
CJB	Ezra	7	26	Whoever refuses to obey the law of your God and the law of the king , let judgment be executed on him swiftly , whether it be death , banishment , confiscation of goods or imprisonment. ”
CJB	Ezra	7	27	Blessed be Adonai , the God of our ancestors , who has put such a thing as this in the heart of the king , to restore the beauty of the house of Adonai in Yerushalayim ,
CJB	Ezra	7	28	and has extended mercy to me before the king and his counselors , and before all the king ’ s most powerful officials . So I took courage , since the hand of Adonai my God was on me , and I gathered together out of Isra ’ el key men to go up with me .

CJB	Ezra	8	160	males ;
CJB	Ezra	8	11	of the descendants of Bevai : Z ’ kharyah the son of Bevai , and with him
CJB	Ezra	8	28	Then I told them , “ You are consecrated to Adonai , the articles are holy , and the silver and gold are a voluntary offering for Adonai the God of your ancestors .
CJB	Ezra	8	12	of the descendants of ‘ Azgad : Yochanan the son of HaKatan , and with him
CJB	Ezra	8	110	males ;
CJB	Ezra	8	13	of the descendants of Adonikam : the younger ones , whose names were Elifelet , Ye ‘ i ’ el and Sh ’ ma ‘ yah , and with them
CJB	Ezra	8	60	males ; and
CJB	Ezra	8	14	of the descendants of Bigvai : ‘ Utai and Zakur , and with them
CJB	Ezra	8	15	I assembled them by the river that runs to Ahava , and we camped there three days . I reviewed the people and the cohanim but found no L ’ vi ’ im there .
CJB	Ezra	8	16	So I sent for Eli ‘ ezer , Ari ’ el , Sh ’ ma ‘ yah , Elnatan , Yariv , Elnatan , Natan , Z ’ kharyah and Meshulam , who were leaders , and also for Yoyariv and Elnatan , who were men of discernment .
CJB	Ezra	8	17	I gave them instructions for Iddo , the leading man in a place called Kasifya , and told them what to say to Iddo and his brother , who were in charge of Kasifya , so that they would bring us men to minister in the house of our God .
CJB	Ezra	8	18	Since the good hand of our God was on us , they brought us Ish-Sekhel from the descendants of Machli the son of Levi , the son of Isra ’ el ; Sherevyah with eighteen of his sons and kinsmen ;
CJB	Ezra	8	19	Hashavyah , with Yesha ‘ yah , from the descendants of M ’ rari , and twenty of his kinsmen and their sons ;
CJB	Ezra	8	20	and from the temple servants , whom David and the princes had assigned to serve the L ’ vi ’ im , two hundred temple servants , all recorded by name .
CJB	Ezra	8	21	Then , there at the Ahava River , I proclaimed a fast ; so that we could humble ourselves before our God and ask a safe journey of him for ourselves , our little ones and all our possessions .
CJB	Ezra	8	22	For I would have been ashamed to ask the king for a detachment of soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies along the road , since we had said to the king , “ The hand of our God is on all who seek him , for good ; but his power and fury is against all who abandon him. ”
CJB	Ezra	8	23	So we fasted and asked our God for this , and he answered our prayer .
CJB	Ezra	8	24	Then I separated twelve of the chief cohanim , along with Sherevyah , Hashavyah and ten of their kinsmen .
CJB	Ezra	8	25	I weighed out to them the silver , the gold and the utensils for the house of our God contributed by the king , his counselors , his princes and all Isra ’ el present there .
CJB	Ezra	8	26	I weighed out and handed over to them twenty-one-and-a-half tons of silver , three-and-a-third tons of silver articles , three-and-a-third tons of gold ,
CJB	Ezra	8	27	twenty gold bowls weighing twenty-one pounds , and two vessels of fine burnished bronze as precious as gold .
CJB	Ezra	8	29	Guard them carefully , until you weigh them before the chief cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im and the leaders of the fathers ’ clans in Yerushalayim , in the rooms of the house of Adonai. ”
CJB	Ezra	8	30	So the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im received the consignment of silver and gold and the articles to bring to Yerushalayim , to the house of our God .
CJB	Ezra	8	31	On the twelfth day of the first month , we left the Ahava River to go to Yerushalayim . The hand of our God was on us , and he protected us from enemies and surprise attacks along the road .
CJB	Ezra	8	32	In time , we arrived at Yerushalayim , where we rested for three days .
CJB	Ezra	8	33	On the fourth day , the silver , gold and articles were weighed in the house of our God and handed over to M ’ remot the son of Uriyah the cohen ; with him was El ‘ azar the son of Pinchas ; and with them were Yozavad the son of Yeshua and No ‘ adyah the son of Binui , who were L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	Ezra	8	34	The entire consignment was numbered and weighed , and at the same time the total weight was recorded .
CJB	Ezra	8	35	The exiles who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Isra ’ el — twelve young bulls for all Isra ’ el , ninety-six rams , seventy-seven lambs , and twelve male goats as a sin offering ; all this was a burnt offering for Adonai .
CJB	Ezra	8	36	They also delivered the king ’ s orders to the king ’ s viceroys and governors beyond the [ Euphrates ] River ; and these gave their support to the people and to the house of God .
CJB	Ezra	9	9	For we are slaves . Yet our God has not abandoned us in our slavery , but has caused the kings of Persia to extend grace to us , reviving us , so that we can rebuild the house of our God , repair its ruins , and have a wall of defense in Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezra	9	2	They have taken some of the women from these nations as wives for themselves and their sons , so that the holy seed has assimilated to the peoples of the lands ; moreover , the officials and leaders have been the main offenders in this treachery. ”
CJB	Ezra	9	3	When I heard this , I tore my robe and tunic , pulled hair from my head and beard , and sat down in shock .
CJB	Ezra	9	4	All who trembled at the words of the God of Isra ’ el assembled around me when confronted with the treachery of these exiles ; and I sat there in shock until the evening offering .
CJB	Ezra	9	5	At the evening offering , with my cloak and tunic torn , I got up from afflicting myself , fell on my knees , spread out my hands to Adonai my God ,
CJB	Ezra	9	6	and said , “ My God , I am ashamed . I blush to lift my face to you , my God ! For our sins tower over our heads ; our guilt reaches up to heaven .
CJB	Ezra	9	7	Since the times of our ancestors , we have been deeply guilty ; and because of our sins , we , our kings and our cohanim have been handed over to the kings of the lands , to the sword , to exile , to pillage and to disgrace , as is the case today .
CJB	Ezra	9	8	Now , for a brief moment , Adonai our God has shown us the favor of allowing a remnant to escape and giving us a secure foothold in his holy place , in order for God to make things look brighter to us and revive us a little in our slavery .
CJB	Ezra	9	10	“ But now , our God , what are we to say after this ? For we have abandoned your mitzvot ,
CJB	Ezra	9	11	which you gave us through your servants the prophets when they said , ‘ The land which you are going to in order to take possession of it is a land defiled by the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands , because of their disgusting practices , which have filled it with their filth from one end to the other .
CJB	Ezra	9	12	Therefore , you are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons ; and you are not to promote their peace or prosperity ever . Only in this way will you grow strong , enjoy the good things of the land and leave it as a lasting inheritance to your children. ’
CJB	Ezra	9	13	Now , after all that has come upon us because of our evil deeds and our deep guilt — and even so , you , our God , have punished us less than our sins deserve and have given us a surviving remnant —
CJB	Ezra	9	14	are we to break your mitzvot again by making marriages with the peoples who have these disgusting practices ? Won ’ t you become so angry with us that you would destroy us completely , so that there would be no surviving remnant and no one who escapes ?
CJB	Ezra	9	15	Adonai , God of Isra ’ el ! You are just ; yet we have been left a surviving remnant that has escaped , as is the case today . Look , we are before you in our guilt ; because of it , no one can stand in your presence . ”
CJB	Ezra	10	10	‘ Ezra the cohen stood up and addressed them : “ You have acted treacherously by marrying foreign women and have thus increased Isra ’ el ’ s guilt .
CJB	Ezra	10	2	Sh ’ khanyah the son of Yechi ’ el , one of the descendants of ‘ Eilam , spoke up and said to ‘ Ezra , “ We have acted treacherously toward our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples of the land . But in spite of this , there is still hope for Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezra	10	3	We should make a covenant with our God to send away all these wives , along with their children , in obedience to the advice of Adonai and of those who tremble at the mitzvah of our God ; let us act in accordance with the Torah .
CJB	Ezra	10	4	Stand up , and do your duty , for we are with you ; take courage , and do it ! ”
CJB	Ezra	10	5	‘ Ezra stood up , and he made the chief cohanim , the L ’ vi ’ im and all Isra ’ el swear that they would act according to what had been said ; and they took the oath .
CJB	Ezra	10	6	‘ Ezra then left his place in front of the house of God and went to the room of Y ’ hochanan the son of Elyashiv . After going there , he neither ate food nor drank water ; because he was mourning over the treachery of the exiles .
CJB	Ezra	10	7	A proclamation was issued throughout Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim that all the exiles were to assemble in Yerushalayim ;
CJB	Ezra	10	8	and that whoever didn ’ t come within three days , in answer to the summons from the officials and leaders , would forfeit all he owned and himself be banished from the community of the exiles .
CJB	Ezra	10	9	All the men of Y ’ hudah and Binyamin assembled in Yerushalayim within the three days . It was the twentieth day of the ninth month . All the people sat in the open place in front of the house of God , trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain .
CJB	Ezra	10	11	Now , therefore , make confession to Adonai , the God of your ancestors ; and do what will please him by separating yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women. ”
CJB	Ezra	10	12	In response , the whole assembly cried aloud , “ Yes , our duty is to do as you have said .
CJB	Ezra	10	13	But there are many people , and it ’ s the rainy season — we can ’ t stay out here in the open . Also , it isn ’ t the work of a day or two ; for there are many of us who have committed this crime .
CJB	Ezra	10	14	Let our leaders represent the whole community ; and let all those in our cities who have married foreign women appear at prearranged times , accompanied by the elders and judges of each city ; until our God ’ s fierce anger over this has been turned away from us. ”
CJB	Ezra	10	15	Only Yonatan the son of ‘ Asah ’ el and Yachz ’ yah the son of Tikvah , supported by Meshulam and Shabtai the Levi , opposed this .
CJB	Ezra	10	16	The exiles did as agreed . ‘ Ezra the cohen chose heads of fathers ’ clans by name , and they began their sessions to look into the matter on the first day of the tenth month .
CJB	Ezra	10	17	They finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month .
CJB	Ezra	10	18	Among the cohanim were found these who had married foreign women : of the sons of Yeshua the son of Yotzadak and his brothers : Ma ‘ aseiyah , Eli ‘ ezer , Yariv and G ’ dalyah .
CJB	Ezra	10	19	They promised that they would send their wives away ; and since they were guilty , they offered a ram from the flock for their guilt .
CJB	Ezra	10	20	Of the sons of Immer : Hanani and Z ’ vadyah ;
CJB	Ezra	10	21	of the sons of Harim : Ma ‘ aseiyah , Eliyah , Sh ’ ma ‘ yah , Yechi ’ el and ‘ Uziyah ;

CJB	Ezra	10	43	of the descendants of N ’ vo : Ye ‘ i ’ el , Mattityah , Zavad , Z ’ vina , Yadai , Yo ’ el and B ’ nayah .
CJB	Ezra	10	44	All these had taken foreign wives , and some of them had wives by whom they had had children .
CJB	Nehemiah	1	1	The words of Nechemyah the son of Hakhalyah : It was in the month of Kislev , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the capital ,
CJB	Nehemiah	1	2	that Hanani , one of my kinsmen , came out of Y ’ hudah with some men ; and I asked them about the remnant of Judeans who had escaped the exile , and about Yerushalayim .
CJB	Nehemiah	1	3	They answered me , “ The remnant of the exile left there in the province are in great distress and are held in contempt , the wall of Yerushalayim is in ruins , and its gates have been completely burned up. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	1	4	On hearing this answer , I sat down and wept ; I mourned for several days , fasting and praying before the God of heaven .
CJB	Nehemiah	1	5	I said , “ Please , Adonai ! God of heaven ! You great and fearsome God , who keeps his covenant and extends grace to those who love him and observe his mitzvot !
CJB	Nehemiah	1	6	Let your ear now be attentive and your eyes be open , so that you will listen to the prayer of your servant , which I am praying before you these days , day and night , for the people of Isra ’ el your servants — even as I confess the sins of the people of Isra ’ el that we have committed against you . Yes , I and my father ’ s house have sinned .
CJB	Nehemiah	1	7	We have deeply offended you . We haven ’ t observed the mitzvot , laws or rulings you ordered your servant Moshe .
CJB	Nehemiah	1	8	Remember , please , the word you gave through your servant Moshe , ‘ If you break faith , I will scatter you among the peoples ;
CJB	Nehemiah	1	9	but if you return to me , observe my mitzvot and obey them , then , even if your scattered ones are in the most distant part of heaven , nevertheless , I will collect them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen for bearing my name. ’
CJB	Nehemiah	1	10	Now these are your servants , your people , whom you have redeemed by your great power and strong hand .
CJB	Nehemiah	1	11	Adonai , please , let your ear now be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take joy in fearing your name : please let your servant succeed today and win this man ’ s compassion ” — for I was the king ’ s personal attendant .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	2	The king asked , “ Why do you look so sad ? You ’ re not sick , so this must be some deep inner grief. ” At this , I became very fearful ,
CJB	Nehemiah	2	3	as I said to the king , “ May the king live forever ! Why shouldn ’ t I look sad , when the city , the place where my ancestors ’ tombs are , lies in ruins ; and its gates are completely burned up ? ”
CJB	Nehemiah	2	4	The king asked me , “ What is it that you want ? ” I prayed to the God of heaven ,
CJB	Nehemiah	2	5	then said to the king , “ If it pleases the king , if your servant has won your favor , send me to Y ’ hudah , to the city of my ancestors ’ tombs , so that I can rebuild it. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	2	6	With the queen sitting next to him , the king asked me , “ How long is your trip going to take ? When will you return ? ” So it pleased the king to send me , and I gave him a time .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	7	I then said to the king , “ If it pleases the king , have letters given to me for the governors of the territory beyond the [ Euphrates ] River , so that they will let me pass through until I reach Y ’ hudah ;
CJB	Nehemiah	2	8	and also a letter for Asaf the supervisor of the royal forests , so that he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress belonging to the house , for the city wall and for the house I will be occupying. ” The king gave me these , according to the good hand of my God on me .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	9	I went to the governors of the territory beyond the River and gave them the king ’ s letters . The king had sent with me an escort of army captains and cavalry .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	10	When Sanvalat the Horoni and Toviyah the servant , the ‘ Amoni , heard about this , they were very displeased that someone had come to promote the welfare of the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	11	So I reached Yerushalayim . After I had been there for three days ,
CJB	Nehemiah	2	12	I got up during the night , I and a few men with me . I hadn ’ t told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Yerushalayim ; and I didn ’ t take any animal with me except the animal on which I was riding .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	13	I went out by night through the Valley Gate , to the Dragon ’ s Well and the Dung Gate , and inspected the places where the walls of Yerushalayim were broken down and where its gates had been burned down .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	14	Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King ’ s Pool , but there was no room for the animal under me to pass .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	15	So I went up the valley in the dark and went on inspecting the wall ; then I turned back , entered through the Valley Gate and returned ,
CJB	Nehemiah	2	16	without the officials ’ knowing where I had gone or what I had done . Till then , I hadn ’ t said anything about this to the Judeans , cohanim , nobles , officials or anyone who would be responsible for the work .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	17	Afterwards , I said to them , “ You see what a sad state we are in , how Yerushalayim lies in ruins , with it gates burned up . Come , let ’ s rebuild the wall of Yerushalayim , so that we won ’ t continue in disgrace. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	2	18	I also told them of the gracious hand of my God that had been on me , also what the king had said to me . They said , “ Let ’ s start building at once , ” and energetically set out to do this good work .
CJB	Nehemiah	2	19	When Sanvalat the Horoni , Toviyah the servant , the ‘ Amoni , and Geshem the Arab heard about it , they began mocking us and jeering , “ What is this you are doing ? Are you going to rebel against the king ? ”
CJB	Nehemiah	2	20	But I answered them : “ The God of heaven will enable us to succeed . Therefore we his servants will set about rebuilding . But you have no share , right or history to commemorate in Yerushalayim . ”

CJB	Nehemiah	3	32	Finally , between the upper room at the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs .
CJB	Nehemiah	3	33	( 4:1 ) But when Sanvalat heard that we were rebuilding the wall , he was furious . Greatly enraged , he ridiculed the Judeans ;
CJB	Nehemiah	3	34	( 4:2 ) before his kinsmen and the army of Shomron he said , “ What are these pathetic Judeans doing ? Are they going to rebuild anything they want ? Are they going to sacrifice ? Are they going to finish today ? Are they going to recover useful stones from the piles of rubble , burned rubble at that ? ”
CJB	Nehemiah	3	35	( 4:3 ) Toviyah the ‘ Amoni was with him , and he said , “ Whatever they ’ re building , why , if even a fox went up it , he ’ d knock their stone wall down ! ”
CJB	Nehemiah	3	36	( 4:4 ) Our God , listen ! We are being treated with contempt . Turn back their jeers on their own heads ; give them over to be plundered in a land of exile .
CJB	Nehemiah	3	37	( 4:5 ) Don ’ t cover their guilt , don ’ t let their sin be wiped out from before you ; because they have insulted the builders to their face .
CJB	Nehemiah	3	38	( 4:6 ) So we kept building the wall , which was soon joined together and completed to half its height all the way around ; because the people worked with a will .

CJB	Nehemiah	4	18	) As for the construction-workers , each one had his sword sheathed at his side ; that is how they built . The man to sound the alarm on the shofar stayed with me .
CJB	Nehemiah	4	19	) I said to the nobles , the leaders and the rest of the people , “ This is a great work , and it is spread out ; we are separated on the wall , one far from another .
CJB	Nehemiah	4	20	) But wherever you are , when you hear the sound of the shofar , come to that place , to us . Our God will fight for us ! ”
CJB	Nehemiah	4	21	) So we kept doing the work . Half of them held spears from daybreak until the stars appeared .
CJB	Nehemiah	4	22	) Also at that time I told the people , “ Let everyone with a servant stay the night within Yerushalayim , so that at night they can be a guard for us , even as they work during the day. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	4	23	) I , my kinsmen , my servants and my bodyguards never took off our clothes , and everyone who went to get water took his weapon .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	5	Now our flesh is no different from the flesh of our kinsmen , and our children are the same as their children ; yet we are bringing our sons and daughters into bondage as slaves . Some of our daughters have gone into slavery already , and it ’ s beyond our power to do anything about it , because other men have our fields and vineyards. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	5	2	Some of them said , “ Counting our sons and daughters , there are a lot of us ! Allow us to get grain for them , so that we can eat and stay alive. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	5	3	There were also some who said , “ We are mortgaging our fields , vineyards and homes in order to buy grain , because of the famine. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	5	4	Yet others said , “ We have borrowed money for the king ’ s taxes against our fields and vineyards .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	6	When I heard their outcry and the reasons for it , I became very angry .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	7	I thought the matter over and then took issue with the nobles and rulers . I charged them , “ You are lending against pledges , everyone to his brother ” ; and I summoned a great assembly to deal with them .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	8	I said to them , “ We , to the limit of our ability , have redeemed our brothers the Judeans who sold themselves to the pagans . Now you are selling your own brothers , and we will have to buy them back ! ” They stayed silent ; they couldn ’ t think of anything to say .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	9	I also said , “ What you are doing is not good ! You should be living in fear of our God , so that our pagan enemies won ’ t have grounds for deriding us .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	10	Moreover , my brothers and my servants , I too have loaned them money and grain . Please , let ’ s stop making it so burdensome to go into debt .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	11	Please ! Today ! Give them back their fields , vineyards , olive groves and homes ; also the hundred pieces of silver and the grain , wine and olive oil you demand from them as interest. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	5	12	They answered , “ We will give it back . We will require nothing from them . Yes , we will do it , just as you say. ” Then I called the cohanim and took an oath from them that they would do as they had promised .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	13	Shaking out the fold in my garment , I said , “ May God thus shake every man from his house and from his work who fails to live up to this promise — may he be shaken out like this and made empty. ” The whole assembly said , “ Amen ! ” and praised Adonai ; and the people did as they had promised .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	14	Besides that , from the time I was appointed their governor in the land of Y ’ hudah , from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of Artach ’ shashta the king — that is , for twelve years — neither I nor my colleagues drew on the governor ’ s living allowance .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	15	The earlier governors , before me , had burdened the people , taxing them more than one-and-a-half pounds of silver shekels for food and wine ; and even their servants lorded it over the people . But I didn ’ t , because I feared God .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	16	Moreover , I put all my energy into working on this wall . We didn ’ t buy any land , and all my servants were gathered there for the work .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	17	There were
CJB	Nehemiah	5	150	leaders and other Judeans who ate at my table , besides those who came to us from the surrounding nations .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	18	Every day one ox , six choice sheep , and fowl were prepared for me , and every ten days a supply of all kinds of wine . Yet in spite of all this , I never claimed the governor ’ s allowance , because the people were already bearing the heavy burden of their labor .
CJB	Nehemiah	5	19	My God , remember favorably everything I have done for this people !
CJB	Nehemiah	6	6	in which was written : “ It is reported among the nations , and Geshem says it too , that you and the Judeans are planning a revolt , that this is why you are rebuilding the wall , and that you intend to be their king , ” and similar words ;
CJB	Nehemiah	6	2	Sanvalat and Geshem sent me a message which said , “ Come , let ’ s meet together in one of the villages of the Ono Valley. ” But they were planning to do me harm ;
CJB	Nehemiah	6	3	so I sent them messengers with this message : “ I ’ m too busy with important work to come down . Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you ? ”
CJB	Nehemiah	6	4	They kept sending this sort of message to me — four times — and I answered them the same way .
CJB	Nehemiah	6	5	The fifth time , with the same purpose , Sanvalat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand ,
CJB	Nehemiah	6	7	“ moreover , that you have also appointed prophets to proclaim about you in Yerushalayim , ‘ There is a king in Y ’ hudah ! ’ A report along these lines is now going to be made to the king . Come now , therefore , and let ’ s discuss this. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	6	8	I sent him this answer ; “ Nothing like what you are saying is being done . You ’ re making it all up in your head. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	6	9	They were all just trying to scare us , thinking , “ This will sap their strength and keep them from working. ” But now , [ God , ] increase my strength !
CJB	Nehemiah	6	10	One day , when I went to the house of Sh ’ ma ‘ yah the son of D ’ layah , the son of M ’ heitav ’ el , where he was confined , he said , “ Let ’ s meet together in the house of God , inside the temple , and let ’ s shut the doors of the temple . For they are going to come and try to assassinate you ; yes , they will come at night to kill you. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	6	11	I replied , “ Should a man like me run away ? Can a man like me go into the temple to save his life ? I refuse to go in. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	6	12	Then I realized that God had not sent him , that he was making this prophecy against me , and that Toviyah and Sanvalat had bribed him to say it .
CJB	Nehemiah	6	13	He had been hired to frighten me into following his suggestion and thus sin , so that they would have material for their unfavorable report about me and could taunt me with it .
CJB	Nehemiah	6	14	My God , remember Toviyah and Sanvalat according to their deeds , also the prophet No ‘ adyah and the other prophets trying to intimidate me .
CJB	Nehemiah	6	15	So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul , in fifty-two days .
CJB	Nehemiah	6	16	When all our enemies heard about it and the surrounding nations became afraid , our enemies ’ self-esteem fell severely ; because they realized that this work had been accomplished by our God .
CJB	Nehemiah	6	17	During this same period of time , the nobles of Y ’ hudah sent many letters to Toviyah , and Toviyah kept sending them replies .
CJB	Nehemiah	6	18	For there were many in Y ’ hudah who had sworn allegiance to him , because he was the son-in-law of Sh ’ khanyah the son of Arach , and his son Y ’ hochanan had taken as his wife the daughter of Meshulam the son of Berekhyah .
CJB	Nehemiah	6	19	They would even praise his good deeds in my presence , and they passed on my words to him . And Toviyah kept sending letters to intimidate me .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	7	they went with Z ’ rubavel , Yeshua , Nechemyah , ‘ Azaryah , Ra ‘ amyah , Nachmani , Mordekhai , Bilshan , Misperet , Bigvai , N ’ chum and Ba ‘ anah . “ The number of men from the people of Isra ’ el : |8 descendants of Par ‘ osh||2,172| |9 descendants of Sh ’ fatyah||372| |10 descendants of Arach||652| |11 descendants of Pachat-Mo ’ av , | |from the descendants of Yeshua and Yo ’ av||2,818| |12 descendants of ‘ Eilam||1,254| |13 descendants of Zatu||845| |14 descendants of Zakkai||760| |15 descendants of Binui||648| |16 descendants of B ’ vai||628| |17 descendants of ‘ Azgad||2,322| |18 descendants of Adonikam||667| |19 descendants of Bigvai||2,067| |20 descendants of ‘ Adin||655| |21 descendants of Ater , of Y ’ chizkiyah||98| |22 descendants of Hashum||328| |23 descendants of Betzai||324| |24 descendants of Harif||112| |25 descendants of Giv ‘ on||95| |26 people of Beit-Lechem and N ’ tofah||188| |27 people of ‘ Anatot||128| |28 people of Beit- ‘ Azmavet||42| |29 people of Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim , K ’ firah and Be ’ erot||743| |30 people of Ramah and Geva||621| |31 people of Mikhmas||122| |32 people of Beit-El and ‘ Ai||123| |33 people from the other N ’ vo||52| |34 people from the other ‘ Eilam||1,254| |35 descendants of Harim||320| |36 descendants of Yericho||345| |37 descendants of Lod , Hadid and Ono||721| |38 descendants of S ’ na ’ ah||3,930|
CJB	Nehemiah	7	2	I put my kinsman Hanani in charge of Yerushalayim , along with Hananyah the commander of the citadel . For he was a faithful man , and he feared God more than most .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	3	I said to them , “ The gates of Yerushalayim are not to be opened until the sun is hot ; and while the gatekeepers are still on duty , have them shut the doors ; and you , put up the bars . Appoint watchmen from among those living in Yerushalayim ; assign each one his time to guard , and have each one serving near his own house. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	7	4	The city was large and spacious , but there were few people in it , and the houses had not been rebuilt .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	5	My God put it in my heart to assemble the nobles , the leaders and the people , so that they could be registered according to their genealogies . I located the record of the genealogies of those who had come up at the beginning and found written in it :
CJB	Nehemiah	7	6	“ Here is a list of the people of the province who had been exiled , carried off to Bavel by N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel , but who later returned from exile and went up to Yerushalayim and Y ’ hudah , each to his own city ;
CJB	Nehemiah	7	39	“ The cohanim : |descendants of Y ’ da ‘ yah , of the house of Yeshua||973| |40 descendants of Immer||1,052| |41 descendants of Pash ’ chur||1,247| |42 descendants of Harim||1,017|

CJB	Nehemiah	7	61	“ The following went up from Tel-Melach , Tel-Harsha , K ’ ruv , Adon and Immer ; but they could not state which fathers ’ clan they and their children belonged to , [ so it was not clear ] whether they were from Isra ’ el : |62 descendants of D ’ layah , | |descendants of Toviyah , and| |descendants of N ’ koda||642|
CJB	Nehemiah	7	63	and of the cohanim : |descendants of Havayah , | |descendants of Hakotz , and| descendants of Barzillai , who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gil ‘ adi and was named after them .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	64	“ These tried to locate their geneaolgical records , but they weren ’ t found . Therefore they were considered defiled and were not allowed to serve as cohanim .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	65	The Tirshata told them not to eat any of the especially holy food until a cohen appeared who could consult the urim and tumim .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	66	“ The entire assembly numbered 42,360 ,
CJB	Nehemiah	7	67	not including their male and female slaves , of whom there were 7,337 . They also had
CJB	Nehemiah	7	245	; *
CJB	Nehemiah	7	68	Their horses numbered
CJB	Nehemiah	7	736	; their mules ,
CJB	Nehemiah	7	69	their camels ,
CJB	Nehemiah	7	435	; and their donkeys , 6,720 .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	70	“ Some from among the heads of fathers ’ clans made contributions for the work . The Tirshata contributed to the treasury a thousand gold darkmonim [ twenty-one pounds ] , fifty basins and
CJB	Nehemiah	7	530	tunics for the cohanim .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	71	Some of the heads of fathers ’ clans gave into the treasury for the work 20,000 gold darkmonim [
CJB	Nehemiah	7	420	pounds ] and 2,200 silver manim [ one-and-a-third tons ] .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	72	The rest of the people gave 20,000 gold darkmonim , 2,000 silver manim [ about one-and-a-quarter tons ] and sixty-seven tunics for the cohanim .
CJB	Nehemiah	7	73	“ So the cohanim , the L ’ vi ’ im , the gatekeepers , the singers , some of the people , the temple servants and all Isra ’ el lived in their towns. ” ( 8:1 ) When the seventh month arrived , after the people of Isra ’ el had resettled in their towns ,
CJB	Nehemiah	8	8	They read clearly from the scroll , in the Torah of God , translated it , and enabled them to understand the sense of what was being read .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	2	‘ Ezra the cohen brought the Torah before the assembly , which consisted of men , women and all children old enough to understand . It was the first day of the seventh month .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	3	Facing the open space in front of the Water Gate , he read from it to the men , the women and the children who could understand from early morning until noon ; and all the people listened attentively to the scroll of the Torah .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	4	‘ Ezra the Torah-teacher stood on a wood platform which they had made for the purpose ; beside him on his right stood Mattityah , Shema , ‘ Anayah , Uriyah , Hilkiyah and Ma ‘ aseiyah ; while on his left were P ’ dayah , Misha ’ el , Malkiyah , Hashum , Hashbadanah , Z ’ kharyah and Meshulam .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	5	‘ Ezra opened the scroll where all the people could see him , because he was higher than all the people ; when he opened it , all the people rose to their feet .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	6	‘ Ezra blessed Adonai , the great God ; and all the people answered , “ Amen ! Amen ! ” as they lifted up their hands , bowed their heads and fell prostrate before Adonai with their faces to the ground .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	7	The L ’ vi ’ im Yeshua , Bani , Sherevyah , Yamin , ‘ Akuv , Shabtai , Hodiyah , Ma ‘ aseiyah , K ’ lita , ‘ Azaryah , Yozavad , Hanan and P ’ layah explained the Torah to the people , while the people remained in their places .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	9	Nechemyah the Tirshata , ‘ Ezra the cohen and Torah-teacher and the L ’ vi ’ im who taught the people said to all the people , “ Today is consecrated to Adonai your God ; don ’ t be mournful , don ’ t weep. ” For all the people had been weeping when they heard the words of the Torah .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	10	Then he said to them , “ Go , eat rich food , drink sweet drinks , and send portions to those who can ’ t provide for themselves ; for today is consecrated to our Lord . Don ’ t be sad , because the joy of Adonai is your strength. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	8	11	In this way the L ’ vi ’ im quieted the people , as they said , “ Be quiet , for today is holy ; don ’ t be sad. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	8	12	Then the people went off to eat , drink , send portions and celebrate ; because they had understood the words that had been proclaimed to them .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	13	On the second day , the heads of fathers ’ clans of all the people assembled with the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im before ‘ Ezra the Torah-teacher to study the words of the Torah .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	14	They found written in the Torah that Adonai had ordered through Moshe that the people of Isra ’ el were to live in sukkot during the feast of the seventh month ;
CJB	Nehemiah	8	15	and that they were to announce and pass the word in all their cities and in Yerushalayim , “ Go out to the mountains , and collect branches of olives , wild olives , myrtles , palms , and other leafy trees to make sukkot , as prescribed. ”
CJB	Nehemiah	8	16	So the people went out , brought them and made sukkot for themselves , each one on the roof of his house , also in their courtyards , in the courtyards of the house of God , in the open space by the Water Gate and in the open space by the Efrayim Gate .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	17	The entire community of those who had returned from the exile made sukkot and lived in the sukkot , for the people of Isra ’ el had not done this since the days of Yeshua the son of Nun . So there was very great joy .
CJB	Nehemiah	8	18	Also they read every day , from the first day until the last day , in the scroll of the Torah of God . They kept the feast for seven days ; then on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly , according to the rule .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	9	“ ‘ You saw the distress of our ancestors in Egypt and heard their cry by the Sea of Suf .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	2	Those descended from Isra ’ el separated themselves from all foreigners ; then they stood up and confessed their own sins and the iniquities of their ancestors .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	3	Standing where they were , they read in the scroll of the Torah of Adonai their God for one-quarter of the day . For another quarter they confessed and prostrated themselves before Adonai their God .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	4	On the platform of the L ’ vi ’ im stood Yeshua , Bani , Kadmi ’ el , Sh ’ vanyah , Buni , Sherevyah , Bani and K ’ nani ; they cried out loudly to Adonai their God .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	5	Then the L ’ vi ’ im Yeshua , Kadmi ’ el , Bani , Hashavn ’ yah , Sherevyah , Hodiyah , Sh ’ vanyah and P ’ tachyah said , “ Stand up , and bless Adonai your God from everlasting to everlasting ; let them say : “ ‘ Blessed be your glorious name , exalted above all blessing and praise !
CJB	Nehemiah	9	6	“ ‘ You are Adonai , you alone . You made heaven , the heaven of heavens , with all their array , the earth and all the things that are in it , the seas and all that is in them ; and you preserve them all . The army of heaven worships you .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	7	“ ‘ You are Adonai , the God who chose Avram , brought him out of Ur-Kasdim and gave him the name of Avraham .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	8	Finding that he was faithful to you , you made a covenant with him to give the land of the Kena ‘ ani , the Hitti , Emori and P ’ rizi , the Y ’ vusi and the Girgashi , to give it to his descendants ; and you have done what you promised , because you are just .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	10	You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh , against all his servants and the people of the land ; for you knew how arrogantly they treated them ; and you won yourself a name which is yours to this day .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	11	You divided the sea ahead of them , so that they could pass through the sea on dry land ; then you hurled their pursuers into the depths , like a stone into turbulent waters .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	12	“ ‘ In a column of cloud you led them by day , and by night in a column of fire , so that they would have light ahead of them on the way that they were to go .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	13	“ ‘ You descended on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven . You gave them right rulings and true teachings , good laws and mitzvot .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	14	You revealed to them your holy Shabbat and gave them mitzvot , laws and the Torah through Moshe your servant .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	15	“ ‘ For their hunger you gave them bread from heaven ; for their thirst you brought forth for them water from the rock . You ordered them to enter and possess the land you had sworn with your hand to give them .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	16	“ ‘ But they and our ancestors were arrogant ; they stiffened their necks and ignored your mitzvot ;
CJB	Nehemiah	9	17	they refused to listen and paid no attention to the wonders you had done among them . No , they stiffened their necks , and in their rebellion appointed a leader to return them to their slavery . But because you are a God of forgiveness , merciful , full of compassion , slow to grow angry and full of grace , you did not abandon them .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	18	Even when they cast themselves a metal calf , saying of it , “ This is your god that brought you up from Egypt , ” and committing other gross provocations ;
CJB	Nehemiah	9	19	still , you , in your great compassion , did not abandon them in the desert . The column of cloud did not leave them by day ; it kept leading them along the way . By night the column of fire kept showing them light and the path to take .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	20	You also gave your good Spirit to teach them , did not withhold man from their mouths and provided them water to quench their thirst .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	21	Yes , forty years you sustained them in the desert ; they lacked nothing — their clothes did not wear out ; their feet did not swell up .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	22	“ ‘ You gave them kingdoms and peoples ; you even gave them extra land , so that they took possession of the land of Sichon , also the land of the king of Heshbon and the land of ‘ Og king of Bashan .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	23	You made their children as numerous as the countless stars in the sky . “ ‘ Then you brought them into the land about which you had said to their fathers that they should go in and take possession of it .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	24	So the children went in and possessed the land , as you subdued ahead of them the Kena ‘ ani living in the land , and handed them over to them , along with their kings and the peoples of the land , for them to do with as they wished .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	25	They took fortified cities and fertile land , possessed houses full of all kinds of good things , dug-out cisterns , vineyards , olive groves , fruit trees in plenty ; so they ate their fill and grew robust , luxuriating in your great goodness .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	26	“ ‘ Yet they disobeyed and rebelled against you , throwing your Torah behind their backs . They killed your prophets for warning them that they should return to you and committed other gross provocations .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	27	So you handed them over to the power of their adversaries , who oppressed them . Yet in the time of their trouble , when they cried out to you , you heard from heaven , and in keeping with your great compassion , you gave them saviors to save them from the power of their adversaries .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	28	But as soon as they had gotten some relief , they went back to do evil before you . So you left them in the power of their enemies , who came down hard on them . Yet when they returned and cried out to you , you heard from heaven many times and saved them , according to your compassion .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	29	You warned them , in order to bring them back to your Torah ; yet they were arrogant . They paid no attention to your mitzvot , but sinned against your rulings , which , if a person does them , he will have life through them . However , they stubbornly turned their shoulders , stiffened their necks and refused to hear .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	30	Many years you extended them mercy and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets ; yet they would not listen . Therefore you handed them over to the peoples of the lands .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	31	Even so , in your great compassion , you didn ’ t completely destroy them ; nor did you abandon them , for you are a compassionate and merciful God .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	32	“ ‘ Now therefore , our God , great , mighty , fearsome God , who keeps both covenant and grace : let not all this suffering seem little to you that has come on us , our kings , our leaders , our cohanim , our prophets , our ancestors , and on all your people , from the times of the kings of Ashur until this very day .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	33	There is no question that you are just in all that has come upon us ; for you have treated us fairly . It is we who have acted wickedly .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	34	Our kings , our leaders , our cohanim and ancestors did not keep your Torah , pay attention to your mitzvot or heed the warnings you gave them .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	35	Even when they ruled their own kingdom , even when you prospered them greatly , in the great , rich land you gave them , they did not serve you ; nor did they turn from their wicked deeds .
CJB	Nehemiah	9	36	“ ‘ So here we are today , slaves . Yes , in the land you gave our ancestors , so that they could eat what it produces and enjoy its good — here we are in it , slaves !
CJB	Nehemiah	9	37	Its rich yield now goes to the kings you have set over us because of our sins ; they have power over our bodies , they can do what they please to our livestock , and we are in great distress !

CJB	Nehemiah	12	30	The cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im first purified themselves ; then they purified the people , the gates and the wall ;
CJB	Nehemiah	12	31	and after that I brought the leaders of Y ’ hudah up onto the wall and appointed two large choirs to give thanks and to walk in procession . One went to the right on the wall toward the Dung Gate .
CJB	Nehemiah	12	32	After them went Hosha ‘ yah and half of the leaders of Y ’ hudah ,

CJB	Nehemiah	12	37	At the Fountain Gate they went straight ahead up the steps to the City of David , where the wall goes up , passed above the house of David , and went on to the Water Gate on the east .
CJB	Nehemiah	12	38	The other thanksgiving choir , consisting of half the people , walked on the wall to meet them , with myself following . They went above the Tower of the Furnaces to the Broad Wall ,
CJB	Nehemiah	12	39	above the Efrayim Gate , by the gate to the Old City , to the Fish Gate , the Tower of Hanan ’ el and the Tower of the Hundred , as far as the Sheep Gate , and halted at the Prison Gate .
CJB	Nehemiah	12	40	Thus stood the two choirs of those giving thanks in the house of God , with myself and half of the leaders with me .
CJB	Nehemiah	12	41	The cohanim there included Elyakim , Ma ‘ aseiyah , Minyamin , Mikhayah , Elyo ‘ einai , Z ’ kharyah and Hananyah carrying trumpets ;
CJB	Nehemiah	12	42	also Ma ‘ aseiyah , Sh ’ ma ‘ yah , El ‘ azar , ‘ Uzi , Y ’ hochanan , Malkiyah , ‘ Eilam and ‘ Ezer . The singers sang loudly , directed by Yizrachyah .
CJB	Nehemiah	12	43	With joy they offered great sacrifices that day , for God had made them celebrate with great joy . The women and children too rejoiced , so that the celebrating in Yerushalayim could be heard far off .
CJB	Nehemiah	12	44	At that time , men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for supplies , contributions , firstfruits and tenths , and to gather into them , from the fields belonging to the cities , the portions prescribed by the Torah for the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im . For Y ’ hudah rejoiced over the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im who took their position
CJB	Nehemiah	12	45	carrying out the duties of their God and the duties of purification , as also did the singers and gatekeepers , in accordance with the order of David and of Shlomo his son .
CJB	Nehemiah	12	46	For back in the days of David and Asaf , there had been leaders for those singing the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God .
CJB	Nehemiah	12	47	So in the days of Z ’ rubavel and in the days of Nechemyah , all Isra ’ el gave portions to the singers and gatekeepers as required daily . They set aside a portion for the L ’ vi ’ im , who , in turn set aside a portion for the descendants of Aharon .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	13	To supervise the storerooms I appointed Shelemyah the cohen , Tzadok the Torah-teacher and , from the L ’ vi ’ im , P ’ dayah ; assisting them was Hanan the son of Zakur , the son of Mattanyah ; for these were considered reliable . Their duty was to make the distribution to their kinsmen .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	2	because they did not supply the people of Isra ’ el with food and water , but hired Bil ‘ am against them to put a curse on them — although our God turned the curse into a blessing .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	3	On hearing the Torah , they separated from Isra ’ el everyone of mixed ancestry .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	4	Also , prior to this , Elyashiv the cohen , who had been put in charge of the storage rooms in the house of our God , and who was related by marriage to Toviyah ,
CJB	Nehemiah	13	5	had prepared for him a large room where formerly they had stored the grain offerings , frankincense , equipment and the tenths of grain , wine and olive oil ordered to be given to the L ’ vi ’ im , singers and gatekeepers , and the contributions for the cohanim .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	6	During all this time I wasn ’ t present in Yerushalayim ; because in the thirty-second year of Artach ’ shashta king of Bavel , I went to see the king ; then , after some time had passed , I asked permission from the king
CJB	Nehemiah	13	7	and returned to Yerushalayim , where I found out about the terrible thing Elyashiv had done for Toviyah by preparing a room for him in the courtyards of the house of our God .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	8	I was so furious that I threw all Toviyah ’ s household goods out of the room .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	9	Then , at my order , they cleansed the rooms ; and I brought back the equipment of the house of God , the grain offerings and frankincense .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	10	I also learned that the portions for the L ’ vi ’ im had not been given to them , so that the L ’ vi ’ im and singers who were supposed to be doing the work had deserted , each one to his own farm .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	11	I disputed with the leaders , demanding , “ Why is the house of God abandoned ? ” I gathered the L ’ vi ’ im together and restored them to their stations ;
CJB	Nehemiah	13	12	and then all Y ’ hudah brought the tenth of grain , wine and olive oil to the storerooms .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	14	My God , remember me for this ; don ’ t wipe out my good deeds which I have done for the house of my God and for his service !
CJB	Nehemiah	13	15	During this time I saw in Y ’ hudah some people who were treading winepresses on Shabbat , also bringing in heaps of grain and loading donkeys with it , likewise wine , grapes , figs and all kinds of loads ; and they were bringing them into Yerushalayim on the day of Shabbat . On the day when they were planning to sell the food , I warned them not to .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	16	There were also living there people from Tzor who brought in fish and all kinds of goods , and sold them on Shabbat to the people in Y ’ hudah and even in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	17	I disputed with the nobles of Y ’ hudah , demanding of them , “ What is this terrible thing you are doing , profaning the day of Shabbat ?
CJB	Nehemiah	13	18	Didn ’ t your ancestors do this , and didn ’ t our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city ? Yet you are bringing still more fury against Isra ’ el by profaning Shabbat ! ”
CJB	Nehemiah	13	19	So when the gates of Yerushalayim began to grow dark before Shabbat , I ordered that the doors be shut ; and I ordered that they not be reopened until after Shabbat . I put some of my servants in charge of the gates , to see to it that no loads be brought in on Shabbat .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	20	The merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Yerushalayim once or twice ,
CJB	Nehemiah	13	21	until I warned them , “ Why are you spending the night by the wall ? Do it again , and I ’ ll use force against you ! ” From then on they stopped coming on Shabbat .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	22	Then I ordered the L ’ vi ’ im to purify themselves and come and guard the gates , in order to keep the day of Shabbat holy . My God , remember this too for me , and have mercy on me in keeping with the greatness of your grace !
CJB	Nehemiah	13	23	Also during this time I saw the Judeans who had married women from Ashdod , ‘ Amon and Mo ’ av ;
CJB	Nehemiah	13	24	and their children , who spoke half in the language of Ashdod and couldn ’ t speak in the language the Judeans spoke but only in the language of each people .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	25	I disputed with them and cursed them , and I beat some of them up and pulled out their hair . Then I made them swear by God , “ You will not give your daughters as wives for their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	26	Wasn ’ t it by doing these things that Shlomo king of Isra ’ el sinned ? There was no king like him among many nations , and his God loved him , and God made him king over all Isra ’ el ; nevertheless the foreign women caused even him to sin .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	27	Are we to give in to you and let you continue in this very great evil , breaking faith with our God by marrying foreign women ? ”
CJB	Nehemiah	13	28	One of the sons of Yoyada the son of Elyashiv , the cohen hagadol , had become son-in-law to Sanvalat the Horoni ; so I drove him out of my presence .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	29	My God , remember them ; because they have defiled the office of cohen and the covenant of the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	30	Thus I cleansed them of everything foreign , and I had the cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im resume their duties , each one in his appointed task .
CJB	Nehemiah	13	31	I also made provision for the delivery of wood at stated times , and for the firstfruits . My God , remember me favorably .
CJB	Esther	1	1	These events took place in the time of Achashverosh , the Achashverosh who ruled over
CJB	Esther	1	127	provinces from India to Ethiopia .
CJB	Esther	1	2	It was in those days , when King Achashverosh sat on his royal throne in Shushan the capital ,
CJB	Esther	1	3	in the third year of his reign , that he gave a banquet for all his officials and courtiers . The army of Persia and Media , the nobles and the provincial officials were in attendance .
CJB	Esther	1	4	He displayed the dazzling wealth of his kingdom and his great splendor for a long time ,
CJB	Esther	1	180	days .
CJB	Esther	1	5	At the end of that time , the king gave a seven-day banquet in the courtyard of the royal palace garden for all the people , both great and small , there in Shushan the capital .
CJB	Esther	1	6	There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings fastened to silver rods , with cords of fine linen and purple ; the columns were marble ; the couches [ for reclining at table ] were of gold and silver on a mosaic flooring of malachite , marble , mother-of-pearl and onyx .
CJB	Esther	1	7	Drinks were served in gold goblets , with each goblet different from the others . There was royal wine in abundance , as befits royal bounty .
CJB	Esther	1	8	The drinking was not according to any fixed rule , for the king had ordered the stewards to serve each man what he wanted .
CJB	Esther	1	9	Also Vashti the queen gave a banquet for the women in the royal house belonging to King Achashverosh .
CJB	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day , when the king was in high spirits from the wine , he ordered Mehuman , Bizta , Harvona , Bigta , Avagta , Zetar and Karkas , the seven officers who attended him ,
CJB	Esther	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king with the royal crown , in order to show the people and the officials her beauty , for she was indeed a good-looking woman .
CJB	Esther	1	12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the order of the king , which he had sent through his officers . This enraged the king — his anger blazed inside him .
CJB	Esther	1	13	As was the king ’ s custom , he consulted sages well-versed in matters of law and justice .
CJB	Esther	1	14	With him were Karshna , Shetar , Admata , Tarshish , Meres , Marsna and Memukhan , the seven vice-regents of Persia and Media , who were part of the king ’ s inner circle and were the most important officials in the kingdom .
CJB	Esther	1	15	[ The king asked the sages , ] “ According to the law , what should we do to Queen Vashti , since she didn ’ t obey the order of King Achashverosh conveyed by the officers ? ”
CJB	Esther	1	16	Memukhan presented the king and vice-regents this answer : “ Vashti the queen has wronged not only the king , but also all the officials and all the peoples in all the provinces of King Achashverosh ;
CJB	Esther	1	17	because this act of the queen ’ s will become known to all the women , who will then start showing disrespect toward their own husbands ; they will say , ‘ King Achashverosh ordered Vashti the queen to be brought before him , but she wouldn ’ t come. ’
CJB	Esther	1	18	Moreover , the noble ladies of Persia and Media who hear of the queen ’ s conduct will mention it to all the king ’ s officials , which will bring about no end of disrespect and discord .
CJB	Esther	1	19	If it pleases his majesty , let him issue a royal decree — and let it be written as one of the laws of the Persians and Medes , which are irrevocable — that Vashti is never again to be admitted into the presence of King Achashverosh , and that the king give her royal position to someone better than she .
CJB	Esther	1	20	When the edict made by the king is proclaimed throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom , then all wives will honor their husbands , whether great or small. ”
CJB	Esther	1	21	This advice pleased the king and the officials , so the king did what Memukhan had suggested —
CJB	Esther	1	22	he sent letters to all the royal provinces , to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language , that every man should be master in his own house and speak the language of his own people .
CJB	Esther	2	2	The king ’ s servants attending him said , “ A search should be made for young , good-looking virgins .
CJB	Esther	2	3	The king should appoint officials in all the provinces of the kingdom to gather all the young , good-looking virgins to the house for the harem , in Shushan the capital . They should be put under the care of Hegai the king ’ s officer in charge of the women , and he should give them the cosmetics they require .
CJB	Esther	2	4	Then , the girl who seems best to the king should become queen instead of Vashti. ” This proposal pleased the king , so he acted accordingly .
CJB	Esther	2	5	There was in Shushan the capital a man who was a Jew , whose name was Mordekhai the son of Ya ’ ir , the son of Shim ‘ i , the son of Kish , a Binyamini .
CJB	Esther	2	6	He had been exiled from Yerushalayim with the captives exiled with Y ’ khanyah king of Y ’ hudah , whom N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel had carried off .
CJB	Esther	2	7	He had raised Hadassah , that is , Ester , his uncle ’ s daughter ; because she had neither father nor mother . The girl was shapely and good-looking ; after her father ’ s and mother ’ s death , Mordekhai had adopted her as his own daughter .
CJB	Esther	2	8	When the king ’ s order and decree were proclaimed , and many girls assembled in Shushan the capital under the care of Hegai , Ester too was taken into the king ’ s house and put under the care of Hegai , who was in charge of the women .
CJB	Esther	2	9	The girl pleased him and won his favor , so that he lost no time in giving her her cosmetics , her portions [ of special food ] and seven girls from the king ’ s palace to attend her ; he also promoted her and the girls attending her to the best place in the harem ’ s quarters .
CJB	Esther	2	10	Ester did not disclose her people or family ties , because Mordekhai had instructed her not to tell anyone .
CJB	Esther	2	11	Every day Mordekhai would walk around in front of the courtyard of the harem ’ s house in order to know how Ester was doing and what was happening to her .
CJB	Esther	2	12	Each girl had her turn to appear before King Achashverosh after she had undergone the full twelve-month preparation period prescribed for the women , consisting of a six-month treatment with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and other cosmetics for women .
CJB	Esther	2	13	Then , when the girl went to see the king , whatever she wanted would be given to her as she went from the harem ’ s house to the king ’ s palace .
CJB	Esther	2	14	She would go in the evening , and on the following day she would return to another part of the harem ’ s house and be under the care of Sha ‘ ashgaz the king ’ s officer in charge of the concubines . She would not go to the king again unless he was especially pleased with her and had her summoned by name .
CJB	Esther	2	15	When the turn came for Ester the daughter of Avichayil , whom Mordekhai had adopted as his own daughter , to appear before the king , she didn ’ t ask for anything other than what Hegai the king ’ s officer in charge of the harem advised . Yet Ester was admired by all who saw her .
CJB	Esther	2	16	She was brought to King Achashverosh in his royal palace in the tenth month , Tevet , during the seventh year of his reign .
CJB	Esther	2	17	The king liked Ester more than any of his wives ; none of the other virgins obtained such favor and approval from him . So he put the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti .
CJB	Esther	2	18	The king then gave a great banquet in Ester ’ s honor for all his officers and servants , decreed a holiday for the provinces and distributed gifts worthy of royal bounty .
CJB	Esther	2	19	When the girls would gather on other occasions , Mordekhai would sit at the King ’ s Gate .
CJB	Esther	2	20	Ester had not yet revealed her family ties or her people , as Mordekhai had ordered her ; for Ester continued obeying what Mordekhai told her to do , as she had when he was raising her .
CJB	Esther	2	21	On one of those occasions , when Mordekhai was sitting at the King ’ s Gate , two of the king ’ s officers , Bigtan and Teresh , from the group in charge of the private entryways , became angry and conspired to assassinate King Achashverosh .
CJB	Esther	2	22	But Mordekhai learned about it and told Ester the queen . Ester reported it to the king , crediting Mordekhai .
CJB	Esther	2	23	The matter was investigated , found to be true , and both were hanged on a stake . All this was recorded in the daily journal that was kept with the king .
CJB	Esther	3	3	The king ’ s servants at the King ’ s Gate asked Mordekhai , “ Why don ’ t you obey the king ’ s order ? ”
CJB	Esther	3	2	All the king ’ s servants at the King ’ s Gate would kneel and bow down before Haman , because the king had so ordered . But Mordekhai would neither kneel nor bow down to him .
CJB	Esther	3	4	But after they had confronted him a number of times without his paying attention to them , they told Haman , in order to find out whether Mordekhai ’ s explanation that he was a Jew would suffice to justify his behavior .
CJB	Esther	3	5	Haman was furious when he saw that Mordekhai was not kneeling and bowing down to him .
CJB	Esther	3	6	However , on learning what people Mordekhai belonged to , it seemed to him a waste to lay hands on Mordekhai alone . Rather , he decided to destroy all of Mordekhai ’ s people , the Jews , throughout the whole of Achashverosh ’ s kingdom .
CJB	Esther	3	7	In the first month , the month of Nisan , in the twelfth year of Achashverosh , they began throwing pur ( that is , they cast lots ) before Haman every day and every month until the twelfth month , which is the month of Adar .
CJB	Esther	3	8	Then Haman said to Achashverosh , “ There is a particular people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom . Their laws are different from those of every other people ; moreover , they don ’ t observe the king ’ s laws . It doesn ’ t befit the king to tolerate them .
CJB	Esther	3	9	If it please the king , have a decree written for their destruction ; and I will hand over
CJB	Esther	3	330	tons of silver to the officials in charge of the king ’ s affairs to deposit in the royal treasury. ”
CJB	Esther	3	10	The king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hamdata the Agagi , the enemy of the Jews .
CJB	Esther	3	11	The king said to Haman , “ The money is given to you , and the people too , to do with as seems good to you. ”
CJB	Esther	3	12	The king ’ s secretaries were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month . They wrote down all Haman ’ s orders to the king ’ s army commanders and governors in all the provinces and to the officials of every people , to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language ; everything was written in the name of King Achashverosh and sealed with the king ’ s signet ring .
CJB	Esther	3	13	Letters were sent by courier to all the royal provinces “ to destroy , kill and exterminate all Jews , from young to old , including small children and women , on a specific day , the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , the month of Adar , and to seize their goods as plunder. ”
CJB	Esther	3	14	A copy of the document to be issued as a decree in every province was to be publicly proclaimed to all the peoples , so that they would be ready for that day .
CJB	Esther	3	15	At the king ’ s order the runners went out quickly , and the decree was issued in Shushan the capital . Then the king and Haman sat down for a drink together , but the city of Shushan was thrown into confusion .
CJB	Esther	4	4	When the girls and officials attending Ester came and informed her of this , the queen became deeply distressed . She sent clothes for Mordekhai to wear instead of his sackcloth , but he wouldn ’ t accept them .
CJB	Esther	4	2	He stopped before entering the King ’ s Gate , since no one was allowed to go inside the King ’ s Gate wearing sackcloth .
CJB	Esther	4	3	In every province reached by the king ’ s order and decree , there was great mourning among the Jews , with fasting , weeping and wailing , as many lay down on sackcloth and ashes .
CJB	Esther	4	5	So Ester summoned Hatakh , one of the king ’ s officials attending her , and instructed him to go to Mordekhai and find out what this was all about and why .
CJB	Esther	4	6	Hatakh went out to Mordekhai in the open space in front of the King ’ s Gate ,
CJB	Esther	4	7	and Mordekhai told him everything that had happened to him and exactly how much silver Haman had promised to put in the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews .
CJB	Esther	4	8	He also gave him a copy of the decree for their destruction issued in Shushan ; so that he could show it to Ester , explain it to her , and then instruct her to approach the king , intercede with him and implore his favor on behalf of her people .
CJB	Esther	4	9	Hatakh returned and told Ester what Mordekhai had said .
CJB	Esther	4	10	Then Ester spoke to Hatakh and gave him this message for Mordekhai :
CJB	Esther	4	11	“ All the king ’ s officials , as well as the people in the royal provinces , know that if anyone , man or woman , approaches the king in the inner courtyard without being summoned , there is just one law — he must be put to death — unless the king holds out the gold scepter for him to remain alive ; and I haven ’ t been summoned to the king for the past thirty days. ”
CJB	Esther	4	12	Upon being told what Ester had said , Mordekhai
CJB	Esther	4	13	asked them to give Ester this answer : “ Don ’ t suppose that merely because you happen to be in the royal palace you will escape any more than the other Jews .
CJB	Esther	4	14	For if you fail to speak up now , relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from a different direction ; but you and your father ’ s family will perish . Who knows whether you didn ’ t come into your royal position precisely for such a time as this. ”
CJB	Esther	4	15	Ester had them return this answer to Mordekhai :
CJB	Esther	4	16	“ Go , assemble all the Jews to be found in Shushan , and have them fast for me , neither eating nor drinking for three days , night and day ; also I and the girls attending me will fast the same way . Then I will go in to the king , which is against the law ; and if I perish , I perish. ”
CJB	Esther	4	17	Then Mordekhai went his way and did everything Ester had ordered him to do .
CJB	Esther	5	5	The king said , “ Bring Haman quickly , so that what Ester has asked for can be done. ” (
CJB	Esther	5	2	When the king saw Ester the queen standing in the courtyard , she won his favor ; so the king extended the gold scepter in his hand toward Ester . Ester approached and touched the tip of the scepter .
CJB	Esther	5	3	“ What is it you want , Queen Ester ? ” the king asked her . “ Whatever your request , up to half the kingdom , it will be given to you. ”
CJB	Esther	5	4	“ If it is all right with the king , ” answered Ester , “ let the king and Haman come today to the banquet I have prepared for him. ”
CJB	Esther	5	6	(
CJB	Esther	5	7	(
CJB	Esther	5	8	if I have won the king ’ s favor , if it pleases the king to grant my request and do what I want , let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them ; and tomorrow I will do as the king has said. ”
CJB	Esther	5	9	That day Haman went out happy and in good spirits . But when Haman saw Mordekhai at the King ’ s Gate , that he neither rose nor moved for him , Haman was infuriated with Mordekhai .
CJB	Esther	5	10	Nevertheless , Haman restrained himself and went home , where he summoned and brought his friends and Zeresh his wife .
CJB	Esther	5	11	Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth , his many sons , and everything connected with how the king had promoted him and given him precedence over the other officials and servants of the king .
CJB	Esther	5	12	“ Indeed , ” Haman added , “ Ester the queen let nobody into the banquet with the king that she had prepared except myself ; and tomorrow , too , I am invited by her , together with the king .
CJB	Esther	5	13	Yet none of this does me any good at all , as long as I keep seeing Mordekhai the Jew remaining seated at the King ’ s Gate. ”
CJB	Esther	5	14	At this Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him , “ Have a gallows seventy-five feet high constructed , and in the morning speak to the king about having Mordekhai hanged on it . Then go in , and enjoy yourself with the king at the banquet. ” Haman liked the idea , so he had a gallows made .
CJB	Esther	6	6	So Haman came in . The king said to him , “ What should be done for a man that the king wants to honor ? ” Haman thought to himself , “ Whom would the king want to honor more than me ? ”
CJB	Esther	6	2	It was found written that Mordekhai had told about Bigtana and Teresh , two of the king ’ s officers from the group in charge of the private entryways , who had conspired to assassinate King Achashverosh .
CJB	Esther	6	3	The king asked , “ What honor or distinction was conferred on Mordekhai for this ? ” The king ’ s servants answered , “ Nothing was done for him. ”
CJB	Esther	6	4	The king then asked , “ Who ’ s that in the courtyard ? ” For Haman had come into the outer courtyard of the king ’ s palace to speak to the king about hanging Mordekhai on the gallows he had prepared for him .
CJB	Esther	6	5	The king ’ s servants told him , “ It ’ s Haman standing there in the courtyard. ” The king said , “ Have him come in. ”
CJB	Esther	6	7	So Haman answered the king , “ For a man the king wants to honor ,
CJB	Esther	6	8	have royal robes brought which the king himself wears and the horse the king himself rides , with a royal crown on its head .
CJB	Esther	6	9	The robes and the horse should be handed over to one of the king ’ s most respected officials , and they should put the robes on the man the king wants to honor and lead him on horseback through the streets of the city , proclaiming ahead of him , ‘ This is what is done for a man whom the king wants to honor. ’ ”
CJB	Esther	6	10	The king said to Haman , “ Hurry , and take the robes and the horse , as you said , and do this for Mordekhai the Jew , who sits at the King ’ s Gate . Don ’ t leave out anything you mentioned. ”
CJB	Esther	6	11	So Haman took the robes and the horse , dressed Mordekhai and led him riding through the streets of the city , as he proclaimed ahead of him , “ This is what is done for a man whom the king wants to honor. ”
CJB	Esther	6	12	Then Mordekhai returned to the King ’ s Gate ; but Haman rushed home with his head covered in mourning .
CJB	Esther	6	13	After Haman had told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him , his advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him , “ If Mordekhai , before whom you have begun to fall , is a Jew , you will not get the better of him ; on the contrary , your downfall before him is certain. ”
CJB	Esther	6	14	While they were still talking with him , the king ’ s officials came , hurrying to bring Haman to the banquet Ester had prepared .
CJB	Esther	7	7	In a rage , the king got up from the wine banquet and went out to the palace garden . But Haman remained , pleading with Ester the queen to spare his life ; for he could see that the king had decided to do him in .
CJB	Esther	7	2	and the king again said to Ester at the wine banquet , “ Whatever your request , Queen Ester , you will be granted it ; whatever you want , up to half the kingdom , it will be done. ”
CJB	Esther	7	3	Ester the queen answered , “ If I have won your favor , king , and if it pleases the king , then what I ask be given me is my own life and the lives of my people .
CJB	Esther	7	4	For we have been sold , I and my people , to be destroyed , killed , exterminated . If we had only been sold as men- and women-slaves , I would have remained quiet ; since then [ our ] trouble would not have been worth the damage it would have caused the king [ to alter the situation ] . ”
CJB	Esther	7	5	King Achashverosh asked Ester the queen , “ Who is he ? Where is the man who dared to do such a thing ? ”
CJB	Esther	7	6	Ester said , “ A ruthless enemy — it ’ s this wicked Haman ! ” Haman stood aghast , terrified before the king and queen .
CJB	Esther	7	8	Haman had just fallen on the couch where Ester was , when the king returned from the palace garden to the wine banquet . He shouted , “ Is he even going to rape the queen here in the palace , before my very eyes ? ” The moment these words left the king ’ s mouth , they covered Haman ’ s face .
CJB	Esther	7	9	Harvonah , one of the king ’ s attendants , said , “ Look ! The gallows seventy-five feet high that Haman made for Mordekhai , who spoke only good for the king , is standing at Haman ’ s house. ” The king said , “ Hang him on it. ”
CJB	Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordekhai . Then the king ’ s anger subsided .
CJB	Esther	8	8	You should issue a decree in the king ’ s name for whatever you want concerning the Jews , and seal it with the king ’ s signet ring ; because a decree written in the king ’ s name and sealed with the king ’ s ring can ’ t be rescinded by anyone. ”
CJB	Esther	8	2	The king removed his signet ring , which he had taken back from Haman , and gave it to Mordekhai . Then Ester put Mordekhai in charge of Haman ’ s house .
CJB	Esther	8	3	Again Ester spoke to the king ; she fell at his feet and begged him with tears to put an end to the mischief Haman the Agagi had caused by the scheme he had worked out against the Jews .
CJB	Esther	8	4	The king extended the gold scepter toward Ester . So Ester got up and stood in front of the king .
CJB	Esther	8	5	She said , “ If it pleases the king , if I have won his favor , if the matter seem right to the king and if I have his approval , then let an order be written rescinding the letters devised by Haman the son of Hamdata the Agagi , which he wrote to destroy the Jews in all the royal provinces .
CJB	Esther	8	6	For how can I bear to see the disaster that will overcome my people ? How can I endure seeing the extermination of my kinsmen ? ”
CJB	Esther	8	7	King Achashverosh said to Ester the queen and Mordekhai the Jew , “ Listen ! I gave Ester the house of Haman , and they hanged him on the gallows , because he threatened the lives of the Jews .
CJB	Esther	8	9	The king ’ s secretaries were summoned at that time , on the twenty-third day of the third month , the month of Sivan ; and a decree was written according to everything Mordekhai ordered concerning the Jews , to the army commanders , governors and officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia ,
CJB	Esther	8	127	provinces , to each province in its script and to each people in their language , also to the Jews in their script and language .
CJB	Esther	8	10	They wrote in the name of King Achashverosh and sealed it with the king ’ s signet ring ; they sent the letters by couriers on horseback riding fast horses used in the king ’ s service and bred from the royal stock .
CJB	Esther	8	11	The letters said that the king had granted the Jews in every city the right “ to assemble and defend their lives by destroying , killing and exterminating any forces of any people or province that would attack them , their little ones or their women or would try to seize their goods as plunder
CJB	Esther	8	12	on the designated day in any of the provinces of King Achashverosh , namely , the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , the month of Adar. ”
CJB	Esther	8	13	A copy of the edict was to be issued as a decree in every province and proclaimed to all the peoples , and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take vengeance against their enemies .
CJB	Esther	8	14	Couriers riding fast horses used in the king ’ s service left quickly , pressed by the king ’ s order ; and the decree was issued in Shushan the capital .
CJB	Esther	8	15	Meanwhile , Mordekhai left the king ’ s presence arrayed in royal blue and white , wearing a large gold crown and a robe of fine linen and purple ; and the city of Shushan shouted for joy .
CJB	Esther	8	16	For the Jews , all was light , gladness , joy and honor .
CJB	Esther	8	17	In every province and city where the king ’ s order and decree arrived , the Jews had gladness and joy , a feast and a holiday . Many from the peoples of the land became Jews , because fear of the Jews had overcome them .
CJB	Esther	9	9	The time approached for the king ’ s order and decree to be carried out , the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to overpower them . But , as it turned out , the opposite took place — the Jews overpowered those who hated them . Thus , on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , the month of Adar ,
CJB	Esther	9	2	the Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Achashverosh to attack anyone who tried to do them harm ; and no one was able to withstand them ; because all the peoples were afraid of them .
CJB	Esther	9	3	All the officials of the provinces , the army commanders , the governors and those occupied with the king ’ s affairs helped the Jews ; because they were afraid of Mordekhai .
CJB	Esther	9	4	For Mordekhai had become a powerful person in the king ’ s palace , and his fame had spread through all the provinces ; Mordekhai continued to grow increasingly powerful .
CJB	Esther	9	5	The Jews put all their enemies to the sword ; there was great slaughter and destruction , as they did whatever they wanted to those who hated them ;
CJB	Esther	9	6	in Shushan the capital , the Jews slaughtered
CJB	Esther	9	500	men in Shushan the capital and the ten sons of Haman , what have they done in the rest of the royal provinces ! Now , whatever your request , you will be granted it ; whatever more you want , it will be done. ”
CJB	Esther	9	11	The same day , after the king had been told the number of those killed in Shushan the capital ,
CJB	Esther	9	12	he said to Ester the queen , “ If the Jews have slaughtered
CJB	Esther	9	13	Ester replied , “ If it pleases the king , let the Jews in Shushan act again tomorrow in accordance with today ’ s decree ; also have Haman ’ s ten sons hanged on the gallows. ”
CJB	Esther	9	14	The king ordered these things done — a decree was issued in Shushan , and they hanged Haman ’ s ten sons .
CJB	Esther	9	15	So the Jews in Shushan assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed
CJB	Esther	9	300	men in Shushan , but they did not touch the spoil .
CJB	Esther	9	16	The other Jews , those in the royal provinces , had assembled , defended their lives and won rest from their enemies , killing 75,000 of those who hated them , but without touching the spoil ,
CJB	Esther	9	17	on the thirteenth day of the month Adar . So on the fourteenth day of Adar they rested and made it a holiday for celebrating and rejoicing .
CJB	Esther	9	18	However , the Jews of Shushan assembled on both the thirteenth and fourteenth days of Adar , so it was on the fifteenth that they rested and made it a holiday for celebrating and rejoicing .
CJB	Esther	9	19	This is why the Jews of the villages , those who live in unwalled towns , make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day for celebrating and rejoicing , a holiday and a time for sending each other portions [ of food ] .
CJB	Esther	9	20	Mordekhai recorded these events and sent letters to all the Jews in all the provinces of King Achashverosh , both near and far ,
CJB	Esther	9	21	instructing them to observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and the fifteenth day , every year ,
CJB	Esther	9	22	[ to commemorate ] the days on which the Jews obtained rest from their enemies and the month which for them was turned from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday ; they were to make them days of celebrating and rejoicing , sending portions [ of food ] to each other and giving gifts to the poor .
CJB	Esther	9	23	So the Jews took it upon themselves to continue what they had already begun to do , and as Mordekhai had written to them ;
CJB	Esther	9	24	because Haman the son of Hamdata the Agagi , the enemy of the Jews , had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had thrown pur ( that is , “ cast lots ” ) to crush and destroy them ;
CJB	Esther	9	25	but when Ester came before the king , he ordered by letters that [ Haman ’ s ] wicked scheme , which he had plotted against the Jews , should recoil on his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
CJB	Esther	9	26	This is why these days have been called Purim , after the word pur . Thus , because of everything written in this letter , and what they had seen concerning this matter , and what had come upon them ,
CJB	Esther	9	27	the Jews resolved and took upon themselves , their descendants and all who might join them that without fail they would observe these two days in accordance with what was written in [ this letter ] and at the appointed time , every year ;
CJB	Esther	9	28	and that these days would be remembered and observed throughout every generation , every family , every province and every city ; and that these days of Purim would never cease among the Jews or their memory be lost by their descendants .
CJB	Esther	9	29	Then Ester the queen , the daughter of Avichayil , and Mordekhai the Jew , gave full written authority to confirm a second letter about Purim .
CJB	Esther	9	30	He sent copies of it to all the Jews , to the
CJB	Esther	9	127	provinces of the kingdom of Achashverosh , ensuring their peace and security
CJB	Esther	9	31	and requiring the observance of these days of Purim at their designated times , as Mordekhai the Jew and Ester the queen had enjoined them , and as they had established for themselves and their descendants concerning the matters of fasting and lamenting .
CJB	Esther	9	32	At Ester ’ s order these matters of Purim were confirmed and put in writing in the book .
CJB	Esther	10	10	King Achashverosh laid tribute on the land , the coasts and the islands .
CJB	Esther	10	2	All the acts of his power and might , along with a full account of the high honor to which the king advanced Mordekhai , are written in the Annals of the Kings of Media and Persia .
CJB	Esther	10	3	For Mordekhai the Jew was second only to King Achashverosh ; he was a great man among the Jews , popular with all his many countrymen . He sought the good of his people and interceded for the welfare of all their descendants .

CJB	Job	1	1	There was a man in the land of ‘ Utz whose name was Iyov . This man was blameless and upright ; he feared God and shunned evil .
CJB	Job	1	2	Seven sons and three daughters were born to him .
CJB	Job	1	3	He owned 7,000 sheep , 3,000 camels ,
CJB	Job	1	500	female donkeys , as well as a great number of servants ; so that he was the wealthiest man in the east .
CJB	Job	1	4	It was the custom of his sons to give banquets , each on his set day in his own house ; and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them .
CJB	Job	1	5	After a cycle of banquets , Iyov would send for them to come and be consecrated ; then he would get up early in the morning and offer burnt offerings for each of them , because Iyov said , “ My sons might have sinned and blasphemed God in their thoughts. ” This is what Iyov did every time .
CJB	Job	1	6	It happened one day that the sons of God came to serve Adonai , and among them came the Adversary [ a ] .
CJB	Job	1	7	Adonai asked the Adversary , “ Where are you coming from ? ” The Adversary answered Adonai , “ From roaming through the earth , wandering here and there. ”
CJB	Job	1	8	Adonai asked the Adversary , “ Did you notice my servant Iyov , that there ’ s no one like him on earth , a blameless and upright man who fears God and shuns evil ? ”
CJB	Job	1	9	The Adversary answered Adonai , “ Is it for nothing that Iyov fears God ?
CJB	Job	1	10	You ’ ve put a protective hedge around him , his house and everything he has . You ’ ve prospered his work , and his livestock are spread out all over the land .
CJB	Job	1	11	But if you reach out your hand and touch whatever he has , without doubt he ’ ll curse you to your face ! ”
CJB	Job	1	12	Adonai said to the Adversary , “ Here ! Everything he has is in your hands , except that you are not to lay a finger on his person. ” Then the Adversary went out from the presence of Adonai .
CJB	Job	1	13	One day when Iyov ’ s sons and daughters were eating and drinking in their oldest brother ’ s house ,
CJB	Job	1	14	a messenger came to him and said , “ The oxen were plowing , with the donkeys grazing near them ,
CJB	Job	1	15	when a raiding party from Sh ’ va came and carried them off ; they put the servants to the sword too , and I ’ m the only one who escaped to tell you. ”
CJB	Job	1	16	While he was still speaking , another one came and said , “ Fire from God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants ; it completely destroyed them , and I ’ m the only one who escaped to tell you. ”
CJB	Job	1	17	While he was still speaking , another one came and said , “ The Kasdim , three bands of them , fell on the camels and carried them off ; they put the servants to the sword too , and I ’ m the only one who escaped to tell you. ”
CJB	Job	1	18	While he was still speaking , another one came and said , “ Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother ’ s house ,
CJB	Job	1	19	when suddenly a strong wind blew in from over the desert . It struck the four corners of the house , so that it fell on the young people ; they are dead , and I ’ m the only one who escaped to tell you. ”
CJB	Job	1	20	Iyov got up , tore his coat , shaved his head , fell down on the ground and worshipped ;
CJB	Job	1	21	he said , “ Naked I came from my mother ’ s womb , and naked I will return there . Adonai gave ; Adonai took ; blessed be the name of Adonai. ”
CJB	Job	1	22	In all this Iyov neither committed a sin nor put blame on God . Footnotes - Job 1:6 Hebrew : Satan
CJB	Job	2	2	Adonai asked the Adversary , “ Where are you coming from ? ” The Adversary answered Adonai , “ From roaming through the earth , wandering here and there. ”
CJB	Job	2	3	Adonai asked the Adversary , “ Did you notice my servant Iyov , that there ’ s no one like him on earth , a blameless and upright man who fears God and shuns evil , and that he still holds on to his integrity , even though you provoked me against him to destroy him for no reason ? ”
CJB	Job	2	4	The Adversary answered Adonai , “ Skin for skin ! A person will give up everything he has to save his life .
CJB	Job	2	5	But if you reach out your hand and touch his flesh and bone , without doubt he ’ ll curse you to your face ! ”
CJB	Job	2	6	Adonai said to the Adversary , “ Here ! He is in your hands , except that you are to spare his life. ”
CJB	Job	2	7	Then the Adversary went out from the presence of Adonai and struck Iyov down with horrible infected sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head .
CJB	Job	2	8	He took a piece of a broken pot to scratch himself and sat down in the pile of ashes .
CJB	Job	2	9	His wife asked him , “ Why do you still hold on to your integrity ? Curse God , and die ! ”
CJB	Job	2	10	But he answered her , “ You ’ re talking like a low-class woman ! Are we to receive the good at God ’ s hands but reject the bad ? ” In all this Iyov did not say one sinful word .
CJB	Job	2	11	Now when Iyov ’ s three friends heard of all the calamities that had overwhelmed him , they all came . Each came from his own home — Elifaz from Teiman , Bildad from Shuach and Tzofar from Na ‘ amah . They had agreed to meet together in order to come and offer him sympathy and comfort .
CJB	Job	2	12	When they saw him from a distance , they couldn ’ t even recognize him . They wept aloud , tore their coats and threw dust over their heads toward heaven .
CJB	Job	2	13	Then they sat down with him on the ground . For seven days and seven nights , no one spoke a word to him ; because they saw how much he was suffering .
CJB	Job	2	14	( 3:1 ) At length , Iyov broke the silence and cursed the day of his [ birth ] .

CJB	Job	3	26	) I have no peace , no quiet , no rest ; and anguish keeps coming . ”
CJB	Job	4	4	your words have supported those who were stumbling , and you have strengthened the weak-kneed .
CJB	Job	4	2	“ If one tries to speak to you , will you mind ? Yet who could keep from speaking ?
CJB	Job	4	3	You have given moral instruction to many , you have firmed up feeble hands ,
CJB	Job	4	5	“ But now it comes to you , and you are impatient ; at the first touch , you are in shock .
CJB	Job	4	6	Isn ’ t your fear of God your assurance , and the integrity of your ways your hope ?
CJB	Job	4	7	“ Think back : what innocent person has perished ? Since when are the upright destroyed ?
CJB	Job	4	8	What I see is that those who plow sin and sow trouble reap just that .
CJB	Job	4	9	At a breath from God , they perish ; at a blast from his anger , they are consumed .
CJB	Job	4	10	The lion may growl , the king lion may roar , but that old lion ’ s teeth are broken ;
CJB	Job	4	11	so the lion succumbs from lack of prey , and the lion ’ s cubs are scattered .
CJB	Job	4	12	“ For a word was stealthily brought to me , my ear caught only a whisper of it .
CJB	Job	4	13	In passing thoughts flashing through visions at night , when sleep lies heavy on people ,
CJB	Job	4	14	a shiver of horror came over me ; it made all my bones tremble .
CJB	Job	4	15	Then a spirit passed in front of my face ; the hair of my flesh stood on end .
CJB	Job	4	16	It stood still , but I couldn ’ t make out its appearance ; yet the form stayed there before my eyes . Then I heard a subdued voice :
CJB	Job	4	17	‘ Can a human be seen by God as righteous ? Can a mortal be pure before his maker ?
CJB	Job	4	18	[ God ] doesn ’ t trust his own servants , he finds fault even with his angels ;
CJB	Job	4	19	much more those living in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust . They are crushed more easily than a worm ;
CJB	Job	4	20	shattered between morning and evening ; they perish forever , and no one takes notice .
CJB	Job	4	21	Their cord within them is pulled up ; then they die , without ever gaining wisdom . ’
CJB	Job	5	5	the hungry eat up his harvest , taking it even from among thorns , while the thirsty are panting , eager to swallow his wealth .
CJB	Job	5	2	For anger kills the fool , and envy slays the silly .
CJB	Job	5	3	I watch as a fool establishes roots , but I curse his home with sudden [ destruction ] —
CJB	Job	5	4	his children are far from help , publicly humiliated , with no one to rescue ;
CJB	Job	5	6	For misery does not come from the dust or trouble spring from the ground .
CJB	Job	5	7	No , people are born for trouble as surely as sparks fly upward .
CJB	Job	5	8	“ If I were you , I would seek God ; I would make my plea to him .
CJB	Job	5	9	For God does great deeds beyond investigation , wonders beyond all reckoning .
CJB	Job	5	10	He gives rain to the earth , pours water down on the fields .
CJB	Job	5	11	He raises the lowly on high and lifts mourners to safety .
CJB	Job	5	12	He frustrates the schemes of the cunning , so that they achieve no success ;
CJB	Job	5	13	trapping the crafty in their own tricks and foiling quickly the plans of the false .
CJB	Job	5	14	They meet with darkness during the day , groping at noon like at night .
CJB	Job	5	15	But he saves the poor from the sword , their mouth , and from the clutches of the strong ;
CJB	Job	5	16	so the poor can hope again ; and injustice shuts its mouth .
CJB	Job	5	17	“ How happy the person whom God corrects ! So don ’ t despise Shaddai ’ s discipline .
CJB	Job	5	18	For he wounds , but he bandages the sore ; his hands may strike , but they also heal .
CJB	Job	5	19	He will rescue you from six disasters ; yes , in seven no harm will touch you .
CJB	Job	5	20	In famine , he will save you from death , and in war , from the power of the sword .
CJB	Job	5	21	You will be shielded from the lash of the tongue , and you won ’ t have to fear destruction when it comes —
CJB	Job	5	22	you ’ ll be able to laugh at destruction and famine . Also you won ’ t have to fear wild animals ,
CJB	Job	5	23	for you will be in league with the stones in the field , and the wild animals will be at peace with you .
CJB	Job	5	24	You will know that your tent is safe ; you will look round your home and miss nothing .
CJB	Job	5	25	You will know that your descendants are many , your offspring like grass [ growing thick ] in the fields .
CJB	Job	5	26	You will come to your grave at a ripe old age , like a pile of grain that arrives in season .
CJB	Job	5	27	“ We ’ ve looked into this , and that ’ s how it is ; listen , and know that it ’ s for your own good . ”
CJB	Job	6	6	Can food without flavor be eaten without salt ? Do egg whites have any taste ?
CJB	Job	6	2	“ I wish my frustration could be weighed , all my calamities laid on the scales !
CJB	Job	6	3	They would outweigh the sands of the seas ! No wonder , then , that my words come out stammered !
CJB	Job	6	4	For the arrows of Shaddai find their mark in me , and my spirit is drinking in their poison ; the terrors of God are arrayed against me .
CJB	Job	6	5	“ Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass ? Does an ox low when it has fodder ?
CJB	Job	6	7	I refuse to touch them ; such food makes me sick .
CJB	Job	6	8	“ If only I could have my wish granted , and God would give me what I ’ m hoping for —
CJB	Job	6	9	that God would decide to crush me , that he would let his hand loose and cut me off !
CJB	Job	6	10	Then I would feel consoled ; so that even in the face of unending pain , I would be able to rejoice ; for I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
CJB	Job	6	11	“ Have I enough strength to go on waiting ? What end can I expect , that I should be patient ?
CJB	Job	6	12	Is my strength the strength of stones ? Is my flesh made of bronze ?
CJB	Job	6	13	Clearly , I have no help in myself ; common sense has been driven from me .
CJB	Job	6	14	“ A friend should be kind to an unhappy man , even to one who abandons Shaddai .
CJB	Job	6	15	But my brothers are as deceptive as vadis , as vadi streams that soon run dry ;
CJB	Job	6	16	they may turn dark with ice and be hidden by piled-up snow ;
CJB	Job	6	17	but as the weather warms up , they vanish ; when it ’ s hot , they disappear .
CJB	Job	6	18	Their courses turn this way and that ; they go up into the confusing waste and are lost .
CJB	Job	6	19	The caravans from Tema look for them , the travelers from Sh ’ va hope to find them ;
CJB	Job	6	20	but they are disappointed , because they were confident ; on arrival there , they are frustrated .
CJB	Job	6	21	“ For now , you have become like that — just seeing my calamity makes you afraid .
CJB	Job	6	22	Did I say to you , ‘ Give me something , ’ or , ‘ From your wealth , offer a bribe on my behalf , ’
CJB	Job	6	23	or , ‘ Save me from the enemy ’ s grip , ’ or , ‘ Redeem me from the clutches of oppressors ’ ?
CJB	Job	6	24	“ Teach me , and I will be silent . Make me understand how I am at fault .
CJB	Job	6	25	Honest words are forceful indeed , but what do your arguments prove ?
CJB	Job	6	26	Do you think [ your own ] words constitute argument , while the speech of a desperate man is merely wind ?
CJB	Job	6	27	I suppose you would even throw dice for an orphan or barter away your friend !
CJB	Job	6	28	“ So now , I beg you , look at me ! Would I lie to your face ?
CJB	Job	6	29	Think it over , please ; don ’ t let wrong be done . Think it over again : my cause is just .
CJB	Job	6	30	Am I saying something wrong ? Can ’ t I recognize trouble when I taste it ?
CJB	Job	7	7	“ Remember that my life is but a breath ; my eyes will never again see good times .
CJB	Job	7	2	like a slave longing for shade , like a worker thinking only of his wages .
CJB	Job	7	3	So I am assigned months of meaninglessness ; troubled nights are my lot .
CJB	Job	7	4	When I lie down , I ask , ‘ When can I get up ? ’ But the night is long , and I keep tossing to and fro until daybreak .
CJB	Job	7	5	My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt , my skin forms scabs that ooze pus .
CJB	Job	7	6	My days pass more swiftly than a weaver ’ s shuttle and come to their end without hope .
CJB	Job	7	8	The eye that now sees me will see me no more ; while your eyes are on me , I will be gone .
CJB	Job	7	9	Like a cloud dissolving and disappearing , so he who descends to Sh ’ ol won ’ t come back up .
CJB	Job	7	10	He will not return again to his house , and his home will know him no more .
CJB	Job	7	11	“ Therefore I will not restrain my mouth but will speak in my anguish of spirit and complain in my bitterness of soul .
CJB	Job	7	12	Am I the sea , or some sea monster , that you put a guard over me ?
CJB	Job	7	13	When I think that my bed will comfort me , that my couch will relieve my complaint ,
CJB	Job	7	14	then you terrify me with dreams and frighten me with visions .
CJB	Job	7	15	I would rather be strangled ; death would be better than these bones of mine .
CJB	Job	7	16	I hate it ! I won ’ t live forever , so leave me alone , for my life means nothing .
CJB	Job	7	17	“ What are mere mortals , that you make so much of them ? Why do you keep them on your mind ?
CJB	Job	7	18	Why examine them every morning and test them every moment ?
CJB	Job	7	19	Won ’ t you ever take your eyes off of me , at least long enough for me to swallow my spit ?
CJB	Job	7	20	“ Suppose I do sin — how do I harm you , you scrutinizer of humanity ? Why have you made me your target , so that I am a burden to you ?
CJB	Job	7	21	Why don ’ t you pardon my offense and take away my guilt ? For soon I will lie down in the dust ; you will seek me , but I will be gone . ”
CJB	Job	8	8	“ Ask the older generation , and consider what their ancestors found out ;
CJB	Job	8	2	“ How long will you go on talking like this ? What you are saying is raging wind !
CJB	Job	8	3	Does God distort judgment ? Does Shaddai pervert justice ?
CJB	Job	8	4	If your children sinned against him , he left them to be victims of their own offense .
CJB	Job	8	5	“ If you will earnestly seek God and plead for Shaddai ’ s favor ,
CJB	Job	8	6	if you are pure and upright ; then he will rouse himself for you and fulfill your needs .
CJB	Job	8	7	Then , although your beginnings were small , your future will be very great indeed .
CJB	Job	8	9	for we who were born yesterday know nothing , our days on earth are but a shadow .
CJB	Job	8	10	They will teach you , they will tell you , they will say what is in their hearts :
CJB	Job	8	11	‘ Can papyrus grow except in a marsh ? Can swamp grass flourish without water ?
CJB	Job	8	12	While still green , before being cut down , it dries up faster than any other plant .
CJB	Job	8	13	Such are the paths of all who forget God ; the hope of a hypocrite will perish —
CJB	Job	8	14	his confidence is mere gossamer , his trust a spider ’ s web .
CJB	Job	8	15	He can lean on his house , but it won ’ t stand ; he can hold on to it , but it won ’ t last ;
CJB	Job	8	16	[ for its destruction will come ] like the lush growth of a plant in the sun , its shoots may spread out all over its garden ,
CJB	Job	8	17	but meanwhile its roots cause the stone house to collapse , as it seizes hold of the rocks ;
CJB	Job	8	18	someone who tears it away from its place denies he has ever seen it .
CJB	Job	8	19	Yes , this is the “ joy ” of the way [ of the godless ] , and out of the dust will spring up others [ like him ] . ’
CJB	Job	8	20	“ Look , God will not reject a blameless man ; nor will he uphold wrongdoers .
CJB	Job	8	21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy .
CJB	Job	8	22	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame , and the tent of the wicked will cease to exist . ”
CJB	Job	9	9	He made the Great Bear , Orion , the Pleiades and the hidden constellations of the south .
CJB	Job	9	2	“ Indeed , I know that this is so ; but how can a human win a case against God ?
CJB	Job	9	3	Whoever might want to argue with him could not answer him one [ question ] in a thousand .
CJB	Job	9	4	His heart is so wise , his strength so great — who can resist him and succeed ?
CJB	Job	9	5	“ He moves the mountains , although they don ’ t know it , when he overturns them in his anger .
CJB	Job	9	6	He shakes the earth from its place ; its supporting pillars tremble .
CJB	Job	9	7	He commands the sun , and it fails to rise ; he shuts up the stars under his seal .
CJB	Job	9	8	He alone spreads out the sky and walks on the waves in the sea .
CJB	Job	9	10	He does great , unsearchable things , wonders beyond counting .
CJB	Job	9	11	He can go right by me , and I don ’ t see him ; he moves past without my being aware of him .
CJB	Job	9	12	If he kills [ people ] , who will ask why ? Who will say to him , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
CJB	Job	9	13	God will not withdraw his anger — even Rahav ’ s supporters submit to him .
CJB	Job	9	14	“ How much less can I answer him and select my arguments against him !
CJB	Job	9	15	Even if I were right , I wouldn ’ t answer ; I could only ask for mercy from my judge .
CJB	Job	9	16	If I summoned him , and he answered me , I still can ’ t believe he would listen to my plea .
CJB	Job	9	17	He could break me with a storm ; he could multiply my wounds for no reason ,
CJB	Job	9	18	to the point where I couldn ’ t even breathe — with such bitterness he could fill me !
CJB	Job	9	19	If it ’ s a matter of force , look how mighty he is ; if justice , who can summon him to court ?
CJB	Job	9	20	Even if I ’ m right , my own mouth will condemn me ; if I ’ m innocent , it would pronounce me guilty .
CJB	Job	9	21	“ I am innocent . Don ’ t I know myself ? But I ’ ve had enough of this life of mine !
CJB	Job	9	22	So I say it ’ s all the same — he destroys innocent and wicked alike .
CJB	Job	9	23	When disaster brings sudden death , he laughs at the plight of the innocent .
CJB	Job	9	24	The earth has been given to the power of the wicked ; he covers the faces of its judges — if it isn ’ t he , then who is it ?
CJB	Job	9	25	My days pass on more swiftly than a runner ; they flee without seeing anything good .
CJB	Job	9	26	They skim by like skiffs built of reeds , like an eagle swooping down on its prey .
CJB	Job	9	27	“ If I say , ‘ I ’ ll forget my complaining , I ’ ll put off my sad face and be cheerful , ’
CJB	Job	9	28	then I ’ m still afraid of all my pain , and I know you will not hold me innocent .
CJB	Job	9	29	I will be condemned , so why waste my efforts ?
CJB	Job	9	30	Even if I washed myself in melted snow and cleansed my hands with lye ,
CJB	Job	9	31	you would plunge me into the muddy pit , till my own clothes would detest me .
CJB	Job	9	32	“ For he is not merely human like me ; there is no answer that I could give him if we were to come together in court .
CJB	Job	9	33	There is no arbitrator between us who could lay his hand on us both .
CJB	Job	9	34	If he would remove his rod from me and not let his terrors frighten me ,
CJB	Job	9	35	then I would speak without fear of him ; for when I ’ m alone , I ’ m not afraid .
CJB	Job	10	10	Didn ’ t you pour me out like milk , then let me thicken like cheese ?
CJB	Job	10	2	I will say to God , ‘ Don ’ t condemn me ! Tell me why you are contending with me .
CJB	Job	10	3	Do you gain some advantage from oppressing , from spurning what your own hands made , from shining on the schemes of the wicked ?
CJB	Job	10	4	Do you have eyes of flesh ? Do you see as humans see ?
CJB	Job	10	5	Are your days like the days of mortals ? Are your years like human years ,
CJB	Job	10	6	that you have to seek my guilt and search out my sin ?
CJB	Job	10	7	You know that I won ’ t be condemned , yet no one can rescue me from your power .
CJB	Job	10	8	Your own hands shaped me , they made me ; so why do you turn and destroy me ?
CJB	Job	10	9	Please remember that you made me , like clay ; will you return me to dust ?
CJB	Job	10	11	You clothed me with skin and flesh you knit me together with bones and sinews .
CJB	Job	10	12	You granted me life and grace ; your careful attention preserved my spirit .
CJB	Job	10	13	“ ‘ Yet you hid these things in your heart ; I know what your secret purpose was —
CJB	Job	10	14	to watch until I would sin and then not absolve me of my guilt .
CJB	Job	10	15	If I am wicked , woe to me ! — but if righteous , I still don ’ t dare raise my head , because I am so filled with shame , so soaked in my misery .
CJB	Job	10	16	You rise up to hunt me like a lion , and you keep treating me in such peculiar ways .
CJB	Job	10	17	You keep producing fresh witnesses against me , your anger against me keeps growing , your troops assail me , wave after wave .
CJB	Job	10	18	“ ‘ Why did you bring me out of the womb ? I wish I had died there where no eye could see me .
CJB	Job	10	19	I would have been as if I had never existed , I would have been carried from womb to grave .
CJB	Job	10	20	Aren ’ t my days few ? So stop ! Leave me alone , so I can cheer up a little
CJB	Job	10	21	before I go to the place of no return , to the land of darkness and death-dark gloom ,
CJB	Job	10	22	a land of gloom like darkness itself , of dense darkness and utter disorder , where even the light is dark . ’ ”
CJB	Job	11	11	For he knows when people are worthless ; so if he sees iniquity , won ’ t he look into it ?
CJB	Job	11	2	“ Shouldn ’ t this torrent of words be answered ? Does talking a lot make a person right ?
CJB	Job	11	3	Is your babble supposed to put others to silence ? When you mock , is no one to make you ashamed ?
CJB	Job	11	4	“ You claim that your teaching is pure ; you tell [ God ] , ‘ I am clean in your sight. ’
CJB	Job	11	5	I wish that God would speak , would open his mouth to answer you ,
CJB	Job	11	6	would tell you the secrets of wisdom , which is worth twice as much as common sense . Understand that God is demanding of you less than your guilt deserves .
CJB	Job	11	7	“ Can you penetrate God ’ s depths ? Can you find out Shaddai ’ s limits ?
CJB	Job	11	8	They ’ re as high as heaven ; what can you do ? They ’ re deeper than Sh ’ ol ; what can you know ?
CJB	Job	11	9	Their extent is longer than the earth and broader than the sea .
CJB	Job	11	10	If he passes through , puts in prison and assembles [ for judgment ] , who can prevent him ?
CJB	Job	11	12	“ An empty man can gain understanding , even if he was born like a wild donkey .
CJB	Job	11	13	If you will set your heart right , if you will spread out your hands toward him ,
CJB	Job	11	14	if you will put your iniquity at a distance and not let unrighteousness remain in your tents ,
CJB	Job	11	15	then when you lift up your face , there will be no defect ; you will be firm and free from fear .
CJB	Job	11	16	“ For you will forget your misery ; you ’ ll remember it like a flood that passed through long ago ;
CJB	Job	11	17	your life will be brighter than noon ; even its darkness will be like morning .
CJB	Job	11	18	You will be confident , because there is hope ; you will look around you and lie down secure ;
CJB	Job	11	19	you will rest , and no one will make you afraid . Many will seek your favor ;
CJB	Job	11	20	but the eyes of the wicked will fail [ to find comfort ] . They will find no way to escape , and their hope will turn to complete disappointment . ”
CJB	Job	12	12	Is wisdom [ only ] with aged men ? discernment [ only ] with long life ?
CJB	Job	12	2	“ No doubt you are [ the only ] people [ that matter ] ; and when you die , so will wisdom .
CJB	Job	12	3	But I too have a brain , as much as you , In no way am I inferior to you . Besides , who doesn ’ t know things like these ?
CJB	Job	12	4	“ Anyone who calls on God , and he answers him , becomes a laughingstock to his friends — they make fun of an innocent , blameless man .
CJB	Job	12	5	Those at ease have contempt for misfortune , for the blow that strikes somebody already staggering .
CJB	Job	12	6	The tents of robbers prosper , [ the homes of ] those who anger God are secure , those who carry their gods in their hands .
CJB	Job	12	7	“ But ask the animals — they will teach you — and the birds in the air — they will tell you ;
CJB	Job	12	8	or speak to the earth — it will teach you — and the fish in the sea will inform you :
CJB	Job	12	9	every one of them knows that the hand of Adonai has done this !
CJB	Job	12	10	In his hand is the life of every living thing and the spirit of every human being .
CJB	Job	12	11	Shouldn ’ t the ear test words , just as the palate tastes food ?
CJB	Job	12	13	“ With God are wisdom and power ; he has [ good ] counsel and understanding .
CJB	Job	12	14	When he breaks something down , it can ’ t be rebuilt ; when he imprisons someone , he can ’ t be released .
CJB	Job	12	15	When he holds back water , there is drought ; when he sends it out , it overruns the land .
CJB	Job	12	16	With him are strength and common sense ; both the misled and those who mislead are his .
CJB	Job	12	17	He leads counselors away captive , he makes fools of judges .
CJB	Job	12	18	He removes authority from kings , then binds them up [ as prisoners ] .
CJB	Job	12	19	He leads cohanim away captive and overthrows those long in power .
CJB	Job	12	20	Those who are trusted he deprives of speech , and he removes the discernment of the aged .
CJB	Job	12	21	He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong .
CJB	Job	12	22	He discloses the deepest recesses of darkness and brings light into shadows dark as death .
CJB	Job	12	23	He makes nations great and destroys them ; he enlarges nations , then leads them away .
CJB	Job	12	24	He removes understanding from a country ’ s leaders and makes them wander in trackless deserts .
CJB	Job	12	25	They grope in unlit darkness ; he makes them stagger like drunks .
CJB	Job	13	13	“ So be quiet ! Let me be ! I ’ ll do the talking , come on me what may !
CJB	Job	13	2	Whatever you know , I know too ; I am not inferior to you .
CJB	Job	13	3	However , it ’ s Shaddai I want to speak with ; I want to prove my case to God .
CJB	Job	13	4	But you , what you do is whitewash with lies ; you are all witch doctors !
CJB	Job	13	5	I wish you would just stay silent ; for you , that would be wisdom !
CJB	Job	13	6	“ Now listen to my reasoning , pay attention to how I present my dispute .
CJB	Job	13	7	Is it for God ’ s sake that you speak so wickedly ? for him that you talk deceitfully ?
CJB	Job	13	8	Do you need to take his side and plead God ’ s case for him ?
CJB	Job	13	9	If he examines you , will all go well ? Can you deceive him , as one man deceives another ?
CJB	Job	13	10	If you are secretly flattering [ him ] , he will surely rebuke you .
CJB	Job	13	11	Doesn ’ t God ’ s majesty terrify you ? Aren ’ t you overcome with dread of him ?
CJB	Job	13	12	Your maxims are garbage-proverbs ; your answers crumble like clay .
CJB	Job	13	14	Why am I taking my flesh in my teeth , taking my life in my hands ?
CJB	Job	13	15	Look , he will kill me — I don ’ t expect more , but I will still defend my ways to his face .
CJB	Job	13	16	And this is what will save me — that a hypocrite can not appear before him .
CJB	Job	13	17	“ Listen closely , then , to my words ; pay attention to what I am saying .
CJB	Job	13	18	Here , now , I have prepared my case ; I know I am in the right .
CJB	Job	13	19	If anyone can contend with me , I will be quiet and die !
CJB	Job	13	20	“ Only grant two things to me , God ; then I won ’ t hide myself from your face —
CJB	Job	13	21	take your hand away from me , and don ’ t let fear of you frighten me .
CJB	Job	13	22	Then , if you call , I will answer . Or let me speak , and you , answer me !
CJB	Job	13	23	How many crimes and sins have I committed ? Make me know my transgression and sin .
CJB	Job	13	24	Why do you hide your face and think of me as your enemy ?
CJB	Job	13	25	Do you want to harass a wind-driven leaf ? do you want to pursue a dry straw ?
CJB	Job	13	26	Is this why you draw up bitter charges against me and punish me for the faults of my youth ?
CJB	Job	13	27	You put my feet in the stocks , you watch me closely wherever I go , you trace out each footprint of mine —
CJB	Job	13	28	though [ my body ] decays like something rotten or like a moth-eaten garment .
CJB	Job	14	14	If a man dies , will he live again ? I will wait all the days of my life for my change to come .
CJB	Job	14	2	He comes up like a flower and withers away , flees like a shadow , doesn ’ t last .
CJB	Job	14	3	You fix your eyes on a creature like this ? You drag him to court with you ?
CJB	Job	14	4	Who can bring what is pure from something impure ? No one !
CJB	Job	14	5	Since his days are fixed in advance , the number of his months is known to you , and you have fixed the limits which he can ’ t cross ;
CJB	Job	14	6	look away from him , and let him be ; so that , like a hired worker , he can finish his day in peace .
CJB	Job	14	7	“ For a tree , there is hope that if cut down , it will sprout again , that its shoots will continue to grow .
CJB	Job	14	8	Even if its roots grow old in the earth and its stump dies in the ground ,
CJB	Job	14	9	yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth branches like a young plant .
CJB	Job	14	10	But when a human being grows weak and dies , he expires ; and then where is he ?
CJB	Job	14	11	Just as water in a lake disappears , as a river shrinks and dries up ;
CJB	Job	14	12	so a person lies down and doesn ’ t arise — until the sky no longer exists ; it will not awaken , it won ’ t be roused from its sleep .
CJB	Job	14	13	“ I wish you would hide me in Sh ’ ol , conceal me until your anger has passed , then fix a time and remember me !
CJB	Job	14	15	You will call , and I will answer you ; you will long to see what you made again .
CJB	Job	14	16	Whereas now you count each step of mine , then you will not keep watch for my sin .
CJB	Job	14	17	You will seal up my crime in a bag and cover over my iniquity .
CJB	Job	14	18	“ Just as a mountain erodes and falls away , its rock is removed from its place ,
CJB	Job	14	19	the water wears away its stones , and the floods wash away its soil , so you destroy a person ’ s hope .
CJB	Job	14	20	You overpower him , and he passes on ; you change his appearance and send him away .
CJB	Job	14	21	His children earn honor , but he doesn ’ t know it ; or they are brought low , but he doesn ’ t notice .
CJB	Job	14	22	He feels pain only for his own flesh ; he laments only for himself . ”
CJB	Job	15	15	God doesn ’ t trust even his holy ones ; no , even the heavens are not innocent in his view .
CJB	Job	15	2	“ Should a wise man answer with hot-air arguments ? Should he fill up his belly with the hot east wind ?
CJB	Job	15	3	Should he reason with useless talk or make speeches that do him no good ?
CJB	Job	15	4	“ Why , you are abolishing fear of God and hindering prayer to him !
CJB	Job	15	5	Your iniquity is teaching you how to speak , and deceit is your language of choice .
CJB	Job	15	6	Your own mouth condemns you , not I ; your own lips testify against you .
CJB	Job	15	7	“ Were you the firstborn of the human race , brought forth before the hills ?
CJB	Job	15	8	Do you listen in on God ’ s secrets ? Do you limit wisdom to yourself ?
CJB	Job	15	9	What do you know that we don ’ t know ? What discernment do you have that we don ’ t ?
CJB	Job	15	10	With us are gray-haired men , old men , men much older than your father .
CJB	Job	15	11	Are the comfortings of God not enough for you , or a word that deals gently with you ?
CJB	Job	15	12	Why does your heart carry you away , and why do your eyes flash angrily ,
CJB	Job	15	13	so that you turn your spirit against God and let such words escape your mouth ?
CJB	Job	15	14	“ What is a human being , that he could be innocent , someone born from a woman , that he could be righteous ?
CJB	Job	15	16	How much less one loathesome and corrupt , a human being , who drinks iniquity like water .
CJB	Job	15	17	“ I will tell you — hear me out ! I will recount what I have seen ;
CJB	Job	15	18	wise men have told it , and it wasn ’ t hidden from their fathers either ,
CJB	Job	15	19	to whom alone the land was given — no foreigner passed among them .
CJB	Job	15	20	“ The wicked is in torment all his life , for all the years allotted to the tyrant .
CJB	Job	15	21	Terrifying sounds are in his ears ; in prosperity , robbers swoop down on him .
CJB	Job	15	22	He despairs of returning from darkness — he is destined to meet the sword .
CJB	Job	15	23	He wanders and looks for food , which isn ’ t there . He knows the day of darkness is ready , at hand .
CJB	Job	15	24	Distress and anguish overwhelm him , assaulting him like a king about to enter battle .
CJB	Job	15	25	“ He raises his hand against God and boldly defies Shaddai ,
CJB	Job	15	26	running against him with head held high and thickly ornamented shield .
CJB	Job	15	27	“ He lets his face grow gross and fat , and the rest of him bulges with blubber ;
CJB	Job	15	28	he lives in abandoned cities , in houses no one would inhabit , houses about to become ruins ;
CJB	Job	15	29	therefore he will not remain rich , his wealth will not endure , his produce will not bend [ the grain stalks ] to the earth .
CJB	Job	15	30	“ He will not escape from darkness . The flame will dry up his branches . By a breath from the mouth of [ God ] , he will go away .
CJB	Job	15	31	Let him not rely on futile methods , thereby deceiving himself ; for what he will receive in exchange will be only futility .
CJB	Job	15	32	This will be accomplished in advance of its day . His palm frond will not be fresh and green ;
CJB	Job	15	33	he will be like a vine that sheds its unripe grapes , like an olive tree that drops its flowers .
CJB	Job	15	34	“ For the community of the ungodly is sterile ; fire consumes the tents of bribery .
CJB	Job	15	35	They conceive trouble and give birth to evil ; their womb prepares deceit . ”
CJB	Job	16	16	my face is red from crying , and on my eyelids is a death-dark shadow .
CJB	Job	16	2	“ I have heard this stuff so often ! Such sorry comforters , all of you !
CJB	Job	16	3	Is there no end to words of wind ? What provokes you to answer this way ?
CJB	Job	16	4	“ If I were in your place , I too could speak as you do — I could string phrases together against you and shake my head at you .
CJB	Job	16	5	I could ‘ strengthen ’ you with my mouth , with lip service I could ‘ ease your grief. ’
CJB	Job	16	6	If I speak , my own pain isn ’ t eased ; and if I don ’ t speak , it still doesn ’ t leave .
CJB	Job	16	7	“ But now he has worn me out ; you have desolated this whole community of mine .
CJB	Job	16	8	Besides , you have shriveled me up ; and this serves to witness against me . My being so thin rises up against me and testifies to my face .
CJB	Job	16	9	He tears me apart in his anger ; he holds a grudge against me ; he gnashes on me with his teeth . “ My enemies look daggers at me .
CJB	Job	16	10	Wide-mouthed , they gape at me ; with scorn , they slap my cheeks ; they gather themselves together against me .
CJB	Job	16	11	“ God delivers me to the perverse , throws me into the hands of the wicked .
CJB	Job	16	12	I was at peace , and he shook me apart . Yes , he grabbed me by the neck and dashed me to pieces . He set me up as his target —
CJB	Job	16	13	his archers surrounded me . He slashes my innards and shows no mercy , he pours my gall on the ground .
CJB	Job	16	14	He breaks in on me again and again , attacking me like a warrior .
CJB	Job	16	15	“ I sewed sackcloth together to cover my skin and laid my pride in the dust ;
CJB	Job	16	17	Yet my hands are free from violence , and my prayer is pure .
CJB	Job	16	18	“ Earth , don ’ t cover my blood ; don ’ t let my cry rest [ without being answered ] .
CJB	Job	16	19	Even now , my witness is in heaven ; my advocate is there on high .
CJB	Job	16	20	With friends like these as intercessors , my eyes pour out tears to God ,
CJB	Job	16	21	that he would arbitrate between a man and God , just as one does for his fellow human being .
CJB	Job	16	22	For I have but few years left before I leave on the road of no return .
CJB	Job	17	17	“ My spirit is broken , my days are quenched , I am marked for the grave .
CJB	Job	17	2	Mockers are all around me ; my eye meets only their hostility .
CJB	Job	17	3	Be my guarantor , yourself ! Who else will put up a pledge for me ?
CJB	Job	17	4	For you have shut their minds to common sense ; therefore you will not let them triumph .
CJB	Job	17	5	Should people share with their friends when their own children ’ s eyes are so sad ?
CJB	Job	17	6	“ He has made me a byword among the peoples , a creature in whose face they spit .
CJB	Job	17	7	I am nearly blind with grief , my limbs reduced to a shadow .
CJB	Job	17	8	The upright are perplexed at this , the innocent aroused against the hypocrites .
CJB	Job	17	9	Yet the righteous hold on to their way , and those with clean hands grow stronger and stronger .
CJB	Job	17	10	“ But as for you all , turn around ! Come back ! — yet I won ’ t find a wise man among you .
CJB	Job	17	11	My days are over , my plans cut off , which I had cherished so ;
CJB	Job	17	12	but they [ try to ] turn [ my ] night into day , [ saying , ] ‘ Light is near ! ’ — in the face of darkness .
CJB	Job	17	13	“ If I hope for Sh ’ ol to be my house ; if I spread my couch in the dark ;
CJB	Job	17	14	if I say to the pit , ‘ You are my father , ’ and to worms , ‘ You are my mother and sister , ’
CJB	Job	17	15	then where is my hope ? And that hope of mine , who will see it ?
CJB	Job	17	16	Only those who go down with me to the bars of Sh ’ ol , when we rest together in the dust . ”
CJB	Job	18	18	He will be pushed from light into darkness and driven out of the world .
CJB	Job	18	2	“ When will you put an end to words ? Think about it — then we ’ ll talk !
CJB	Job	18	3	Why are we thought of as cattle , stupid in your view ?
CJB	Job	18	4	You can tear yourself to pieces in your anger , but the earth won ’ t be abandoned just for your sake ; not even a rock will be moved from its place .
CJB	Job	18	5	“ The light of the wicked will flicker and die , not a spark from his fire will shine ,
CJB	Job	18	6	the light in his tent is darkened , the lamp over him will be snuffed out .
CJB	Job	18	7	His vigorous stride is shortened , his own plans make him trip and fall .
CJB	Job	18	8	For his own feet plunge him into a net , he wanders into its meshes .
CJB	Job	18	9	A trap grabs him by the heel , a snare catches hold of him .
CJB	Job	18	10	A noose is hidden for him in the ground ; pitfalls lie in his path .
CJB	Job	18	11	Terrors overwhelm him on every side and scatter about his feet .
CJB	Job	18	12	“ Trouble is hungry for him , calamity ready for his fall ;
CJB	Job	18	13	disease eats away at his skin ; the first stages of death devour him gradually .
CJB	Job	18	14	What he relied on will be torn from his tent , and he will be marched before the king of terrors .
CJB	Job	18	15	“ What isn ’ t his at all will live in his tent ; sulfur will be scattered on his home .
CJB	Job	18	16	His roots beneath him will dry up ; above him , his branch will wither .
CJB	Job	18	17	Memory of him will fade from the land , while abroad his name will be unknown .
CJB	Job	18	19	“ Without son or grandson among his people , no one will remain in his dwellings .
CJB	Job	18	20	Those who come after will be appalled at his fate , just as those there before were struck with horror .
CJB	Job	18	21	“ This is how things are in the homes of the wicked , and this is the place of those who don ’ t know God . ”
CJB	Job	19	19	All my intimate friends abhor me , and those I loved have turned against me .
CJB	Job	19	2	“ How long will you go on making me angry , crushing me with words ?
CJB	Job	19	3	You ’ ve insulted me ten times already ; aren ’ t you ashamed to treat me so badly ?
CJB	Job	19	4	Even if it ’ s true that I made a mistake , my error stays with me .
CJB	Job	19	5	“ You may take a superior attitude toward me and cite my disgrace as proof against me ;
CJB	Job	19	6	but know that it ’ s God who has put me in the wrong and closed his net around me .
CJB	Job	19	7	If I cry , ‘ Violence ! ’ no one hears me ; I cry aloud , but there is no justice .
CJB	Job	19	8	“ He has fenced off my way , so that I can ’ t pass ; he has covered my paths with darkness .
CJB	Job	19	9	He has stripped me of my glory and removed the crown from my head .
CJB	Job	19	10	He tears every part of me down — I am gone ; he uproots my hope like a tree .
CJB	Job	19	11	“ Inflamed with anger against me , he counts me as one of his foes .
CJB	Job	19	12	His troops advance together , they make their way against me and encamp around my tent .
CJB	Job	19	13	“ He has made my brothers keep their distance , those who know me are wholly estranged from me ,
CJB	Job	19	14	my kinsfolk have failed me , and my close friends have forgotten me .
CJB	Job	19	15	Those living in my house consider me a stranger ; my slave-girls too — in their view I ’ m a foreigner .
CJB	Job	19	16	I call my servant , and he doesn ’ t answer , even if I beg him for a favor !
CJB	Job	19	17	“ My wife can ’ t stand my breath , I am loathsome to my own family .
CJB	Job	19	18	Even young children despise me — if I stand up , they start jeering at me .
CJB	Job	19	20	My bones stick to my skin and flesh ; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth .
CJB	Job	19	21	“ Pity me , friends of mine , pity me ! For the hand of God has struck me !
CJB	Job	19	22	Must you pursue me as God does , never satisfied with my flesh ?
CJB	Job	19	23	I wish my words were written down , that they were inscribed in a scroll ,
CJB	Job	19	24	that , engraved with iron and filled with lead , they were cut into rock forever !
CJB	Job	19	25	“ But I know that my Redeemer lives , that in the end he will rise on the dust ;
CJB	Job	19	26	so that after my skin has been thus destroyed , then even without my flesh , I will see God .
CJB	Job	19	27	I will see him for myself , my eyes , not someone else ’ s , will behold him . My heart grows weak inside me !
CJB	Job	19	28	“ If you say , ‘ How will we persecute him ? ’ — the root of the matter is found in me .
CJB	Job	19	29	You had best fear the sword , for anger brings the punishment of the sword , so that you will know there is judgment ! ”
CJB	Job	20	20	because his appetite would not let him rest , in his greed he let nothing escape ;
CJB	Job	20	2	“ My thoughts are pressing me to answer ; I feel such an urge to speak !
CJB	Job	20	3	I have heard reproof that outrages me , but a spirit past my understanding gives me a reply .
CJB	Job	20	4	“ Don ’ t you know that ever since time began , ever since humans were placed on earth ,
CJB	Job	20	5	that the triumph of the wicked is always short-lived , and the joy of the ungodly is gone in a moment ?
CJB	Job	20	6	His pride may mount to the heavens , his head may touch the clouds ;
CJB	Job	20	7	but he will vanish completely , like his own dung — those who used to see him will ask , ‘ Where is he ? ’
CJB	Job	20	8	Like a dream he flies off and is not found again ; like a vision in the night he is chased away .
CJB	Job	20	9	The eye which once saw him will see him no more , his place will not behold him again .
CJB	Job	20	10	His children will have to pay back the poor ; his hands will restore their wealth .
CJB	Job	20	11	His bones may be filled with [ the vigor of ] his youth , but it will join him lying in the dust .
CJB	Job	20	12	“ Wickedness may taste sweet in his mouth , he may savor and roll it around on his tongue ,
CJB	Job	20	13	he may linger over it and not let it go but keep it there in his mouth —
CJB	Job	20	14	yet in his stomach his food goes bad , it works inside him like snake venom ;
CJB	Job	20	15	the wealth he swallows he vomits back up ; God makes him disgorge it .
CJB	Job	20	16	He sucks the poison of asps , the viper ’ s fangs will kill him .
CJB	Job	20	17	He will not enjoy the rivers , the streams flowing with honey and cream .
CJB	Job	20	18	He will have to give back what he toiled for ; he won ’ t get to swallow it down — to the degree that he acquired wealth , he won ’ t get to enjoy it .
CJB	Job	20	19	“ For he crushed and abandoned the poor , seizing houses he did not build ,
CJB	Job	20	21	nothing is left that he did not devour ; therefore his well-being will not last .
CJB	Job	20	22	With all needs satisfied , he will be in distress ; the full force of misery will come over him .
CJB	Job	20	23	“ This is what will fill his belly ! — [ God ] will lay on him all his burning anger and make it rain over him , into his insides .
CJB	Job	20	24	If he flees from the weapon of iron , the bow of bronze will pierce him through —
CJB	Job	20	25	he pulls the arrow out of his back , the shining tip comes out from his innards ; terrors come upon him .
CJB	Job	20	26	“ Total darkness is laid up for his treasures , a fire fanned by no one will consume him , and calamity awaits what is left in his tent .
CJB	Job	20	27	The heavens will reveal his guilt , and the earth will rise up against him .
CJB	Job	20	28	The income of his household will be carried off ; his goods will flow away on the day of his wrath .
CJB	Job	20	29	This is God ’ s reward for the wicked , the heritage God decrees for him . ”
CJB	Job	21	21	What joy can they have in their family after them , given that their months are numbered ?
CJB	Job	21	2	“ Listen carefully to my words ; let this be the comfort you give me .
CJB	Job	21	3	Bear with me as I speak ; then , after I have spoken , you can go on mocking .
CJB	Job	21	4	“ As for me , is my complaint merely to other people ? Don ’ t I have grounds for being short-tempered ?
CJB	Job	21	5	Look at me , and be appalled ; cover your mouth with your hand !
CJB	Job	21	6	Whenever I recall it , I am in shock ; my whole body shudders .
CJB	Job	21	7	“ Why do the wicked go on living , grow old and keep increasing their power ?
CJB	Job	21	8	They see their children settled with them , their posterity assured .
CJB	Job	21	9	Their houses are safe , with nothing to fear ; God ’ s rod is not on them .
CJB	Job	21	10	Their bulls are fertile without fail , their cows get pregnant and don ’ t miscarry .
CJB	Job	21	11	They produce flocks of babies , and their children dance around .
CJB	Job	21	12	They sing with tambourines and lyres and rejoice to the sound of the pipe .
CJB	Job	21	13	They spend their days in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace .
CJB	Job	21	14	“ Yet to God they said , ‘ Leave us alone ! We don ’ t want to know about your ways .
CJB	Job	21	15	What is Shaddai , that we should serve him ? What do we gain if we pray to him ? ’
CJB	Job	21	16	Isn ’ t their prosperity already theirs ? The plans of the wicked are far from me .
CJB	Job	21	17	“ How often is the lamp of the wicked put out ? How often does their calamity come upon them ? How often does [ God ] deal out pain in his anger ,
CJB	Job	21	18	to make them like straw in the wind , like chaff carried off by a storm ?
CJB	Job	21	19	God lays up for their children [ the punishment for their ] iniquity . He should lay it on [ the wicked ] themselves , so that they can feel it !
CJB	Job	21	20	Let their own eyes see their own destruction and themselves drink the wrath of Shaddai .
CJB	Job	21	22	“ Can anyone teach God knowledge ? After all , he judges those who are on high .
CJB	Job	21	23	One person dies in his full strength , completely at ease and content ;
CJB	Job	21	24	his pails are full of milk , and the marrow in his bones is moist .
CJB	Job	21	25	Another dies with embittered heart , never having tasted happiness .
CJB	Job	21	26	They lie down alike in the dust , and the worm covers them both .
CJB	Job	21	27	“ Look , I know what you are thinking and your plans to do me wrong .
CJB	Job	21	28	You ask , ‘ Where is the great man ’ s house ? Where is the tent where the wicked once lived ? ’
CJB	Job	21	29	Haven ’ t you ever questioned travelers ? Don ’ t you accept their testimony
CJB	Job	21	30	that the evil man is saved on the day of disaster , rescued on the day of wrath ?
CJB	Job	21	31	So who will confront him with his ways ? Who will repay him for what he has done ?
CJB	Job	21	32	For he is carried off to the grave , people keep watch over his tomb ,
CJB	Job	21	33	the clods of the valley are sweet to him ; so everyone follows his example , just as before him were countless others .
CJB	Job	21	34	“ Why offer me such meaningless comfort ? Of your answers , only the perfidy remains . ”
CJB	Job	22	22	Please ! Receive instruction from his mouth , and take his words to heart .
CJB	Job	22	2	“ Can a human be of advantage to God ? Can even the wisest benefit him ?
CJB	Job	22	3	Does Shaddai gain if you are righteous ? Does he profit if you make your ways blameless ?
CJB	Job	22	4	“ Is he rebuking you because you fear him ? Is this why he enters into judgment with you ?
CJB	Job	22	5	Isn ’ t it because your wickedness is great ? Aren ’ t your iniquities endless ?
CJB	Job	22	6	“ For you kept your kinsmen ’ s goods as collateral for no reason , you stripped the poorly clothed of what clothing they have ,
CJB	Job	22	7	you didn ’ t give water to the weary to drink , you withheld food from the hungry .
CJB	Job	22	8	As a wealthy man , an owner of land , and as a man of rank , who lives on it ,
CJB	Job	22	9	you sent widows away empty-handed and left the arms of orphans crushed .
CJB	Job	22	10	“ No wonder there are snares all around you , and sudden terror overwhelms you ,
CJB	Job	22	11	or darkness , so that you can ’ t see , and a flood of water that covers you up !
CJB	Job	22	12	“ Isn ’ t God in the heights of heaven , looking [ down even ] on the highest stars ?
CJB	Job	22	13	Yet you say , ‘ What does God know ? Can he see through thick darkness to judge ?
CJB	Job	22	14	The clouds veil him off , so that he can ’ t see ; he just wanders around in heaven. ’
CJB	Job	22	15	“ Are you going to keep to the old way , the one the wicked have trodden ,
CJB	Job	22	16	the ones snatched away before their time , whose foundations a flood swept away ?
CJB	Job	22	17	They said to God , ‘ Leave us alone ! What can Shaddai do to us ? ’
CJB	Job	22	18	Yet he himself had filled their homes with good things ! ( But the advice of the wicked is far away from me . )
CJB	Job	22	19	The righteous saw this and rejoiced ; the innocent laughed them to scorn —
CJB	Job	22	20	‘ Indeed , our substance has not been not cut off , but the fire has consumed their wealth. ’
CJB	Job	22	21	“ Learn to be at peace with [ God ] ; in this way good will come [ back ] to you .
CJB	Job	22	23	If you return to Shaddai , you will be built up . If you drive wickedness far from your tents ,
CJB	Job	22	24	if you lay your treasure down in the dust and the gold of Ofir among the rocks in the vadis ,
CJB	Job	22	25	and let Shaddai be your treasure and your sparkling silver ;
CJB	Job	22	26	then Shaddai will be your delight , you will lift up your face to God ;
CJB	Job	22	27	you will entreat him , and he will hear you , and you will pay what you vowed ;
CJB	Job	22	28	what you decide to do will succeed , and light will shine on your path ;
CJB	Job	22	29	when someone is brought down , you will say , ‘ It was pride , because [ God ] saves the humble. ’
CJB	Job	22	30	“ He delivers even the unclean ; so if your hands are clean , you will be delivered . ”
CJB	Job	23	23	Then Iyov answered :
CJB	Job	23	2	“ Today too my complaint is bitter ; my hand is weighed down because of my groaning .
CJB	Job	23	3	I wish I knew where I could find him ; then I would go to where he is .
CJB	Job	23	4	I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments .
CJB	Job	23	5	I would know his answering words and grasp what he would tell me .
CJB	Job	23	6	Would he browbeat me with his great power ? No , he would pay attention to me .
CJB	Job	23	7	There an upright person could reason with him ; thus I might be forever acquitted by my judge .
CJB	Job	23	8	“ If I head east , he isn ’ t there ; if I head west , I don ’ t detect him ,
CJB	Job	23	9	if I turn north , I don ’ t spot him ; in the south he is veiled , and I still don ’ t see him .
CJB	Job	23	10	Yet he knows the way I take ; when he has tested me , I will come out like gold .
CJB	Job	23	11	My feet have stayed in his footsteps ; I keep to his way without turning aside .
CJB	Job	23	12	I don ’ t withdraw from his lips ’ command ; I treasure his words more than my daily food .
CJB	Job	23	13	“ But he has no equal , so who can change him ? What he desires , he does .
CJB	Job	23	14	He will accomplish what is decreed for me , and he has many plans like this .
CJB	Job	23	15	This is why I am terrified of him ; the more I think about it , the more afraid I am —
CJB	Job	23	16	God has undermined my courage ; Shaddai frightens me .
CJB	Job	23	17	Yet I am not cut off by the darkness ; he has protected me from the deepest gloom .
CJB	Job	24	24	They are exalted for a little while ; and then they are gone , brought low , gathered in like all others , shriveled up like ears of grain .
CJB	Job	24	2	There are those who move boundary markers ; they carry off flocks and pasture them ;
CJB	Job	24	3	they drive away the orphan ’ s donkey ; as collateral , they seize the widow ’ s ox .
CJB	Job	24	4	They push the needy out of the way — the poor of the land are forced into hiding ;
CJB	Job	24	5	like wild donkeys in the wilderness , they have to go out and scavenge food , [ hoping that ] the desert will provide food for their children .
CJB	Job	24	6	They must reap in fields that are not their own and gather late grapes in the vineyards of the wicked .
CJB	Job	24	7	They pass the night without clothing , naked , uncovered in the cold ,
CJB	Job	24	8	wet with mountain rain , and hugging the rock for lack of shelter .
CJB	Job	24	9	“ There are those who pluck orphans from the breast and [ those who ] take [ the clothes of ] the poor in pledge ,
CJB	Job	24	10	so that they go about stripped , unclothed ; they go hungry , as they carry sheaves [ of grain ] ;
CJB	Job	24	11	between these men ’ s rows [ of olives ] , they make oil ; treading their winepresses , they suffer thirst .
CJB	Job	24	12	Men are groaning in the city , the mortally wounded are crying for help , yet God finds nothing amiss !
CJB	Job	24	13	“ There are those who rebel against the light — they don ’ t know its ways or stay in its paths .
CJB	Job	24	14	The murderer rises with the light to kill the poor and needy ; while at night he is like a thief .
CJB	Job	24	15	The eye of the adulterer too waits for twilight ; he thinks , ‘ No eye will see me ’ ; but [ to be sure ] , he covers his face .
CJB	Job	24	16	When it ’ s dark , they break into houses ; in the daytime , they stay out of sight . [ None of them ] know the light .
CJB	Job	24	17	For to all of them deep darkness is like morning , for the terrors of deep darkness are familiar to them .
CJB	Job	24	18	“ May they be scum on the surface of the water , may their share of land be cursed , may no one turn on the way of their vineyards ,
CJB	Job	24	19	may drought and heat steal away their snow water and Sh ’ ol those who have sinned .
CJB	Job	24	20	May the womb forget them , may worms find them sweet , may they no longer be remembered — thus may iniquity be snapped like a stick .
CJB	Job	24	21	They devour childless women and give no help to widows .
CJB	Job	24	22	“ Yet God keeps pulling the mighty along — they get up , even when not trusting their own lives .
CJB	Job	24	23	However , even if God lets them rest in safety , his eyes are on their ways .
CJB	Job	24	25	“ And even if it isn ’ t so now , still no one can prove me a liar and show that my words are worthless . ”
CJB	Job	25	25	Bildad the Shuchi said ,
CJB	Job	25	2	“ Dominion and fear belong to him ; he makes peace in his high places .
CJB	Job	25	3	Can his armies be numbered ? On whom does his light not shine ?
CJB	Job	25	4	How then can humans be righteous with God ? How can those born of women be clean ?
CJB	Job	25	5	Why , before him even the moon lacks brightness , and the stars themselves are not pure .
CJB	Job	25	6	How much less a human , who is merely a maggot , a mortal , who is only a worm ? ! ” Bible Gateway Recommends The Jerusalem Talmud : A Translation and Commentary on CD-Rom Retail : $ 179.95 Our Price : $ 79.99 Save : $ 99.96 (

CJB	Job	26	26	Then Iyov replied ,
CJB	Job	26	2	“ What great help you bring to the powerless ! what deliverance to the arm without strength !
CJB	Job	26	3	Such wonderful advice for a man lacking wisdom ! So much common sense you ’ ve expressed !
CJB	Job	26	4	Who helped you to say these words ? Whose spirit is it , coming forth from you ?
CJB	Job	26	5	“ The ghosts of the dead tremble beneath the water , with its creatures .
CJB	Job	26	6	Sh ’ ol is naked before him ; Abaddon lies uncovered .
CJB	Job	26	7	He stretches the north over chaos and suspends the earth on nothing .
CJB	Job	26	8	He binds up the water in his thick clouds , yet no cloud is torn apart by it .
CJB	Job	26	9	He shuts off the view of his throne by spreading his cloud across it .
CJB	Job	26	10	He fixed a circle on the surface of the water , defining the boundary between light and dark .
CJB	Job	26	11	The pillars of heaven tremble , aghast at his rebuke .
CJB	Job	26	12	He stirs up the sea with his power , and by his skill he strikes down Rahav .
CJB	Job	26	13	With his Spirit he spreads the heavens ; his hand pierces the fleeing serpent .
CJB	Job	26	14	And these are but the fringes of his ways ; how faint the echo we hear of him ! But who is able to grasp the meaning of his thundering power ? ”
CJB	Job	27	27	Iyov continued his speech :
CJB	Job	27	2	“ I swear by the living God , who is denying me justice , and by Shaddai , who deals with me so bitterly ,
CJB	Job	27	3	that as long my life remains in me and God ’ s breath is in my nostrils ,
CJB	Job	27	4	my lips will not speak unrighteousness , or my tongue utter deceit .
CJB	Job	27	5	Far be it from me to say you are right ; I will keep my integrity till the day I die .
CJB	Job	27	6	I hold to my righteousness ; I won ’ t let it go ; my heart will not shame me as long as I live .
CJB	Job	27	7	“ May my enemy meet the doom of the wicked ; my foe the fate of the unrighteous .
CJB	Job	27	8	For what hope does the godless have from his gain when God takes away his life ?
CJB	Job	27	9	Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him ?
CJB	Job	27	10	Will he take delight in Shaddai and always call on God ?
CJB	Job	27	11	“ I am teaching you how God uses his power , not hiding what Shaddai is doing .
CJB	Job	27	12	Look , you all can see for yourselves ; so why are you talking such empty nonsense ?
CJB	Job	27	13	“ This is God ’ s reward for the wicked man , the heritage oppressors receive from Shaddai :
CJB	Job	27	14	if his sons become many , they go to the sword ; and his children never have enough to eat .
CJB	Job	27	15	Those of his who remain are buried by plague , and their widows do not weep .
CJB	Job	27	16	Even if he piles up silver like dust and stores away clothing [ in mounds ] like clay —
CJB	Job	27	17	he may collect it , but the just will wear it , and the upright divide up the silver .
CJB	Job	27	18	He builds his house weak as a spider ’ s web , as flimsy as a watchman ’ s shack .
CJB	Job	27	19	He may lie down rich , but his wealth yields nothing ; when he opens his eyes , it isn ’ t there .
CJB	Job	27	20	Terrors overtake him like a flood ; at night a whirlwind steals him away .
CJB	Job	27	21	The east wind carries him off , and he ’ s gone ; it sweeps him far from his place .
CJB	Job	27	22	Yes , it hurls itself at him , sparing nothing ; he does all he can to flee from its power .
CJB	Job	27	23	[ People ] clap their hands at him in derision and hiss him out of his home .
CJB	Job	28	28	And to human beings he said , ‘ Look , fear of Adonai is wisdom ! Shunning evil is understanding ! ’ ”
CJB	Job	28	2	iron is extracted from the earth , and copper is smelted from ore.
CJB	Job	28	3	Miners conquer the darkness and dig as far in as they can , to the ore in gloom and deep darkness .
CJB	Job	28	4	There where no one lives , they break open a shaft ; the feet passing over are oblivious to them ; far from people , suspended in space , they swing to and fro .
CJB	Job	28	5	“ While the earth is [ peacefully ] yielding bread , underneath , it is being convulsed as if by fire ;
CJB	Job	28	6	its rocks have veins of sapphire , and there are flecks of gold .
CJB	Job	28	7	Birds of prey don ’ t know that path , no falcon ’ s eye has seen it ,
CJB	Job	28	8	the proud beasts have never set foot on it , no lion has ever passed over it .
CJB	Job	28	9	“ [ The miner ] attacks the flint , overturns mountains at their roots ,
CJB	Job	28	10	and cuts out galleries in the rock , all the while watching for something of value .
CJB	Job	28	11	He dams up streams to keep them from flooding , and brings what was hidden out into the light .
CJB	Job	28	12	“ But where can wisdom be found ? Where is the source of understanding ?
CJB	Job	28	13	No one knows its value , and it can ’ t be found in the land of the living .
CJB	Job	28	14	The deep says , ‘ It isn ’ t in me , ’ and the sea says , ‘ It isn ’ t with me. ’
CJB	Job	28	15	It can ’ t be obtained with gold , nor can silver be weighed out to buy it .
CJB	Job	28	16	It can ’ t be purchased with choice gold from Ofir , or with precious onyx or sapphires .
CJB	Job	28	17	Neither gold nor glass can be compared with it ; nor can it be exchanged for a bowl of fine gold ,
CJB	Job	28	18	let alone coral or crystal ; for indeed , the price of wisdom is above that of pearls .
CJB	Job	28	19	It can ’ t be compared with Ethiopian topaz , and it can ’ t be valued with pure gold .
CJB	Job	28	20	“ So where does wisdom come from ? where is the source of understanding ,
CJB	Job	28	21	inasmuch as it is hidden from the eyes of all living and kept secret from the birds flying around in the sky ?
CJB	Job	28	22	Destruction and Death say , ‘ We have heard a rumor about it with our ears. ’
CJB	Job	28	23	“ God understands its way , and he knows its place .
CJB	Job	28	24	For he can see to the ends of the earth and view everything under heaven .
CJB	Job	28	25	When he determined the force of the wind and parceled out water by measure ,
CJB	Job	28	26	when he made a law for the rain and cleared a path for the thunderbolts ;
CJB	Job	28	27	then he saw [ wisdom ] and declared it , yes , he set it up and searched it out .
CJB	Job	29	29	Iyov went on speaking :
CJB	Job	29	2	“ I wish I were as in the old days , back in the times when God watched over me ;
CJB	Job	29	3	when his lamp shone over my head , and I walked through the dark by its light ;
CJB	Job	29	4	as I was when I was young , and God ’ s counsel graced my tent .
CJB	Job	29	5	Then Shaddai was still with me , my children were around me ;
CJB	Job	29	6	my steps were awash in butter , and the rocks poured out for me streams of olive oil .
CJB	Job	29	7	I would go out to the city gate and set up my seat in the open space ;
CJB	Job	29	8	when young men saw me they would hide themselves , while the aged arose and stood ;
CJB	Job	29	9	leaders refrained from speaking — they would lay their hands on their mouths ;
CJB	Job	29	10	the voices of nobles were silenced ; their tongues stuck to their palates .
CJB	Job	29	11	Any ear that heard me blessed me , any eye that saw me gave witness to me ,
CJB	Job	29	12	for I delivered the poor when they cried for assistance , the orphan too , who had no one to help him .
CJB	Job	29	13	Those who had been about to die would bless me , and I made widows sing in their hearts for joy .
CJB	Job	29	14	I clothed myself with righteousness , and it clothed itself with me ; my justice was like a robe and a crown .
CJB	Job	29	15	I was eyes for the blind , and I was feet for the lame .
CJB	Job	29	16	I was a father to the needy , and I investigated the problems of those I didn ’ t know .
CJB	Job	29	17	I broke the jaws of the unrighteous and snatched the prey from his teeth .
CJB	Job	29	18	“ I said , ‘ I will die with my nest , and I will live as long as a phoenix ;
CJB	Job	29	19	my root will spread till it reaches water , and dew will stay all night on my branch ;
CJB	Job	29	20	my glory will always be fresh , my bow always new in my hand. ’
CJB	Job	29	21	“ People would listen to me ; they waited and were silent when I gave advice .
CJB	Job	29	22	After I spoke , they didn ’ t talk back ; my words were like drops [ of dew ] on them .
CJB	Job	29	23	They waited for me as if for rain , as if for spring rain , with their mouths open wide .
CJB	Job	29	24	When I joked with them , they couldn ’ t believe it ; and they never darkened the light on my face .
CJB	Job	29	25	I chose their way [ for them ] , sitting as chief ; I lived like a king in the army , like one who comforts mourners .
CJB	Job	30	30	My skin is black and falling off me , and my bones are burning with heat .
CJB	Job	30	2	What use to me was the strength in their hands ? All their vigor had left them .
CJB	Job	30	3	Worn out by want and hunger , they gnaw the dry ground in the gloom of waste and desolation .
CJB	Job	30	4	They pluck saltwort and bitter leaves ; these , with broom tree roots , are their food .
CJB	Job	30	5	They are driven away from society , with men shouting after them as after a thief ,
CJB	Job	30	6	to live in gullies and vadis , in holes in the ground and caves in the rocks .
CJB	Job	30	7	Among the bushes they howl like beasts and huddle among the nettles ,
CJB	Job	30	8	irresponsible nobodies driven from the land .
CJB	Job	30	9	“ Now I have become their song ; yes , I am a byword with them .
CJB	Job	30	10	They loathe me , they stand aloof from me ; they don ’ t hesitate to spit in my face !
CJB	Job	30	11	For God has loosened my bowstring and humbled me ; they throw off restraint in my presence .
CJB	Job	30	12	At my right the street urchins attack , pushing me from place to place , besieging me with their ways of destruction ,
CJB	Job	30	13	breaking up my path , furthering my calamity — even those who have no one to help them .
CJB	Job	30	14	They move in as through a wide gap ; amid the ruin they roll on in waves .
CJB	Job	30	15	Terrors tumble over me , chasing my honor away like the wind ; my [ hope of ] salvation passes like a cloud .
CJB	Job	30	16	“ So now my life is ebbing away , days of grief have seized me .
CJB	Job	30	17	At night pain pierces me to the bone , so that I never rest .
CJB	Job	30	18	My clothes are disfigured by the force [ of my disease ] ; they choke me like the collar of my coat .
CJB	Job	30	19	[ God ] has thrown me into the mud ; I have become like dust and ashes .
CJB	Job	30	20	“ I call out to you [ God ] , but you don ’ t answer me ; I stand up to plead , but you just look at me .
CJB	Job	30	21	You have turned cruelly against me ; with your powerful hand you keep persecuting me .
CJB	Job	30	22	You snatch me up on the wind and make me ride it ; you toss me about in the tempest .
CJB	Job	30	23	For I know that you will bring me to death , the house assigned to everyone living .
CJB	Job	30	24	“ Surely [ God ] wouldn ’ t strike at a ruin , if in one ’ s calamity one cried out to him for help .
CJB	Job	30	25	Didn ’ t I weep for those who were in trouble ? Didn ’ t I grieve for the needy ?
CJB	Job	30	26	Yet when I hoped for good , what came was bad ; when I expected light , what came was darkness .
CJB	Job	30	27	My insides are in turmoil ; they can ’ t find rest ; days of misery confront me .
CJB	Job	30	28	I go about in sunless gloom , I rise in the assembly and cry for help .
CJB	Job	30	29	I have become a brother to jackals and a companion of ostriches .
CJB	Job	30	31	So my lyre is tuned for mourning , my pipe to the voice of those who weep .
CJB	Job	31	31	“ Was there anyone in my tent who didn ’ t say , ‘ No one can find a single person whom he has not filled with his meat ’ ?
CJB	Job	31	2	“ What share does God give from above ? What is the heritage from Shaddai on high ?
CJB	Job	31	3	Isn ’ t it calamity to the unrighteous ? disaster to those who do evil ?
CJB	Job	31	4	Doesn ’ t he see my ways and count all my steps ?
CJB	Job	31	5	“ If I have gone along with falsehood , if my feet have hurried to deceit ;
CJB	Job	31	6	then let me be weighed on an honest scale , so that God will know my integrity .
CJB	Job	31	7	“ If my steps have wandered from the way , if my heart has followed my eyes , if the least dirt has stuck to my hands ;
CJB	Job	31	8	then let me sow and someone else eat , let what grows from my fields be uprooted .
CJB	Job	31	9	“ If my heart has been enticed toward a woman , and I have lain in wait at my neighbor ’ s door ;
CJB	Job	31	10	then let my wife grind for another man , and let others kneel on her .
CJB	Job	31	11	For that would be a heinous act , a criminal offense ,
CJB	Job	31	12	a fire that would burn to the depths of Abaddon , uprooting all I produce .
CJB	Job	31	13	“ If I ever rejected my slave or slave-girl ’ s cause , when they brought legal action against me ;
CJB	Job	31	14	then what would I do if God stood up ? Were he to intervene , what answer could I give ?
CJB	Job	31	15	Didn ’ t he who made me in the womb make them too ? Didn ’ t the same one shape us both before our birth ?
CJB	Job	31	16	“ If I held back anything needed by the poor or made a widow ’ s eye grow dim [ with tears ] ,
CJB	Job	31	17	or ate my portion of food by myself , without letting the orphan eat any of it —
CJB	Job	31	18	No ! From my youth he grew up with me as if with a father , and I have been her guide from my mother ’ s womb ! —
CJB	Job	31	19	or if I saw a traveler needing clothing , someone in need who had no covering ,
CJB	Job	31	20	who didn ’ t bless me from his heart for being warmed with the fleece from my sheep ,
CJB	Job	31	21	or if I lifted my hand against an orphan , knowing that no one would dare charge me in court ;
CJB	Job	31	22	then let my arm fall from its socket , and let my forearm be broken at the elbow !
CJB	Job	31	23	For calamity from God has always terrified me ; before his majesty I could never do a thing [ like that ] .
CJB	Job	31	24	“ If I made gold my hope , if I said to fine gold , ‘ You are my security , ’
CJB	Job	31	25	if I took joy in my great wealth , in my having acquired so much ;
CJB	Job	31	26	or if , on seeing the shining sun or the full moon as it moved through the sky ,
CJB	Job	31	27	my heart was secretly seduced , so that I would wave them a kiss with my hand ;
CJB	Job	31	28	then this too would be a criminal offense , for I would have been lying to God on high .
CJB	Job	31	29	“ Did I rejoice at the destruction of him who hated me ? Was I filled with glee when disaster overtook him ?
CJB	Job	31	30	No , I did not allow my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse .
CJB	Job	31	32	No stranger had to sleep in the street ; I kept my house open to the traveler .
CJB	Job	31	33	“ If I concealed my sins , as most people do , by hiding my wrongdoing in my heart ,
CJB	Job	31	34	from fear of general gossip or dread of some family ’ s contempt . keeping silent and not going outdoors —
CJB	Job	31	35	I wish I had someone who would listen to me ! Here is my signature ; let Shaddai answer me ! I wish I had the indictment my adversary has written !
CJB	Job	31	36	I would carry it on my shoulder ; I would bind it on me like a crown .
CJB	Job	31	37	I would declare to him every one of my steps ; I would approach him like a prince .
CJB	Job	31	38	“ If my land cried out against me , if its furrows wept together ,
CJB	Job	31	39	if I ate its produce without paying or made its owners despair ;
CJB	Job	31	40	then let thistles grow instead of wheat and noxious weeds instead of barley ! “ The words of Iyov are finished . ”
CJB	Job	32	32	So these three men stopped trying to answer Iyov , because he remained convinced of his own righteousness .
CJB	Job	32	2	But then the anger of Elihu the son of Barakh ’ el the Buzi , from the family of Ram , blazed up against Iyov for thinking he was right and God wrong .
CJB	Job	32	3	His anger also blazed up against his three friends , because they had found no answer to Iyov but condemned him anyway .
CJB	Job	32	4	Elihu had waited to speak to Iyov because they were older than he ;
CJB	Job	32	5	however , when Elihu saw that these three had no answer , his anger flared up .
CJB	Job	32	6	Elihu the son of Barakh ’ el the Buzi said : “ I am young , and you are old , so I held back from telling you my opinion .
CJB	Job	32	7	I said , ‘ Age should speak ; an abundance of years should teach wisdom. ’
CJB	Job	32	8	But it is the spirit in a person , the breath from Shaddai , that gives him understanding —
CJB	Job	32	9	it isn ’ t [ only ] the great who are wise or the aged who know how to judge .
CJB	Job	32	10	Therefore , I say , listen to me ; I too will express my opinion .
CJB	Job	32	11	“ Here , I waited for your words , I listened to your reasoning , as you were searching for what to say .
CJB	Job	32	12	I paid attention to you , but none of you convicted Iyov or refuted his arguments .
CJB	Job	32	13	So don ’ t say , ‘ We found the wise course — Let God defeat him , not a human being. ’
CJB	Job	32	14	For he did not direct his words against me , and I won ’ t answer him with your arguments .
CJB	Job	32	15	“ They are confused , they don ’ t reply , words have failed them .
CJB	Job	32	16	But must I wait just because they don ’ t speak , just because they stand there , stuck for an answer ?
CJB	Job	32	17	No , I will now give my answer ; I too will express my opinion .
CJB	Job	32	18	For I am full of words ; the spirit within me compels me .
CJB	Job	32	19	Yes , my insides feel like new wine under pressure , like new wineskins ready to burst .
CJB	Job	32	20	I must speak , to find relief ; I will open my lips and answer .
CJB	Job	32	21	I will show no favor to anyone , and I will flatter no one ;
CJB	Job	32	22	I don ’ t know how to flatter ; if I did , my maker would soon put an end to me .
CJB	Job	33	33	If not , then listen to me ; keep quiet , and I will teach you wisdom . ”
CJB	Job	33	2	Look , I am opening my mouth ; the words are on the tip of my tongue .
CJB	Job	33	3	I will say exactly what is on my mind ; what my lips know , they will speak sincerely .
CJB	Job	33	4	It is the Spirit of God that made me , the breath of Shaddai that gives me life .
CJB	Job	33	5	So refute me , if you can ; organize your words , take your stand !
CJB	Job	33	6	Look , before God I ’ m the same as you ; I too am fashioned from clay .
CJB	Job	33	7	You don ’ t need to be afraid of me ; my pressure on you will not be heavy .
CJB	Job	33	8	“ You spoke within my hearing , and I heard what you said —
CJB	Job	33	9	‘ I am clean , without transgression ; I am innocent , not guilty .
CJB	Job	33	10	Yet [ God ] finds pretexts for accusing me ; he regards me as his enemy .
CJB	Job	33	11	He puts my feet in the stocks and watches wherever I go. ’
CJB	Job	33	12	“ But in this , you are wrong ; I will answer you : God is greater than any mortal .
CJB	Job	33	13	Why do you strive against him ? He will not defend his words —
CJB	Job	33	14	God speaks once , even twice , and still the hearer misses the point .
CJB	Job	33	15	“ In a dream , in a vision at night , when slumber falls upon people , as they sleep in their beds ,
CJB	Job	33	16	he opens people ’ s ears and seals the matter with a warning ,
CJB	Job	33	17	to turn a person away from his action and protect a man from pride ,
CJB	Job	33	18	so that he will keep himself away from the pit and from perishing by the sword .
CJB	Job	33	19	“ He is also warned by pain when in bed , when all his bones are hurting ;
CJB	Job	33	20	so that he detests bread as well as richer food .
CJB	Job	33	21	His flesh wastes away , till one can ’ t stand to look ; his bones protrude and become unsightly .
CJB	Job	33	22	His soul comes close to the pit and his life to those who bring death .
CJB	Job	33	23	“ If there is for him an angel , a mediator , one among a thousand , who can vouch for the man ’ s uprightness ;
CJB	Job	33	24	then [ God ] is gracious to him and says , ‘ Redeem him from going down to the pit ; I have found a ransom. ’
CJB	Job	33	25	His flesh becomes fresher than that of a child , he returns to the days of his youth .
CJB	Job	33	26	He prays to God and is accepted by him , so that he sees [ God ’ s ] face with joy , and [ God ] repays the man for his righteousness .
CJB	Job	33	27	He declares before everyone , ‘ I sinned ; I perverted what was right , and it gained me nothing .
CJB	Job	33	28	[ God ] redeemed me from going into the pit , and now my life sees light. ’
CJB	Job	33	29	God will accomplish all these things twice , even three times , with a man ,
CJB	Job	33	30	to bring him back from the pit , so that he can enjoy the light of the living .
CJB	Job	33	31	“ Pay attention , Iyov , listen to me ; keep quiet , and I will keep speaking .
CJB	Job	33	32	If you have something to say , answer me ; speak , because I want to show that you are right .
CJB	Job	34	34	Intelligent people will tell me , every wise man who hears me will say ,
CJB	Job	34	2	“ Hear my words , you sages ! Listen to me , you who know so much !
CJB	Job	34	3	For the ear tests words , just as the palate tastes food .
CJB	Job	34	4	Let ’ s choose for ourselves what is just ; let ’ s decide among ourselves what is good .
CJB	Job	34	5	For Iyov says , ‘ I am in the right , but God is denying me justice .
CJB	Job	34	6	Against justice , I am considered a liar ; my wound is mortal , though I committed no crime. ’
CJB	Job	34	7	“ Is there a man like Iyov , who drinks in scoffing like water ,
CJB	Job	34	8	who keeps company with evildoers and goes with wicked men ,
CJB	Job	34	9	since he thinks , ‘ It profits a person nothing to be in accord with God ’ ?
CJB	Job	34	10	“ So listen to me , you men with sense ! Far be it from God to do anything wicked !
CJB	Job	34	11	For he pays people back for what they do and sees that each gets what his conduct deserves .
CJB	Job	34	12	It is certain that God does nothing wicked ; Shaddai will not pervert justice .
CJB	Job	34	13	Did someone else put him in charge of the earth ? Who else established the entire world ?
CJB	Job	34	14	If he were to take back man ’ s heart to himself , if he gathered to himself his spirit and breath ;
CJB	Job	34	15	all flesh would instantly perish , everyone would return to dust .
CJB	Job	34	16	“ If you have any sense , [ Iyov , ] hear this ; listen to what I am saying . 17-18 Should a hater of justice be in control ? If you wouldn ’ t tell a king , ‘ You ’ re a scoundrel ! ’ or nobles , ‘ You are wicked men ! ’ then you shouldn ’ t condemn the Just and Mighty One ,
CJB	Job	34	19	who is neither partial toward princes nor favors the rich over the poor , since they all are the work of his hands .
CJB	Job	34	20	They may die in a moment , in the middle of the night — the people are shaken and pass away , the mighty are removed without human hands .
CJB	Job	34	21	For he keeps watch on a person ’ s ways ; he sees his every step .
CJB	Job	34	22	There is no darkness , no death-like gloom , where wrongdoers can hide ;
CJB	Job	34	23	for he doesn ’ t give warning to people when they must appear before God in judgment .
CJB	Job	34	24	He shatters the mighty without needing to investigate and sets up others in their place .
CJB	Job	34	25	Therefore , aware of what they are doing , he overturns them by night , and they are crushed .
CJB	Job	34	26	He strikes them as if they were common criminals in the open sight of others ,
CJB	Job	34	27	because they turned away from following him and gave no thought to any of his ways ,
CJB	Job	34	28	thereby bringing before him the cries of the poor ; and he hears the cries of the oppressed .
CJB	Job	34	29	“ But if God is silent , who can accuse him ; if he hides his face , who can see him ? He may do this to nations and persons alike ,
CJB	Job	34	30	so that godless men will not become kings , and the people will not be lured into traps .
CJB	Job	34	31	“ For has anyone said to God , ‘ I have been chastised without having offended ;
CJB	Job	34	32	teach me what I have failed to see ; and if I have done wrong , I will do it no more ’ ?
CJB	Job	34	33	Must his rewards meet your approval ? Well , you are the one who doesn ’ t like them , so you , not I , should pick the alternative ; come on , say what you think !
CJB	Job	34	35	‘ Iyov is speaking without thinking ; his words lack discernment. ’
CJB	Job	34	36	“ I wish Iyov would be kept on trial forever , because he answers like wicked men .
CJB	Job	34	37	For now to his sin he adds rebellion ; he [ mockingly ] claps his hands among us and keeps adding to his words against God . ”
CJB	Job	35	35	Elihu went on to say :
CJB	Job	35	2	“ Are you so convinced you are right , that you say , ‘ I am more just than God ’ ?
CJB	Job	35	3	For you ask what advantage it is to you , ‘ How do I gain from not sinning ? ’
CJB	Job	35	4	“ Here is my answer to you , to you and to your friends :
CJB	Job	35	5	Look at the heavens and see ; observe the skies , high above you .
CJB	Job	35	6	If you sin , how do you hurt him ? If your crimes are many , how do you affect him ?
CJB	Job	35	7	If you are righteous , what do you give him ? What benefit does he get from you ?
CJB	Job	35	8	Your wickedness can affect only others like you , and your righteousness only other human beings .
CJB	Job	35	9	People cry out from under many oppressions ; they cry for help from under the fist of the mighty .
CJB	Job	35	10	But no one asks , ‘ Where is God my maker , who causes glad songs to ring out at night ,
CJB	Job	35	11	who teaches us more than he teaches wild animals and makes us wiser than the birds in the air ? ’
CJB	Job	35	12	They may cry out , but no one answers , because of evil men ’ s pride .
CJB	Job	35	13	For God will not listen to empty cries ; Shaddai pays no attention to them .
CJB	Job	35	14	All the more when you say that you don ’ t see him ! Just be patient ; he ’ s considering the matter .
CJB	Job	35	15	But now , just because he doesn ’ t get angry and punish , does it mean he doesn ’ t know what arrogance is ?
CJB	Job	35	16	So Iyov is being futile when he opens his mouth ; he is piling up words without knowledge . ”
CJB	Job	36	36	Elihu added :
CJB	Job	36	2	“ Bear with me a little , and I will show you that there is more to say on God ’ s behalf .
CJB	Job	36	3	I may search far and wide for my arguments , but I will ascribe righteousness to God my maker .
CJB	Job	36	4	For the fact is that my words are true ; you have with you a man whose views are pure .
CJB	Job	36	5	“ Look , God is powerful and despises no one , powerful in his strength of understanding .
CJB	Job	36	6	He does not preserve the lives of the wicked , but he gives justice to the poor .
CJB	Job	36	7	He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous ; but when he sets kings on their throne forever , they may become proud ;
CJB	Job	36	8	if , then , they are bound in chains , held in oppressive cords ,
CJB	Job	36	9	he shows them the results of their doings , the crimes caused by their pride .
CJB	Job	36	10	He sounds a warning in their ears and orders them to repent of their evil .
CJB	Job	36	11	“ If they pay attention and obey him , they spend their days in prosperity ; their years pass pleasantly .
CJB	Job	36	12	But if they don ’ t pay attention , they perish by the sword and die without learning their lesson .
CJB	Job	36	13	The godless in heart cherish their anger , not crying for help when he binds them .
CJB	Job	36	14	Their soul perishes in their youth , and their life becomes depraved .
CJB	Job	36	15	“ God , with his affliction , delivers the afflicted ; and he gets their attention by pressing on them .
CJB	Job	36	16	Indeed [ Iyov ] , he is drawing you away from distress to an untroubled open place , with rich food on your table .
CJB	Job	36	17	But the judgment on the wicked applies fully to you , judgment and condemnation take hold [ of them ] .
CJB	Job	36	18	For beware of wrath when abundance entices you ; don ’ t let a big bribe turn you aside .
CJB	Job	36	19	Will your great wealth help you ? or all your efforts , no matter how strong ?
CJB	Job	36	20	Don ’ t desire the night , when people suddenly die .
CJB	Job	36	21	Be careful ; turn away from wrongdoing ; for because of this , you have been tested by affliction .
CJB	Job	36	22	“ Look , God is exalted in his strength ; who is a teacher like him ?
CJB	Job	36	23	Who ever prescribed his course for him ? Who ever said , ‘ What you are doing is wrong ’ ?
CJB	Job	36	24	Remember , rather , to magnify his work , of which many have sung .
CJB	Job	36	25	Everyone has seen it , [ but ] humans see it [ only ] from a distance .
CJB	Job	36	26	Look , God is great , beyond what we can know ; the number of his years is uncountable .
CJB	Job	36	27	“ He makes the droplets of water , which condense into rain from his mist .
CJB	Job	36	28	The clouds pour it down upon humankind in abundance .
CJB	Job	36	29	Can anyone fathom the spreading of the clouds , or the crashes that come from his canopy ?
CJB	Job	36	30	See how he scatters his lightning over it and covers the roots of the sea .
CJB	Job	36	31	By these things he judges the people and also gives food in plenty .
CJB	Job	36	32	He gathers the lightning into his hands and commands it to strike the target .
CJB	Job	36	33	Its crashing announces its presence and apprises the cattle of what is coming .
CJB	Job	37	37	“ At this , my own heart trembles and leaps out of its place .
CJB	Job	37	2	Just listen to the rumbling of his voice , to the thunder that comes from his mouth !
CJB	Job	37	3	He sends it out under all of heaven , his lightning to the ends of the earth .
CJB	Job	37	4	There follows a sound , a roar — he is thundering with his majestic voice , and he keeps releasing [ the lightning ] even while his voice is being heard .
CJB	Job	37	5	“ God thunders wonderfully with his voice , he does great things beyond our understanding .
CJB	Job	37	6	He says to the snow , ‘ Fall on the earth ! ’ — likewise to the light rain , also to the downpour .
CJB	Job	37	7	He brings all human activity to a stop , so that everyone he has made can know it .
CJB	Job	37	8	Then the animals go into their lairs and hibernate in their dens .
CJB	Job	37	9	“ Out of its chamber comes the storm , with cold out of the north .
CJB	Job	37	10	By the breath of God , ice is given , and the wide waters freeze over .
CJB	Job	37	11	He weighs the clouds down with moisture , and they flash forth his lightning .
CJB	Job	37	12	He , by his plans , turns them around , so they do what he commands them anywhere on earth ;
CJB	Job	37	13	he brings them forth on the earth sometimes to punish , sometimes to express his grace .
CJB	Job	37	14	“ Listen to this , Iyov ! Stop , and consider God ’ s wonders .
CJB	Job	37	15	Do you know how God puts them in place , how he causes lightning to flash from his cloud ?
CJB	Job	37	16	Do you know how he balances the clouds ? These are marvels of him who knows everything !
CJB	Job	37	17	“ You , sweltering in your clothing as the earth lies still under a sultry south wind ,
CJB	Job	37	18	can you , with him , spread out the sky , hard as a cast metal mirror ?
CJB	Job	37	19	Teach us what we should tell him , for the darkness keeps us from organizing our case .
CJB	Job	37	20	Is he to be told that I will speak ? Can a man speak at all when he is already swallowed up ?
CJB	Job	37	21	Now people don ’ t see the light , which is bright in the sky ; but then the wind blows and clears [ the clouds ] away .
CJB	Job	37	22	Out of the north comes a golden glow , fearsome majesty surrounding God .
CJB	Job	37	23	Shaddai , whom we can not find , whose power is immense , in his great righteousness does not pervert justice .
CJB	Job	37	24	This is why people fear him ; he does not consider those who think of themselves as wise . ”
CJB	Job	38	38	so that the dust becomes a mass [ of mud ] , and its clods stick together ?
CJB	Job	38	2	“ Who is this , darkening my plans with his ignorant words ?
CJB	Job	38	3	Stand up like a man , and brace yourself ; I will ask questions ; and you , give the answers !
CJB	Job	38	4	“ Where were you when I founded the earth ? Tell me , if you know so much .
CJB	Job	38	5	Do you know who determined its dimensions or who stretched the measuring line across it ?
CJB	Job	38	6	On what were its bases sunk , or who laid its cornerstone ,
CJB	Job	38	7	when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ?
CJB	Job	38	8	“ Who shut up the sea behind closed doors when it gushed forth from the womb ,
CJB	Job	38	9	when I made the clouds its blanket and dense fog its swaddling cloth ,
CJB	Job	38	10	when I made the breakers its boundary set its gates and bars ,
CJB	Job	38	11	and said , ‘ You may come this far , but no farther ; here your proud waves must stop ’ ?
CJB	Job	38	12	“ Have you ever in your life called up the dawn and made the morning know its place ,
CJB	Job	38	13	so that it could take hold of the edges of the earth and shake the wicked out of it ?
CJB	Job	38	14	Then the earth is changed like clay under a seal , until its colors are fixed like those of a garment .
CJB	Job	38	15	But from the wicked the light is withheld , and the arm raised [ to strike ] is broken .
CJB	Job	38	16	“ Have you gone down to the springs of the sea or explored the limits of the deep ?
CJB	Job	38	17	Have the gates of death been revealed to you , the gates of death-like darkness ?
CJB	Job	38	18	Have you surveyed the full extent of the earth ? Say so , if you know it all !
CJB	Job	38	19	“ Which way leads to where light has its home ? and darkness , where does it dwell ?
CJB	Job	38	20	If you knew , you could take each to its place and set it on its homeward path .
CJB	Job	38	21	You know , of course , because you were born then ; by now you must be very old !
CJB	Job	38	22	“ Have you gone into the storehouses for snow or seen the storehouses for hail ,
CJB	Job	38	23	which I save for times of trouble , for days of battle and war ?
CJB	Job	38	24	“ By what path is light dispersed , or the east wind poured out on the land ?
CJB	Job	38	25	Who cut a channel for the downpours , or a way for the lightning and thunder ,
CJB	Job	38	26	causing it to rain where no one is , in a desert without anyone there ,
CJB	Job	38	27	drenching the waste and desolate [ ground ] , till the tender grass sprouts ?
CJB	Job	38	28	Does the rain have a father ? Who is the father of dewdrops ?
CJB	Job	38	29	From whose womb does ice come ? Who gives birth to the frost of heaven ,
CJB	Job	38	30	when water becomes as hard as stone , and the surface of the deep freezes solid ?
CJB	Job	38	31	“ Can you tie up the cords of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion ?
CJB	Job	38	32	Can you lead out the constellations of the zodiac in their season or guide the Great Bear and its cubs ?
CJB	Job	38	33	Do you know the laws of the sky ? Can you determine how they affect the earth ?
CJB	Job	38	34	“ Can you raise your voice to the clouds and make them cover you with a flood of rain ?
CJB	Job	38	35	Can you send lightning bolts on their way ? Will they say to you , ‘ Here we are ’ ?
CJB	Job	38	36	“ Who put wisdom in people ’ s inner parts ? Who gave understanding to the mind ?
CJB	Job	38	37	Who , by wisdom , can number the clouds ? Who can tilt the water-skins of heaven ,
CJB	Job	38	39	“ Can you hunt prey for a lioness or satisfy the appetite of the young lions ,
CJB	Job	38	40	when they crouch in their dens or lie in ambush in their lairs ?
CJB	Job	38	41	Who provides food for the raven when his young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food ?
CJB	Job	39	39	“ Do you know when mountain goats give birth ? Have you seen deer in labor ?
CJB	Job	39	2	Can you tell how many months they carry their young ? Do you know when they give birth ,
CJB	Job	39	3	when they crouch down and bring forth their young , when they deliver their fawns ?
CJB	Job	39	4	Their young become strong , growing up in the open ; they leave and never return .
CJB	Job	39	5	“ Who lets the wild donkey roam freely ? Who sets the wild donkey loose from its shackles ?
CJB	Job	39	6	I made the ‘ Aravah its home , the salty desert its place to live .
CJB	Job	39	7	It scorns the noise of the city and hears no driver ’ s shouts .
CJB	Job	39	8	It ranges over the hills for its pasture , searching for anything green .
CJB	Job	39	9	“ Would a wild ox be willing to serve you ? Would it stay by your stall ?
CJB	Job	39	10	Could you tie a rope around its neck and make it plow furrows for you ?
CJB	Job	39	11	Would you trust its great strength enough to let it do your heavy work ,
CJB	Job	39	12	or rely on it to bring home your seed and gather the grain from your threshing-floor ?
CJB	Job	39	13	“ An ostrich ’ s wings beat wildly , although its pinions lack plumage .
CJB	Job	39	14	It leaves its eggs on the ground and lets them be warmed by the sand ,
CJB	Job	39	15	forgetting that a foot may crush them or a wild animal trample on them .
CJB	Job	39	16	It treats its chicks heartlessly , as if they were not its own ; even if her labor is in vain , it really doesn ’ t care ;
CJB	Job	39	17	because God has deprived it of wisdom and given it no share in understanding .
CJB	Job	39	18	When the time comes , it flaps its wings , scorning both horse and rider .
CJB	Job	39	19	“ Did you give the horse its strength ? Did you clothe its neck with a mane ?
CJB	Job	39	20	Did you make him able to leap like a locust ? Its majestic snorting is frightening !
CJB	Job	39	21	It paws with force and exults with vigor , then charges into the battle ;
CJB	Job	39	22	mocking at fear , unafraid , it does not shy away from the sword .
CJB	Job	39	23	The [ rider ’ s ] quiver rattles over it , [ his ] gleaming spear and javelin .
CJB	Job	39	24	Frenzied and eager , it devours the ground , scarcely believing the shofar has sounded .
CJB	Job	39	25	At the sound of the shofar it whinnies ; as from afar it scents the battle , the roar of the chiefs and the shouting .
CJB	Job	39	26	“ Is it your wisdom that sets the hawk soaring , spreading its wings toward the south ?
CJB	Job	39	27	Does the eagle fly up when you say so , to build its nest in the heights ?
CJB	Job	39	28	It lives and spends its nights on the cliffs ; a rocky crag is its fortress .
CJB	Job	39	29	From there it spots its prey , its eyes see it far off .

CJB	Job	40	40	Continuing to address Iyov , Adonai said :
CJB	Job	40	2	“ Does the critic still want to dispute Shaddai ? Let him who wants to correct God give an answer ! ”
CJB	Job	40	3	Then Iyov replied to Adonai :
CJB	Job	40	4	“ I am too ashamed ; I have nothing to say . I lay my hand over my mouth .
CJB	Job	40	5	Yes , I spoke once , but I won ’ t answer more ; all right , twice , but I won ’ t go on. ”
CJB	Job	40	6	Adonai answered Iyov out of the storm :
CJB	Job	40	7	“ Stand up like a man , and brace yourself ; I will ask questions ; and you , give the answers !
CJB	Job	40	8	“ Are you impugning my justice ? Putting me in the wrong to prove yourself right ?
CJB	Job	40	9	Do you have an arm like God ’ s ? Can you thunder with a voice like his ?
CJB	Job	40	10	Come on , deck yourself with majesty and dignity , robe yourself in glory and splendor .

CJB	Job	40	12	Look at all who are proud , and bring them down ; tread down the wicked where they stand .
CJB	Job	40	13	Bury them in the ground together , bind their faces in the hidden world .
CJB	Job	40	14	If you do this , then I will confess to you that your own power can save you .

CJB	Job	40	17	He can make his tail as stiff as a cedar , the muscles in his thighs are like cables ,

CJB	Job	40	21	He lies down under the thorny lotus bushes and is hidden by the reeds in the swamp ;

CJB	Job	40	23	If the river overflows , it doesn ’ t worry him ; he is confident even if the Yarden rushes by his mouth .
CJB	Job	40	24	Can anyone catch him by his eyes or pierce his nose with a hook ?

CJB	Job	41	34	) He looks straight at all high things . He is king over all proud beasts . ”
CJB	Job	42	42	Then [ at last , ] Iyov gave Adonai this answer :
CJB	Job	42	2	“ I know that you can do everything , that no purpose of yours can be thwarted .
CJB	Job	42	3	“ [ You asked , ] ‘ Who is this , hiding counsel , without having knowledge ? ’ Yes , I spoke , without understanding , of wonders far beyond me , which I didn ’ t know .
CJB	Job	42	4	“ Please listen , and I will speak . [ You said , ] ‘ I will ask questions ; and you , give me answers ’ —
CJB	Job	42	5	I had heard about you with my ears , but now my eye sees you ;
CJB	Job	42	6	therefore I detest [ myself ] and repent in dust and ashes. ”
CJB	Job	42	7	After Adonai had spoken these words to Iyov , Adonai said to Elifaz the Teimani , “ My anger is blazing against you and your two friends , because , unlike my servant Iyov , you have not spoken rightly about me .
CJB	Job	42	8	So now , get yourselves seven young bulls and seven rams , go to my servant Iyov , and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering . My servant Iyov will pray for you — because him I will accept — so that I won ’ t punish you as your boorishness deserves ; because you have not spoken rightly about me , as my servant Iyov has. ”
CJB	Job	42	9	So Elifaz the Teimani , Bildad the Shuchi and Tzofar the Na ‘ amati went and did what Adonai had ordered them to do , and Adonai accepted Iyov [ ’ s prayer ] .
CJB	Job	42	10	When Iyov prayed for his friends , Adonai restored his fortunes ; Adonai gave Iyov twice as much as he had had before .
CJB	Job	42	11	Then all his brothers and sisters came to him , also all who had known him before , and they ate a meal with him in his house . They consoled and comforted him for all the evils Adonai had inflicted on him . Each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring .
CJB	Job	42	12	Adonai blessed Iyov ’ s later situation even more than his earlier one — he had 14,000 sheep , 6,000 camels , 1,000 pairs of oxen and 1,000 female donkeys .
CJB	Job	42	13	He also had seven sons and three daughters .
CJB	Job	42	14	The first he named Y ’ mimah ; the second , K ’ tzi ‘ ah ; and the third , Keren-Hapukh .
CJB	Job	42	15	Nowhere in the land could women be found as beautiful as Iyov ’ s daughters ; and their father gave them inheritances along with their brothers .
CJB	Job	42	16	After this , Iyov lived
CJB	Job	42	140	years , long enough to see his sons and grandsons , four generations .
CJB	Job	42	17	Then , old and full of days , Iyov died .

CJB	Psalms	78	0	) A maskil of Asaf : (
CJB	Psalms	78	1	) Listen , my people , to my teaching ; turn your ears to the words from my mouth .
CJB	Psalms	78	2	I will speak to you in parables and explain mysteries from days of old .
CJB	Psalms	78	3	The things which we have heard and known , and which our fathers told us
CJB	Psalms	78	4	we will not hide from their descendants ; we will tell the generation to come the praises of Adonai and his strength , the wonders that he has performed .
CJB	Psalms	78	5	He raised up a testimony in Ya ‘ akov and established a Torah in Isra ’ el . He commanded our ancestors to make this known to their children ,
CJB	Psalms	78	6	so that the next generation would know it , the children not yet born , who would themselves arise and tell their own children ,
CJB	Psalms	78	7	who could then put their confidence in God , not forgetting God ’ s deeds , but obeying his mitzvot .
CJB	Psalms	78	8	Then they would not be like their ancestors , a stubborn , rebellious generation , a generation with unprepared hearts , with spirits unfaithful to God .
CJB	Psalms	78	9	The people of Efrayim , though armed with bows and arrows , turned their backs on the day of battle .
CJB	Psalms	78	10	They did not keep the covenant of God and refused to live by his Torah .
CJB	Psalms	78	11	They forgot what he had done , his wonders which he had shown them .
CJB	Psalms	78	12	He had done wonderful things in the presence of their ancestors in the land of Egypt , in the region of Tzo ‘ an .
CJB	Psalms	78	13	He split the sea and made them pass through , he made the waters stand up like a wall .
CJB	Psalms	78	14	He also led them by day with a cloud and all night long with light from a fire .
CJB	Psalms	78	15	He broke apart the rocks in the desert and let them drink as if from boundless depths ;
CJB	Psalms	78	16	yes , he brought streams out of the rock , making the water flow down like rivers .
CJB	Psalms	78	17	Yet they sinned still more against him , rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High ;
CJB	Psalms	78	18	in their hearts they tested God by demanding food that would satisfy their cravings .
CJB	Psalms	78	19	Yes , they spoke against God by asking , “ Can God spread a table in the desert ?
CJB	Psalms	78	20	True , he struck the rock , and water gushed out , until the vadis overflowed ; but what about bread ? Can he give that ? Can he provide meat for his people ? ”
CJB	Psalms	78	21	Therefore , when Adonai heard , he was angry ; fire blazed up against Ya ‘ akov ; his anger mounted against Isra ’ el ;
CJB	Psalms	78	22	because they had no faith in God , no trust in his power to save .
CJB	Psalms	78	23	So he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven .
CJB	Psalms	78	24	He rained down man on them as food ; he gave them grain from heaven —
CJB	Psalms	78	25	mortals ate the bread of angels ; he provided for them to the full .
CJB	Psalms	78	26	He stirred up the east wind in heaven , brought on the south wind by his power ,
CJB	Psalms	78	27	and rained down meat on them like dust , birds flying thick as the sand on the seashore .
CJB	Psalms	78	28	He let them fall in the middle of their camp , all around their tents .
CJB	Psalms	78	29	So they ate till they were satisfied ; he gave them what they craved .
CJB	Psalms	78	30	They were still fulfilling their craving , the food was still in their mouths ,
CJB	Psalms	78	31	when the anger of God rose up against them and slaughtered their strongest men , laying low the young men of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Psalms	78	32	Still , they kept on sinning and put no faith in his wonders .
CJB	Psalms	78	33	Therefore , he ended their days in futility and their years in terror .
CJB	Psalms	78	34	When he brought death among them , they would seek him ; they would repent and seek God eagerly ,
CJB	Psalms	78	35	remembering that God was their Rock , El ‘ Elyon their Redeemer .
CJB	Psalms	78	36	But they tried to deceive him with their words , they lied to him with their tongues ;
CJB	Psalms	78	37	for their hearts were not right with him , and they were unfaithful to his covenant .
CJB	Psalms	78	38	Yet he , because he is full of compassion , forgave their sin and did not destroy ; many times he turned away his anger and didn ’ t rouse all his wrath .
CJB	Psalms	78	39	So he remembered that they were but flesh , a wind that blows past and does not return .
CJB	Psalms	78	40	How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wastelands !
CJB	Psalms	78	41	Repeatedly they challenged God and pained the Holy One of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Psalms	78	42	They didn ’ t remember how he used his hand on the day he redeemed them from their enemy ,
CJB	Psalms	78	43	how he displayed his signs in Egypt , his wonders in the region of Tzo ‘ an .
CJB	Psalms	78	44	He turned their rivers into blood , so they couldn ’ t drink from their streams .
CJB	Psalms	78	45	He sent swarms of flies , which devoured them , and frogs , which destroyed them .
CJB	Psalms	78	46	He gave their harvest to shearer-worms , the fruit of their labor to locusts .
CJB	Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vineyards with hail and their sycamore-figs with frost .
CJB	Psalms	78	48	Their cattle too he gave over to the hail and their flocks to lightning bolts .
CJB	Psalms	78	49	He sent over them his fierce anger , fury , indignation and trouble , with a company of destroying angels
CJB	Psalms	78	50	to clear a path for his wrath . He did not spare them from death , but gave them over to the plague ,
CJB	Psalms	78	51	striking all the firstborn in Egypt , the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham .
CJB	Psalms	78	52	But his own people he led out like sheep , guiding them like a flock in the desert .
CJB	Psalms	78	53	He led them safely , and they weren ’ t afraid , even when the sea overwhelmed their foes .
CJB	Psalms	78	54	He brought them to his holy land , to the hill-country won by his right hand .
CJB	Psalms	78	55	He expelled nations before them , apportioned them property to inherit and made Isra ’ el ’ s tribes live in their tents .
CJB	Psalms	78	56	Yet they tested El ‘ Elyon and rebelled against him , refusing to obey his instructions .
CJB	Psalms	78	57	They turned away and were faithless , like their fathers ; they were unreliable , like a bow without tension .
CJB	Psalms	78	58	They provoked him with their high places and made him jealous with their idols .
CJB	Psalms	78	59	God heard , and he was angry ; he came to detest Isra ’ el completely .
CJB	Psalms	78	60	He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh , the tent he had made where he could live among people .
CJB	Psalms	78	61	He gave his strength into exile , his pride to the power of the foe .
CJB	Psalms	78	62	He gave his people over to the sword and grew angry with his own heritage .
CJB	Psalms	78	63	Fire consumed their young men , their virgins had no wedding-song ,
CJB	Psalms	78	64	their cohanim fell by the sword , and their widows could not weep .
CJB	Psalms	78	65	Then Adonai awoke , as if from sleep , like a warrior shouting for joy from wine .
CJB	Psalms	78	66	He struck his foes , driving them back and putting them to perpetual shame .
CJB	Psalms	78	67	Rejecting the tents of Yosef and passing over the tribe of Efrayim ,
CJB	Psalms	78	68	he chose the tribe of Y ’ hudah , Mount Tziyon , which he loved .
CJB	Psalms	78	69	He built his sanctuary like the heights ; like the earth , he made it to last forever .
CJB	Psalms	78	70	He chose David to be his servant , taking him from the sheep-yards ;
CJB	Psalms	78	71	from tending nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Ya ‘ akov his people , Isra ’ el his heritage .
CJB	Psalms	78	72	With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with skillful hands .

CJB	Psalms	103	3	He forgives all your offenses , he heals all your diseases ,
CJB	Psalms	103	4	he redeems your life from the pit , he surrounds you with grace and compassion ,
CJB	Psalms	103	5	he contents you with good as long as you live , so that your youth is renewed like an eagle ’ s .
CJB	Psalms	103	6	Adonai brings vindication and justice to all who are oppressed .
CJB	Psalms	103	7	He made his ways known to Moshe , his mighty deeds to the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Psalms	103	8	Adonai is merciful and compassionate , slow to anger and rich in grace .
CJB	Psalms	103	9	He will not always accuse , he will not keep his anger forever .
CJB	Psalms	103	10	He has not treated us as our sins deserve or paid us back for our offenses ,
CJB	Psalms	103	11	because his mercy toward those who fear him is as far above earth as heaven .
CJB	Psalms	103	12	He has removed our sins from us as far as the east is from the west .
CJB	Psalms	103	13	Just as a father has compassion on his children , Adonai has compassion on those who fear him .
CJB	Psalms	103	14	For he understands how we are made , he remembers that we are dust .
CJB	Psalms	103	15	Yes , a human being ’ s days are like grass , he sprouts like a flower in the countryside —
CJB	Psalms	103	16	but when the wind sweeps over , it ’ s gone ; and its place knows it no more .
CJB	Psalms	103	17	But the mercy of Adonai on those who fear him is from eternity past to eternity future , and his righteousness extends to his children ’ s children ,
CJB	Psalms	103	18	provided they keep his covenant and remember to follow his precepts .
CJB	Psalms	103	19	Adonai has established his throne in heaven ; his kingly power rules everything .

CJB	Psalms	104	104	Bless Adonai , my soul ! Adonai , my God , you are very great ; you are clothed with glory and majesty ,
CJB	Psalms	104	2	wrapped in light as with a robe . You spread out the heavens like a curtain ,
CJB	Psalms	104	3	you laid the beams of your palace on the water . You make the clouds your chariot , you ride on the wings of the wind .
CJB	Psalms	104	4	You make winds your messengers , fiery flames your servants .
CJB	Psalms	104	5	You fixed the earth on its foundations , never to be moved .
CJB	Psalms	104	6	You covered it with the deep like a garment ; the waters stood above the mountains .
CJB	Psalms	104	7	At your rebuke they fled ; at the sound of your thunder they rushed away ,
CJB	Psalms	104	8	flowing over hills , pouring into valleys , down to the place you had fixed for them .
CJB	Psalms	104	9	You determined a boundary they could not cross ; they were never to cover the earth again .
CJB	Psalms	104	10	You make springs gush forth in the vadis ; they flow between the hills ,
CJB	Psalms	104	11	supplying water to all the wild animals ; the wild donkeys quench their thirst .
CJB	Psalms	104	12	On their banks the birds of the air build their nests ; among the branches they sing .
CJB	Psalms	104	13	You water the mountains from your palace ; the earth is satisfied with how you provide —
CJB	Psalms	104	14	You grow grass for the cattle ; and for people you grow the plants they need to bring forth bread from the earth ,
CJB	Psalms	104	15	wine that gladdens the human heart , oil to make faces glow , and food to sustain their strength .
CJB	Psalms	104	16	Adonai ’ s trees are satisfied — the cedars of the L ’ vanon , which he has planted .
CJB	Psalms	104	17	In them sparrows build their nests , while storks live in the fir trees .
CJB	Psalms	104	18	For the wild goats there are the high mountains , while the coneys find refuge in the rocks .
CJB	Psalms	104	19	You made the moon to mark the seasons , and the sun knows when to set .
CJB	Psalms	104	20	You bring darkness , and it is night , the time when all forest animals prowl .
CJB	Psalms	104	21	The young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from God .
CJB	Psalms	104	22	The sun rises , they slink away and lie down to rest in their dens ;
CJB	Psalms	104	23	while people go out to their work , laboring on till evening .
CJB	Psalms	104	24	What variety there is in your works , Adonai ! How many [ of them there are ] ! In wisdom you have made them all ; the earth is full of your creations .
CJB	Psalms	104	25	Look at the sea , so great , so wide ! It teems with countless creatures , living beings , both large and small .
CJB	Psalms	104	26	The ships are there , sailing to and fro ; Livyatan , which you formed to play there .
CJB	Psalms	104	27	All of them look to you to give them their food when they need it .
CJB	Psalms	104	28	When you give it to them , they gather it ; when you open your hand , they are well satisfied .
CJB	Psalms	104	29	If you hide your face , they vanish ; if you hold back their breath , they perish and return to their dust .
CJB	Psalms	104	30	If you send out your breath , they are created , and you renew the face of the earth .
CJB	Psalms	104	31	May the glory of Adonai last forever ! May Adonai rejoice in his works !
CJB	Psalms	104	32	When he looks at the earth , it trembles ; when he touches the mountains , they pour out smoke .
CJB	Psalms	104	33	I will sing to Adonai as long as I live , sing praise to my God all my life .
CJB	Psalms	104	34	May my musings be pleasing to him ; I will rejoice in Adonai .

CJB	Psalms	105	6	You descendants of Avraham his servant , you offspring of Ya ‘ akov , his chosen ones ,
CJB	Psalms	105	7	he is Adonai our God ! His rulings are everywhere on earth .
CJB	Psalms	105	8	He remembers his covenant forever , the word he commanded to a thousand generations ,
CJB	Psalms	105	9	the covenant he made with Avraham , the oath he swore to Yitz ’ chak ,
CJB	Psalms	105	10	and established as a law for Ya ‘ akov , for Isra ’ el as an everlasting covenant :
CJB	Psalms	105	11	“ To you I will give the land of Kena ‘ an as your allotted heritage. ”
CJB	Psalms	105	12	When they were but few in number , and not only few , but aliens there too ,
CJB	Psalms	105	13	wandering from nation to nation , from this kingdom to that people ,
CJB	Psalms	105	14	he allowed no one to oppress them . Yes , for their sakes he rebuked even kings :
CJB	Psalms	105	15	“ Don ’ t touch my anointed ones or do my prophets harm ! ”
CJB	Psalms	105	16	He called down famine on the land , broke off all their food supply ,
CJB	Psalms	105	17	but sent a man ahead of them — Yosef , who was sold as a slave .
CJB	Psalms	105	18	They shackled his feet with chains , and they bound him in irons ;
CJB	Psalms	105	19	until the time when his word proved true , God ’ s utterance kept testing him .
CJB	Psalms	105	20	The king sent and had him released , the ruler of peoples set him free ;
CJB	Psalms	105	21	he made him lord of his household , in charge of all he owned ,
CJB	Psalms	105	22	correcting his officers as he saw fit and teaching his counselors wisdom .
CJB	Psalms	105	23	Then Isra ’ el too came into Egypt , Ya ‘ akov lived as an alien in the land of Ham .
CJB	Psalms	105	24	There God made his people very fruitful , made them too numerous for their foes ,
CJB	Psalms	105	25	whose hearts he turned to hate his people , and treat his servants unfairly .
CJB	Psalms	105	26	He sent his servant Moshe and Aharon , whom he had chosen .
CJB	Psalms	105	27	They worked his signs among them , his wonders in the land of Ham .
CJB	Psalms	105	28	He sent darkness , and the land grew dark ; they did not defy his word .
CJB	Psalms	105	29	He turned their water into blood and caused their fish to die .
CJB	Psalms	105	30	Their land swarmed with frogs , even in the royal chambers .
CJB	Psalms	105	31	He spoke , and there came swarms of insects and lice throughout their land .
CJB	Psalms	105	32	He gave them hail instead of rain , with fiery [ lightning ] throughout their land .
CJB	Psalms	105	33	He struck their vines and fig trees , shattering trees all over their country .
CJB	Psalms	105	34	He spoke , and locusts came , also grasshoppers without number ;
CJB	Psalms	105	35	they ate up everything green in their land , devoured the fruit of their ground .
CJB	Psalms	105	36	He struck down all the firstborn in their land , the firstfruits of all their strength .
CJB	Psalms	105	37	Then he led his people out , laden with silver and gold ; among his tribes not one stumbled .
CJB	Psalms	105	38	Egypt was happy to have them leave , because fear of [ Isra ’ el ] had seized them .
CJB	Psalms	105	39	He spread out a cloud to screen them off and fire to give them light at night .
CJB	Psalms	105	40	When they asked , he brought them quails and satisfied them with food from heaven .
CJB	Psalms	105	41	He split a rock , and water gushed out , flowing as a river over the dry ground ,
CJB	Psalms	105	42	for he remembered his holy promise to his servant Avraham .
CJB	Psalms	105	43	He led out his people with joy , his chosen ones with singing .
CJB	Psalms	105	44	Then he gave them the lands of the nations , and they possessed what peoples had toiled to produce ,
CJB	Psalms	105	45	in order to obey his laws and follow his teachings . Halleluyah !
CJB	Psalms	106	106	Halleluyah ! Give thanks to Adonai ; for he is good , for his grace continues forever .
CJB	Psalms	106	2	Who can express Adonai ’ s mighty doings or proclaim in full his praise ?
CJB	Psalms	106	3	How happy are those who act justly , who always do what is right !
CJB	Psalms	106	4	Remember me , Adonai , when you show favor to your people , keep me in mind when you save them ;
CJB	Psalms	106	5	so I can see how well things are going with those whom you have chosen , so that I can rejoice in your nation ’ s joy , and glory in your heritage .
CJB	Psalms	106	6	Together with our ancestors , we have sinned , done wrong , acted wickedly .
CJB	Psalms	106	7	Our ancestors in Egypt failed to grasp the meaning of your wonders . They didn ’ t keep in mind your great deeds of grace but rebelled at the sea , at the Sea of Suf .
CJB	Psalms	106	8	Yet he saved them for his own name ’ s sake , to make known his mighty power .
CJB	Psalms	106	9	He rebuked the Sea of Suf , and it dried up ; he led them through its depths as through a desert .
CJB	Psalms	106	10	He saved them from hostile hands , redeemed them from the power of the foe .
CJB	Psalms	106	11	The water closed over their adversaries ; not one of them was left .
CJB	Psalms	106	12	Then they believed his words , and they sang his praise .
CJB	Psalms	106	13	But soon they forgot his deeds and wouldn ’ t wait for his counsel .
CJB	Psalms	106	14	In the desert they gave way to insatiable greed ; in the wastelands they put God to the test .
CJB	Psalms	106	15	He gave them what they wanted but sent meagerness into their souls .
CJB	Psalms	106	16	In the camp they were jealous of Moshe and Aharon , Adonai ’ s holy one .
CJB	Psalms	106	17	The earth opened up and swallowed Datan and closed over Aviram ’ s allies .
CJB	Psalms	106	18	A fire blazed out against that group , the flames consumed the wicked .
CJB	Psalms	106	19	In Horev they fashioned a calf , they worshipped a cast metal image .
CJB	Psalms	106	20	Thus they exchanged their Glory for the image of an ox that eats grass !
CJB	Psalms	106	21	They forgot God , who had saved them , who had done great things in Egypt ,
CJB	Psalms	106	22	wonders in the land of Ham , fearsome deeds by the Sea of Suf .
CJB	Psalms	106	23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them , [ and he would have , ] had not Moshe his chosen one stood before him in the breach to turn back his destroying fury .
CJB	Psalms	106	24	Next , they rejected the beautiful land , they didn ’ t trust his promise ;
CJB	Psalms	106	25	and they complained in their tents , they didn ’ t obey Adonai .
CJB	Psalms	106	26	Therefore , raising his hand , he swore to them that he would strike them down in the desert
CJB	Psalms	106	27	and strike down their descendants among the nations , dispersing them in foreign lands .
CJB	Psalms	106	28	Now they joined themselves to Ba ‘ al-P ‘ or and ate meat sacrificed to dead things .
CJB	Psalms	106	29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds , so that a plague broke out among them .
CJB	Psalms	106	30	Then Pinchas stood up and executed judgment ; so the plague was checked .
CJB	Psalms	106	31	That was credited to him as righteousness , through all generations forever .
CJB	Psalms	106	32	They angered him at the M ’ rivah Spring , and Moshe suffered on their account ;
CJB	Psalms	106	33	for when they embittered his spirit , [ Moshe ] spoke up without thinking .
CJB	Psalms	106	34	They failed to destroy the peoples , as Adonai had ordered them to do ,
CJB	Psalms	106	35	but mingled with the nations and learned to follow their ways .
CJB	Psalms	106	36	They went on to serve their idols , which became a snare for them .
CJB	Psalms	106	37	They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons .
CJB	Psalms	106	38	Yes , they shed innocent blood , the blood of their own sons and daughters , whom they sacrificed to Kena ‘ an ’ s false gods , polluting the land with blood .
CJB	Psalms	106	39	Thus they were defiled by their deeds ; they prostituted themselves by their actions ,
CJB	Psalms	106	40	For this Adonai ’ s fury blazed up against his people , and he detested his heritage .
CJB	Psalms	106	41	He handed them over to the power of the nations , and those who hated them ruled over them .
CJB	Psalms	106	42	Their enemies oppressed them and kept them in subjection to their power .
CJB	Psalms	106	43	Many times [ God ] rescued them , but they kept making plans to rebel . Thus they were brought low by their own wrongdoing .
CJB	Psalms	106	44	Still he took pity on their distress whenever he heard their cry .
CJB	Psalms	106	45	For their sakes he kept in mind his covenant and in his limitless grace relented ,
CJB	Psalms	106	46	causing them to be treated with compassion by all who had taken them captive .
CJB	Psalms	106	47	Save us , Adonai our God ! Gather us from among the nations , so that we can thank your holy name and glory in praising you .
CJB	Psalms	106	48	Blessed be Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , from eternity past to eternity future . Now let all the people say , “ Amen ! Halleluyah ! ”
CJB	Psalms	107	107	Give thanks to Adonai ; for he is good , for his grace continues forever .
CJB	Psalms	107	2	Let those redeemed by Adonai say it , those he redeemed from the power of the foe .
CJB	Psalms	107	3	He gathered them from the lands , from the east and from the west , from the north and from the sea .
CJB	Psalms	107	4	They wandered in the desert , on paths through the wastes , without finding any inhabited city .
CJB	Psalms	107	5	They were hungry and thirsty , their life was ebbing away .
CJB	Psalms	107	6	In their trouble they cried to Adonai , and he rescued them from their distress .
CJB	Psalms	107	7	He led them by a direct path to a city where they could live .
CJB	Psalms	107	8	Let them give thanks to Adonai for his grace , for his wonders bestowed on humanity !
CJB	Psalms	107	9	For he has satisfied the hungry , filled the starving with good .
CJB	Psalms	107	10	Some lived in darkness , in death-dark gloom , bound in misery and iron chains ,
CJB	Psalms	107	11	because they defied God ’ s word , scorned the counsel of the Most High .
CJB	Psalms	107	12	So he humbled their hearts by hard labor ; when they stumbled , no one came to their aid .
CJB	Psalms	107	13	In their trouble they cried to Adonai , and he rescued them from their distress .
CJB	Psalms	107	14	He led them from darkness , from death-dark gloom , shattering their chains .
CJB	Psalms	107	15	Let them give thanks to Adonai for his grace , for his wonders bestowed on humanity !
CJB	Psalms	107	16	For he shattered bronze doors and cut through iron bars .
CJB	Psalms	107	17	There were foolish people who suffered affliction because of their crimes and sins ;
CJB	Psalms	107	18	they couldn ’ t stand to eat anything ; they were near the gates of death .
CJB	Psalms	107	19	In their trouble they cried to Adonai , and he rescued them from their distress ;
CJB	Psalms	107	20	he sent his word and healed them , he delivered them from destruction .
CJB	Psalms	107	21	Let them give thanks to Adonai for his grace , for his wonders bestowed on humanity !
CJB	Psalms	107	22	Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and proclaim his great deeds with songs of joy .
CJB	Psalms	107	23	Those who go down to the sea in ships , plying their trade on the great ocean ,
CJB	Psalms	107	24	saw the works of Adonai , his wonders in the deep .
CJB	Psalms	107	25	For at his word the storm-wind arose , lifting up towering waves .
CJB	Psalms	107	26	The sailors were raised up to the sky , then plunged into the depths . At the danger , their courage failed them ,
CJB	Psalms	107	27	they reeled and staggered like drunk men , and all their skill was swallowed up .
CJB	Psalms	107	28	In their trouble they cried to Adonai , and he rescued them from their distress .
CJB	Psalms	107	29	He silenced the storm and stilled its waves ,
CJB	Psalms	107	30	and they rejoiced as the sea grew calm . Then he brought them safely to their desired port .
CJB	Psalms	107	31	Let them give thanks to Adonai for his grace , for his wonders bestowed on humanity !
CJB	Psalms	107	32	Let them extol him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the leaders ’ council .
CJB	Psalms	107	33	He turns rivers into desert , flowing springs into thirsty ground ,
CJB	Psalms	107	34	productive land into salt flats , because the people living there are so wicked .
CJB	Psalms	107	35	But he also turns desert into pools of water , dry land into flowing springs ;
CJB	Psalms	107	36	there he gives the hungry a home , and they build a city to live in ;
CJB	Psalms	107	37	there they sow fields and plant vineyards , which yield an abundant harvest .
CJB	Psalms	107	38	He blesses them , their numbers grow , and he doesn ’ t let their livestock decrease .
CJB	Psalms	107	39	When their numbers fall , and they grow weak , because of oppression , disaster and sorrow ,
CJB	Psalms	107	40	he pours contempt on princes and leaves them to wander in trackless wastes .
CJB	Psalms	107	41	But the needy he raises up from their distress and increases their families like sheep .
CJB	Psalms	107	42	When the upright see this , they rejoice ; while the wicked are reduced to silence .
CJB	Psalms	107	43	Let whoever is wise observe these things and consider Adonai ’ s loving deeds .

CJB	Psalms	109	4	In return for my love they became my accusers , even though I prayed for them .

CJB	Proverbs	1	1	The proverbs of Shlomo the son of David , king of Isra ’ el ,
CJB	Proverbs	1	2	are for learning about wisdom and discipline ; for understanding words expressing deep insight ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	3	for gaining an intelligently disciplined life , doing what is right , just and fair ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	4	for endowing with caution those who don ’ t think and the young person with knowledge and discretion .
CJB	Proverbs	1	5	Someone who is already wise will hear and learn still more ; someone who already understands will gain the ability to counsel well ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	6	he will understand proverbs , obscure expressions , the sayings and riddles of the wise .
CJB	Proverbs	1	7	The fear of Adonai is the beginning of knowledge , but fools despise wisdom and discipline .
CJB	Proverbs	1	8	My son , heed the discipline of your father , and do not abandon the teaching of your mother ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	9	they will be a garland to grace your head , a medal of honor for your neck .
CJB	Proverbs	1	10	My son , if sinners entice you , don ’ t go along with them .
CJB	Proverbs	1	11	Suppose they say , “ Come with us : we ’ ll ambush somebody and kill him , we ’ ll waylay some harmless soul , just for fun ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	12	we ’ ll swallow him alive , like Sh ’ ol , whole , like those who descend to the pit ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	13	we ’ ll find everything he has of value , we ’ ll fill our homes with loot !
CJB	Proverbs	1	14	Throw in your lot with us ; we ’ ll share a common purse ” —
CJB	Proverbs	1	15	my son , don ’ t go along with them , don ’ t set foot on their path ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	16	Their feet run to evil , they rush to shed blood .
CJB	Proverbs	1	17	For in vain is the net baited if any bird can see it ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	18	rather , they are ambushing themselves to shed their own blood , waylaying themselves .
CJB	Proverbs	1	19	So are the ways of all greedy for gain — it takes the lives of those who get it .
CJB	Proverbs	1	20	Wisdom calls aloud in the open air and raises her voice in the public places ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	21	she calls out at streetcorners and speaks out at entrances to city gates :
CJB	Proverbs	1	22	“ How long , you whose lives have no purpose , will you love thoughtless living ? How long will scorners find pleasure in mocking ? How long will fools hate knowledge ?
CJB	Proverbs	1	23	Repent when I reprove — I will pour out my spirit to you , I will make my words known to you .
CJB	Proverbs	1	24	Because you refused when I called , and no one paid attention when I put out my hand ,
CJB	Proverbs	1	25	but instead you neglected my counsel and would not accept my reproof ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	26	I , in turn , will laugh at your distress , and mock when terror comes over you —
CJB	Proverbs	1	27	yes , when terror overtakes you like a storm and your disaster approaches like a whirlwind , when distress and trouble assail you .
CJB	Proverbs	1	28	Then they will call me , but I won ’ t answer ; they will seek me earnestly , but they won ’ t find me .
CJB	Proverbs	1	29	Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of Adonai ,
CJB	Proverbs	1	30	they refused my counsel and despised my reproof .
CJB	Proverbs	1	31	So they will bear the consequences of their own way and be overfilled with their own schemes .
CJB	Proverbs	1	32	For the aimless wandering of the thoughtless will kill them , and the smug overconfidence of fools will destroy them ;
CJB	Proverbs	1	33	but those who pay attention to me will live securely , untroubled by fear of misfortune . ”
CJB	Proverbs	2	2	paying attention to wisdom inclining your mind toward understanding —
CJB	Proverbs	2	3	yes , if you will call for insight and raise your voice for discernment ,
CJB	Proverbs	2	4	if you seek it as you would silver and search for it as for hidden treasure —
CJB	Proverbs	2	5	then you will understand the fear of Adonai and find knowledge of God .
CJB	Proverbs	2	6	For Adonai gives wisdom ; from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding .
CJB	Proverbs	2	7	He stores up common sense for the upright , is a shield to those whose conduct is blameless ,
CJB	Proverbs	2	8	in order to guard the courses of justice and preserve the way of those faithful to him .
CJB	Proverbs	2	9	Then you will understand righteousness , justice , fairness and every good path .
CJB	Proverbs	2	10	For wisdom will enter your heart , knowledge will be enjoyable for you ,
CJB	Proverbs	2	11	discretion will watch over you , and discernment will guard you .
CJB	Proverbs	2	12	They will save you from the way of evil and from those who speak deceitfully ,
CJB	Proverbs	2	13	who leave the paths of honesty to walk the ways of darkness ,
CJB	Proverbs	2	14	who delight in doing evil and take joy in being stubbornly deceitful ,
CJB	Proverbs	2	15	from those whose tracks are twisted and whose paths are perverse .
CJB	Proverbs	2	16	They will save you from a woman who is a stranger , from a loose woman with smooth talk ,
CJB	Proverbs	2	17	who abandons the ruler she had in her youth and forgets the covenant of her God .
CJB	Proverbs	2	18	Her house is sinking toward death , her paths lead to the dead .
CJB	Proverbs	2	19	None who go to her return ; they never regain the path to life .
CJB	Proverbs	2	20	Thus you will walk on the way of good people and keep to the paths of the righteous .
CJB	Proverbs	2	21	For the upright will live in the land , the pure-hearted will remain there ;
CJB	Proverbs	2	22	but the wicked will be cut off from the land , the unfaithful rooted out of it .
CJB	Proverbs	3	3	Do not let grace and truth leave you — bind them around your neck ; write them on the tablet of your heart .
CJB	Proverbs	3	2	for they will add to you many days , years of life and peace .
CJB	Proverbs	3	4	Then you will win favor and esteem in the sight of God and of people .
CJB	Proverbs	3	5	Trust in Adonai with all your heart ; do not rely on your own understanding .
CJB	Proverbs	3	6	In all your ways acknowledge him ; then he will level your paths .
CJB	Proverbs	3	7	Don ’ t be conceited about your own wisdom ; but fear Adonai , and turn from evil .
CJB	Proverbs	3	8	This will bring health to your body and give strength to your bones .
CJB	Proverbs	3	9	Honor Adonai with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your income .
CJB	Proverbs	3	10	Then your granaries will be filled and your vats overflow with new wine .
CJB	Proverbs	3	11	My son , don ’ t despise Adonai ’ s discipline or resent his reproof ;
CJB	Proverbs	3	12	for Adonai corrects those he loves like a father who delights in his son .
CJB	Proverbs	3	13	Happy the person who finds wisdom , the person who acquires understanding ;
CJB	Proverbs	3	14	for her profit exceeds that of silver , gaining her is better than gold ,
CJB	Proverbs	3	15	she is more precious than pearls — nothing you want can compare with her .
CJB	Proverbs	3	16	Long life is in her right hand , riches and honor in her left .
CJB	Proverbs	3	17	Her ways are pleasant ways , and all her paths are peace .
CJB	Proverbs	3	18	She is a tree of life to those who grasp her ; whoever holds fast to her will be made happy .
CJB	Proverbs	3	19	Adonai by wisdom founded the earth , by understanding he established the heavens ,
CJB	Proverbs	3	20	by his knowledge the deep [ springs ] burst open and the dew condenses from the sky .
CJB	Proverbs	3	21	My son , don ’ t let these slip from your sight ; preserve common sense and discretion ;
CJB	Proverbs	3	22	they will be life for your being and grace for your neck .
CJB	Proverbs	3	23	Then you will walk your way securely , without hurting your foot .
CJB	Proverbs	3	24	When you lie down , you will not be afraid ; when you lie down , your sleep will be sweet .
CJB	Proverbs	3	25	Don ’ t be afraid of sudden terror or destruction caused by the wicked , when it comes ;
CJB	Proverbs	3	26	for you can rely on Adonai ; he will keep your foot from being caught in a trap .
CJB	Proverbs	3	27	Don ’ t withhold good from someone entitled to it when you have in hand the power to do it .
CJB	Proverbs	3	28	Don ’ t tell your neighbor , “ Go away ! Come another time ; I ’ ll give it to you tomorrow , ” when you have it now .
CJB	Proverbs	3	29	Don ’ t plan harm against your neighbor who lives beside you trustingly .
CJB	Proverbs	3	30	Don ’ t quarrel with someone for no reason , if he has done you no harm .
CJB	Proverbs	3	31	Don ’ t envy a man of violence , don ’ t choose any of his ways ;
CJB	Proverbs	3	32	for the perverse is an abomination to Adonai , but he shares his secret counsel with the upright .
CJB	Proverbs	3	33	Adonai ’ s curse is in the house of the wicked , but he blesses the home of the righteous .
CJB	Proverbs	3	34	The scornful he scorns , but gives grace to the humble .
CJB	Proverbs	3	35	The wise win honor , but fools win shame .
CJB	Proverbs	4	4	He too taught me ; he said to me , “ Let your heart treasure my words ; keep my commands , and live ;
CJB	Proverbs	4	2	for I am giving you good advice ; so don ’ t abandon my teaching .
CJB	Proverbs	4	3	For I too was once a child to my father ; and my mother , too , thought of me as her special darling .
CJB	Proverbs	4	5	gain wisdom , gain insight ; don ’ t forget or turn from the words I am saying .
CJB	Proverbs	4	6	Don ’ t abandon [ wisdom ] ; then she will preserve you ; love her , and she will protect you .
CJB	Proverbs	4	7	The beginning of wisdom is : get wisdom ! And along with all your getting , get insight !
CJB	Proverbs	4	8	Cherish her , and she will exalt you ; embrace her , and she will bring you honor ;
CJB	Proverbs	4	9	she will give your head a garland of grace , bestow on you a crown of glory. ”
CJB	Proverbs	4	10	Listen , my son , receive what I say , and the years of your life will be many .
CJB	Proverbs	4	11	I ’ m directing you on the way of wisdom , guiding you in paths of uprightness ;
CJB	Proverbs	4	12	when you walk , your step won ’ t be hindered ; and if you run , you won ’ t stumble .
CJB	Proverbs	4	13	Hold fast to discipline , don ’ t let it go ; guard it , for it is your life .
CJB	Proverbs	4	14	Don ’ t follow the path of the wicked or walk on the way of evildoers .
CJB	Proverbs	4	15	Avoid it , don ’ t go on it , turn away from it , and pass on .
CJB	Proverbs	4	16	For they can ’ t sleep if they haven ’ t done evil , they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone fall .
CJB	Proverbs	4	17	For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence .
CJB	Proverbs	4	18	But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn , shining ever brighter until full daylight .
CJB	Proverbs	4	19	The way of the wicked is like darkness ; they don ’ t even know what makes them stumble .
CJB	Proverbs	4	20	My son , pay attention to what I am saying ; incline your ear to my words .
CJB	Proverbs	4	21	Don ’ t let them out of your sight , keep them deep in your heart ;
CJB	Proverbs	4	22	for they are life to those who find them and health to their whole being .
CJB	Proverbs	4	23	Above everything else , guard your heart ; for it is the source of life ’ s consequences .
CJB	Proverbs	4	24	Keep crooked speech out of your mouth , banish deceit from your lips .
CJB	Proverbs	4	25	Let your eyes look straight ahead , fix your gaze on what lies in front of you .
CJB	Proverbs	4	26	Level the path for your feet , let all your ways be properly prepared ;
CJB	Proverbs	4	27	then deviate neither right nor left ; and keep your foot far from evil .
CJB	Proverbs	5	5	Her feet go down to death , her steps lead straight to Sh ’ ol ;
CJB	Proverbs	5	2	so that you will preserve discretion and your lips keep watch over knowledge .
CJB	Proverbs	5	3	For the lips of a woman who is a stranger drop honey , her mouth is smoother than oil ;
CJB	Proverbs	5	4	but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood , sharp as a double-edged sword .
CJB	Proverbs	5	6	she doesn ’ t walk the level path of life — her course wanders all over , but she doesn ’ t know it .
CJB	Proverbs	5	7	So now , children , listen to me ; don ’ t turn away from what I am saying :
CJB	Proverbs	5	8	distance your way from her , stay far from the door of her house ;
CJB	Proverbs	5	9	so that you won ’ t give your vigor to others and your years to someone who is cruel ,
CJB	Proverbs	5	10	so strangers won ’ t be filled with your strength and what you worked for go to a foreign house .
CJB	Proverbs	5	11	Then , when your flesh and bones have shrunk , at the end of your life , you would moan ,
CJB	Proverbs	5	12	“ How I hated discipline ! My whole being despised reproof ,
CJB	Proverbs	5	13	I ignored what my teachers said , I didn ’ t listen to my instructors .
CJB	Proverbs	5	14	I took part in almost every kind of evil , and the whole community knew it. ”
CJB	Proverbs	5	15	Drink the water from your own cistern , fresh water from your own well .
CJB	Proverbs	5	16	Let what your springs produce be dispersed outside , streams of water flowing in the streets ;
CJB	Proverbs	5	17	but let them be for you alone and not for strangers with you .
CJB	Proverbs	5	18	Let your fountain , the wife of your youth , be blessed ; find joy in her —
CJB	Proverbs	5	19	a lovely deer , a graceful fawn ; let her breasts satisfy you at all times , always be infatuated with her love .
CJB	Proverbs	5	20	My son , why be infatuated with an unknown woman ? Why embrace the body of a loose woman ?
CJB	Proverbs	5	21	For Adonai is watching a man ’ s ways ; he surveys all his paths .
CJB	Proverbs	5	22	A wicked person ’ s own crimes will trap him , he will be held fast by the ropes of his sin .
CJB	Proverbs	5	23	He will die from lack of discipline ; the magnitude of his folly will make him totter and fall .
CJB	Proverbs	6	6	Go to the ant , you lazybones ! Consider its ways , and be wise .
CJB	Proverbs	6	2	you have been snared by the words of your mouth , caught by the words of your own mouth .
CJB	Proverbs	6	3	Do this now , my son , and extricate yourself , since you put yourself in your friend ’ s power : go , humble yourself , and pester your friend ;
CJB	Proverbs	6	4	give your eyes no sleep , give your eyelids no rest ;
CJB	Proverbs	6	5	break free , like a gazelle from the [ hunter ’ s ] trap , like a bird from the grip of the fowler .
CJB	Proverbs	6	7	It has no chief , overseer or ruler ;
CJB	Proverbs	6	8	yet it provides its food in summer and gathers its supplies at harvest-time .
CJB	Proverbs	6	9	Lazybones ! How long will you lie there in bed ? When will you get up from your sleep ?
CJB	Proverbs	6	10	“ I ’ ll just lie here a bit , rest a little longer , just fold my hands for a little more sleep ” —
CJB	Proverbs	6	11	and poverty comes marching in on you , scarcity hits you like an invading soldier .
CJB	Proverbs	6	12	A scoundrel , a vicious man , lives by crooked speech ,
CJB	Proverbs	6	13	winking his eyes , shuffling his feet , pointing with his fingers .
CJB	Proverbs	6	14	With deceit in his heart , he is always plotting evil and sowing discord .
CJB	Proverbs	6	15	Therefore disaster suddenly overcomes him ; unexpectedly , he is broken beyond repair .
CJB	Proverbs	6	16	There are six things Adonai hates , seven which he detests :
CJB	Proverbs	6	17	a haughty look , a lying tongue , hands that shed innocent blood ,
CJB	Proverbs	6	18	a heart that plots wicked schemes , feet swift in running to do evil ,
CJB	Proverbs	6	19	a false witness who lies with every breath , and him who sows strife among brothers .
CJB	Proverbs	6	20	My son , obey your father ’ s command , and don ’ t abandon your mother ’ s teaching .
CJB	Proverbs	6	21	Bind them always on your heart , tie them around your neck .
CJB	Proverbs	6	22	When you walk , they will lead you ; when you lie down , they will watch over you ; and when you wake up , they will talk with you .
CJB	Proverbs	6	23	For the mitzvah is a lamp , Torah is light , and reproofs that discipline are the way to life .
CJB	Proverbs	6	24	They keep you from an evil woman , from a loose woman ’ s seductive tongue .
CJB	Proverbs	6	25	Don ’ t let your heart lust after her beauty or allow her glance to captivate you .
CJB	Proverbs	6	26	The price of a whore is a loaf of bread , but the adulteress is hunting for a precious life .
CJB	Proverbs	6	27	Can a man carry fire inside his shirt without burning his clothes ?
CJB	Proverbs	6	28	Can a man walk [ barefoot ] on hot coals without scorching his feet ?
CJB	Proverbs	6	29	So is he who has sex with his neighbor ’ s wife ; anyone touching her will be punished .
CJB	Proverbs	6	30	A thief is not despised if he steals only to satisfy his appetite when hungry ;
CJB	Proverbs	6	31	but even he , if caught , must pay back sevenfold ; he may have to give up all the wealth that he owns .
CJB	Proverbs	6	32	He who commits adultery lacks sense ; he who does it destroys himself .
CJB	Proverbs	6	33	He will get nothing but blows and contempt , and his disgrace will not be wiped away .
CJB	Proverbs	6	34	For jealousy drives a man into a rage ; he will show no mercy when he takes revenge ;
CJB	Proverbs	6	35	he will not accept compensation ; he ’ ll refuse every bribe , no matter how large .
CJB	Proverbs	7	7	when I saw among the young men there , among those who don ’ t think for themselves , a young fellow devoid of all sense .
CJB	Proverbs	7	2	Obey my commands , and live ; guard my teaching like the pupil of your eye .
CJB	Proverbs	7	3	Bind them on your fingers ; write them on the tablet of your heart .
CJB	Proverbs	7	4	Say to wisdom , “ You are my sister ” ; call understanding your kinswoman ;
CJB	Proverbs	7	5	so that they can keep you from unknown women , from loose women with their seductive talk .
CJB	Proverbs	7	6	For I was at the window of my house , glancing out through the lattice ,
CJB	Proverbs	7	8	He crosses the street near her corner and continues on toward her house .
CJB	Proverbs	7	9	Dusk turns into evening , and finally night , dark and black .
CJB	Proverbs	7	10	Then a woman approaches him , dressed as a prostitute , wily of heart .
CJB	Proverbs	7	11	She ’ s the coarse , impulsive type , whose feet don ’ t stay at home ;
CJB	Proverbs	7	12	rather , she stalks the streets and squares , lurking at every streetcorner .
CJB	Proverbs	7	13	She grabs him , gives him a kiss , and , brazen-faced , she says to him ,
CJB	Proverbs	7	14	“ I had to offer peace sacrifices , and I fulfilled my vows today .
CJB	Proverbs	7	15	This is why I came out to meet you , to look for you ; now I ’ ve found you .
CJB	Proverbs	7	16	I ’ ve spread quilts on my couch made of colored Egyptian linen .
CJB	Proverbs	7	17	I ’ ve perfumed my bed with myrrh , aloes and cinnamon .
CJB	Proverbs	7	18	Come on , let ’ s make love till morning ; we ’ ll enjoy making love .
CJB	Proverbs	7	19	My husband isn ’ t at home , he ’ s gone on a long trip ;
CJB	Proverbs	7	20	he took a bag of money with him and won ’ t be back till the moon is full. ”
CJB	Proverbs	7	21	With all her sweet talk she convinces him , enticing him with her seductive words .
CJB	Proverbs	7	22	At once he follows her like an ox on its way to be slaughtered ; like a fool to be punished in the stocks ;
CJB	Proverbs	7	23	or like a bird rushing into a trap , not knowing its life is at stake till an arrow pierces its liver .
CJB	Proverbs	7	24	So now , children , listen to me ; pay attention to what I am saying .
CJB	Proverbs	7	25	Don ’ t let your heart turn to her ways ; don ’ t stray onto her paths .
CJB	Proverbs	7	26	For many are those she has struck down dead , numerous those she has killed .
CJB	Proverbs	7	27	Her house is the way to Sh ’ ol ; it leads down to the halls of death .
CJB	Proverbs	8	8	All the words from my mouth are righteous ; nothing false or crooked is in them .
CJB	Proverbs	8	2	On the heights along the road , where the paths meet , she is standing ;
CJB	Proverbs	8	3	by the gates leading into the city , at the entrances , she cries aloud :
CJB	Proverbs	8	4	“ People , I am calling you , raising my voice to all mankind .
CJB	Proverbs	8	5	You who don ’ t direct your lives , understand caution ; as for you , you fools , get some common sense !
CJB	Proverbs	8	6	“ Listen ! I will say worthwhile things ; when I speak , my words are right .
CJB	Proverbs	8	7	My mouth says what is true , because my lips detest evil .
CJB	Proverbs	8	9	They are all clear to those who understand and straightforward to those who gain knowledge .
CJB	Proverbs	8	10	Receive my instruction , rather than silver ; knowledge , rather than the finest gold .
CJB	Proverbs	8	11	For wisdom is better than pearls ; nothing you want can compare with her .
CJB	Proverbs	8	12	“ I , wisdom , live together with caution ; I attain knowledge and discretion .
CJB	Proverbs	8	13	The fear of Adonai is hatred of evil . I hate pride and arrogance , evil ways and duplicitous speech .
CJB	Proverbs	8	14	Good advice is mine , and common sense ; I am insight , power is mine .
CJB	Proverbs	8	15	By me kings reign , and princes make just laws .
CJB	Proverbs	8	16	By me princes govern , nobles too , and all the earth ’ s rulers .
CJB	Proverbs	8	17	I love those who love me ; and those who seek me will find me .
CJB	Proverbs	8	18	Riches and honor are with me , lasting wealth and righteousness .
CJB	Proverbs	8	19	My fruit is better than gold , fine gold , my produce better than the finest silver .
CJB	Proverbs	8	20	I follow the course of righteousness along the paths of justice ,
CJB	Proverbs	8	21	to endow with wealth those who love me and fill their treasuries .
CJB	Proverbs	8	22	“ Adonai made me as the beginning of his way , the first of his ancient works .
CJB	Proverbs	8	23	I was appointed before the world , before the start , before the earth ’ s beginnings .
CJB	Proverbs	8	24	When I was brought forth , there were no ocean depths , no springs brimming with water .
CJB	Proverbs	8	25	I was brought forth before the hills , before the mountains had settled in place ;
CJB	Proverbs	8	26	he had not yet made the earth , the fields , or even the earth ’ s first grains of dust .
CJB	Proverbs	8	27	When he established the heavens , I was there . When he drew the horizon ’ s circle on the deep ,
CJB	Proverbs	8	28	when he set the skies above in place , when the fountains of the deep poured forth ,
CJB	Proverbs	8	29	when he prescribed boundaries for the sea , so that its water would not transgress his command , when he marked out the foundations of the earth ,
CJB	Proverbs	8	30	I was with him as someone he could trust . For me , every day was pure delight , as I played in his presence all the time , .
CJB	Proverbs	8	31	playing everywhere on his earth , and delighting to be with humankind .
CJB	Proverbs	8	32	“ Therefore , children , listen to me : happy are those who keep my ways .
CJB	Proverbs	8	33	Hear instruction , and grow wise ; do not refuse it .
CJB	Proverbs	8	34	How happy the person who listens to me , who watches daily at my gates and waits outside my doors .
CJB	Proverbs	8	35	For he who finds me finds life and obtains the favor of Adonai .
CJB	Proverbs	8	36	But he who misses me harms himself ; all who hate me love death . ”
CJB	Proverbs	9	9	Give to a wise man , and he grows still wiser ; teach a righteous man , and he will learn still more .
CJB	Proverbs	9	2	She has prepared her food , spiced her wine , and she has set her table .
CJB	Proverbs	9	3	She has sent out her young girls [ with invitations ] ; she calls from the heights of the city ,
CJB	Proverbs	9	4	“ Whoever is unsure of himself , turn in here ! ” To someone weak-willed she says ,
CJB	Proverbs	9	5	“ Come and eat my food ! Drink the wine I have mixed !
CJB	Proverbs	9	6	Don ’ t stay unsure of yourself , but live ! Walk in the way of understanding ! ”
CJB	Proverbs	9	7	“ He who corrects a scoffer only gets insulted ; reproving a wicked man becomes his blemish .
CJB	Proverbs	9	8	If you reprove a scoffer , he will hate you ; if you reprove a wise man , he will love you .
CJB	Proverbs	9	10	The fear of Adonai is the beginning of wisdom , and knowledge of holy ones is understanding .
CJB	Proverbs	9	11	For with me , your days will be increased ; years will be added to your life .
CJB	Proverbs	9	12	If you are wise , your wisdom helps you ; but if you scoff , you bear the consequences alone. ”
CJB	Proverbs	9	13	The foolish woman is coarse ; she doesn ’ t think , and she doesn ’ t know a thing .
CJB	Proverbs	9	14	She sits at the door of her house or on a seat at the heights of the city ,
CJB	Proverbs	9	15	calling to those who pass by , to those going straight along their ways ,
CJB	Proverbs	9	16	“ Whoever is unsure of himself , turn in here ! ” To someone weak-willed she says ,
CJB	Proverbs	9	17	“ Stolen water is sweet ; food eaten in secret is pleasant. ”
CJB	Proverbs	9	18	But he doesn ’ t realize that the dead are there , and that those who accept her invitation are in the depths of Sh ’ ol .
CJB	Proverbs	10	10	He who winks his eye [ instead of rebuking ] causes pain , yet a babbling fool will have trouble .

CJB	Proverbs	31	3	Don ’ t give your strength to women or your ways to that which destroys kings .
CJB	Proverbs	31	4	It is not for kings , L ’ mu ’ el , not for kings to drink wine ; it is not for rulers to ask , “ Where can I find strong liquor ? ”
CJB	Proverbs	31	5	For they may drink , then forget what has been decreed , and pervert the justice due to the poor .

CJB	Proverbs	31	13	She procures a supply of wool and flax and works with willing hands . ה
CJB	Proverbs	31	14	She is like those merchant vessels , bringing her food from far away . ו
CJB	Proverbs	31	15	It ’ s still dark when she rises to give food to her household and orders to the young women serving her . ז
CJB	Proverbs	31	16	She considers a field , then buys it , and from her earnings she plants a vineyard . ח
CJB	Proverbs	31	17	She gathers her strength around her and throws herself into her work . ט
CJB	Proverbs	31	18	She sees that her business affairs go well ; her lamp stays lit at night . י
CJB	Proverbs	31	19	She puts her hands to the staff with the flax ; her fingers hold the spinning rod . כ
CJB	Proverbs	31	20	She reaches out to embrace the poor and opens her arms to the needy . ל

CJB	Proverbs	31	22	She makes her own quilts ; she is clothed in fine linen and purple . נ
CJB	Proverbs	31	23	Her husband is known at the city gates when he sits with the leaders of the land . ס
CJB	Proverbs	31	24	She makes linen garments and sells them ; she supplies the merchants with sashes . ע
CJB	Proverbs	31	25	Clothed with strength and dignity , she can laugh at the days to come . פ
CJB	Proverbs	31	26	When she opens her mouth , she speaks wisely ; on her tongue is loving instruction . צ
CJB	Proverbs	31	27	She watches how things go in her house , not eating the bread of idleness . ק
CJB	Proverbs	31	28	Her children arise ; they make her happy ; her husband too , as he praises her : ר
CJB	Proverbs	31	29	“ Many women have done wonderful things , but you surpass them all ! ” ש
CJB	Proverbs	31	30	Charm can lie , beauty can vanish , but a woman who fears Adonai should be praised . ת
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	1	The words of Kohelet the son of David , king in Yerushalayim :
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	2	Pointless ! Pointless ! — says Kohelet — Utterly meaningless ! Nothing matters !
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	3	What does a person gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	4	Generations come , generations go , but the earth remains forever .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	5	The sun rises , the sun sets ; then it speeds to its place and rises there .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	6	The wind blows south , then it turns north ; the wind blows all around and keeps returning to its rounds .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	7	All the rivers flow to the sea , yet the sea is not full ; to the place where the rivers flow , there they keep on flowing .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	8	Everything is wearisome , more than one can express ; the eye is not satisfied with seeing , the ear not filled up with hearing .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	9	What has been is what will be , what has been done is what will be done , and there is nothing new under the sun .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	10	Is there something of which it is said , “ See , this is new ” ? It existed already in the ages before us .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	11	No one remembers the people of long ago ; and those to come will not be remembered by those who come after them .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	12	I , Kohelet , have been king over Isra ’ el in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	13	I wisely applied myself to seek out and investigate everything done under heaven . What a bothersome task God has given humanity to keep us occupied !
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	14	I have seen all the activities that are done under the sun , and it ’ s all pointless , feeding on wind .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	15	What is crooked can ’ t be straightened ; what is not there can ’ t be counted .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	16	I said to myself , “ Look , I have acquired much wisdom , more than anyone ruling Yerushalayim before me. ” Yes , I experienced a great deal of wisdom and knowledge ;
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	17	yet when I applied myself to understanding wisdom and knowledge , as well as stupidity and folly , I came to see that this too was merely feeding on wind .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	1	18	For in much wisdom is much grief ; the more knowledge , the more suffering .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	2	Of laughter I said , “ This is stupid , ” and of pleasure , “ What ’ s the use of it ? ”
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	3	I searched my mind for how to gratify my body with wine and , with my mind still guiding me with wisdom , how to pursue foolishness ; my object was to find out what was the best thing for people to do during the short time they have under heaven to live .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	4	I worked on a grand scale — I built myself palaces , planted myself vineyards ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	5	and made myself gardens and parks ; in them I planted all kinds of fruit trees .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	6	I made myself pools from which to water the trees springing up in the forest .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	7	I bought male and female slaves , and I had my home-born slaves as well . I also had growing herds of cattle and flocks of sheep , more than anyone before me in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	8	I amassed silver and gold , the wealth of kings and provinces . I acquired male and female singers , things that provide sensual delight , and a good many concubines .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	9	So I grew great , surpassing all who preceded me in Yerushalayim ; my wisdom , too , stayed with me .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	10	I denied my eyes nothing they wanted . I withheld no pleasure from myself ; for I took pleasure in all my work , and this was my reward for all my work .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	11	Then I looked at all that my hands had accomplished and at the work I had toiled at ; and I saw that it was all meaningless and feeding on wind , and that there was nothing to be gained under the sun .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	12	So I decided to look more carefully at wisdom , stupidity and foolishness ; for what can the man who succeeds the king do , except what has already been done ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	13	I saw that wisdom is more useful than foolishness , just as light is more useful than darkness .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	14	The wise man has eyes in his head , but the fool walks in darkness . Yet the same fate awaits them all .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	15	So I said to myself , “ If the same thing happens to the fool as to me , then what did I gain by being wise ? ” and I thought to myself , “ This too is pointless .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	16	For the wise man , like the fool , will not be long remembered , inasmuch as in the times to come , everything will long ago have been forgotten . The wise man , no less than the fool , must die. ”
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	17	So I came to hate life , because the activities done under the sun were loathesome to me , since everything is meaningless and feeding on wind .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	18	I hated all the things for which I had worked under the sun , because I saw that I would have to leave them to the man who will come after me .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	19	Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool ? Yet he will have control over all the things I worked for and which demonstrated how wise I am under the sun . This too is pointless .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	20	Thus I came to despair over all the things I had worked for under the sun .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	21	Here is a man whose work is done with wisdom , knowledge and skill ; yet he has to leave it to someone who has put no work into it . This is not only pointless , but a great evil .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	22	For what does a person get from all his efforts and ambitions permeating the work he does under the sun ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	23	His whole life is one of pain , and his work is full of stress ; even at night his mind gets no rest . This too is pointless .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	24	So there is nothing better for a man to do than eat , drink and and let himself enjoy the good that results from his work . I also realized that this is from God ’ s hand .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	25	For who will eat and who will enjoy except me ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	2	26	For to the man who is good from [ God ’ s ] viewpoint he gives wisdom , knowledge and joy ; but to the sinner he gives the task of collecting and accumulating things to leave to him who is good from God ’ s viewpoint . This too is pointless and feeding on wind .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	3	a time to kill and a time to heal , a time to tear down and a time to build ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	2	a time to be born and a time to die , a time to plant and a time to uproot ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	4	a time to weep and a time to laugh , a time to mourn and a time to dance ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	5	a time to throw stones and a time to gather stones , a time to embrace and a time to refrain ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	6	a time to search and a time to give up , a time to keep and a time to discard ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	7	a time to tear and a time to sew , a time to keep silent and a time to speak ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	8	a time to love and a time to hate , a time for war and a time for peace .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	9	What does the worker gain from his efforts ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I have seen the task God has given humanity to keep us occupied .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	11	He has made everything suited to its time ; also , he has given human beings an awareness of eternity ; but in such a way that they can ’ t fully comprehend , from beginning to end , the things God does .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	12	I know that there is nothing better for them to do than to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	13	Still , the fact that everyone can eat and drink and enjoy the good that results from all his work , is a gift of God .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I know that whatever God does will last forever ; there is nothing to add or subtract from it ; and God has done it so that people will fear him .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	15	That which was is here already ; and that which will be has already been , but God seeks out what people chase after .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	16	Another thing I observed under the sun : There , in the same place as justice , was wickedness ; there , in the same place as righteousness , was wickedness .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I said to myself , “ The righteous and the wicked God will judge , because there is a right time for every intention and for every action. ”
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	18	Concerning people , I said to myself , “ God is testing them , so that they will see that by themselves they are just animals .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	19	After all , the same things that happen to people happen to animals , the very same thing — just as the one dies , so does the other . Yes , their breath is the same ; so that humans are no better than animals ; since nothing matters , anyway .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	20	They all go to the same place ; they all come from dust , and they all return to dust .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who knows if the spirit of a human being goes upward and the spirit of an animal goes downward into the earth ? ”
CJB	Ecclesiastes	3	22	So I concluded that there is nothing better for a person to do than take joy in his activities , that that is his allotted portion ; for who can enable him to see what will happen after him ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	4	Next I realized that all effort and achievement stem from one person ’ s envy of another . This too is futility and feeding on wind .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	2	So I considered the dead happier , because they were already dead , than the living , who must still live their lives ;
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	3	but happier than either of them is the one who has not yet been born , because he has not yet seen the evil things that are done under the sun .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	5	Fools fold their arms together and eat their own flesh away .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	6	Better an armload with tranquillity than both arms full of effort and feeding on wind .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Then I turned my attention to something else under the sun that is pointless :
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	8	the situation in which a solitary individual without a companion , with neither son nor brother , keeps on working endlessly but never has enough wealth . “ For whom ” [ he should ask ] , “ am I working so hard and denying myself pleasure ? ” This too is truly pointless , a sorry business .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two are better than one , in that their cooperative efforts yield this advantage :
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	10	if one of them falls , the other will help his partner up — woe to him who is alone when he falls and has no one to help him up .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	11	Again , if two people sleep together , they keep each other warm ; but how can one person be warm by himself ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	12	Moreover , an attacker may defeat someone who is alone , but two can resist him ; and a three-stranded cord is not easily broken .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	13	Better a youth who is poor but wise than a king who is old but foolish , no longer willing to listen to advice .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	14	True , he rose from prison to be king ; yet , while ruling , he became poor .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I observed that all who live and walk under the sun took the side of the youth mentioned first who would rule in place of the king ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	16	and that no limit was set for the number of his subjects . Nevertheless , those who come afterwards will not regard him highly . This too is certainly pointless and feeding on wind .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	4	17	( 5:1 ) Watch your step when you go to the house of God . Offering to listen is better than fools offering sacrifices , because they don ’ t discern whether or not they are doing evil .

CJB	Ecclesiastes	6	6	without enjoying himself , even if he were to live a thousand years twice over . Doesn ’ t everyone go to the same place ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	6	2	the case in which God gives someone riches , wealth and honor , so that he lacks nothing that he wants ; but God does not give him the power to enjoy them , and some stranger gets to enjoy them — this is meaningless , evil , sick .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	6	3	Suppose a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years , so that he has a long life , but he fails to enjoy himself ; then , even if he were to [ live indefinitely and therefore ] never be buried , I say that it would be better to be born dead .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	6	4	For the arrival of a stillborn baby is a futile thing , and its departure is in darkness ; its name is [ forgotten , ] covered in darkness ;

CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	7	But oppression can make a wise man stupid ; also a gift can destroy understanding .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	2	Better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting , for all are destined to be mourned ; the living should lay this to heart .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Grief is better than laughter , for sadness can improve a person .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	4	The thoughts of the wise are in the house of mourning , but the thoughts of fools are in the house of pleasure .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	5	It is better to hear the rebukes of the wise than to listen to the songs of fools .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	6	For the laughter of fools is like the crackling of thorns burning under a pot ; this too is pointless .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	8	The end of something is better than its beginning , so the patient are better than the proud .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Don ’ t be quick to get angry , for [ only ] fools nurse anger .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Don ’ t ask why the old days were better than now , because that is a foolish question .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom is good , along with possessions , an advantage to all who see the sun .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	12	For wisdom is a shelter , and money is a shelter , but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom keeps the one who has it alive .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Consider the work of God : who can make straight what he has made crooked ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	14	When things are going well , enjoy yourself ; but when things are going badly , consider that God made the one alongside the other , so that people would learn nothing of their futures .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	15	In my pointless life , I ’ ve seen everything — from the righteous person perishing in his uprightness to the wicked one who lives a long life and keeps on doing wrong .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	16	So don ’ t be overly righteous or overly wise ; why should you disappoint yourself ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	17	But don ’ t be overly wicked , and don ’ t be foolish ; why should you die before your time ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	18	Don ’ t grasp just one of these rules ; take hold of the other as well ; for he who is in fear of God will live by both of them .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	19	To a wise man wisdom is better protection than ten rulers in a city .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	20	For there isn ’ t a righteous person on earth who does [ only ] good and never sins .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Also , don ’ t take seriously every word spoken , such as when you hear your servant speaking badly of you ;
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	22	because often , as you yourself know , you have spoken badly of others .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	23	All this I have put to the test of wisdom ; I said , “ I will acquire wisdom ” ; but wisdom remained far away from me .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	24	That which exists is far away and deep , so deep , that it can ’ t be discovered .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	25	So I turned myself and my thoughts to know , search out and seek wisdom and the reasons behind things , also to know how foolish it is to be wicked and how stupid to act like a fool .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	26	I found more bitter than death the woman who is a trap , whose heart is a snare and whose hands are like prison chains . The man who pleases God will escape from her , but the sinner will be caught by her .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	27	I have found this — says Kohelet — adding one thing to another to reach a conclusion ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	28	I searched a long time without finding it : one man in a thousand I have found , but a woman among all those I have not found .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	7	29	This is the only thing I have found , that God made human beings upright , but they have devised many schemes .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	8	Just as no one has the power to keep the wind from blowing , so no one has power over the day of death . If one is drafted to fight a war , one can ’ t send a substitute ; likewise the wicked won ’ t escape death by their wickedness .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	2	Keep the king ’ s command because of the oath before God .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Don ’ t be quick to leave his presence , and don ’ t persist in doing what is wrong , for he does whatever he pleases .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	4	After all , his word is final ; who can challenge him , “ Why are you doing that ? ”
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	5	Whoever obeys his command will never come to harm , and the wise person will know the right time and judgment .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	6	For to everything there is a right time and a judgment , since people are greatly troubled
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	7	by uncertainty over the future ; even when the event takes place , who will tell them about it ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	9	All this I have seen , as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun when one person tyrannizes another .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	10	Thus I saw the wicked buried ; they had even come from the Holy Place . But those who had acted uprightly were forgotten in the city . This too is a futile thing ;
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	11	because the punishment decreed for an evil act is not promptly carried out ; therefore people who plan to do evil are strengthened in their intentions .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	12	For a sinner can do evil a hundred times and still live a long life ; although I know that in the end things will go well with those who fear God , because they fear him .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	13	But things will not go well with the wicked ; and , like a shadow , he will not prolong his days ; because he doesn ’ t fear God .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is something frustrating that occurs on earth , namely , that there are righteous people to whom things happen as if they were doing wicked deeds ; and , again , there are wicked people to whom things happen as if they were doing righteous deeds . I say that this too is pointless .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	15	So I recommend enjoyment — a person can do nothing better under the sun than eat , drink and enjoy himself ; this is what should accompany him as he does his work for as long as God gives him to live under the sun .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	16	When I applied myself to gain wisdom and to observe how people occupy themselves on earth , that people ’ s eyes don ’ t see sleep either by day or by night ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	8	17	then , on looking over all of God ’ s work , I realized that it is impossible to grasp all the activity taking place under the sun ; because even if a person works hard at searching it out , he won ’ t grasp it ; and even if a wise person thinks he knows it , he still won ’ t be able to grasp it .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Enjoy life with the wife you have loved throughout your meaningless life that he has given you under the sun , all the days of your futility ; for that is your allotted portion in life and in your labor that you work at under the sun .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	2	Anything can happen to anyone ; the same thing can happen to the righteous as to the wicked , to the good and clean and to the unclean , to someone who offers a sacrifice and to someone who doesn ’ t offer a sacrifice ; it is the same for a good person as for a sinner , for someone who takes an oath rashly as for someone who fears to take an oath .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is another evil among all those done under the sun , that the same events can occur to anyone . Truly , the human mind is full of evil ; and as long as people live , folly is in their hearts ; after which they go to be with the dead .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	4	For as long as a person is linked with the living , there is hope — better to be a living dog than a dead lion !
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	5	For the living know that they will die , but the dead know nothing ; there is no longer any reward for them , because all memory of them is lost .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	6	What they loved , what they hated and what they envied all disappeared long ago , and they no longer have a share in anything done under the sun .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	7	So go , eat your bread with joy , and drink your wine with a happy heart , for God has already accepted your deeds .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Let your clothing always be white , and never fail to perfume your head .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Whatever task comes your way to do , do it with all your strength ; because in Sh ’ ol , where you will go , there is neither working nor planning , neither knowledge nor wisdom .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	11	Yet another thing I observed under the sun is that races aren ’ t won by the swift or battles by the strong , and that food doesn ’ t go to the wise or wealth to the intelligent or favor to the experts ; rather , time and chance rule them all .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	12	For people don ’ t know when their time will come any more than fish taken in the fatal net or birds caught in a snare ; similarly , people are snared at an unfortunate time , when suddenly it falls on them .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	13	Here is something else I have seen as wisdom under the sun , and it seemed important to me :
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	14	there was a small town with few people in it ; and a great king came to attack it ; he surrounded it and built massive siege-works against it .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	15	Now there was found in it a man who was poor but wise , and by his wisdom he saved the city ; yet afterwards , nobody remembered that poor man .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	16	So , although I say that wisdom is better than strength , nevertheless the poor man ’ s wisdom is despised ; nobody pays attention to what he says .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	17	A wise man speaking quietly is more worth heeding than the shouts of a ruler commanding fools .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war , but a person who makes a mistake can destroy much good .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	10	If the [ hatchet ’ s ] iron [ blade ] is blunt , and [ its user ] doesn ’ t sharpen it , he will have to exert more effort ; but the expert has the advantage of his skill .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	2	A wise man ’ s heart leads him rightly , but a fool ’ s heart leads him astray ;
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	3	and when a fool travels , he has no good sense , thus showing everyone that he is a fool .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	4	If a ruler gets angry at you , stay at your post , because calmness soothes great offenses .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	5	Another evil I have seen under the sun , the kind of mistake rulers make , is that
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	6	fools are promoted to high positions , while the rich occupy humble places .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen servants riding horses , while princes walk on foot like slaves .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	8	He who digs a pit may fall into it ; he who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	9	He who quarries stones may get hurt by them , he who chops wood puts himself in danger .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	11	If a snake bites before it is charmed , the snake-charmer has no advantage .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	12	The words spoken by the wise bring them favor , but the lips of a fool swallow him up .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	13	What he says starts with foolishness and ends with wicked madness .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	14	A fool keeps talking and talking , yet no one knows what the future will bring — can anyone tell a person what will happen after he ’ s gone ?
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	15	The efforts of a fool wear him out ; he doesn ’ t even know the way to town !
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	16	Woe to you , land , when your king is a child , and your leaders start their parties in the morning !
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	17	Happy are you , land , when your king is well-born , and your princes eat at the proper time , in order to stay strong , not to get drunk !
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	18	When the owner is lazy , the roof sags ; when hands are idle , the house leaks .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	19	Parties are made for having a good time , wine adds cheer to life , and money has an answer for everything .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	10	20	Don ’ t insult the king , not even in your thoughts ; and don ’ t insult the wealthy , not even in your bedroom ; for a bird in the air might carry the news , a creature with wings might repeat what you said .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	11	Send your resources out over the seas ; eventually you will reap a return .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	2	Divide your merchandise into seven or eight shares , since you don ’ t know what disasters may come on the earth .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	3	If the clouds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the earth . Whether a tree falls toward the north or the south , the place where the tree falls is where it stays .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	4	He who keeps watching the wind will never sow ; he who keeps looking at the clouds will never reap .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	5	Just as you don ’ t know the way of the wind or how bones grow in a pregnant woman ’ s womb , so you don ’ t know the work of God , the maker of everything .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	6	In the morning , sow your seed ; and don ’ t slack off until evening ; for you don ’ t know which sowing will succeed , this , or that , or if both will do well .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	7	Then the light will be sweet , and it will be a pleasure to see the sun .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	8	For if a person lives many years , let him take joy in them all ; yet remembering that there will be many days of darkness , that all to come is futile .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	9	Young person , if you spend your youth only having fun , if you use your early years just to entertain yourself , if you follow your heart as you live your life , and let your eyes be your guide ; understand that for all these things God will bring you to judgment .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	11	10	Therefore , remove anger from your heart ; and keep from harming your body ; for neither adolescence nor youth has any lasting value .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	12	In addition , my son , take heed : one can write many books — there ’ s no end to it ; and one can study so much that it wearies the flesh .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	2	before the sun and the light grow dim , also the moon and the stars ; before the clouds return after the rain ;
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	3	on the day when the guards of the house are trembling , and men of courage are bent over double ; when the women stop grinding grain , because there are so few ; when the women at the windows can no longer see out ;
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	4	when the doors to the streets are kept shut ; when the noise from the grain-mill fades ; when a person is startled by the chirp of a bird , yet their singing is hard to hear ;
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	5	when they will be afraid to go up a hill , and terrors will stalk the way , even though the almond tree is in bloom ; when the locust can only drag itself along , and the caper berry has no [ aphrodisiac ] effect — because the person is headed for his eternal home , and the mourners are already gathering in the marketplace —
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	6	before the silver cord is snapped the bowl of gold is cracked , the pitcher is shattered at the spring , the pulley is broken at the cistern ,
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	7	the dust returns to earth , as it was , and the spirit returns to God , who gave it !
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	8	Pointless ! Meaningless ! — says Kohelet , Nothing matters at all !
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	9	Not only was Kohelet wise , he also taught the people what he knew ; also he weighed , researched and corrected many ethical sayings .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	10	Kohelet worked to develop an attractive writing style , in which he expressed the truth straightforwardly .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	11	The sayings of the wise are as sharp as goads , and those given by leaders of assemblies are like well-fixed nails ; [ in this case , ] they are presented by a single shepherd .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	13	Here is the final conclusion , now that you have heard everything : fear God , and keep his mitzvot ; this is what being human is all about .
CJB	Ecclesiastes	12	14	For God will bring to judgment everything we do , including every secret , whether good or bad . [ Here is the final conclusion , now that you have heard everything : fear God , and keep his mitzvot ; this is what being human is all about . ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	1	The Ultimate Song , by Shlomo : [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	2	Let him smother me with kisses from his mouth , for your love is better than wine .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	3	Your anointing oils have a wonderful fragrance ; your name is like anointing oil poured out . This is why young women love you —
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	4	“ Take me with you . We will run after you. ” The king has brought me into his rooms . [ Chorus ] We will be glad and rejoice for you . We will praise your love more than wine . How right it is for them to love you ! [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	5	I am dark tan but beautiful , you daughters of Yerushalayim , like the tents of Kedar , like the curtains of Shlomo .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	6	Don ’ t stare at me because I ’ m dark ; it ’ s the sun that tanned me . My mother ’ s sons were angry with me and made me look after the vineyards . But I haven ’ t cared for my own vineyard .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	7	Tell me , my love , where you pasture your flock , where you have them rest at noon ; for why should I veil myself [ like a whore ] beside the flocks of your friends ? [ Chorus ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	8	If you do not know , you most beautiful of women , then follow the footprints of the flock and let your kids graze by the shepherds ’ tents . [ He ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	9	My love , I compare you with my mare , pulling one of Pharaoh ’ s chariots —
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	10	your cheeks are lovely with ornaments , your neck with its strings of beads ;
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	11	we will make you ornaments of gold , studded with silver . [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	12	As the king reclines at table , my nard gives forth its perfume :
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	13	to me the man I love is a sachet of myrrh lodged between my breasts ;
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	14	to me the man I love is a spray of henna flowers in the vineyards of ‘ Ein-Gedi . [ He ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	15	Look at you , my love ! How beautiful you are ! Your eyes are doves — [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	16	— Look at you ! So handsome , so pleasing , my darling ! Our bed is the greenery ;
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	17	cedars are the beams of our houses , cypresses the rafters .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	2	Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the other women . [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	3	Like an apple tree among the other trees in the forest is my darling among the other men . I love to sit in his shadow ; his fruit is sweet to my taste .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	4	He brings me to the banquet hall ; his banner over me is love .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	5	Sustain me with raisins , refresh me with apples , for I am sick with love .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	6	[ I wish ] his left arm [ were ] under my head , and his right arm around me .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	7	I warn you , daughters of Yerushalayim , by the gazelles and deer in the wilds , not to awaken or stir up love until it wants to arise !
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	8	The voice of the man I love ! Here he comes , bounding over the mountains , skipping over the hills !
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	9	My darling is like a gazelle or young stag . There he is , standing outside our wall , looking in through the windows , peering in through the lattice .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	10	My darling speaks ; he is saying to me , “ Get up , my love ! My beauty ! Come away !
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	11	For you see that the winter has passed , the rain is finished and gone ,
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	12	the flowers are appearing in the countryside , the time has come for [ the birds ] to sing , and the cooing of doves can be heard in the land .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	13	The fig trees are forming their unripe figs , and the grapevines in bloom give out their perfume . Get up , my love , my beauty ! Come away ! ” [ He ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	14	My dove , hiding in holes in the rock , in the secret recesses of the cliff , let me see your face and hear your voice ; for your voice is sweet , and your face is lovely . [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	15	“ Catch the foxes for us , yes , the little foxes ! They are ruining the vineyards when our vineyards are in bloom ! ”
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	16	My darling is mine , and I am his , as he pastures his flock among the lilies .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	17	Before the daytime breeze rises and the shadows flee , return , my love , like a stag or gazelle on the hills of Beter .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	3	The guards roaming the city found me . “ Have you seen the man I love ? ”
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	2	“ I will get up now and roam the city , through the streets and the open places , I will look for the man I love. ” I looked for him , but I didn ’ t find him .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	4	Scarcely had I left them , when I found the man I love . I took hold of him and would not let him go until I had brought him to my mother ’ s house , to the bedroom of the woman who conceived me .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	5	I warn you , daughters of Yerushalayim , by the gazelles and deer in the wilds , not to awaken or stir up love until it wants to arise !
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	6	Who is this , coming up from the desert like a column of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , chosen from the merchant ’ s crushed spices ?
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	7	It is Shlomo ’ s litter , escorted by sixty valiant men chosen from Isra ’ el ’ s finest ;
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	8	all of them wield the sword and are expert fighters ; each one has his sword ready at his side to combat the terrors of night .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	9	King Shlomo made himself a royal litter of wood from the L ’ vanon .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	10	He made its columns of silver , its roof of gold , its seat of purple cloth ; its inside was lovingly inlaid by the daughters of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	11	Daughters of Tziyon , come out , and gaze upon King Shlomo , wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him on his wedding day , his day of joy !
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	4	Your neck is like the tower of David , built magnificently , on which hang a thousand bucklers , each one a brave warrior ’ s shield .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	2	Your teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep that have just come up from being washed ; each of them is matched , and none of them is missing .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	3	Your lips are like a scarlet thread , and your mouth is lovely . Your cheeks are like a pomegranate split open behind your veil .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	5	Your two breasts are like two fawns , twins of a gazelle grazing among lilies .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	6	When the day ’ s cool breeze comes up and the shadows lengthen , I will get myself to the mountain of myrrh to the hill of frankincense .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	7	Everything about you is beautiful , my love ; you are without a flaw .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	8	Come with me from the L ’ vanon , my bride , come with me from the L ’ vanon . Come down from the heights of Amanah , from the heights of S ’ nir and Hermon , down from the lions ’ lairs and the leopard-haunted hills .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	9	My sister , my bride , you have carried my heart away ! With just one glance , with one bead of your necklace you have carried my heart away .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	10	My sister , my bride , how sweet is your love ! How much better your love than wine , more fragrant your perfumes than any spice !
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	11	Your lips , my bride , drip honey ; honey and milk are under your tongue ; and the scent of your garments is like the scent of the L ’ vanon .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	12	My sister , my bride , is a garden locked up , a pool covered over , a spring sealed shut .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	13	You are an orchard that puts forth pomegranates and other precious fruits , henna and nard —
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	14	nard , saffron and aromatic cane , cinnamon and all kinds of frankincense trees , myrrh , aloes , all the best spices .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	15	You are a garden fountain , a spring of running water , flowing down from the L ’ vanon . [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	16	Awake , north wind ! Come , south wind ! Blow on my garden to spread its fragrance . Let my darling enter his garden and eat its finest fruit .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	5	I got up to open for the man I love . My hands were dripping with myrrh — pure myrrh ran off my fingers onto the handle of the bolt .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	2	I am asleep , but my heart is awake . Listen ! I hear my darling knocking ! [ He ] Open for me , my sister , my love , my dove , my flawless one ! For my head is wet with dew , my hair with the moisture of the night . [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	3	I ’ ve removed my coat ; must I put it back on ? I ’ ve washed my feet ; must I dirty them again ?
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	4	The man I love put his hand through the hole by the door-latch , and my heart began pounding at the thought of him .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	6	I opened for my darling , but my darling had turned and gone . My heart had failed me when he spoke — I sought him , but I couldn ’ t find him ; I called him , but he didn ’ t answer .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	7	The watchmen roaming the city found me ; they beat me , they wounded me ; they took away my cloak , those guardians of the walls !
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	8	I charge you , daughters of Yerushalayim , that if you find the man I love , what are you to tell him ? That I am sick with love . [ Chorus ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	9	How does the man you love differ from any other , you most beautiful of women ? How does the man you love differ from any other , that you should give us this charge ? [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	10	The man I love is radiant and ruddy ; he stands out among ten thousand .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	11	His head is like the finest gold ; his locks are wavy and black as a raven .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	12	His eyes are like doves by running streams , bathed in milk and set just right .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	13	His cheeks are like beds of spices , like banks of fragrant herbs . His lips are like lilies dripping with sweet myrrh .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	14	His arms are rods of gold set with beryl , his body polished ivory adorned with sapphires .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	15	His legs are like pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold . His appearance is like the L ’ vanon , as imposing as the cedars .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	16	His words are sweetness itself ; he is altogether desirable . This is my darling , and this is my friend , daughters of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	6	Your teeth are like a flock of sheep that have just come up from being washed ; each of them is matched , and none of them is missing .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	2	My darling went down to his garden , to the beds of spices , to pasture his flock in the gardens and to gather lilies .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	3	I belong to the man I love , and he belongs to me ; he pastures his flock among the lilies . [ He ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	4	You are as beautiful as Tirtzah , my love , as lovely as Yerushalayim , but formidable as an army marching under banners .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	5	Turn your eyes away from me , because they overwhelm me ! Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	7	Your cheeks are like a pomegranate split open behind your veil .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	8	There are sixty queens and eighty concubines , as well as young women beyond number ;
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	9	but my dove , my perfect one , is unique , her mother ’ s only child , the darling of the one who bore her . The daughters see her and call her happy ; the queens and concubines praise her .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	10	“ Who is this , shining forth like the dawn , fair as the moon , bright as the sun ” — but formidable as an army marching under banners ? [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	11	I had gone down to the nut orchard to see the fresh green plants in the valley , to see if the vine had budded , or if the pomegranate trees were in bloom .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	12	Before I knew it , I found myself in a chariot , and with me was a prince .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	7	) Your appearance is stately as a palm tree , with its fruit clusters your breasts .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	2	) Your navel is like a round goblet that never lacks spiced wine . Your belly is a heap of wheat encircled by lilies .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	1	) How beautiful are your feet in sandals , you daughter of princes ! The curves of your thighs are like a necklace made by a skilled craftsman .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	3	) Your two breasts are like two fawns , twins of a gazelle .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	4	) Your neck is like a tower of ivory , your eyes like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bat-Rabbim , your nose like a tower in the L ’ vanon overlooking Dammesek .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	5	) You hold your head like the Karmel , and the hair on your head is like purple cloth — the king is held captive in its tresses .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	6	) How beautiful you are , my love , how charming , how delightful !
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	8	) I said , “ I will climb up into the palm tree , I will take hold of its branches. ” May your breasts be like clusters of grapes , your breath as fragrant as apples ,
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	9	) and your mouth like the finest wine . [ She ] May the wine go straight to the man I love and gently move the lips of those who are asleep .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	10	) I belong to my darling , and his desire is for me .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	11	) Come , my darling , let ’ s go out to the country and spend the nights in the villages .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	12	) We ’ ll get up early and go to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded , to see if their flowers have opened , or if the pomegranate trees are in bloom . There I will give you my love .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	13	) The mandrakes are sending out their fragrance , all kinds of choice fruits are at our doors , fruits both new and old , my darling , which I have kept in store for you .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	14	(
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	8	We have a little sister ; her breasts are still unformed . What are we to do with our sister when she is asked for in marriage ?
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	2	I would lead you and bring you to my mother ’ s house , and she would instruct me . I would give you spiced wine to drink , fresh juice from my pomegranates .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	3	His left arm would be under my head and his right arm around me .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	4	I warn you , daughters of Yerushalayim , not to awaken or stir up love until it wants to arise ! [ Chorus ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	5	Who is this , coming up from the desert , leaning on her darling ? [ He ] I awakened you under the apple tree . It was there that your mother conceived you ; there she who bore you conceived you . [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	6	Set me like a seal on your heart , like a seal on your arm ; for love is as strong as death , passion as cruel as Sh ’ ol ; its flashes are flashes of fire , [ as fierce as the ] flame of Yah .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	7	No amount of water can quench love , torrents can not drown it . If someone gave all the wealth in his house for love , he would gain only utter contempt . [ Chorus ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	9	If she is a wall , we will build on her a palace of silver ; and if she is a door , we will enclose her with panels of cedar . [ She ]
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	10	I am a wall , and my breasts are like towers ; so in his view I am like one who brings peace .
CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	11	Shlomo had a vineyard at Ba ‘ al-Hamon , and he gave the vineyard to caretakers ; each of them would pay for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver .

CJB	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	14	— Flee , my darling ! Be like a gazelle or young stag on the mountains of spices !
CJB	Isaiah	1	1	This is the vision of Yesha ‘ yahu the son of Amotz , which he saw concerning Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim during the days of ‘ Uziyahu , Yotam , Achaz and Y ’ chizkiyahu , kings of Y ’ hudah :
CJB	Isaiah	1	2	“ Hear , heaven ! Listen , earth ! For Adonai is speaking . “ I raised and brought up children , but they rebelled against me .
CJB	Isaiah	1	3	An ox knows its owner and a donkey its master ’ s stall , but Isra ’ el does not know , my people do not reflect .
CJB	Isaiah	1	4	“ Oh , sinful nation , a people weighed down by iniquity , descendants of evildoers , immoral children ! They have abandoned Adonai , spurned the Holy One of Isra ’ el , turned their backs on him !
CJB	Isaiah	1	5	“ Where should I strike you next , as you persist in rebelling ? The whole head is sick , the whole heart diseased .
CJB	Isaiah	1	6	From the sole of the foot to the head there is nothing healthy , only wounds , bruises and festering sores that haven ’ t been dressed or bandaged or softened up with oil .
CJB	Isaiah	1	7	“ Your land is desolate , your cities are burned to the ground ; foreigners devour your land in your presence ; it ’ s as desolate as if overwhelmed by floods .
CJB	Isaiah	1	8	The daughter of Tziyon is left like a shack in a vineyard , like a shed in a cucumber field , like a city under siege. ”
CJB	Isaiah	1	9	If Adonai-Tzva ’ ot had not left us a tiny , tiny remnant , we would have become like S ’ dom , we would have resembled ‘ Amora .
CJB	Isaiah	1	10	Hear what Adonai says , you rulers of S ’ dom ! Listen to God ’ s Torah , you people of ‘ Amora !
CJB	Isaiah	1	11	“ Why are all those sacrifices offered to me ? ” asks Adonai . “ I ’ m fed up with burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fattened animals ! I get no pleasure from the blood of bulls , lambs and goats !
CJB	Isaiah	1	12	Yes , you come to appear in my presence ; but who asked you to do this , to trample through my courtyards ?
CJB	Isaiah	1	13	Stop bringing worthless grain offerings ! They are like disgusting incense to me ! Rosh-Hodesh , Shabbat , calling convocations — I can ’ t stand evil together with your assemblies !
CJB	Isaiah	1	14	Everything in me hates your Rosh-Hodesh and your festivals ; they are a burden to me — I ’ m tired of putting up with them !
CJB	Isaiah	1	15	“ When you spread out your hands , I will hide my eyes from you ; no matter how much you pray , I won ’ t be listening ; because your hands are covered with blood .
CJB	Isaiah	1	16	“ Wash yourselves clean ! Get your evil deeds out of my sight ! Stop doing evil ,
CJB	Isaiah	1	17	learn to do good ! Seek justice , relieve the oppressed , defend orphans , plead for the widow .
CJB	Isaiah	1	18	“ Come now , ” says Adonai , “ let ’ s talk this over together . Even if your sins are like scarlet , they will be white as snow ; even if they are red as crimson , they will be like wool .
CJB	Isaiah	1	19	If you are willing and obedient , you will eat the good of the land ;
CJB	Isaiah	1	20	but if you refuse and rebel , you will be eaten by the sword ” ; for the mouth of Adonai has spoken .
CJB	Isaiah	1	21	How the faithful city has become a whore ! Once she was filled with justice , righteousness lodged in her ; but now murderers !
CJB	Isaiah	1	22	Your silver is no longer pure , your wine is watered down .
CJB	Isaiah	1	23	Your leaders are rebels , friends of thieves . They all love bribes and run after gifts . They give no justice to orphans , the widow ’ s complaint doesn ’ t catch their attention .
CJB	Isaiah	1	24	“ Therefore , ” says the Lord , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the Mighty One of Isra ’ el , “ I will free myself of my adversaries , I will take vengeance on my enemies .
CJB	Isaiah	1	25	But I will also turn my hand against you ! I will cleanse your impurities as with lye and remove all your alloyed base metal .
CJB	Isaiah	1	26	I will restore your judges as at first and your advisers as at the beginning . After that , you will be called the City of Righteousness , Faithful City .
CJB	Isaiah	1	27	Tziyon will be redeemed by justice ; and those in her who repent , by righteousness .
CJB	Isaiah	1	28	“ Rebels and sinners together will be broken and those who abandon Adonai be consumed .
CJB	Isaiah	1	29	You will be ashamed of the sacred oaks you desired , you will blush at the gardens you chose ;
CJB	Isaiah	1	30	for you will be like an oak whose leaf fades , like a garden without any water .
CJB	Isaiah	1	31	The strong will be like tinder and [ the idol ’ s ] maker like a spark ; both will burn together , and no one will put them out . ”
CJB	Isaiah	2	2	In the acharit-hayamim the mountain of Adonai ’ s house will be established as the most important mountain . It will be regarded more highly than the other hills , and all the Goyim will stream there .
CJB	Isaiah	2	3	Many peoples will go and say , “ Come , let ’ s go up to the mountain of Adonai , to the house of the God of Ya ‘ akov ! He will teach us about his ways , and we will walk in his paths. ” For out of Tziyon will go forth Torah , the word of Adonai from Yerushalayim .
CJB	Isaiah	2	4	He will judge between the nations and arbitrate for many peoples . Then they will hammer their swords into plow-blades and their spears into pruning-knives ; nations will not raise swords at each other , and they will no longer learn war .
CJB	Isaiah	2	5	Descendants of Ya ‘ akov , come ! Let ’ s live in the light of Adonai !
CJB	Isaiah	2	6	For you have abandoned your people the house of Ya ‘ akov . Now they are filled from the east , full of sorcerers , like the P ’ lishtim ; even the children of foreigners are enough for them !
CJB	Isaiah	2	7	Their land is full of silver and gold ; They have no end of treasures . Their land is full of horses ; They have no end of chariots .
CJB	Isaiah	2	8	Their land is full of idols ; everyone worships the work of his hands , what his own fingers have made .
CJB	Isaiah	2	9	A person bows down , a man lowers himself — don ’ t forgive them !
CJB	Isaiah	2	10	Come into the rock , hide in the dust to escape the terror of Adonai and the glory of his majesty .
CJB	Isaiah	2	11	The proud looks of man will be humiliated ; the arrogance of men will be bowed down ; and when that day comes , Adonai alone will be exalted .
CJB	Isaiah	2	12	Yes , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot has a day in store for all who are proud and lofty , for all who are lifted high to be humiliated ;
CJB	Isaiah	2	13	for all cedars of the L ’ vanon that are high and lifted up , for all the oaks of the Bashan ;
CJB	Isaiah	2	14	for all the high mountains , for all the hills that are lifted up ;
CJB	Isaiah	2	15	for every high tower , for every fortified wall ;
CJB	Isaiah	2	16	for every “ Tarshish ” ship , for every luxurious vessel .
CJB	Isaiah	2	17	The pride of man will be bowed down , the arrogance of men will be humiliated , and when that day comes , Adonai alone will be exalted .
CJB	Isaiah	2	18	The idols will be completely abolished .
CJB	Isaiah	2	19	People will enter cracks in the rocks and holes in the ground to escape the terror of Adonai and his glorious majesty , when he sets out to convulse the earth .
CJB	Isaiah	2	20	On that day a man will take hold of his idols of silver and idols of gold , which they made for themselves to worship , and fling them away to the moles and bats !
CJB	Isaiah	2	21	Then they will enter the cracks in the rocks and the crevices in the cliffs to escape the terror of Adonai and his glorious majesty , when he sets out to convulse the earth .
CJB	Isaiah	2	22	Stop relying on man , in whose nostrils is a mere breath — after all , he doesn ’ t count for much , does he ?
CJB	Isaiah	3	3	captains of fifty , men of rank and advisers , skillful magicians and expert enchanters .
CJB	Isaiah	3	2	heroes and warriors , judges and prophets , diviners and leaders ,
CJB	Isaiah	3	4	I will put children in authority ; capriciousness will govern them .
CJB	Isaiah	3	5	People will oppress each other — everyone his friend , everyone his neighbor . The young will be insolent toward their elders , the insignificant arrogant toward the respected .
CJB	Isaiah	3	6	A man will take hold of his brother in his father ’ s house and say , “ You have a coat , so rule us ! Take charge of this ruin ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	3	7	But on that day , he will protest , “ I don ’ t have a remedy , I lack food and clothing for my own house ; don ’ t put me in charge of people ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	3	8	For Yerushalayim is ruined , and Y ’ hudah has fallen ; because their words and deeds defy Adonai , in open provocation of his glory .
CJB	Isaiah	3	9	Their very look witnesses against them ! They parade their sin , like S ’ dom ; they don ’ t even try to hide it — all the worse for them ! — they bring evil on themselves .
CJB	Isaiah	3	10	Say that it will go well with the righteous , that they will enjoy the fruit of their actions ;
CJB	Isaiah	3	11	but woe to the wicked , it will go badly with him ; for what he has done will be done to him .
CJB	Isaiah	3	12	My people — children oppress them , and women are ruling over them . My people ! Your guides lead you astray and obliterate the paths you should follow .
CJB	Isaiah	3	13	Adonai rises to accuse , he stands to judge the peoples .
CJB	Isaiah	3	14	Adonai presents the indictment against the leaders and officers of his people : “ It is you who devour the vineyard ; in your houses is plunder taken from the poor .
CJB	Isaiah	3	15	What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding down the faces of the poor ? ” says Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Isaiah	3	16	Moreover Adonai says : “ Because Tziyon ’ s women are so proud , walking with their heads in the air and throwing seductive glances , moving with mincing steps and jingling their anklets —
CJB	Isaiah	3	17	Adonai will strike the crown of the heads of Tziyon ’ s women with sores , and Adonai will expose their private parts. ”
CJB	Isaiah	3	18	On that day Adonai will take away their finery — their anklets , medallions and crescents ,
CJB	Isaiah	3	19	their pendants , bracelets and veils ;
CJB	Isaiah	3	20	their headbands , armlets , sashes , perfume bottles , amulets ,
CJB	Isaiah	3	21	rings and nose-jewels ;
CJB	Isaiah	3	22	their fine dresses , wraps , shawls , handbags ,
CJB	Isaiah	3	23	gauze scarves , linen underclothes , turbans and capes .
CJB	Isaiah	3	24	Then , there will be instead of perfume , a stench ; instead of a belt , a rope ; instead of well-set hair , a shaved scalp ; instead of a rich robe , a sackcloth skirt ; and a slave-brand instead of beauty .
CJB	Isaiah	3	25	Your men will fall by the sword and your warriors in battle .
CJB	Isaiah	3	26	Her gates will lament and mourn ; ravaged , she will sit on the ground .
CJB	Isaiah	4	4	When Adonai washes away the filth of the women of Tziyon and cleanses Yerushalayim from the blood shed in it with a blast of searing judgment ,
CJB	Isaiah	4	2	On that day , Adonai ’ s plant will be beautiful and glorious ; and the fruit of the land will be the pride and splendor of Isra ’ el ’ s survivors .
CJB	Isaiah	4	3	Those left in Tziyon and remaining in Yerushalayim will be called holy , and everyone in Yerushalayim written down for life .
CJB	Isaiah	4	5	Adonai will create over the whole site of Mount Tziyon and over those who assemble there a smoking cloud by day and a shining , flaming fire by night ; for the Glory will be over everything like a hupah .
CJB	Isaiah	4	6	A sukkah will give shade by day from the heat ; it will also provide refuge and cover from storm and rain .
CJB	Isaiah	5	5	Now come , I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard : I will remove its hedge , and [ its grapes ] will be eaten up ; I will break through its fence , and [ its vines ] will be trampled down .
CJB	Isaiah	5	2	He dug up its stones and cleared them away , planted it with the choicest vines , built a watchtower in the middle of it , and carved out in its rock a winepress . He expected it to produce good grapes , but it produced only sour , wild grapes .
CJB	Isaiah	5	3	Now , citizens of Yerushalayim and people of Y ’ hudah , judge between me and my vineyard .
CJB	Isaiah	5	4	What more could I have done for my vineyard that I haven ’ t already done in it ? So why , when I expected good grapes , did it produce sour , wild grapes ?
CJB	Isaiah	5	6	I will let it go to waste : it will be neither pruned nor hoed , but overgrown with briars and thorns . I will also order the clouds not to let rain fall on it .
CJB	Isaiah	5	7	Now the vineyard of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is the house of Isra ’ el , and the men of Y ’ hudah are the plant he delighted in . So he expected justice , but look — bloodshed ! — and righteousness , but listen — cries of distress !
CJB	Isaiah	5	8	Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field , until there ’ s no room for anyone else , and you live in splendor alone on your land .
CJB	Isaiah	5	9	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot said in my ears , “ Many houses will be brought to ruin , large , magnificent ones left empty ;
CJB	Isaiah	5	10	for a ten-acre vineyard will produce only five gallons of wine , and seed from five bushels of grain will yield but half a bushel. ”
CJB	Isaiah	5	11	Woe to those who get up early to pursue intoxicating liquor ; who stay up late at night , until wine inflames them .
CJB	Isaiah	5	12	They have lutes and lyres , drums and flutes , and wine at their parties ; but they pay no attention to how Adonai works and never look at what his hands have made .
CJB	Isaiah	5	13	For such lack of knowledge my people go into exile ; this is also why their respected men starve and their masses are parched from thirst .
CJB	Isaiah	5	14	Therefore Sh ’ ol has enlarged itself and opened its limitless jaws — and down go their nobles and masses , along with their noise and revels .
CJB	Isaiah	5	15	The masses are lowered , the nobles are humbled — proud looks will be brought down .
CJB	Isaiah	5	16	But Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is exalted through justice , God the Holy One is consecrated through righteousness .
CJB	Isaiah	5	17	Then lambs will be able to feed as if they were in their own pasture , and those wandering through will eat from the ruined fields of the overfed .
CJB	Isaiah	5	18	Woe to those who begin by pulling at transgression with a thread , but end by dragging sin along as if with a cart rope .
CJB	Isaiah	5	19	They say , “ We want God to speed up his work , to hurry it along , so we can see it ! We want the Holy One of Isra ’ el ’ s plan to come true right now , so we can be sure of it ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	5	20	Woe to those who call evil good and good evil , who change darkness into light and light into darkness , who change bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter !
CJB	Isaiah	5	21	Woe to those seeing themselves as wise , esteeming themselves as clever .
CJB	Isaiah	5	22	Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine , men whose power goes to mixing strong drinks ,
CJB	Isaiah	5	23	who acquit the guilty for bribes but deny justice to the righteous !
CJB	Isaiah	5	24	Therefore , as fire licks up the stubble , and the chaff is consumed in the flame ; so their root will rot , and their flowers scatter like dust ; because they have rejected the Torah of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , they have despised the word of the Holy One of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	5	25	This is why Adonai ’ s anger blazed up against his people , why he stretched out his hand against them and struck them [ so hard that ] the hills shook , and corpses lay like trash in the streets . Even after all this , his anger remains , his upraised hand still threatens .
CJB	Isaiah	5	26	He will give a signal to faraway nations , he will whistle for them to come from the ends of the earth ; and here they come , so fast ! —
CJB	Isaiah	5	27	none of them tired or stumbling , none of them sleeping or drowsy , none with a loose belt , none with a broken sandal-strap .
CJB	Isaiah	5	28	Their arrows are sharp , all their bows are strung , their horses ’ hoofs are like flint , and their [ chariot ] wheels like a whirlwind .
CJB	Isaiah	5	29	They will roar like lions — yes , roaring like young lions , they growl and seize the prey and carry it off , with no one to rescue .
CJB	Isaiah	5	30	On that day they will growl at them , like the sea when it growls — and when one looks toward land , one sees darkness closing in ; the light is dissipated in the obscuring overcast .
CJB	Isaiah	6	6	One of the s ’ rafim flew to me with a glowing coal in his hand , which he had taken with tongs from the altar .
CJB	Isaiah	6	2	S ’ rafim stood over him , each with six wings — two for covering his face , two for covering his feet and two for flying .
CJB	Isaiah	6	3	They were crying out to each other , “ More holy than the holiest holiness is Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ! The whole earth is filled with his glory ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	6	4	The doorposts shook at the sound of their shouting , and the house was filled with smoke .
CJB	Isaiah	6	5	Then I said , “ Woe to me ! I [ too ] am doomed ! — because I , a man with unclean lips , living among a people with unclean lips , have seen with my own eyes the King , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	6	7	He touched my mouth with it and said , “ Here ! This has touched your lips . Your iniquity is gone , your sin is atoned for. ”
CJB	Isaiah	6	8	Then I heard the voice of Adonai saying , “ Whom should I send ? Who will go for us ? ” I answered , “ I ’ m here , send me ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	6	9	He said , “ Go and tell this people : ‘ Yes , you hear , but you don ’ t understand . You certainly see , but you don ’ t get the point ! ’
CJB	Isaiah	6	10	“ Make the heart of this people [ sluggish with ] fat , stop up their ears , and shut their eyes . Otherwise , seeing with their eyes , and hearing with their ears , then understanding with their hearts , they might repent and be healed ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	6	11	I asked , “ Adonai , how long ? ” and he answered , “ Until cities become uninhabited ruins , houses without human presence , the land utterly wasted ;
CJB	Isaiah	6	12	until Adonai drives the people far away , and the land is one vast desolation .
CJB	Isaiah	6	13	If even a tenth [ of the people ] remain , it will again be devoured . “ But like a pistachio tree or an oak , whose trunk remains alive after its leaves fall off , the holy seed will be its trunk . ”
CJB	Isaiah	7	7	“ ‘ This is what Adonai Elohim says : “ It won ’ t occur , it won ’ t happen .
CJB	Isaiah	7	2	It was told to the house of David that Aram and Efrayim had become allies . Achaz ’ s heart began to tremble , as did the hearts of his people , like forest trees shaken by the wind .
CJB	Isaiah	7	3	Then Adonai said to Yesha ‘ yahu , “ Go out now to meet Achaz , you and your son Sh ’ ar Yashuv , at the end of the aqueduct from the Upper Pool , on the road to the Launderers ’ Field ;
CJB	Isaiah	7	4	and say to him , ‘ Take care to stay calm and unafraid ; don ’ t be demoralized by these two smoldering stumps of firewood , by the blazing anger of Retzin and Aram or the son of Remalyah ;
CJB	Isaiah	7	5	or because Aram , Efrayim and the son of Remalyah have been plotting against you , thinking ,
CJB	Isaiah	7	6	“ We will invade Y ’ hudah , tear it apart , divide it among ourselves and appoint the son of Tav ’ el as king there. ”
CJB	Isaiah	7	8	For the head of Aram is Dammesek , and the head of Dammesek Retzin . In sixty-five years Efrayim will be broken and will cease to be a people .
CJB	Isaiah	7	9	The head of Efrayim is Shomron , and the head of Shomron is the son of Remalyah . Without firm faith , you will not be firmly established. ” ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	7	10	Adonai spoke again to Achaz ; he said ,
CJB	Isaiah	7	11	“ Ask Adonai your God to give you a sign . Ask it anywhere , from the depths of Sh ’ ol to the heights above. ”
CJB	Isaiah	7	12	But Achaz answered , “ I won ’ t ask , I won ’ t test Adonai. ”
CJB	Isaiah	7	13	Then [ the prophet ] said , “ Listen here , house of David ! Is trying people ’ s patience such a small thing for you that you must try the patience of my God as well ?
CJB	Isaiah	7	14	Therefore Adonai himself will give you people a sign : the young woman * will become pregnant , bear a son and name him ‘ Immanu El [ God is with us ] .
CJB	Isaiah	7	15	By the time he knows enough to refuse evil and choose good , he will [ have to ] eat curdled milk and [ wild ] honey .
CJB	Isaiah	7	16	Yes , before the child knows enough to refuse evil and choose good , the land whose two kings you dread will be left abandoned .
CJB	Isaiah	7	17	Adonai will bring the king of Ashur on you , your people and your father ’ s house . These will be days worse than any you ’ ve known since Efrayim broke loose from Y ’ hudah. ”
CJB	Isaiah	7	18	Yes , when that day comes , Adonai will whistle for the fly in the farthest streams of the Nile in Egypt and for the bee in the land of Ashur .
CJB	Isaiah	7	19	They will come and settle , all of them , in steep vadis and holes in the rocks and on all thorn bushes and brambles .
CJB	Isaiah	7	20	When that day comes , Adonai will shave — with a razor hired beyond the [ Euphrates ] River , that is , with the king of Ashur — the head and the hair between the legs , and get rid of the beard as well .
CJB	Isaiah	7	21	When that day comes , a man will raise a young cow and two sheep .
CJB	Isaiah	7	22	Will they produce in abundance ? No , he will [ have to ] eat curdled milk . Indeed , everyone left in the land will eat curdled milk and [ wild ] honey .
CJB	Isaiah	7	23	When that day comes , wherever there once were a thousand grapevines , worth a thousand pieces of silver , there will be only briars and thorns .
CJB	Isaiah	7	24	One will go there [ to hunt ] with bow and arrow , because all the land will be briars and thorns .
CJB	Isaiah	7	25	You won ’ t visit hills once worked with a hoe , for fear of the briars and thorns ; it will be good only for pasturing cattle and being trampled down by sheep .
CJB	Isaiah	8	8	It will sweep through Y ’ hudah , flooding everything and passing on . It will reach even up to the neck , and its outspread wings will fill the whole expanse of the land. ” God is with us ! [ a ]
CJB	Isaiah	8	2	I had it witnessed for me by reliable witnesses — Uriyah the cohen and Z ’ kharyahu the son of Y ’ verekhyahu .
CJB	Isaiah	8	3	Then I had sexual relations with my wife ; she became pregnant and gave birth to a son ; and Adonai said to me , “ Name him Maher Shalal Hash Baz ;
CJB	Isaiah	8	4	because before the child knows how to cry , ‘ Abba ! ’ and ‘ Eema ! ’ , the riches of Dammesek and the spoil of Shomron will be carried off and given to the king of Ashur. ”
CJB	Isaiah	8	5	Adonai went on speaking and said more to me :
CJB	Isaiah	8	6	“ Since this people has rejected the gently flowing waters from Shilo ’ ach and takes joy in Retzin and the son of Remalyah ;
CJB	Isaiah	8	7	now Adonai will bring upon them the mighty floodwaters of the [ Euphrates ] River — that is , the king of Ashur and his power . It will rise above all its channels and overflow all its banks .
CJB	Isaiah	8	9	You may make an uproar , peoples ; but you will be shattered . Listen , all of you from distant lands : arm yourselves , but you will be shattered ; yes , arm yourselves , but you will be shattered ;
CJB	Isaiah	8	10	devise a plan , but it will come to nothing ; say anything you like , but it won ’ t happen ; because God is with us [ b ] .
CJB	Isaiah	8	11	For this is what Adonai said to me , speaking with a strong hand , warning me not to live the way this people does :
CJB	Isaiah	8	12	“ Don ’ t regard as alliance what this people calls alliance , and don ’ t fear what they fear or be awestruck by it ;
CJB	Isaiah	8	13	but Adonai-Tzva ’ ot — consecrate him ! Let him be the object of your fear and awe !
CJB	Isaiah	8	14	He is there to be a sanctuary . But for both the houses of Isra ’ el he will be a stone to stumble over , a rock obstructing their way ; a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Isaiah	8	15	Many of them will stumble and fall , be broken and trapped and captured .
CJB	Isaiah	8	16	Wrap up this document , and confine its teaching to those I have instructed. ”
CJB	Isaiah	8	17	I will wait for Adonai , who is hiding his face from the house of Ya ‘ akov ; yes , I will look for him .
CJB	Isaiah	8	18	Meanwhile , I and the children whom Adonai has given me will become for Isra ’ el signs and wonders from Adonai-Tzva ’ ot living on Mount Tziyon .
CJB	Isaiah	8	19	So when they tell you to consult those squeaking , squawking mediums and fortune-tellers ; [ you are to answer ] , “ Shouldn ’ t a people seek their God ? Must the living ask the dead
CJB	Isaiah	8	20	for teaching and instruction ? ” For they will indeed give you this unenlightened suggestion .
CJB	Isaiah	8	21	Distressed and hungry they will pass through the land ; and because of their hunger they will grow angry and curse by their king and by their God . But whether they look up [ to God ]
CJB	Isaiah	8	22	or [ down ] at the earth , they will see only trouble and darkness , anguished gloom and pervasive darkness .
CJB	Isaiah	8	23	( 9:1 ) But there will be no more gloom for those who are now in anguish . In the past the land of Z ’ vulun and the land of Naftali were regarded lightly ; but in the future he will honor the way to the lake , beyond the Yarden , Galil-of-the-Goyim .

CJB	Isaiah	9	21	) M ’ nasheh devours Efrayim ; and Efrayim , M ’ nasheh ; while together they oppose Y ’ hudah . Even after all this , his anger remains , his upraised hand still threatens .
CJB	Isaiah	10	10	Just as my hand reached the kingdoms of non-gods , with more images than in Yerushalayim and Shomron ;
CJB	Isaiah	10	2	to deprive the impoverished of justice and rob my people ’ s poor of their rights , looting widows and preying on orphans !
CJB	Isaiah	10	3	What will you do on the day of punishment , when calamity comes from afar ? To whom will you flee for help ? Where will you leave your wealth ,
CJB	Isaiah	10	4	so as not to squat among the prisoners or fall among the slain ? Even after all this , his anger remains , his upraised hand still threatens .
CJB	Isaiah	10	5	“ Oh Ashur , the rod expressing my anger ! The club in their hands is my fury !
CJB	Isaiah	10	6	I am sending him against a hypocritical nation , ordering him to march against a people who enrage me , to take the spoil and the plunder and trample them down like mud in the street .
CJB	Isaiah	10	7	That is not what Ashur intends , that is not what they think ; rather , they mean to destroy , to cut down nation after nation .
CJB	Isaiah	10	8	For [ their king ] says , ‘ Aren ’ t all my commanders kings ?
CJB	Isaiah	10	9	Hasn ’ t Kalno [ suffered ] like Kark ’ mish , Hamat like Arpad , Shomron like Dammesek ?
CJB	Isaiah	10	11	so won ’ t I do to Yerushalayim and her non-gods what I did to Shomron and her idols ? ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	10	12	Therefore when Adonai has done everything he intends to do to Mount Tziyon and Yerushalayim , “ I will punish the king of Ashur for the boasting that comes from his proud heart and from reveling in his arrogant looks .
CJB	Isaiah	10	13	For he says , “ ‘ With my own strong arm I have done this , and with my wisdom , because I ’ m so clever ! I erased the boundaries between peoples , I plundered their stores for the future ; as a mighty man , I subjugated the inhabitants .
CJB	Isaiah	10	14	My hand found the riches of the peoples like a nest ; and as one gathers abandoned eggs , I gathered the whole earth ! Not one wing fluttered , not one beak opened or let out a chirp ! ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	10	15	Should the axe glorify itself over the one who chops with it ? Should the saw magnify itself over the one who moves it ? It ’ s as if a stick could wave the hand that raises it up , or as if a wooden staff could lift [ a person , who is ] not made of wood .
CJB	Isaiah	10	16	Therefore the Lord , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , will send leanness to his well-fed ones ; and in place of his glory , a fire will be kindled that will burn and burn .
CJB	Isaiah	10	17	The light of Isra ’ el will become a fire and his Holy One a flame , burning and devouring his thorns and briars in a single day .
CJB	Isaiah	10	18	The glory of his forest and of his fertile land he will consume body and soul , like an invalid wasting away .
CJB	Isaiah	10	19	So few forest trees will remain that a child could list them .
CJB	Isaiah	10	20	On that day the remnant of Isra ’ el , those of the house of Ya ‘ akov who escaped , will no longer rely on the man who struck them down , but will truly rely on Adonai , the Holy One of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	10	21	A remnant will return , the remnant of Ya ‘ akov , to the mighty God .
CJB	Isaiah	10	22	For , although your people , Isra ’ el , are like the sand of the sea , only a remnant of them will return . Destruction is decreed , overflowing with justice .
CJB	Isaiah	10	23	Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot will bring about this decreed destruction throughout all the land .
CJB	Isaiah	10	24	Therefore Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot says : “ My people living in Tziyon , don ’ t be afraid of Ashur , even when he strikes you with a stick and raises his staff against you , the way it was in Egypt .
CJB	Isaiah	10	25	For in but a little while , my fury will end ; and my anger will have destroyed them. ”
CJB	Isaiah	10	26	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will wield a whip against them , as he did when striking Midyan at the Rock of ‘ Orev ; as his staff was over the sea , he will raise it , the way it was in Egypt .
CJB	Isaiah	10	27	On that day his burden will fall from your shoulders and his yoke from your neck ; the yoke will be destroyed by your prosperity .
CJB	Isaiah	10	28	He has come to ‘ Ayat and passed through Migron . He has stored his equipment at Mikhmas .
CJB	Isaiah	10	29	They have crossed the pass , then lodged at Geva . Ramah is shaking , Giv ‘ at-Sha ’ ul has fled .
CJB	Isaiah	10	30	Cry , shriek , Bat-Gallim ! Listen , Layish ! Poor ‘ Anatot !
CJB	Isaiah	10	31	Madmenah is in flight , The people of Gevim take cover .
CJB	Isaiah	10	32	This very day he will stop at Nov ; and he will shake his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Tziyon , at the hill of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Isaiah	10	33	See how Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot lops off the branches with terrible violence ! The ones standing highest are chopped down , the lofty are laid low .
CJB	Isaiah	10	34	He will hack down the forest underbrush with an axe , and the L ’ vanon in its splendor falls .
CJB	Isaiah	11	11	On that day Adonai will raise his hand again , a second time , to reclaim the remnant of his people who remain from Ashur , Egypt , Patros , Ethiopia , ‘ Eilam , Shin ‘ ar , Hamat and the islands in the sea .
CJB	Isaiah	11	2	The Spirit of Adonai will rest on him , the Spirit of wisdom and understanding , the Spirit of counsel and power , the Spirit of knowledge and fearing Adonai —
CJB	Isaiah	11	3	he will be inspired by fearing Adonai . He will not judge by what his eyes see or decide by what his ears hear ,
CJB	Isaiah	11	4	but he will judge the impoverished justly ; he will decide fairly for the humble of the land . He will strike the land with a rod from his mouth and slay the wicked with a breath from his lips .
CJB	Isaiah	11	5	Justice will be the belt around his waist , faithfulness the sash around his hips .
CJB	Isaiah	11	6	The wolf will live with the lamb ; the leopard lie down with the kid ; calf , young lion and fattened lamb together , with a little child to lead them .
CJB	Isaiah	11	7	Cow and bear will feed together , their young will lie down together , and the lion will eat straw like the ox .
CJB	Isaiah	11	8	An infant will play on a cobra ’ s hole , a toddler put his hand in a viper ’ s nest .
CJB	Isaiah	11	9	They will not hurt or destroy anywhere on my holy mountain , for the earth will be as full of the knowledge of Adonai as water covering the sea .
CJB	Isaiah	11	10	On that day the root of Yishai , which stands as a banner for the peoples — the Goyim will seek him out , and the place where he rests will be glorious .
CJB	Isaiah	11	12	He will hoist a banner for the Goyim , assemble the dispersed of Isra ’ el , and gather the scattered of Y ’ hudah from the four corners of the earth .
CJB	Isaiah	11	13	Efrayim ’ s jealousy will cease — those who harass Y ’ hudah will be cut off , Efrayim will stop envying Y ’ hudah , and Y ’ hudah will stop provoking Efrayim .
CJB	Isaiah	11	14	They will swoop down on the flank of the P ’ lishtim to the west . Together they will pillage the people to the east — they will put out their hand over Edom and Mo ’ av , and the people of ‘ Amon will obey them .
CJB	Isaiah	11	15	Adonai will dry up the gulf of the Egyptian Sea . He will shake his hand over the [ Euphrates ] River to bring a scorching wind , dividing it into seven streams and enabling people to cross dryshod .
CJB	Isaiah	11	16	There will be a highway for the remnant of his people who are still left from Ashur , just as there was for Isra ’ el when he came out from the land of Egypt .
CJB	Isaiah	12	12	On that day you will say : “ I thank you , Adonai , because , although you were angry at me , your anger is now turned away ; and you are comforting me .
CJB	Isaiah	12	2	“ See ! God is my salvation . I am confident and unafraid ; for Yah Adonai is my strength and my song , and he has become my salvation ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	12	3	Then you will joyfully draw water from the springs of salvation .
CJB	Isaiah	12	4	On that day you will say , “ Give thanks to Adonai ! Call on his name ! Make his deeds known among the peoples , declare how exalted is his name .
CJB	Isaiah	12	5	Sing to Adonai , for he has triumphed — this is being made known throughout the earth .
CJB	Isaiah	12	6	Shout and sing for joy , you who live in Tziyon ; for the Holy One of Isra ’ el is with you in his greatness ! ” Bible Gateway Recommends The Complete Jewish Study Bible Retail : $ 49.95 Our Price : $ 27.49 Save : $ 22.46 (

CJB	Isaiah	13	13	This is why I will make the heavens tremble , and the earth will be shaken from its place at the wrath of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot on the day of his fierce anger .
CJB	Isaiah	13	2	Hoist a banner on a high mountain , shout to [ the invaders ] ; beckon them to enter the Nobles ’ Gate .
CJB	Isaiah	13	3	“ I have ordered my holy ones , summoned my heroes , eager and bold , to execute my anger. ”
CJB	Isaiah	13	4	Listen ! A tumult on the mountains — it sounds like a vast multitude ! Listen ! The uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathering together ! Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is mustering an army for war .
CJB	Isaiah	13	5	They come from a distant land , from beyond the horizon . It ’ s Adonai , with the weapons of his rage , to lay waste to all the earth .
CJB	Isaiah	13	6	Howl ! for the Day of Adonai is at hand , destruction coming from Shaddai .
CJB	Isaiah	13	7	This is why every arm will hang limp and everyone ’ s courage melt away .
CJB	Isaiah	13	8	They will be gripped by panic , seized with pain and agony , writhing like a woman in labor , looking aghast at each other , faces aflame .
CJB	Isaiah	13	9	Here comes the Day of Adonai , full of cruelty , rage and hot fury , to desolate the earth and destroy the sinners in it .
CJB	Isaiah	13	10	For the stars , the constellations in the sky , will no longer give their light ; the sun will be dark when it rises ; and the moon will no longer shine .
CJB	Isaiah	13	11	“ I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity . I will end the arrogance of the proud and humble the insolence of tyrants .
CJB	Isaiah	13	12	I will make humans rarer than gold , scarcer than Ofir ’ s pure gold .
CJB	Isaiah	13	14	Then , like a hunted gazelle , like sheep with no one to gather them , everyone will head back to his own people ; everyone will flee to his own land .
CJB	Isaiah	13	15	Anyone found will be pierced through ; anyone caught will fall by the sword ,
CJB	Isaiah	13	16	their babies dashed to pieces before their eyes , their houses looted , their wives raped .
CJB	Isaiah	13	17	I will stir up against them the Medes , who can not be tempted by silver or bought off with gold .
CJB	Isaiah	13	18	Their bows will tear young men to pieces , they will have no pity on the fruit of the womb , their eye will not spare children. ”
CJB	Isaiah	13	19	Thus Bavel , that jewel of kingdoms , the pride and glory of the Kasdim , will be like S ’ dom and ‘ Amora when overthrown by God .
CJB	Isaiah	13	20	It will never again be inhabited , never lived in through all generations . Arabs will not pitch tents there nor shepherds bring their flocks .
CJB	Isaiah	13	21	But wildcats will lie there , their houses will be full of owls , ostriches will live there , and wild goats will dance there .
CJB	Isaiah	13	22	Jackals will howl in their palaces and wild dogs in their temples of delight . Its time is close at hand , its days will not last long .
CJB	Isaiah	14	14	I will rise past the tops of the clouds , I will make myself like the Most High. ’
CJB	Isaiah	14	2	Peoples will take and escort them to their homeland , and the house of Isra ’ el will possess them in the land of Adonai as male and female slaves . They will take their captors captive and rule over their oppressors .
CJB	Isaiah	14	3	Then , when Adonai gives you rest from your suffering and trouble and from the hard service imposed on you ,
CJB	Isaiah	14	4	you will take up this taunt-song against the king of Bavel : “ At last the oppressor is stilled , his arrogance is ended !
CJB	Isaiah	14	5	Adonai has broken the staff of the wicked , the scepter of the rulers ,
CJB	Isaiah	14	6	which furiously struck down peoples with unceasing blows , angrily beating down nations with relentless persecution .
CJB	Isaiah	14	7	The whole earth is at rest and quiet . They break into song .
CJB	Isaiah	14	8	The cypresses rejoice over you , with the cedars of the L ’ vanon — ‘ Now that you are laid low , no one comes to cut us down. ’
CJB	Isaiah	14	9	“ Sh ’ ol below is stirred up to meet you when you come . It awakens for you the ghosts of the dead who were leaders on earth ; it makes all the kings of the nations arise from their thrones .
CJB	Isaiah	14	10	They all greet you with these words : ‘ Now you are as weak as we are , you have become like us !
CJB	Isaiah	14	11	Your pride has been brought down to Sh ’ ol with the music of your lyres , under you a mattress of maggots , over you a blanket of worms. ’
CJB	Isaiah	14	12	“ How did you come to fall from the heavens , morning star , son of the dawn ? How did you come to be cut to the ground , conqueror of nations ?
CJB	Isaiah	14	13	You thought to yourself , ‘ I will scale the heavens , I will raise my throne above God ’ s stars . I will sit on the Mount of Assembly far away in the north .
CJB	Isaiah	14	15	“ Instead you are brought down to Sh ’ ol , to the uttermost depths of the pit .
CJB	Isaiah	14	16	Those who see you will stare at you , reflecting on what has become of you : ‘ Is this the man who shook the earth , who made kingdoms tremble ,
CJB	Isaiah	14	17	who made the world a desert , who destroyed its cities , who would not set his prisoners free ? ’
CJB	Isaiah	14	18	“ All other kings of the nations , all of them , lie in glory , each in his tomb .
CJB	Isaiah	14	19	But you are discarded , unburied , like a loathed branch , clothed like the slain who were pierced by the sword , then fall to the stones inside a pit , like a corpse to be trampled underfoot .
CJB	Isaiah	14	20	You will not be joined with those kings in the grave , because you destroyed your own land , you have brought death to your own people . The descendants of evildoers will be utterly forgotten .
CJB	Isaiah	14	21	Get ready to slaughter his sons for the iniquity of their fathers ; so they won ’ t arise , take over the earth and cover the world with their cities. ”
CJB	Isaiah	14	22	“ I will arise against them , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . “ I will cut off from Bavel name and remnant , offshoot and offspring , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	14	23	“ I will make it a haunt for hedgehogs , it will become a swampy waste , I will sweep it with the broom of destruction , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Isaiah	14	24	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot has sworn , “ Just as I thought it , it will occur ; just as I planned it , so it will be .
CJB	Isaiah	14	25	I will break Ashur in my land , I will trample him down on my mountains . Then his yoke will fall off them , his burden be removed from their shoulders. ”
CJB	Isaiah	14	26	This is the program planned for all the earth , this is the hand stretched out over all the nations .
CJB	Isaiah	14	27	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot has made his decision . Who is there that can stop him ? He has stretched out his hand . Who can turn it back ?
CJB	Isaiah	14	28	In the year that King Achaz died , this prophecy came :
CJB	Isaiah	14	29	Do not rejoice , P ’ leshet , any of you , that the rod which struck you is broken ; for out of the snake ’ s root will come a viper , and his offspring will be a flying fiery serpent .
CJB	Isaiah	14	30	While the firstborn of the poor graze and the needy lie down in safety , I will kill off your root with famine and slaughter the rest of you .
CJB	Isaiah	14	31	Howl , gate ! Cry , city ! Melt away , P ’ leshet , all of you ! For a smoke is coming from the north , with not a straggler in its ranks .
CJB	Isaiah	14	32	And what is one to answer the messengers of the nation ? That Adonai founded Tziyon , and there the poor of his people will find refuge .
CJB	Isaiah	15	15	This is a prophecy about Mo ’ av : The night ‘ Ar is sacked , Mo ’ av is ruined . The night Kir is sacked , Mo ’ av is ruined .
CJB	Isaiah	15	2	He went up to the temple , to Dibon and to the high places , to weep . On N ’ vo and Meidva Mo ’ av is howling , every head shaved bald , every beard cut off .
CJB	Isaiah	15	3	In the streets they wear sackcloth ; on their roofs and in their squares , everyone howls and weeps profusely .
CJB	Isaiah	15	4	Heshbon and El ‘ aleh cry out , they are heard as far as Yachatz . Mo ’ av ’ s best troops cry aloud , as their courage faints away .
CJB	Isaiah	15	5	My heart cries out for Mo ’ av ! Its fugitives flee to Tzo ‘ ar , a calf three years old . They ascend the slope of Luchit , weeping as they go ; on their way to Horonayim , they utter heartrending cries .
CJB	Isaiah	15	6	The waters of Nimrim are desolate , the grass is dried up , the new growth fails , nothing green is left .
CJB	Isaiah	15	7	Therefore they carry away their wealth , everything they have put aside , across the Vadi of the Willows .
CJB	Isaiah	15	8	For the cry has circulated throughout Mo ’ av ’ s territory — its howling has reached Eglayim , its howling has reached Be ’ er-Elim .
CJB	Isaiah	15	9	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood , yet I have worse in store for Dimon — a lion for those who escape from Mo ’ av and for those who remain in its land .
CJB	Isaiah	16	16	Send lambs for the ruler of the land from the crags toward the desert to the mountain of the daughter of Tziyon .
CJB	Isaiah	16	2	The daughters of Mo ’ av at the fords of the Arnon are like fluttering birds pushed from the nest .
CJB	Isaiah	16	3	“ Give [ us ] counsel ! Decide [ to help ] ! Make your shadow [ over us ] like night in the middle of noonday . Hide [ our ] outcasts ! Don ’ t betray [ our ] fugitives !
CJB	Isaiah	16	4	Let our outcasts live with you ! Protect Mo ’ av from the attacks of robbers ! ” For when the extorting ends , the spoiling ceases , and those trampling on the land are destroyed ,
CJB	Isaiah	16	5	a throne will be set up by grace , and on it , in the tent of David , will sit an honest judge , seeking justice and pursuing righteousness .
CJB	Isaiah	16	6	We have heard about Mo ’ av ’ s pride , how very proud they are ; about their haughty arrogance , their insolence and bravado .
CJB	Isaiah	16	7	Therefore Mo ’ av will wail for Mo ’ av — they will all wail ! You will sigh , stricken by grief , for the raisin-cakes of Kir-Hareset .
CJB	Isaiah	16	8	For the grainfields of Heshbon are withering , also the vineyards of Sibmah , whose red grapes overpowered rulers of nations — once they reached as far as Ya ‘ zer and trailed out into the desert ; their spreading branches even crossed the sea .
CJB	Isaiah	16	9	Therefore I will weep for Sibmah ’ s vine as I weep for Ya ‘ zer ; I will water you with my tears , Heshbon and El ‘ aleh ; because the shouts of battle are falling on your summer fruits and harvest ;
CJB	Isaiah	16	10	gladness and joy are removed from the fruitful fields . No revelry in the vineyards , no happy shouting , no one treading grapes in the wine presses — I have silenced the vintage-cheers .
CJB	Isaiah	16	11	This is why my heart throbs like a lyre for Mo ’ av , and everything in me for Kir-Heres .
CJB	Isaiah	16	12	Even when Mo ’ av is seen growing weary of worshipping on the high places and entering their sanctuaries to pray , they will have accomplished nothing .
CJB	Isaiah	16	13	This is the word Adonai spoke against Mo ’ av in the past .
CJB	Isaiah	16	14	But now Adonai has said , “ Within three years [ and not a day more ] , as if a hired worker were keeping track of the time , the glory of Mo ’ av will be brought into contempt , despite its large population ; and the surviving remnant will be few and feeble . ”
CJB	Isaiah	17	17	This is a prophecy about Dammesek : “ Dammesek will soon stop being a city ; it will become a heap of ruins .
CJB	Isaiah	17	2	The cities of ‘ Aro ‘ er will be abandoned , given over to flocks lying down undisturbed .
CJB	Isaiah	17	3	Efrayim will have no defenses , Dammesek will cease to rule , and Aram ’ s survivors will share the fate of Isra ’ el ’ s finest sons , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Isaiah	17	4	“ When that day comes , Ya ‘ akov ’ s glory will wane , and his full body grow thin ,
CJB	Isaiah	17	5	as when the harvester collects the standing grain , reaping the ears of grain with his arm ; yes , as when they glean the grain in the Refa ’ im Valley .
CJB	Isaiah	17	6	Yet gleanings will be left , as when beating an olive tree — two or three olives at the very top , four or five on its fruitful branches , ” says Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	17	7	On that day , a person will heed his Maker and turn his eyes toward the Holy One of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	17	8	He will pay no heed to the altars made with his own hands , he will not turn toward what his fingers made , the sacred poles and standing-stones for sun-worship .
CJB	Isaiah	17	9	When that day comes , his strong cities , which others abandoned when Isra ’ el advanced , will be like abandoned woods and forests ; they will be laid waste .
CJB	Isaiah	17	10	For you have forgotten the God who saved you , failed to remember the Rock of your strength ; so you plant pagan-style gardens and set out vine-cuttings for a foreign god .
CJB	Isaiah	17	11	Though you make them grow on the day you plant them , and in the morning your seedlings flower ; the crop will vanish the day disease comes , a day of incurable pain .
CJB	Isaiah	17	12	Oh , the terror-stricken uproar of many peoples , roaring like the roar of the seas , and the rushing about of nations , rushing and surging like wild , wild waters !
CJB	Isaiah	17	13	Yes , the nations will roar like the mighty ocean , but he will rebuke them , and far will they flee , driven like chaff by a mountain wind , like whirling dust in advance of the storm .
CJB	Isaiah	17	14	As evening falls , you can see terror ; before sunrise , they have ceased to be . This is the lot of those who plunder us , the fate of those who prey on us .
CJB	Isaiah	18	18	Woe to the land of whirring wings beyond the rivers of Ethiopia ;
CJB	Isaiah	18	2	they send ambassadors by sea , across the water in papyrus-reed boats ! Go , swift messengers , to a nation tall and bronzed , to a people feared far and near , to a strong and conquering nation whose land is divided by rivers !
CJB	Isaiah	18	3	All you inhabitants of the world , you who live on the earth : when a banner is hoisted on the mountains , look ! When the shofar is blown , listen !
CJB	Isaiah	18	4	For Adonai has said this to me : “ I will look on from my place and do nothing , like heat shimmering in the sun , like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. ”
CJB	Isaiah	18	5	For before the harvest , when the flowering is over , and the bud becomes a ripening grape , he will cut off the branches with pruning-knives , lop off the twigs and take them away .
CJB	Isaiah	18	6	They will all be left to the vultures in the mountains and to the wild animals in the fields ; the vultures will feed on them in summer , and the wild animals of the fields in winter .
CJB	Isaiah	18	7	At that time tribute will be brought to Adonai-Tzva ’ ot from a nation tall and bronzed , from a people feared far and near , from a strong and conquering nation whose land is divided by rivers , to the place where the name of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot lives , Mount Tziyon .
CJB	Isaiah	19	19	On that day there will be an altar to Adonai in the middle of the land of Egypt , as well as a standing-stone for Adonai at its border .
CJB	Isaiah	19	2	“ I will incite Egypt against Egypt , brother will fight against brother , friend against friend , city against city , kingdom against kingdom .
CJB	Isaiah	19	3	The courage of Egypt will ebb away within it , I will reduce its counsel to confusion . They will consult idols and mediums , ghosts and spirits .
CJB	Isaiah	19	4	I will hand over the Egyptians to a cruel master . A harsh king will rule them , ” says the Lord , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Isaiah	19	5	The water will ebb from the sea , the river will be drained dry .
CJB	Isaiah	19	6	The rivers will become foul , the canals of Egypt ’ s Nile will dwindle and dry up , the reeds and rushes will wither .
CJB	Isaiah	19	7	The river-plants on the banks of the Nile and everything sown near the Nile will dry up , blow away and be no more .
CJB	Isaiah	19	8	Fishermen too will lament , all who cast hooks in the Nile will mourn , those who spread nets on the water lose heart .
CJB	Isaiah	19	9	The linen-workers will be in despair , along with the weavers of white cotton ;
CJB	Isaiah	19	10	the spinners will be crushed , the hired workers dejected .
CJB	Isaiah	19	11	The princes of Tzo ‘ an are utter fools , Pharaoh ’ s wisest counselors give stupid advice . How can you say to Pharaoh , “ I ’ m a sage , descended from kings of old. ”
CJB	Isaiah	19	12	Where are they , then , those sages of yours ? Let them tell you , so all can know what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot has planned against Egypt !
CJB	Isaiah	19	13	The princes of Tzo ‘ an have been fooled , the princes of Nof have been duped , Egypt ’ s clan chiefs have led her astray .
CJB	Isaiah	19	14	Adonai has mixed up their minds with a spirit that distorts judgment , so they make Egypt stagger in whatever she does , like a drunk staggering in his vomit .
CJB	Isaiah	19	15	Nobody in Egypt will find work to do — neither head nor tail , neither [ tall ] palm frond nor [ lowly ] reed .
CJB	Isaiah	19	16	On that day Egypt will be like women trembling with fear , because Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is shaking his fist at them .
CJB	Isaiah	19	17	Just mentioning the land of Y ’ hudah to the Egyptians will throw them into panic ; they will be afraid because of what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot has planned for them .
CJB	Isaiah	19	18	On that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Kena ‘ an and swear loyalty to Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ; one of them will be called the City of Destruction . *
CJB	Isaiah	19	20	It will be a sign and witness to Adonai-Tzva ’ ot in the land of Egypt ; so that when they cry out to Adonai for help because of the oppressors , he will send them a savior to defend and rescue them .
CJB	Isaiah	19	21	Adonai will make himself known to Egypt ; on that day , the Egyptians will know Adonai . They will worship him with sacrifices and offerings , they will make vows to Adonai and keep them .
CJB	Isaiah	19	22	Yet Adonai will strike Egypt , both striking and healing , so they will return to Adonai . He will listen to their prayers , and he will heal them .
CJB	Isaiah	19	23	On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Ashur . Ashur will come to Egypt and Egypt to Ashur , and Egypt will worship with Ashur .
CJB	Isaiah	19	24	On that day Isra ’ el will be a third partner with Egypt and Ashur , a blessing here on earth ;
CJB	Isaiah	19	25	for Adonai-Tzva ’ ot has blessed him : “ Blessed be Egypt my people , Ashur the work of my hands and Isra ’ el my heritage . ”
CJB	Isaiah	20	20	In the year that Sargon the king of Ashur sent his commander-in-chief to attack Ashdod , he captured it .
CJB	Isaiah	20	2	It was at that time that Adonai , speaking through Yesha ‘ yahu the son of Amotz , said , “ Go and unwind the sackcloth from around your waist , and take your sandals off your feet. ” So he did it , going about unclothed and barefoot .
CJB	Isaiah	20	3	In time , Adonai said , “ Just as my servant Yesha ‘ yahu has gone about unclothed and barefoot for three years as a sign and portent against Egypt and Ethiopia ,
CJB	Isaiah	20	4	so will the king of Ashur lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia , young and old , unclothed and barefoot , with their buttocks exposed , to the shame of Egypt .
CJB	Isaiah	20	5	They will be dismayed and ashamed because of Ethiopia their hope and Egypt their pride .
CJB	Isaiah	20	6	On that day , the people living along this coast will say , ‘ Look what happened to the people to whom we fled for help , hoping they would rescue us from the king of Ashur ! How will we escape now ? ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	21	21	A prophecy about the coastal desert : Like whirlwinds sweeping over the Negev , it comes from the desert , from a fearsome land .
CJB	Isaiah	21	2	A dire vision has been shown to me : the betrayer betrays , and the spoiler spoils . ‘ Eilam , advance ! Madai , lay siege ! I will end all groaning .
CJB	Isaiah	21	3	This is why my insides are racked with pain ; I am seized by pangs , like a woman in labor ; wrenched by what I hear , aghast at what I see .
CJB	Isaiah	21	4	My mind reels , shuddering assails me . The twilight I longed for terrifies me .
CJB	Isaiah	21	5	They set the table , light the lamps , eat and drink — “ Get going , princes ! Oil the shields ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	21	6	For this is what Adonai said to me : “ Go , post a watchman to report what he sees !
CJB	Isaiah	21	7	If he sees the cavalry , horsemen in pairs , riders on donkeys , riders on camels , he must be on alert , on full alert ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	21	8	He calls out like a lion : “ My lord , I stand on the watchtower all day long , I stay at my post all night. ”
CJB	Isaiah	21	9	Then , as they appeared — the cavalry , horsemen in pairs — he spoke these words : “ She has fallen ! She has fallen — Bavel ! All the carved images of her gods lie shattered on the ground. ”
CJB	Isaiah	21	10	My people , who have been threshed , grain trodden down on my threshing-floor : I am telling you what I have heard from Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	21	11	A prophecy about Dumah : Someone is calling to me from Se ‘ ir : “ Watchman , how much longer is it night ? Watchman , how much longer is it night ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	21	12	The watchman answers : “ Morning is coming , but also the night . If you want to ask , ask ! Come back again ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	21	13	A prophecy about Arabia : You caravans of D ’ danim will camp in the desert growth of Arabia .
CJB	Isaiah	21	14	Bring water to the thirsty , you who live in Teima , greet the fugitives with food ;
CJB	Isaiah	21	15	because they are fleeing the sword , the drawn sword , the bent bow and the press of battle .
CJB	Isaiah	21	16	For this is what Adonai has told me : “ Within a year [ and not a day more ] , as if a hired worker were keeping track of the time , the glory of Kedar will come to an end .
CJB	Isaiah	21	17	Few of Kedar ’ s valiant archers will be left . ” Adonai the God of Isra ’ el has spoken .
CJB	Isaiah	22	22	I will place the key of David ’ s house on his shoulder ; no one will shut what he opens ; no one will open what he shuts .
CJB	Isaiah	22	2	You city full of noise , confusion and boisterous excitement , your slain did not fall to the sword , nor did they die in battle .
CJB	Isaiah	22	3	All your leaders fled together and were captured without the use of a bow ; all from you who were found were captured , even though they had fled far away .
CJB	Isaiah	22	4	This is why I said , “ Don ’ t look at me , leave me alone to weep bitterly , don ’ t try to comfort me over the destruction of my people. ”
CJB	Isaiah	22	5	For it is a day of panic , trampling and confusion from Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot in the Valley of Vision . With walls crashing down , they cry for help to the mountains .
CJB	Isaiah	22	6	‘ Eilam picks up the quivers , with cavalry and horsemen , and Kir uncovers the shields .
CJB	Isaiah	22	7	In time , your choicest valleys are overrun by chariots , and the cavalry take their posts by the gate ;
CJB	Isaiah	22	8	thus is Y ’ hudah ’ s protection removed . That day you looked for the armor in the House of the Forest .
CJB	Isaiah	22	9	You saw how many breaches there were in the City of David , you collected water from the lower pool ,
CJB	Isaiah	22	10	you surveyed the houses in Yerushalayim , tearing some down to fortify the wall .
CJB	Isaiah	22	11	You also built a reservoir between the two walls for the water from the Old Pool ; but you didn ’ t look to Him who made these things ; you had no respect for Him who fashioned them long ago .
CJB	Isaiah	22	12	That day Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot called on you to weep and mourn , to shave your heads and wear sackcloth ;
CJB	Isaiah	22	13	but instead , one sees joy and celebrating , killing of oxen , slaughtering of sheep , eating of meat , drinking of wine — “ Let ’ s eat and drink now , because tomorrow we ’ ll be dead ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	22	14	Then Adonai-Tzva ’ ot revealed himself in my ears : “ You will not atone for this iniquity until you die. ” This is what Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot says .
CJB	Isaiah	22	15	Thus says Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot : “ Go and find that steward , Shevna , administrator of the palace , and ask him :
CJB	Isaiah	22	16	‘ What do you own here , and who gave you the right to cut yourself a tomb here ? Why do you get such an eminent tomb ? Why are you carving a resting-place for yourself in the rock ? ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	22	17	Look , strong man ! Adonai is about to throw you out ! He will grab you ,
CJB	Isaiah	22	18	roll you up , and toss you around like a ball in the open country . There you will die , with your fancy chariots , you disgrace to your master ’ s palace !
CJB	Isaiah	22	19	“ I will remove you from your office , I will snatch you from your post .
CJB	Isaiah	22	20	When that day comes , I will summon my servant Elyakim the son of Hilkiyahu .
CJB	Isaiah	22	21	I will dress him in your robe , gird him with your sash of office , and invest him with your authority . He will be a father to the people living in Yerushalayim and to the house of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Isaiah	22	23	“ I will fasten him firmly in place like a peg , so that he will become a seat of honor for his clan .
CJB	Isaiah	22	24	They will hang on him all the weight of his clan , descendants and offspring , as well as all the vessels of small capacity , from pitchers to cups .
CJB	Isaiah	22	25	When that day comes , the peg fastened firmly in place will give way ; it will be cut down and fall , and the weight that was on it will be cut off. ” For Adonai has said it .
CJB	Isaiah	23	23	A prophecy about Tzor : Howl , you “ Tarshish ” ships , because the harbor is destroyed ! On returning from Kittim , they discover they can not enter it .
CJB	Isaiah	23	2	Silence , you who live on the coast , you who have been enriched by the merchants of Tzidon crossing the sea .
CJB	Isaiah	23	3	By the great water the grain of Shichor , the harvest of the Nile , brought you profits . She was marketplace for the nations .
CJB	Isaiah	23	4	Shame , Tzidon , for the sea speaks ; the fortress of the sea says , “ I no longer have labor pains or bear children , yet I have raised neither boys nor girls. ”
CJB	Isaiah	23	5	When the report reaches Egypt , they will be in anguish at the fate of Tzor .
CJB	Isaiah	23	6	Cross over to Tarshish ! Howl , you who live on the coast !
CJB	Isaiah	23	7	Is this your boisterous city , whose feet long ago in antiquity carried her off to found distant colonies ?
CJB	Isaiah	23	8	Who planned this against Tzor , the city that once bestowed crowns , whose merchants are princes , whose traders are honored throughout the earth ?
CJB	Isaiah	23	9	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot planned it to break the pride of all the arrogant , to humiliate all those who are honored everywhere on earth .
CJB	Isaiah	23	10	People of Tarshish ! Nothing restricts you now . You can flow freely over your land just like the Nile River .
CJB	Isaiah	23	11	He has stretched out his hand against the sea , he has shaken kingdoms ; Adonai has ordered that Kena ‘ an ’ s fortresses be destroyed .
CJB	Isaiah	23	12	He has said , “ Exult no more , oppressed virgin daughter of Tzidon . Arise , cross to Kittim ; even there you will find no rest. ”
CJB	Isaiah	23	13	Look at the land of the Kasdim ! This was the people who did not exist when Ashur destined it for desert creatures . They erected their siege towers and tore down her palaces , so that it has been made a ruin .
CJB	Isaiah	23	14	Howl , you “ Tarshish ” ships , because your fortress is destroyed .
CJB	Isaiah	23	15	When that day comes , Tzor will be forgotten for seventy years , the lifetime of a king . After seventy years , its fate will be the same as that of the prostitute in this song :
CJB	Isaiah	23	16	“ Take a lyre , walk the city , you poor , forgotten whore ! Play sweetly , sing all your songs , so that they will remember you ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	23	17	After seventy years are over Adonai will remember Tzor . She will receive her wages again and prostitute herself to all the world ’ s kingdoms on the face of the earth .
CJB	Isaiah	23	18	But her merchandise and profits will be dedicated to Adonai ; they will not be stored up or hoarded , because her profits will be for those living in Adonai ’ s presence , so that they can eat their fill and wear fine clothing .
CJB	Isaiah	24	24	Look ! Adonai is stripping and destroying the land , turning it upside down and scattering its inhabitants —
CJB	Isaiah	24	2	cohen and commoner , slave and master , maid and mistress , buyer and seller , lender and borrower , creditor and debtor .
CJB	Isaiah	24	3	The land will be completely stripped , completely plundered , for Adonai has spoken this word .
CJB	Isaiah	24	4	The land fades and withers , the world wilts and withers , the exalted of the land languish .
CJB	Isaiah	24	5	The land lies defiled under its inhabitants ; because they have transgressed the teachings , changed the law and broken the everlasting covenant .
CJB	Isaiah	24	6	Therefore a curse is devouring the land , and its inhabitants are punished for their guilt . It is why those living there waste away , and the people left are few .
CJB	Isaiah	24	7	The new wine fails , the vines wilt , all the revelers sigh ,
CJB	Isaiah	24	8	the happy sound of tambourines ceases , the shouts of merrymakers are stilled , the joy of the lyre ends .
CJB	Isaiah	24	9	They no longer sing as they drink their wine , strong liquor tastes bitter to those drinking it .
CJB	Isaiah	24	10	The city of chaos is shattered , every house closed up ; no one can enter .
CJB	Isaiah	24	11	In the streets they are crying over the wine ; all joy has faded , cheer has left the land .
CJB	Isaiah	24	12	In the city , only desolation , its gates are battered beyond repair .
CJB	Isaiah	24	13	Around the earth , among the peoples , it will be as when beating an olive tree , as when gleaning the grapes at the end of the harvest .
CJB	Isaiah	24	14	They lift their voices , singing for joy , shouting from the west to honor Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	24	15	So in the east , honor Adonai ; in the coastlands , honor the name of Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	24	16	From the farthest part of the earth we have heard them sing , “ Glory to the Righteous One ! ” But , I say , I ’ m wasting away , I am wasting away ! Woe to me ! Traitors betray ! Oh , how the traitors betray and betray !
CJB	Isaiah	24	17	Terror , pit and trap are upon you , you who are living on earth .
CJB	Isaiah	24	18	He who flees at the sound of terror will fall into the pit . He who climbs up out of the pit will be caught in the trap . For the windows above have been opened , and the earth ’ s foundations shake .
CJB	Isaiah	24	19	The earth cracks and breaks open , the earth crumbles to pieces , the earth trembles and totters .
CJB	Isaiah	24	20	The earth staggers to and fro like a drunk , sways back and forth like a watchman ’ s shelter ; its transgression weighs heavy upon it ; it will fall and not rise again .
CJB	Isaiah	24	21	When that day comes , Adonai will punish the armies of the high heaven on high , and the kings of the earth here on earth .
CJB	Isaiah	24	22	They will be assembled like prisoners in a dungeon and shut up in prison to be punished many years .
CJB	Isaiah	24	23	Then the moon will be confused and the sun ashamed , for Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will rule on Mount Tziyon and in Yerushalayim , with his glory manifest to the rulers of his people .
CJB	Isaiah	25	25	Adonai , you are my God . I exalt you , I praise your name . For you have accomplished marvels , [ fulfilled ] ancient plans faithfully and truly .
CJB	Isaiah	25	2	For you have made a city a heap of stones , turned a fortified city into rubble , made the foreigners ’ fortress a city that will never be rebuilt .
CJB	Isaiah	25	3	Therefore mighty peoples glorify you , the city of ruthless nations fears you .
CJB	Isaiah	25	4	For you have been a refuge for the poor , a refuge for the needy in distress , shelter from the storm , shade from the heat — for the blast from the ruthless was like a storm that could destroy a wall .
CJB	Isaiah	25	5	Like desert heat , you subdue the foreigners ’ uproar ; like heat subdued by a cloud ’ s shadow , the song of the ruthless dies away .
CJB	Isaiah	25	6	On this mountain Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will make for all peoples a feast of rich food and superb wines , delicious , rich food and superb , elegant wines .
CJB	Isaiah	25	7	On this mountain he will destroy the veil which covers the face of all peoples , the veil enshrouding all the nations .
CJB	Isaiah	25	8	He will swallow up death forever . Adonai Elohim will wipe away the tears from every face , and he will remove from all the earth the disgrace his people suffer . For Adonai has spoken .
CJB	Isaiah	25	9	On that day they will say , “ See ! This is our God ! We waited for him to save us . This is Adonai ; we put our hope in him . We are full of joy , so glad he saved us ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	25	10	For on this mountain the hand of Adonai will rest . But Mo ’ av will be trampled down where they are , like straw trampled into a pile of manure .
CJB	Isaiah	25	11	They will spread out their hands in Mo ’ av , like a swimmer using his hands to tread water ; but their pride will be humbled and sunk , no matter how clever the strokes of their hands .
CJB	Isaiah	25	12	Your high , fortified walls he will level , strike to the ground , lay in the dust .
CJB	Isaiah	26	26	On that day this song will be sung in the land of Y ’ hudah : “ We have a strong city ! He has built walls and ramparts for our safety .
CJB	Isaiah	26	2	Open the gates ! Let the righteous nation enter , a nation that keeps faith !
CJB	Isaiah	26	3	“ A person whose desire rests on you you preserve in perfect peace , because he trusts in you .
CJB	Isaiah	26	4	Trust in Adonai forever , because in Yah Adonai , is a Rock of Ages. ”
CJB	Isaiah	26	5	For he has humbled those in high places , levelling the lofty city , levelling it to the ground , laying it in the dust .
CJB	Isaiah	26	6	It is trampled underfoot by the feet of the poor , by the footsteps of the needy .
CJB	Isaiah	26	7	The way of the righteous is level ; Righteous One , you smooth the path for the righteous .
CJB	Isaiah	26	8	Following the way of your judgments , we put our hope in you . The desire of all our soul is to remember you and your name .
CJB	Isaiah	26	9	My soul desires you at night , my spirit in me seeks you at dawn ; for when your judgments are here on earth , the people in the world learn what righteousness is .
CJB	Isaiah	26	10	Even if pity is shown to the wicked , he still doesn ’ t learn what righteousness is . In a land of uprightness he will still act wrongly and fail to see the majesty of Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	26	11	Adonai , you raised your hand , but they still didn ’ t see . Yet with shame they will see your zeal for the people . Yes , fire will destroy your enemies .
CJB	Isaiah	26	12	Adonai , you will grant us peace ; because all we have done , you have done for us .
CJB	Isaiah	26	13	Adonai our God , other lords besides you have ruled us , but only you do we invoke by name .
CJB	Isaiah	26	14	The dead will not live again , the ghosts will not rise again ; for you punished and destroyed them , wiped out all memory of them .
CJB	Isaiah	26	15	You enlarged the nation , Adonai , you enlarged the nation ; and thus you glorified yourself ; you extended all the frontiers of the country .
CJB	Isaiah	26	16	Adonai , when they were troubled , they sought you . When you chastened them , they poured out a silent prayer .
CJB	Isaiah	26	17	As a pregnant woman about to give birth cries out and writhes in her labor pains , so we have been at your presence , Adonai —
CJB	Isaiah	26	18	we have been pregnant and been in pain . But we , as it were , have given birth to wind ; we have not brought salvation to the land , and those inhabiting the world have not come to life .
CJB	Isaiah	26	19	Your dead will live , my corpses will rise ; awake and sing , you who dwell in the dust ; for your dew is like the morning dew , and the earth will bring the ghosts to life .
CJB	Isaiah	26	20	Come , my people , enter your rooms , and shut your doors behind you . Hide yourselves for a little while until the wrath is past .
CJB	Isaiah	26	21	For see ! Adonai emerges from his place to punish those on earth for their sin . Then the earth will reveal the blood shed on it and no longer conceal its slain .
CJB	Isaiah	27	27	On that day Adonai , with his great , strong , relentless sword , will punish Livyatan the fleeing serpent , the twisting serpent Livyatan ; he will slay the sea monster .
CJB	Isaiah	27	2	On that day , a pleasant vineyard — sing about it !
CJB	Isaiah	27	3	“ I , Adonai , guard it . Moment to moment I water it . So that no harm will come to it , I guard it night and day .
CJB	Isaiah	27	4	I have no anger in me . If it gives me briars and thorns , then , as in war , I will trample it down and burn it up at once ;
CJB	Isaiah	27	5	unless it takes hold of my strength , in order to make peace with me , yes , to make peace with me. ”
CJB	Isaiah	27	6	The time is coming when Ya ‘ akov will take root ; Isra ’ el will bud and flower , and fill the whole world with a harvest .
CJB	Isaiah	27	7	[ Adonai ] will not strike Isra ’ el , as he did others who struck Isra ’ el ; he will not kill them , as he did the others .
CJB	Isaiah	27	8	Your controversy with her is fully resolved by sending her [ into exile ] . He removes her with a rough gust of wind on a day when it ’ s blowing from the east .
CJB	Isaiah	27	9	So the iniquity of Ya ‘ akov is atoned for by this , and removing his sin produces this result : he chops up all the altar stones like chalk — sacred poles and sun-pillars stand no more .
CJB	Isaiah	27	10	For the fortified city is alone , abandoned and deserted , like the desert . Calves graze and lie down there , stripping its branches bare .
CJB	Isaiah	27	11	When its harvest dries up , it is broken off ; women come and set it on fire . For this is a people without understanding . Therefore he who made them will not pity them , he who formed them will show them no mercy .
CJB	Isaiah	27	12	On that day Adonai will beat out the grain between the Euphrates River and the Vadi of Egypt ; and you will be gathered , one by one , people of Isra ’ el !
CJB	Isaiah	27	13	On that day a great shofar will sound . Those lost in the land of Ashur will come , also those scattered through the land of Egypt ; and they will worship Adonai on the holy mountain in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Isaiah	28	28	When crushing grain for bread , one doesn ’ t thresh it forever ; one drives the horse and cart wheels over it but doesn ’ t crush it to powder .
CJB	Isaiah	28	2	Adonai has someone strong and powerful . He comes like a hailstorm , a destructive tempest , like a flood of water , rushing , overwhelming ; with his hand he hurls them to the ground .
CJB	Isaiah	28	3	The haughty crown of Efrayim ’ s drunks is trampled underfoot ;
CJB	Isaiah	28	4	and the fading flower of its proud splendor , located at the head of the rich valley , is like the first ripe fig of summer — whoever sees it picks and eats it .
CJB	Isaiah	28	5	On that day , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will be a glorious crown , a brilliant diadem for the remnant of his people .
CJB	Isaiah	28	6	He will also be a spirit of justice for whoever sits as a judge , and a source of strength for those repelling enemy attacks at the gate .
CJB	Isaiah	28	7	But there are others reeling from wine , staggering about because of strong liquor ; cohen and prophet reel from strong liquor , they are confused by wine . Led astray by strong liquor , they err in their visions and stumble when judging .
CJB	Isaiah	28	8	All tables are covered with vomit and feces , not a single place is clean .
CJB	Isaiah	28	9	Can no one be taught anything ? Can no one understand the message ? Must one teach barely weaned toddlers , babies just taken from the breast ,
CJB	Isaiah	28	10	so that [ one has to use nursery rhymes ] ? — Tzav la-tzav , tzav la-tzav , kav la-kav , kav la-kav z ‘ eir sham , z ‘ eir sham [ Precept by precept , precept by precept , line by line , line by line , a little here , a little there ] .
CJB	Isaiah	28	11	So with stammering lips , in a foreign accent , [ Adonai ] will speak to this people .
CJB	Isaiah	28	12	He once told this people , “ It ’ s time to rest , the exhausted can rest , now you can relax ” — but they wouldn ’ t listen .
CJB	Isaiah	28	13	So now the word of Adonai for them comes “ precept by precept , precept by precept , line by line , line by line , a little here , a little there , ” so that when they walk , they stumble backward , and are broken , trapped and captured !
CJB	Isaiah	28	14	So listen to the word of Adonai , you scoffers , composing taunts for this people in Yerushalayim :
CJB	Isaiah	28	15	Because you said , “ We made a covenant with death , we made a contract with Sh ’ ol . When the raging flood passes through , it will not touch us . For we have made lies our refuge and hid ourselves in falsehoods ” —
CJB	Isaiah	28	16	therefore here is what Adonai Elohim says : “ Look , I am laying in Tziyon a tested stone , a costly cornerstone , a firm foundation-stone ; he who trusts will not rush here and there .
CJB	Isaiah	28	17	I will make justice the plumbline and righteousness the plumb-bob ; hail will sweep away the refuge of lies , water will overflow the hiding place ,
CJB	Isaiah	28	18	your covenant with death will be annulled , and your contract with Sh ’ ol will not stand . When the raging flood passes through , you will be trampled down by it .
CJB	Isaiah	28	19	As often as it passes through , it will take you , for it will pass through every morning , day after day , night after night ; understanding the message will be sheer terror. ”
CJB	Isaiah	28	20	For , [ as the saying goes , ] “ The bed is too short for a person to stretch , and the blanket too narrow [ to protect him from cold ] even if he crams himself in. ”
CJB	Isaiah	28	21	For Adonai will arise , as at Mount P ’ ratzim , and storm with rage , as in the Giv ‘ on Valley ; so he can do his deed , his strange deed , and perform his task , his alien task .
CJB	Isaiah	28	22	Therefore , now , stop your scoffing , or your bonds will be further tightened ; for I have heard from Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot that destruction is decreed for the whole land .
CJB	Isaiah	28	23	Listen and hear my voice ; pay attention , and hear what I say :
CJB	Isaiah	28	24	Does a farmer sowing keep plowing forever ? Does he never stop breaking up and harrowing his land ?
CJB	Isaiah	28	25	No — when he finishes levelling it , he scatters his dill-seed , sows his cumin , puts wheat in rows , barley where it belongs , and plants buckwheat around the edges ;
CJB	Isaiah	28	26	because his God has taught him this , has given him instruction .
CJB	Isaiah	28	27	Dill must not be threshed with a sledge or cartwheels driven over cumin ; rather , dill one beats with a stick and cumin with a flail .
CJB	Isaiah	28	29	This too comes from Adonai-Tzva ’ ot — his counsel is wonderful , his wisdom great .
CJB	Isaiah	29	29	Woe to Ari ’ el [ fireplace on God ’ s altar , lion of God ] — Ari ’ el , the city where David encamped ! Celebrate the feasts for a few more years ,
CJB	Isaiah	29	2	but then I will bring trouble to Ari ’ el . There will be mourning and moaning , as she becomes truly an ari ’ el for me .
CJB	Isaiah	29	3	I will encamp all around you , besiege you with towers and mount siege-works against you .
CJB	Isaiah	29	4	Prostrate , you will speak from the ground ; your words will be stifled by the dust ; your voice will sound like a ghost in the ground , your words like squeaks in the dust .
CJB	Isaiah	29	5	But your many foes will become like fine powder , the horde of tyrants like blowing chaff , and it will happen very suddenly .
CJB	Isaiah	29	6	You will be visited by Adonai-Tzva ’ ot with thunder , earthquakes and loud noises , whirlwinds , tempests , flaming firestorms .
CJB	Isaiah	29	7	Then , all the nations fighting Ari ’ el , every one at war with her , the ramparts around her , the people that trouble her will fade like a dream , like a vision in the night .
CJB	Isaiah	29	8	It will be like a hungry man dreaming he ’ s eating ; but when he wakes up , his stomach is empty ; or like a thirsty man dreaming he ’ s drinking ; but when he wakes up , he is dry and exhausted — it will be like this for the horde of all nations fighting against Mount Tziyon .
CJB	Isaiah	29	9	If you make yourselves stupid , you will stay stupid ! If you blind yourselves , you will stay blind ! You are drunk , but not from wine ; you are staggering , but not from strong liquor .
CJB	Isaiah	29	10	For Adonai has poured over you a spirit of lethargy ; he has closed your eyes ( that is , the prophets ) and covered your heads ( that is , the seers ) .
CJB	Isaiah	29	11	For you this whole prophetic vision has become like the message in a sealed-up scroll . When one gives it to someone who can read and says , “ Please read this , ” he answers , “ I can ’ t , because it ’ s sealed. ”
CJB	Isaiah	29	12	If the scroll is given to someone who can ’ t read with the request , “ Please read this , ” he says , “ I can ’ t read. ”
CJB	Isaiah	29	13	Then Adonai said : “ Because these people approach me with empty words , and the honor they bestow on me is mere lip-service ; while in fact they have distanced their hearts from me , and their ‘ fear of me ’ is just a mitzvah of human origin —
CJB	Isaiah	29	14	therefore , I will have to keep shocking these people with astounding and amazing things , until the ‘ wisdom ’ of their ‘ wise ones ’ vanishes , and the ‘ discernment ’ of their ‘ discerning ones ’ is hidden away. ”
CJB	Isaiah	29	15	Woe to those who burrow down deep to hide their plans from Adonai ! They work in the dark and say to themselves , “ Nobody sees us , nobody knows us. ”
CJB	Isaiah	29	16	How you turn things upside down ! — Is the potter not better than the clay , Does something made say of its maker , “ He didn ’ t make me ” ? Does the product say of its producer , “ He has no discernment ” ?
CJB	Isaiah	29	17	In but a little while the L ’ vanon will be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field regarded as a forest .
CJB	Isaiah	29	18	On that day the deaf will hear the words of a book , and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see .
CJB	Isaiah	29	19	The humble will again rejoice in Adonai and the poor exult in the Holy One of Isra ’ el ,
CJB	Isaiah	29	20	for the tyrant is now nothing , the scoffer is finished , and all alert to do evil are cut off —
CJB	Isaiah	29	21	those whose words make a man out to be a sinner , those who set traps for the arbitrator at the city gate , and those who groundlessly deny justice to the one in the right .
CJB	Isaiah	29	22	Therefore , here are the words of Adonai , who redeemed Avraham , concerning the house of Ya ‘ akov : “ Ya ‘ akov will no longer be ashamed , no longer will his face grow pale .
CJB	Isaiah	29	23	When his descendants see the work of my hands among them , they will consecrate my name . Yes , they will consecrate the Holy one of Ya ‘ akov and stand in awe of the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	29	24	Those whose spirits stray will come to understand , and those who complain will learn their lesson .
CJB	Isaiah	30	30	Adonai will make his glorious voice heard , and he will reveal his arm descending with furious anger in a flaming firestorm , with cloudbursts , tempests and hailstones .
CJB	Isaiah	30	2	They go down to Egypt but don ’ t consult me , seeking refuge in Pharaoh ’ s protection , seeking shelter in Egypt ’ s shadow .
CJB	Isaiah	30	3	But Pharaoh ’ s protection will bring you shame , shelter in Egypt ’ s shadow will lead to disgrace .
CJB	Isaiah	30	4	Though his princes are at Tzo ‘ an , and his envoys have reached Hannes ,
CJB	Isaiah	30	5	they all are disappointed with a people that doesn ’ t help them , who give no assistance and no advantage , only disappointment and disgrace. ”
CJB	Isaiah	30	6	A prophecy about the animals in the Negev : In a land of trouble and anguish , of lionesses and roaring lions , of vipers and poisonous flying serpents , they carry their riches on donkeys ’ backs and their treasures on camels ’ humps to a people who will not help them .
CJB	Isaiah	30	7	For Egypt ’ s help is worthless , pointless ; so I call her “ Arrogance Doing Nothing. ”
CJB	Isaiah	30	8	Now go , inscribe it on a tablet , write it for them in a scroll , so that on the final day it will be a witness forever and ever .
CJB	Isaiah	30	9	For this is a rebellious people ; they are lying children , children who refuse to hear the Torah of Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	30	10	They say to the seers , “ Do not see ! ” to those who have visions , “ Do not tell us the visions you have as they really are ; but flatter us , fabricate illusions !
CJB	Isaiah	30	11	Get out of the way ! Leave the path ! Rid us of the Holy One of Isra ’ el ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	30	12	Therefore here is what the Holy One of Isra ’ el says : “ Because you reject this word , trust in extortion and rely on deceit ,
CJB	Isaiah	30	13	this sin will become for you a crack bulging out high on a wall , showing signs it is ready to fall ; then suddenly , all at once , it breaks. ”
CJB	Isaiah	30	14	He will break it like a clay pot , ruthlessly shattering it into pieces so tiny not even a potsherd remains for taking fire from the fireplace or scooping water from the cistern .
CJB	Isaiah	30	15	For this is what Adonai Elohim , the Holy One of Isra ’ el , says : “ Returning and resting is what will save you ; calmness and confidence will make you strong — but you want none of this !
CJB	Isaiah	30	16	‘ No ! ’ you say , ‘ We will flee on horseback ! ’ Therefore you will surely flee . And , ‘ We will ride on swift ones ! ’ So your pursuers will be swift .
CJB	Isaiah	30	17	A thousand will flee at the threat of one , you all will flee at the threat of five , until you are left isolated , like a flagstaff on a mountaintop , like a banner on a hill. ”
CJB	Isaiah	30	18	Yet Adonai is just waiting to show you favor , he will have pity on you from on high ; for Adonai is a God of justice ; happy are all who wait for him !
CJB	Isaiah	30	19	People in Tziyon , who live in Yerushalayim , you will weep no more . At the sound of your cry , he will show you his grace ; on hearing it , he will answer you .
CJB	Isaiah	30	20	Though Adonai may give you but bread and water , and not very much of that ; your teacher will no longer hide himself , but with your own eyes you will see your teacher .
CJB	Isaiah	30	21	With your ears you will hear a word from behind you : “ This is the way ; stay on it , whether you go to the right or the left. ”
CJB	Isaiah	30	22	You will treat as unclean your silver-covered idols and your cast metal images plated with gold ; you will throw them away , like menstrual cloths ; you will say to them , “ Get out of here ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	30	23	Then he will give you rain for the seed you use to sow your land ; and the food that comes from the ground will be rich and abundant . When that day comes , your cattle will graze in spacious pastures .
CJB	Isaiah	30	24	The oxen and donkeys that work the land will eat a tasty mixture , winnowed free of chaff , spread by pitchfork and shovel .
CJB	Isaiah	30	25	On every high mountain and lofty hill will be streams and flowing brooks , on a day of great slaughter , when the towers fall .
CJB	Isaiah	30	26	Moreover , the light of the moon will be as bright as the light of the sun ; and the light of the sun will be seven times stronger , like the light of seven days [ in one ] , on the day Adonai binds up the wounds of his people and heals the bruise caused by the blow .
CJB	Isaiah	30	27	Here comes the name of Adonai from afar , his anger burning , in thick rising smoke . His lips are full to the brim with fury , his tongue a consuming fire .
CJB	Isaiah	30	28	His breath is like a racing torrent that rises up to the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction , and put a bridle in the peoples ’ mouths to lead them astray .
CJB	Isaiah	30	29	Your song will be like one that is sung on a night when a holy feast is kept , and your hearts will be happy , as if walking to the sound of the flute , to the mountain of Adonai , to the Rock of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	30	31	For Adonai ’ s voice will terrify Ashur , as with his scepter he strikes them down .
CJB	Isaiah	30	32	Every sweep of the punishing rod that Adonai imposes on him will be to tambourines and lyres , as he brandishes his arm against them in battle .
CJB	Isaiah	30	33	For the Tofet fire pit has long been ready , prepared for the king , made large and deep , with plenty of wood and blazing with fire ; like a stream of sulfur , Adonai ’ s breath sets it aflame .
CJB	Isaiah	31	31	Woe to those going down to Egypt expecting help — relying on horses ; trusting in chariots , because they have many , and in the strength of their cavalrymen — but not looking to the Holy One of Isra ’ el , not consulting Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	31	2	But he too is wise and can bring disaster , and he does not take back his words ; he will rise against the house of evildoers and against the help of those who do wrong .
CJB	Isaiah	31	3	Now the Egyptians are men and not God , and their horses flesh and not spirit . So when Adonai stretches out his hand , both he who helps will stumble , and he who is helped will fall ; both will perish together .
CJB	Isaiah	31	4	For here is what Adonai says to me : “ As a lion or lion cub growls at its prey and isn ’ t frightened away by the shouts of hordes of shepherds called out against him — their voices do not upset him — so likewise Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will descend to fight on Mount Tziyon , on its hill .
CJB	Isaiah	31	5	Like hovering birds , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will protect Yerushalayim . In protecting it , he will rescue it ; in sparing it , he will save it .
CJB	Isaiah	31	6	People of Isra ’ el ! Return to him to whom you have been so deeply disloyal !
CJB	Isaiah	31	7	For on that day everyone will discard his idols of silver and idols of gold , which you made for yourselves with your own sinful hands .
CJB	Isaiah	31	8	Then Ashur will fall by a sword not of mortals , a sword , not of humans , will devour him ; he will flee before the sword , and his young men will be put to forced labor .
CJB	Isaiah	31	9	His rock , out of terror , will pass away , and his panicked officers will desert the standard. ” So says Adonai , whose fire is in Tziyon , whose furnace is in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Isaiah	32	32	There is coming a king who will reign justly and princes who will rule uprightly .
CJB	Isaiah	32	2	A man will be like a refuge from the wind , like protection from a storm , like streams of water on arid ground , like a rock cliff shading a weary land .
CJB	Isaiah	32	3	The eyes of those seeing will not be closed , the ears of those hearing will pay close attention .
CJB	Isaiah	32	4	The minds of the impetuous will learn to weigh carefully , the tongues of the stutterers will speak readily and clearly .
CJB	Isaiah	32	5	The mean person will no longer be called generous , or the miserly said to be noble ;
CJB	Isaiah	32	6	for the mean person will speak meanness , his heart planning evil , so that he can act godlessly , spreading error concerning Adonai , as he lets the hungry go on starving and deprives the thirsty of drink .
CJB	Isaiah	32	7	The mean person ’ s means are mean — he devises wicked devices to ruin the poor and needy with lies , even when their cause is just .
CJB	Isaiah	32	8	But the generous person devises generous things , and his generosity will keep him standing .
CJB	Isaiah	32	9	You women who are so complacent , listen to me ! Overconfident women , pay attention to my words !
CJB	Isaiah	32	10	In a year and a few days more , you overconfident women will shudder , because the vintage will fail , the harvest will not come .
CJB	Isaiah	32	11	Tremble , you complacent women ! Shudder , you overconfident women ! Strip bare , wear sackcloth to cover yourselves .
CJB	Isaiah	32	12	Beat your breasts in mourning for the pleasant fields and fruitful vines ,
CJB	Isaiah	32	13	for the land of my people , producing thorns and briars , for all the happy homes in the joyful city .
CJB	Isaiah	32	14	For the palace will be abandoned , the crowded city deserted , ‘ Ofel and fortress wastelands forever , a delight for wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks —
CJB	Isaiah	32	15	till the Spirit is poured out on us from above , and the desert becomes a fertile field , with the fertile field regarded as a forest .
CJB	Isaiah	32	16	Then justice will dwell in the desert , and righteousness abide in the fertile field .
CJB	Isaiah	32	17	The effect of righteousness will be peace ; the result of righteousness , quiet trust forever .
CJB	Isaiah	32	18	My people will live in a peaceful place , in secure neighborhoods and tranquil dwellings .
CJB	Isaiah	32	19	Just as the forest will surely come down , the city will surely be laid low .
CJB	Isaiah	32	20	Happy are you who sow by all streams , letting oxen and donkeys roam freely .
CJB	Isaiah	33	33	Woe , destroyer , yourself undestroyed ! Woe , betrayer , yourself unbetrayed ! When you stop destroying , you will be destroyed ; when you tire of betraying , they will betray you .
CJB	Isaiah	33	2	Adonai , show us mercy ; we have waited for you . Be their arm every morning , and our salvation in time of trouble .
CJB	Isaiah	33	3	At the sound of the tumult , the peoples wander off ; when you exalt yourself , the nations are scattered .
CJB	Isaiah	33	4	Your spoil is gathered as if stripped by shearer-worms ; they run over it like a swarm of locusts .
CJB	Isaiah	33	5	Adonai is exalted , for he dwells on high ; he has filled Tziyon with justice and right .
CJB	Isaiah	33	6	He will be the stability of your times , a wealth of salvation , wisdom and knowledge , and fear of Adonai , which is his treasure .
CJB	Isaiah	33	7	Hear their brave men crying out for help ! The envoys of peace weep bitterly .
CJB	Isaiah	33	8	The highways are deserted , there are no travelers . He has broken the covenant , despised the cities ; he has no regard for human life .
CJB	Isaiah	33	9	The land is mourning and wilting away . The L ’ vanon is withering with shame . The Sharon has become like the ‘ Aravah . Bashan and Karmel have been shaken bare .
CJB	Isaiah	33	10	“ Now I will arise , ” says Adonai , “ Now I will exalt and lift myself up .
CJB	Isaiah	33	11	You conceive chaff and give birth to stubble , your breath is a fire devouring you .
CJB	Isaiah	33	12	The peoples will be as if burned into lime , like thorns cut off to burn in the fire .
CJB	Isaiah	33	13	You living far off , hear what I have done ! You who are near , acknowledge my strength ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	33	14	The sinners in Tziyon are frightened ; trembling has seized the ungodly . “ Who of us can live with the devouring fire ? Who of us can live with eternal burning ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	33	15	He whose life is right and whose speech is straight , he who scorns getting rich by extortion , he who shakes his hands free of bribes , stops his ears against talk of bloodshed and shuts his eyes against looking at evil .
CJB	Isaiah	33	16	Such a person will live on the heights , his refuge a fortress among the cliffs , his food and water in steady supply .
CJB	Isaiah	33	17	Your eyes will see the king in his beauty , they will gaze on a land stretching into the distance .
CJB	Isaiah	33	18	Your mind will meditate on the terror : “ Where is the man who did the counting ? Where is the man who did the weighing ? Where is the man who numbered the towers ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	33	19	You will not see the intransigent people , that people whose language is so obscure , whose stuttering speech you can not understand .
CJB	Isaiah	33	20	Look at Tziyon , the city of our festivals ; your eyes will see Yerushalayim a secure abode , a tent that will not be removed , whose pegs will never be pulled out and whose guy-ropes will not be cut .
CJB	Isaiah	33	21	But there in his splendor Adonai will be with us , in a place of rivers and broad streams . But no boat with oars will go there , no majestic ship will pass by .
CJB	Isaiah	33	22	For Adonai is our judge , Adonai is our lawgiver , Adonai is our king . He will save us .
CJB	Isaiah	33	23	For your ropes are hanging loose , not holding the mast , not spreading the sail . Then the plunder shared out is so huge that even the lame get part of the spoil .
CJB	Isaiah	33	24	No inhabitant will say , “ I am ill ” ; the people living there will be forgiven their sin .
CJB	Isaiah	34	34	Come close , you nations , and listen ! Pay close attention , you peoples ! Let the earth hear , and everything in it ; the world , with all it produces .
CJB	Isaiah	34	2	For Adonai is angry at every nation , furious with all their armies ; he has completely destroyed them , handed them over to slaughter .
CJB	Isaiah	34	3	Their slain will be thrown out , the stench will rise from their corpses , the mountains will flow with their blood .
CJB	Isaiah	34	4	The whole host of heaven will decompose , the heavens themselves be rolled up like a scroll ; all their array will wither away like a withering grape-leaf that falls from a vine or a withered fig from a fig tree .
CJB	Isaiah	34	5	“ For my sword has drunk its fill in heaven ; now it descends on Edom to judge them , the people I have doomed to destruction. ”
CJB	Isaiah	34	6	There is a sword that belongs to Adonai . It is filled with blood , gorged with fat , filled with the blood of lambs and goats , gorged with the fat of the kidneys of rams . For Adonai has a sacrifice in Botzrah , a great slaughter in the land of Edom .
CJB	Isaiah	34	7	The wild oxen will fall with them , the young bulls with the strong , mature ones . Their land will be drunk with blood and their dust made greasy with fat .
CJB	Isaiah	34	8	For Adonai has a day of vengeance , a year of requital for fighting with Tziyon .
CJB	Isaiah	34	9	Its streams will be changed to tar , its dust to sulfur , its land burning tar
CJB	Isaiah	34	10	that will not be quenched night or day ; its smoke will rise forever . In all generations it will lie waste ; no one will pass through it ever again .
CJB	Isaiah	34	11	Horned owl and hawk will possess it , screech owl and raven will live there ; he will stretch over it the measuring line of confusion and the plumbline of the empty void .
CJB	Isaiah	34	12	Of its nobles , none will be called to be king , and all its princes will be nothing .
CJB	Isaiah	34	13	Thorns will overgrow its palaces , nettles and thistles its fortresses ; it will become a lair for jackals , an enclosure for ostriches .
CJB	Isaiah	34	14	Wildcats and hyenas will meet there ; and billy-goats call to each other ; Lilit [ the night monster ] will lurk there and find herself a place to rest .
CJB	Isaiah	34	15	There the hoot owl will nest , lay her eggs , hatch and gather her young in its shade . There the vultures will assemble , every one with its mate .
CJB	Isaiah	34	16	Consult the book of Adonai and read it : not one of these will be missing , none will be lacking a mate . For by his own mouth he gave the order , and by his Spirit he brought them together .
CJB	Isaiah	34	17	It is he who cast the lot for them , his hand measured out their shares . They will possess it forever , and live there through all generations .
CJB	Isaiah	35	35	The desert and the dry land will be glad ; the ‘ Aravah will rejoice and blossom like the lily .
CJB	Isaiah	35	2	It will burst into flower , will rejoice with joy and singing , will be given the glory of the L ’ vanon , the splendor of Karmel and the Sharon . They will see the glory of Adonai , the splendor of our God .
CJB	Isaiah	35	3	Strengthen your drooping arms , and steady your tottering knees .
CJB	Isaiah	35	4	Say to the fainthearted , “ Be strong and unafraid ! Here is your God ; he will come with vengeance ; with God ’ s retribution he will come and save you. ”
CJB	Isaiah	35	5	Then the eyes of the blind will be opened , and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped ;
CJB	Isaiah	35	6	then the lame man will leap like a deer , and the mute person ’ s tongue will sing . For in the desert , springs will burst forth , streams of water in the ‘ Aravah ;
CJB	Isaiah	35	7	the sandy mirage will become a pool , the thirsty ground springs of water . The haunts where jackals lie down will become a marsh filled with reeds and papyrus .
CJB	Isaiah	35	8	A highway will be there , a way , called the Way of Holiness . The unclean will not pass over it , but it will be for those whom he guides — fools will not stray along it .
CJB	Isaiah	35	9	No lion or other beast of prey will be there , traveling on it . They will not be found there , but the redeemed will go there .
CJB	Isaiah	35	10	Those ransomed by Adonai will return and come with singing to Tziyon , on their heads will be everlasting joy . They will acquire gladness and joy , while sorrow and sighing will flee .
CJB	Isaiah	36	36	It was in the fourteenth year of King Hizkiyahu that Sancheriv king of Ashur advanced against all the fortified cities of Y ’ hudah and captured them .
CJB	Isaiah	36	2	From Lakhish the king of Ashur sent Rav-Shakeh to Hizkiyahu in Yerushalayim with a large army . He positioned himself by the aqueduct from the Upper Pool , which is by the road to the Launderers ’ Field .
CJB	Isaiah	36	3	Elyakim the son of Hilkiyahu , who was in charge of the household , Shevnah the general secretary and Yo ’ ach the son of Asaf the foreign minister went out to meet him .
CJB	Isaiah	36	4	Rav-Shakeh addressed them : “ Tell Hizkiyahu : ‘ Here is what the great king , the king of Ashur , says : “ What makes you so confident ?
CJB	Isaiah	36	5	I say : do mere words constitute strategy and strength for battle ? In whom , then , are you trusting when you rebel against me like this ?
CJB	Isaiah	36	6	Look ! Relying on Egypt is like using a broken stick as a staff — when you lean on it , it punctures your hand . That ’ s what Pharaoh king of Egypt is like for anyone who puts his trust in him .
CJB	Isaiah	36	7	But if you tell me , ‘ We trust in Adonai our God , ’ then isn ’ t he the one whose high places and altars Hizkiyahu has removed , telling Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim , ‘ You must worship before this altar ’ ?
CJB	Isaiah	36	8	All right , then , make a wager with my lord the king of Ashur : I will give you two thousand horses if you can find enough riders for them .
CJB	Isaiah	36	9	How then can you repulse even one of my master ’ s lowest-ranked army officers ? Yet you are relying on Egypt for chariots and riders !
CJB	Isaiah	36	10	Do you think I have come up to this land to destroy it without Adonai ’ s approval ? Adonai said to me , ‘ Go up against this land and destroy it ! ’ ” ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	36	11	Elyakim , Shevnah and Yo ’ ach said to Rav-Shakeh , “ Please speak to your servants in Aramaic , since we understand it ; don ’ t speak to us in Hebrew while the people on the wall are listening. ”
CJB	Isaiah	36	12	But Rav-Shakeh answered , “ Did my master send me to deliver my message just to your master and yourselves ? Didn ’ t he send me to address the men sitting on the wall , who , like you , are going to eat their own dung and drink their own urine ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	36	13	Then Rav-Shakeh stood up and , speaking loudly in Hebrew , said : “ Hear what the great king , the king of Ashur , says !
CJB	Isaiah	36	14	This is what the king says : ‘ Don ’ t let Hizkiyahu deceive you , because he won ’ t be able to save you .
CJB	Isaiah	36	15	And don ’ t let Hizkiyahu make you trust in Adonai by saying , “ Adonai will surely save us ; this city will not be given over to the king of Ashur. ”
CJB	Isaiah	36	16	Don ’ t listen to Hizkiyahu. ’ For this is what the king says : ‘ Make peace with me , surrender to me . Then every one of you can eat from his vine and fig tree and drink the water in his own cistern ,
CJB	Isaiah	36	17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land with grain and wine , a land with bread and vineyards .
CJB	Isaiah	36	18	Beware of Hizkiyahu ; he is only deluding you when he says , “ Adonai will save us. ” Has any god of any nation ever saved his land from the power of the king of Ashur ?
CJB	Isaiah	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamat and Arpad ? Where are the gods of S ’ farvayim ? Did they save Shomron from my power ?
CJB	Isaiah	36	20	Where is the god of any of these countries that has saved its country from my power , so that Adonai might be able to save Yerushalayim from my power ? ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	36	21	But they kept still and didn ’ t answer him so much as a word , for the king ’ s order was , “ Don ’ t answer him. ”
CJB	Isaiah	36	22	Then Elyakim the son of Hilkiyahu , who was in charge of the household , Shevnah the general secretary and Yo ’ ach the son of Asaf the foreign minister went to Hizkiyahu with their clothes torn and reported to him what Rav-Shakeh had said .
CJB	Isaiah	37	37	So Sancheriv king of Ashur left , went and returned to live in Ninveh .
CJB	Isaiah	37	2	He sent Elyakim , who was in charge of the household , Shevnah the general secretary and the leading cohanim , covered with sackcloth , to Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet , the son of Amotz .
CJB	Isaiah	37	3	They said to him , “ This is what Hizkiyahu says : ‘ Today is a day of trouble , rebuke and disgrace . Children are ready to be born , but there is no strength to bring them to birth .
CJB	Isaiah	37	4	Maybe Adonai your God will hear the words of Rav-Shakeh , whom his master the king of Ashur has sent to taunt the living God , and will rebuke the message which Adonai your God has heard . So pray for the remnant that is left. ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	37	5	When King Hizkiyahu ’ s servants came to Yesha ‘ yahu ,
CJB	Isaiah	37	6	he said to them , “ Tell your master that this is what Adonai says : ‘ Don ’ t be afraid of the words you heard the servants of the king of Ashur use to insult me .
CJB	Isaiah	37	7	I will put a spirit in him that will make him hear a rumor and return to his own land ; then I will cause him to die by the sword in his own land. ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	37	8	Rav-Shakeh returned and , having heard that the king of Ashur had left Lakhish , found him making war with Livnah .
CJB	Isaiah	37	9	Then he heard it said that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia was on his way to fight him . On hearing this , the king of Ashur sent messengers to Hizkiyahu , after ordering them ,
CJB	Isaiah	37	10	“ This is what you are to say to Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah : ‘ Don ’ t let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying , “ Yerushalayim will not be handed over to the power of the king of Ashur. ”
CJB	Isaiah	37	11	You have heard what the kings of Ashur have done to all lands — they have completely destroyed them . So how will you be delivered ?
CJB	Isaiah	37	12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them ? No , my ancestors destroyed them — Gozan , Haran , Retzef and the people of ‘ Eden who were in Tel ’ asar .
CJB	Isaiah	37	13	Where is the king of Hamat ? the king of Arpad ? the king of the city of S ’ farvayim , of Hena and ‘ Ivah ? ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	37	14	Hizkiyahu took the letter from the messengers ’ hands and read it . Then Hizkiyahu went up to the house of Adonai and spread it out before Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	37	15	This is the prayer that Hizkiyahu prayed to Adonai :
CJB	Isaiah	37	16	“ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , God of Isra ’ el , who dwells above the k ’ ruvim ! You alone are God of all the kingdoms on earth . You made heaven and earth .
CJB	Isaiah	37	17	Turn your ear , Adonai , and hear ! Open your eyes , Adonai , and see ! Hear all the words that Sancheriv sent to taunt the living God .
CJB	Isaiah	37	18	It is true that the kings of Ashur have laid waste all the countries and their lands
CJB	Isaiah	37	19	and have thrown their gods into the fire . For those were non-gods , merely the products of people ’ s hands , wood and stone ; this is why they could destroy them .
CJB	Isaiah	37	20	Now therefore , Adonai our God , save us from his power — so that all the kingdoms on earth will know that you are Adonai — you only. ”
CJB	Isaiah	37	21	Then Yesha ‘ yahu the son of Amotz sent this message to Hizkiyahu : “ Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ You prayed to me against Sancheriv king of Ashur. ’
CJB	Isaiah	37	22	Here is Adonai ’ s answer concerning him : “ ‘ The virgin daughter of Tziyon despises you ; she laughs you to scorn . The daughter of Yerushalayim shakes her head at you .
CJB	Isaiah	37	23	Whom have you taunted and insulted ? Against whom have you raised your voice and haughtily lifted your eyes ? The Holy One of Isra ’ el !
CJB	Isaiah	37	24	“ ‘ Through your servants you taunted Adonai . You said , “ With my many chariots I have ascended the mountain heights even in the far reaches of the L ’ vanon . I cut down its tall cedars and its best cypress trees . I reached its remotest heights and its best forests .
CJB	Isaiah	37	25	I dug [ wells ] and drank the water . The soles of my [ soldiers ’ ] feet dried up all the rivers of Egypt. ”
CJB	Isaiah	37	26	“ ‘ Haven ’ t you heard ? Long ago I made it ; in antiquity I produced it ; and now I am making it happen : you are turning fortified cities into heaps of ruins ,
CJB	Isaiah	37	27	while their inhabitants , shorn of power , are disheartened and ashamed , weak as grass , frail as plants , like grass on the rooftops or grain scorched by the east wind .
CJB	Isaiah	37	28	“ ‘ But I know when you sit , when you leave , when you enter — and when you rage against me .
CJB	Isaiah	37	29	And because of your rage against me , because of your pride that has reached my ears , I am putting my hook in your nose and my bridle on your lips ; and I will make you return by the way on which you came .
CJB	Isaiah	37	30	“ ‘ This will be the sign for you [ people of Isra ’ el ] : this year , you will eat the grain that grows of itself ; the second year , you will eat what grows from that ; but in the third year , you will sow , reap , plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
CJB	Isaiah	37	31	“ ‘ Meanwhile , the remnant of the house of Y ’ hudah that has escaped will again take root downward and bear fruit upward ;
CJB	Isaiah	37	32	for a remnant will go out from Yerushalayim , those escaping will go out from Mount Tziyon . The zeal of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will accomplish this. ’
CJB	Isaiah	37	33	“ Therefore this is what Adonai says concerning the king of Ashur : “ ‘ He will not come to this city or even shoot an arrow there ; he will not confront it with a shield or erect earthworks against it .
CJB	Isaiah	37	34	“ ‘ By the way he came he will return ; he will not come to this city , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	37	35	‘ For I will defend this city and save it , both for my own sake and for my servant David ’ s sake. ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	37	36	Then the angel of Adonai went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of Ashur . Early the next morning , there they were , all of them , corpses — dead .
CJB	Isaiah	37	38	One day , as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisrokh his god , his sons Adramelekh and Shar ’ etzer struck him with the sword and escaped into the land of Ararat . So his son Esar-Hadon took his place as king .
CJB	Isaiah	38	38	Around this time Hizkiyahu became ill to the point of death . Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet , the son of Amotz , came and said to him , “ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ Put your house in order , because you are going to die ; you will not live. ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	38	2	Hizkiyahu turned his face toward the wall and prayed to Adonai :
CJB	Isaiah	38	3	“ I plead with you , Adonai , remember now how I have lived before you truly and wholeheartedly , and how I have done what you see as good. ” And he cried bitter tears .
CJB	Isaiah	38	4	Then the word of Adonai came to Yesha ‘ yahu :
CJB	Isaiah	38	5	“ Go and tell Hizkiyahu that this is what Adonai , the God of David your ancestor , says : ‘ I have heard your prayer and seen your tears ; therefore I will add fifteen years to your life .
CJB	Isaiah	38	6	Also I will rescue you and this city from the power of the king of Ashur ; I will defend this city .
CJB	Isaiah	38	7	The sign for you from Adonai that Adonai will do what he said is
CJB	Isaiah	38	8	that I will cause the shadow of the sundial , which has started going down on the sundial of Achaz , to go backward ten intervals. ’ ” So the sun went back ten intervals of the distance it had already gone down .
CJB	Isaiah	38	9	After Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah had been ill and had recovered , he wrote the following :
CJB	Isaiah	38	10	“ I once said : ‘ In the prime of life I am going off to the gates of Sh ’ ol . I am being deprived of living out the full span of my life. ’
CJB	Isaiah	38	11	“ I said , ‘ I will never again see Yah , Yah in the land of the living ; I will look on human beings no more or be with those who live in this world .
CJB	Isaiah	38	12	My home is uprooted and taken away from me like a shepherd ’ s tent . Like a weaver , I have rolled up my life ; he cuts me off from the loom . Between day and night you could finish me off .
CJB	Isaiah	38	13	I try to be strong like a lion till morning , but still my illness breaks all my bones — between day and night you could finish me off .
CJB	Isaiah	38	14	I make little chattering sounds like a swallow , I moan aloud like a dove , My eyes are weary with looking upward . Adonai , I am overwhelmed ; guarantee my life ! ’
CJB	Isaiah	38	15	“ What is there that I can say ? He has spoken to me and acted ! I will go humbly all my years , remembering how bitter I was .
CJB	Isaiah	38	16	Adonai , by these things people live ; in all these is the life of my spirit . You ’ re restoring my health and giving me life —
CJB	Isaiah	38	17	though instead of peace , I felt very bitter . You desired my life and preserved it from the nothingness pit ; for you threw all my sins behind your back .
CJB	Isaiah	38	18	“ Sh ’ ol can not thank you , death can not praise you ; those descending to the pit can not hope for your truth .
CJB	Isaiah	38	19	The living , the living — they can thank you , as I do today ; fathers will make their children know about your faithfulness .
CJB	Isaiah	38	20	Adonai is ready to save me ; hence we will make our stringed instruments sound all the days of our life in the house of Adonai. ”
CJB	Isaiah	38	21	Then Yesha ‘ yahu said , “ Have them take a fig-plaster and apply it to the inflammation , and he will recover. ”
CJB	Isaiah	38	22	Hizkiyahu asked , “ What sign will there be that I will be able to go up to the house of Adonai ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	39	39	M ’ rodakh-Bal ’ adan the son of Bal ’ adan , king of Bavel , heard that Hizkiyahu had been ill and had recovered , so he sent a letter and a gift to him .
CJB	Isaiah	39	2	Hizkiyahu was pleased with the gifts and showed the messengers all of the building where he kept his treasures , including the silver , gold , spices and precious oils ; also all of the building where he kept his armor ; and everything in his treasury — there was nothing in his palace or in his entire domain that Hizkiyahu did not show them .
CJB	Isaiah	39	3	Then Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet came to King Hizkiyahu and asked him , “ What did these men say ? Where did they come from ? ” Hizkiyahu answered , “ They came to me from a distant country , Bavel. ”
CJB	Isaiah	39	4	Yesha ‘ yahu asked , “ What have they seen in your palace ? ” “ They have seen everything in my palace , ” said Hizkiyahu . “ There isn ’ t a thing among my treasures that I haven ’ t shown them. ”
CJB	Isaiah	39	5	Yesha ‘ yahu said to Hizkiyahu , “ Hear what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says :
CJB	Isaiah	39	6	‘ The day will come when everything in your palace , along with everything your ancestors stored up until today , will be carried off to Bavel . Nothing will be left , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	39	7	‘ They will carry off some of your descendants , your own offspring ; and they will be made eunuchs serving in the palace of the king of Bavel. ”
CJB	Isaiah	39	8	Hizkiyahu said to Yesha ‘ yahu , “ The word of Adonai which you have just told me is good ” ; because he thought , “ At least peace and truth will continue during my lifetime . ”
CJB	Isaiah	40	40	“ Comfort and keep comforting my people , ” says your God .
CJB	Isaiah	40	2	“ Tell Yerushalayim to take heart ; proclaim to her that she has completed her time of service , that her guilt has been paid off , that she has received at the hand of Adonai double for all her sins. ”
CJB	Isaiah	40	3	A voice cries out : “ Clear a road through the desert for Adonai ! Level a highway in the ‘ Aravah for our God !
CJB	Isaiah	40	4	Let every valley be filled in , every mountain and hill lowered , the bumpy places made level and the crags become a plain .
CJB	Isaiah	40	5	Then the glory of Adonai will be revealed ; all humankind together will see it , for the mouth of Adonai has spoken. ”
CJB	Isaiah	40	6	A voice says , “ Proclaim ! ” And I answer , “ What should I proclaim ? ” “ All humanity is merely grass , all its kindness like wildflowers :
CJB	Isaiah	40	7	the grass dries up , the flower fades , when a wind from Adonai blows on it . Surely the people are grass !
CJB	Isaiah	40	8	The grass dries up , the flower fades ; but the word of our God will stand forever. ”
CJB	Isaiah	40	9	You who bring good news to Tziyon , get yourself up on a high mountain ; you who bring good news to Yerushalayim , cry out at the top of your voice ! Don ’ t be afraid to shout out loud ! Say to the cities of Y ’ hudah , “ Here is your God !
CJB	Isaiah	40	10	Here comes Adonai Elohim with power , and his arm will rule for him . Look ! His reward is with him , and his recompense is before him .
CJB	Isaiah	40	11	He is like a shepherd feeding his flock , gathering his lambs with his arm , carrying them against his chest , gently leading the mother sheep. ”
CJB	Isaiah	40	12	Who has counted the handfuls of water in the sea , measured off the sky with a ruler , gauged how much dust there is on the earth , weighed the mountains on scales , or the hills in a balance ?
CJB	Isaiah	40	13	Who has measured the Spirit of Adonai ? Who has been his counselor , instructing him ?
CJB	Isaiah	40	14	Whom did he consult , to gain understanding ? Who taught him how to judge , taught him what he needed to know , showed him how to discern ?
CJB	Isaiah	40	15	The nations are like a drop in a bucket , they count like a grain of dust on the scales . The islands weigh as little as specks of dust .
CJB	Isaiah	40	16	The L ’ vanon would not suffice for fuel or its animals be enough for burnt offerings .
CJB	Isaiah	40	17	Before him all the nations are like nothing . He regards them as less than nothing .
CJB	Isaiah	40	18	With whom , then , will you compare God ? By what standard will you evaluate him ?
CJB	Isaiah	40	19	An image made by a craftsman , which a goldsmith overlays with gold , for which he then casts silver chains ?
CJB	Isaiah	40	20	A man too poor to afford an offering chooses a piece of wood that won ’ t rot , then seeks out a skilled artisan to prepare an image that won ’ t fall over .
CJB	Isaiah	40	21	Don ’ t you know ? Don ’ t you hear ? Haven ’ t you been told from the start ? Don ’ t you understand how the earth is set up ?
CJB	Isaiah	40	22	He who sits above the circle of the earth — for whom its inhabitants appear like grasshoppers — stretches out the heavens like a curtain , spreads them out like a tent to live in .
CJB	Isaiah	40	23	He reduces princes to nothing , the rulers of the earth to emptiness .
CJB	Isaiah	40	24	Scarcely are they planted , scarcely sown , scarcely their stem taken root in the ground , when he blows on them , they dry up , and the whirlwind carries them off like straw .
CJB	Isaiah	40	25	“ With whom , then , will you compare me ? With whom am I equal ? ” asks the Holy One .
CJB	Isaiah	40	26	Turn your eyes to the heavens ! See who created these ? He brings out the army of them in sequence , summoning each by name . Through his great might and his massive strength , not one of them is missing .
CJB	Isaiah	40	27	Why do you complain , Ya ‘ akov ; why do you say , Isra ’ el , “ My way is hidden from Adonai , my rights are ignored by my God ” ?
CJB	Isaiah	40	28	Haven ’ t you known , haven ’ t you heard that the everlasting God , Adonai , the Creator of the ends of the earth , does not grow tired or weary ? His understanding can not be fathomed .
CJB	Isaiah	40	29	He invigorates the exhausted , he gives strength to the powerless .
CJB	Isaiah	40	30	Young men may grow tired and weary , even the fittest may stumble and fall ;
CJB	Isaiah	40	31	but those who hope in Adonai will renew their strength , they will soar aloft as with eagles ’ wings ; when they are running they won ’ t grow weary , when they are walking they won ’ t get tired .
CJB	Isaiah	41	41	“ Keep silence before me , coastlands ! Let the peoples replenish their strength ! Let them approach ; then let them speak . Let us assemble for judgment. ”
CJB	Isaiah	41	2	Who has raised from the east one who is just and called him to be in his service ? He hands nations over to him and subjects kings to him ; his sword reduces them to dust , his bow to driven straw .
CJB	Isaiah	41	3	He pursues them , passing on unscathed , hardly touching the path with his feet .
CJB	Isaiah	41	4	Whose work is this ? Who has brought it about ? He who called the generations from the beginning , “ I , Adonai , am the first ; and I am the same with those who are last. ”
CJB	Isaiah	41	5	The coastlands have seen and became afraid . The ends of the earth have trembled . They have approached , and now they have come .
CJB	Isaiah	41	6	Every one helps his fellow workman , everyone says to his brother , “ Be strong ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	41	7	The woodworker encourages the goldsmith , the polisher encourages the hammerer ; he says of the soldering , “ Yes , that ’ s good , ” then puts nails in [ the idol ] to keep it from moving .
CJB	Isaiah	41	8	“ But you , Isra ’ el , my servant ; Ya ‘ akov , whom I have chosen , descendants of Avraham my friend ,
CJB	Isaiah	41	9	I have taken you from the ends of the earth , summoned you from its most distant parts and said to you , ‘ You are my servant ’ — I have chosen you , not rejected you .
CJB	Isaiah	41	10	Don ’ t be afraid , for I am with you ; don ’ t be distressed , for I am your God . I give you strength , I give you help , I support you with my victorious right hand .
CJB	Isaiah	41	11	All those who were angry with you will be disgraced , put to shame ; those who fought against you will be destroyed , brought to nothing .
CJB	Isaiah	41	12	You will seek them but not find them , those who contended with you ; yes , those who made war with you will be brought to nothing , nothing at all .
CJB	Isaiah	41	13	For I , Adonai , your God , say to you , as I hold your right hand , ‘ Have no fear ; I will help you .
CJB	Isaiah	41	14	Have no fear , Ya ‘ akov , you worm , you men of Isra ’ el ! ’ I will help you , ” says Adonai ; “ Your redeemer is the Holy One of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	41	15	“ I will make you into a threshing-sledge , new , with sharp , pointed teeth , to thresh the mountains and crush them to dust , to reduce the hills to chaff .
CJB	Isaiah	41	16	As you fan them , the wind will carry them off , and the whirlwind will scatter them . Then you will rejoice in Adonai , you will glory in the Holy One of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	41	17	“ The poor and needy look for water in vain ; their tongues are parched with thirst . I , Adonai , will answer them . I , the God of Isra ’ el , will not leave them .
CJB	Isaiah	41	18	I will open up rivers on the barren hills and wells down in the broad valleys . I will turn the desert into a lake and dry ground into springs .
CJB	Isaiah	41	19	I will plant the desert with cedars , acacias , myrtles and olive trees ; In the ‘ Aravah I will put cypresses together with elm trees and larches. ”
CJB	Isaiah	41	20	Then the people will see and know , together observe and understand that the hand of Adonai has done this , that the Holy One of Isra ’ el created it .
CJB	Isaiah	41	21	“ Present your case , ” says Adonai , “ Produce your arguments , ” says Ya ‘ akov ’ s king .
CJB	Isaiah	41	22	Bring out those idols ! Have them foretell the future for us , tell us about past events , so that we can reflect on them and understand their consequences . Or tell us about events yet to come ,
CJB	Isaiah	41	23	state what will happen in the future , so that we can know you are gods . At least , do something , either good or bad — anything , to make us awestruck and fearful !
CJB	Isaiah	41	24	You can ’ t ! — because you are less than nothing . Whoever chooses you is an abomination !
CJB	Isaiah	41	25	“ I roused someone from the north , and he has come from the rising sun ; he will call on my name . He will trample on rulers as if they were mud , like a potter treading clay. ”
CJB	Isaiah	41	26	Who said this at the start , so we could know , or foretold it , so we could say , “ He ’ s right ” ? In fact , no one said it ; no one foretold it — the fact is , nobody hears what you say .
CJB	Isaiah	41	27	I am the first to declare it to Tziyon , to send Yerushalayim a messenger with good news .
CJB	Isaiah	41	28	But when I look around , there is no one — not a single one can give counsel , who , when I ask , can give an answer .
CJB	Isaiah	41	29	Look at them all ! What they do is nothing ! Their idols are so much wind and waste .
CJB	Isaiah	42	42	“ Here is my servant , whom I support , my chosen one , in whom I take pleasure . I have put my Spirit on him ; he will bring justice to the Goyim .
CJB	Isaiah	42	2	He will not cry or shout ; no one will hear his voice in the streets .
CJB	Isaiah	42	3	He will not snap off a broken reed or snuff out a smoldering wick . He will bring forth justice according to truth ;
CJB	Isaiah	42	4	he will not weaken or be crushed until he has established justice on the earth , and the coastlands wait for his Torah. ”
CJB	Isaiah	42	5	Thus says God , Adonai , who created the heavens and spread them out , who stretched out the earth and all that grows from it , who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk on it :
CJB	Isaiah	42	6	“ I , Adonai , called you righteously , I took hold of you by the hand , I shaped you and made you a covenant for the people , to be a light for the Goyim ,
CJB	Isaiah	42	7	so that you can open blind eyes , free the prisoners from confinement , those living in darkness from the dungeon .
CJB	Isaiah	42	8	I am Adonai ; that is my name . I yield my glory to no one else , nor my praise to any idol .
CJB	Isaiah	42	9	See how the former predictions come true ; and now new things do I declare — before they sprout I tell you about them. ”
CJB	Isaiah	42	10	Sing to Adonai a new song ! Let his praise be sung from the ends of the earth by those sailing the sea and by everything in it , by the coastlands and those living there .
CJB	Isaiah	42	11	Let the desert and its cities raise their voices , the villages where Kedar lives ; let those living in Sela shout for joy ; let them cry out from the mountaintops !
CJB	Isaiah	42	12	Let them give glory to Adonai and proclaim his praise in the coastlands .
CJB	Isaiah	42	13	Adonai will go out like a soldier , like a soldier roused to the fury of battle ; he will shout , yes , he raises the battle cry ; as he triumphs over his foes .
CJB	Isaiah	42	14	“ For a long time I have held my peace , I have been silent , restrained myself . Now I will shriek like a woman in labor , panting and gasping for air .
CJB	Isaiah	42	15	I will devastate mountains and hills , wither all their vegetation , turn the rivers into islands and dry up the lakes .
CJB	Isaiah	42	16	The blind I will lead on a road they don ’ t know , on roads they don ’ t know I will lead them ; I will turn darkness to light before them , and straighten their twisted paths . These are things I will do without fail .
CJB	Isaiah	42	17	Those who trust in idols , who say to statues , ‘ You are our gods , ’ will be repulsed in utter shame .
CJB	Isaiah	42	18	Listen , you deaf ! Look , you blind ! — so that you will see !
CJB	Isaiah	42	19	Who is as blind as my servant , or as deaf as the messenger I send ? Who is as blind as the one I rewarded , as blind as the servant of Adonai ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	42	20	You see much but don ’ t pay attention ; you open your ears , but you don ’ t listen .
CJB	Isaiah	42	21	Adonai was pleased , for his righteousness ’ sake , to make the Torah great and glorious .
CJB	Isaiah	42	22	But this is a people pillaged and plundered , all trapped in holes and sequestered in prisons . They are there to be plundered , with no one to rescue them ; there to be pillaged , and no one says , “ Return them ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	42	23	Which of you will listen to this ? Who will hear and give heed in the times to come ?
CJB	Isaiah	42	24	Who gave Ya ‘ akov to be pillaged , Isra ’ el to the plunderers ? Didn ’ t Adonai , against whom we have sinned , in whose ways they refused to walk , he whose Torah they did not obey ?
CJB	Isaiah	42	25	This is why he poured on him his blazing anger as well as the fury of battle — it wrapped him in flames , yet he learned nothing ; it burned him , yet he did not take it to heart .
CJB	Isaiah	43	43	But now this is what Adonai says , he who created you , Ya ‘ akov , he who formed you , Isra ’ el : “ Don ’ t be afraid , for I have redeemed you ; I am calling you by your name ; you are mine .
CJB	Isaiah	43	2	When you pass through water , I will be with you ; when you pass through rivers , they will not overwhelm you ; when you walk through fire , you will not be scorched — the flame will not burn you .
CJB	Isaiah	43	3	For I am Adonai , your God , the Holy One of Isra ’ el , your Savior — I have given Egypt as your ransom , Ethiopia and S ’ va for you .
CJB	Isaiah	43	4	Because I regard you as valued and honored , and because I love you . For you I will give people , nations in exchange for your life .
CJB	Isaiah	43	5	Don ’ t be afraid , for I am with you . I will bring your descendants from the east , and I will gather you from the west ;
CJB	Isaiah	43	6	I will say to the north , ‘ Give them up ! ’ and to the south , ‘ Don ’ t hold them back ! Bring my sons from far away , and my daughters from the ends of the earth ,
CJB	Isaiah	43	7	everyone who bears my name , whom I created for my glory — I formed him , yes , I made him. ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	43	8	Bring forward the people who are blind but have eyes , also the deaf who have ears .
CJB	Isaiah	43	9	All the nations are gathered together , and the peoples are assembled . Who among them can proclaim this and reveal what happened in the past ? Let them bring their witnesses to justify themselves , so that others , on hearing , can say , “ That ’ s true. ”
CJB	Isaiah	43	10	“ You are my witnesses , ” says Adonai , “ and my servant whom I have chosen , so that you can know and trust me and understand that I am he — no god was produced before me , nor will any be after me .
CJB	Isaiah	43	11	I , yes I , am Adonai ; besides me there is no deliverer .
CJB	Isaiah	43	12	I have declared , saved and proclaimed — not some alien god among you . Therefore you are my witnesses , ” says Adonai . “ I am God .
CJB	Isaiah	43	13	Since days began , I have been he . No one can deliver from my hand . When I act , who can reverse it ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	43	14	Here is what Adonai , your redeemer , the Holy One of Isra ’ el , says : “ For your sake I have sent [ an army ] to Bavel and knocked down the fleeing Kasdim , all of them ; their songs of triumph are now lamentations .
CJB	Isaiah	43	15	I am Adonai , your Holy One , the Creator of Isra ’ el , your King. ”
CJB	Isaiah	43	16	Here is what Adonai says , who made a way in the sea , a path through the raging waves ;
CJB	Isaiah	43	17	who led out chariot and horse , the army in its strength — they lay down , never to rise again , snuffed out and quenched like a wick :
CJB	Isaiah	43	18	“ Stop dwelling on past events and brooding over times gone by ;
CJB	Isaiah	43	19	I am doing something new ; it ’ s springing up — can ’ t you see it ? I am making a road in the desert , rivers in the wasteland .
CJB	Isaiah	43	20	The wild animals will honor me , the jackals and the ostriches ; because I put water in the desert , rivers in the wasteland , for my chosen people to drink ,
CJB	Isaiah	43	21	the people I formed for myself , so that they would proclaim my praise .
CJB	Isaiah	43	22	But you haven ’ t called on me , Ya ‘ akov ; because you have grown weary of me , Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	43	23	You have not brought me sheep for your burnt offerings , you have not honored me with your sacrifices . I didn ’ t burden you by requiring grain offerings . or weary you by demanding frankincense .
CJB	Isaiah	43	24	You have not spent money to buy me sweet cane or filled me with the fat of your sacrifices . Instead , you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your crimes .
CJB	Isaiah	43	25	I , yes I , am the one who blots out your offenses for my own sake ; I will not remember your sins .
CJB	Isaiah	43	26	Remind me when we ’ re in court together — tell your side , make the case that you are right .
CJB	Isaiah	43	27	Your first father sinned , and your spokesmen rebelled against me .
CJB	Isaiah	43	28	Therefore I repudiated the officials of the sanctuary , delivered Ya ‘ akov to the curse of destruction , and subjected Isra ’ el to scorn .
CJB	Isaiah	44	44	“ Now listen , Ya ‘ akov my servant , Isra ’ el whom I have chosen :
CJB	Isaiah	44	2	Thus says Adonai , who made you , formed you in the womb , and will help you : Don ’ t be afraid , Ya ‘ akov my servant , Yeshurun , whom I have chosen .
CJB	Isaiah	44	3	For I will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground ; I will pour my Spirit on your descendants , my blessing on your offspring .
CJB	Isaiah	44	4	They will spring up among the grass like willows on the riverbanks .
CJB	Isaiah	44	5	One will say , ‘ I belong to Adonai. ’ Another will be called by the name of Ya ‘ akov . Yet another will write that he belongs to Adonai . and adopt the surname Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Isaiah	44	6	Thus says Adonai , Isra ’ el ’ s King and Redeemer , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot : “ I am the first , and I am the last ; besides me there is no God .
CJB	Isaiah	44	7	Who is like me ? Let him speak out ! Let him show me clearly what has been happening since I set up the eternal people ; let him foretell future signs and events .
CJB	Isaiah	44	8	Don ’ t be frightened , don ’ t be afraid — Didn ’ t I tell you this long ago ? I foretold it , and you are my witnesses . Is there any God besides me ? There is no other Rock — I know of none. ”
CJB	Isaiah	44	9	All idol-makers amount to nothing ; their precious productions profit no one ; and their witnesses , to their own shame , neither see nor understand .
CJB	Isaiah	44	10	Who would fashion a god or cast an image that profits no one anything ?
CJB	Isaiah	44	11	All involved will be ashamed , but more than anyone else , the people who made them . Let them all be assembled , let them stand up ; let them fear and be shamed together .
CJB	Isaiah	44	12	A blacksmith makes a tool over burning coals ; with his strong arm he shapes it with hammers . But when he gets hungry , his strength fails ; if he doesn ’ t drink water , he grows tired .
CJB	Isaiah	44	13	A carpenter takes his measurements , sketches the shape with a stylus , planes the wood , checks it with calipers , and carves it into the shape of a man ; and , since it is honored like a man , of course it has to live in a house .
CJB	Isaiah	44	14	He goes to chop down cedars ; he takes an evergreen and an oak ; he especially tends one tree in the forest , plants a pine for the rain to nourish .
CJB	Isaiah	44	15	In time , when it ’ s ready for use as fuel , he takes some of it to keep himself warm and burns some more to bake bread . Then he makes a god and worships it , carves it into an idol and falls down before it .
CJB	Isaiah	44	16	So half of it he burns in the fire ; with that half he roasts meat and eats his fill ; he warms himself ; says , “ It feels so good , getting warm while watching the flames ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	44	17	With the rest of the log he fashions a god , a carved image , then falls down before it ; he worships it and prays to it . “ Save me , ” he says , “ for you are my god ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	44	18	Such people know nothing , understand nothing . Their eyes are sealed shut , so that they can ’ t see ; their hearts too , so they can ’ t understand .
CJB	Isaiah	44	19	Not one thinks to himself or has the knowledge or the discernment to say , “ I burned half of it in the fire , baked bread on its coals , roasted meat and ate it . Should I now make the rest an abomination ? Should I prostrate myself to a tree trunk ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	44	20	He is relying on ashes ! A deceived heart has led him astray ; so that now he won ’ t save himself , just won ’ t say , “ This thing in my hand is a fraud ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	44	21	“ Keep these matters in mind , Ya ‘ akov , for you , Isra ’ el , are my servant . I formed you , you are my own servant ; Isra ’ el , don ’ t forget me .
CJB	Isaiah	44	22	Like a thick cloud , I wipe away your offenses ; like a cloud , your sins . Come back to me , for I have redeemed you. ”
CJB	Isaiah	44	23	Sing , you heavens , for Adonai has done it ! Shout , you depths of the earth ! Mountains , break out into song , along with every tree in the forest ! For Adonai has redeemed Ya ‘ akov ; he glorifies himself in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	44	24	Here is what Adonai says , your Redeemer , he who formed you in the womb : “ I am Adonai , who makes all things , who stretched out the heavens all alone , who spread out the earth all by myself .
CJB	Isaiah	44	25	I frustrate false prophets and their omens , I make fools of diviners , I drive back the sages and make their wisdom look silly .
CJB	Isaiah	44	26	I confirm my servants ’ prophecies and make my messengers ’ plans succeed . I say of Yerushalayim : ‘ She will be lived in , ’ of the cities of Y ’ hudah , ‘ They will be rebuilt ; I will restore their ruins. ’
CJB	Isaiah	44	27	I say to the deep sea , ‘ Dry up ! I will make your streams run dry. ’
CJB	Isaiah	44	28	I say of Koresh , ‘ He is my shepherd , he will do everything I want . He will say of Yerushalayim , “ You will be rebuilt , ” and of the temple , “ Your foundation will be laid . ” ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	45	45	Thus says Adonai to Koresh , his anointed , whose right hand he has grasped , so that he subdues nations before him and strips kings of their robes , so that doors open in front of him , and no gates are barred :
CJB	Isaiah	45	2	“ I will go ahead of you , levelling the hills , shattering the bronze gates , smashing the iron bars .
CJB	Isaiah	45	3	I will give you treasures hoarded in the dark , secret riches hidden away , so that you will know that I , Adonai , calling you by your name , am the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	45	4	It is for the sake of Ya ‘ akov my servant , yes , for Isra ’ el my elect , that I call you by your name and give you a title , although you don ’ t know me .
CJB	Isaiah	45	5	I am Adonai ; there is no other ; besides me there is no God . I am arming you , although you don ’ t know me ,
CJB	Isaiah	45	6	so that those from the east and those from the west will know that there is none besides me — I am Adonai ; there is no other .
CJB	Isaiah	45	7	I form light , I create darkness ; I make well-being , I create woe ; I , Adonai , do all these things .
CJB	Isaiah	45	8	“ Heavens above , rain down justice ; let the clouds pour it down . Let the earth open , so that salvation springs up , and justice sprouts with it . I , Adonai , have created it. ”
CJB	Isaiah	45	9	Woe to anyone who argues with his maker , like potsherds lying on the ground ! Does the clay ask the potter , “ What are you doing ? ” or , “ What ’ s this you ’ re making , that has no hands ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	45	10	Woe to him who asks a father , “ Of what are you the father ? ” or who asks a woman , “ To what are you giving birth ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	45	11	Thus says Adonai , the Holy One of Isra ’ el , his Maker : “ You ask for signs concerning my children ? You give orders concerning the work of my hands ?
CJB	Isaiah	45	12	I am the one who made the earth ! I created human beings on it ! I — my hands — stretched out the heavens , and directed all their number .
CJB	Isaiah	45	13	I am stirring up Koresh to righteousness , I am smoothing out all his paths . He will rebuild my city ; and he will free my exiles , taking neither ransom nor bribe , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Isaiah	45	14	Here is what Adonai says : “ The earnings of Egypt , the commerce of Ethiopia , and men of stature from S ’ va will come over to you and become yours ; they will come in chains and follow you . They will prostrate themselves before you ; they will pray to you : ‘ Surely God is with you ; there is no other , other gods are nothing. ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	45	15	Truly , you are a God who hides himself , God of Isra ’ el , Savior !
CJB	Isaiah	45	16	The idol-makers will be ashamed , disgraced , all of them ; they will go dishonored together .
CJB	Isaiah	45	17	But Isra ’ el , saved by Adonai with an everlasting salvation , you will never , ever , be ashamed or disgraced .
CJB	Isaiah	45	18	For thus says Adonai , who created the heavens , God , who shaped and made the earth , who established and created it not to be chaos , but formed it to be lived in : “ I am Adonai ; there is no other .
CJB	Isaiah	45	19	I did not speak in secret , in a land of darkness . I did not say to the descendants of Ya ‘ akov , ‘ It is in vain that you will seek me. ’ I , Adonai , speak rightly ; I say what is true .
CJB	Isaiah	45	20	Assemble , come and gather together , you refugees from the nations ! Those carrying their wooden idols are ignorant , they pray to a god that can not save .
CJB	Isaiah	45	21	Let them stand and present their case ! Indeed , let them take counsel together . Who foretold this long ago , announced it in times gone by ? Wasn ’ t it I , Adonai ? There is no other God besides me , a just God and a Savior ; there is none besides me .
CJB	Isaiah	45	22	Look to me , and be saved , all the ends of the earth ! For I am God ; there is no other .
CJB	Isaiah	45	23	In the name of myself I have sworn , from my mouth has rightly gone out , a word that will not return — that to me every knee will bow and every tongue will swear
CJB	Isaiah	45	24	about me that only in Adonai are justice and strength. ” All who rage against him will come to him ashamed ,
CJB	Isaiah	45	25	but all the descendants of Isra ’ el will find justice and glory in Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	46	46	Bel bows down , N ’ vo stoops low ; their idols are borne by animals , beasts of burden . The loads you yourselves were carrying are now burdening tired animals .
CJB	Isaiah	46	2	They stoop and bow down together ; they can not save the burden , but themselves go into captivity .
CJB	Isaiah	46	3	“ Listen to me , house of Ya ‘ akov , all who remain of the house of Isra ’ el : I have borne you from birth , carried you since the womb .
CJB	Isaiah	46	4	Till your old age I will be the same — I will carry you until your hair is white . I have made you , and I will bear you ; yes , I will carry and save you .
CJB	Isaiah	46	5	To whom will you liken me and equate me ? With whom will you compare me , as if we were similar ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	46	6	They squander the gold from their bags and weigh silver on a scale ; they hire a goldsmith to make a god , before which they fall down and worship !
CJB	Isaiah	46	7	It is borne on shoulders and carried , then set in its place ; and there it stands . From its place it does not move . If one cries to it , it can not answer or save anyone from his troubles .
CJB	Isaiah	46	8	Remember this , and stand firm . Keep it in mind , you rebels .
CJB	Isaiah	46	9	“ Remember things that happened at the beginning , long ago — that I am God , and there is no other ; I am God , and there is none like me .
CJB	Isaiah	46	10	At the beginning I announce the end , proclaim in advance things not yet done ; and I say that my plan will hold , I will do everything I please to do .
CJB	Isaiah	46	11	I call a bird of prey from the east , the man I intended , from a distant country . I have spoken and will bring it about ; I have made a plan , and I will fulfill it .
CJB	Isaiah	46	12	Listen to me , you stubborn people , so far from righteousness :
CJB	Isaiah	46	13	I am bringing my justice nearer , it is not far away ; my salvation will not be delayed , I will place my salvation in Tziyon for Isra ’ el my glory .
CJB	Isaiah	47	47	“ Come down , and sit in the dust , you virgin daughter of Bavel ! Sit on the ground , not on a throne , daughter of the Kasdim ! No longer are you to be called dainty and delicate .
CJB	Isaiah	47	2	Take the millstones , and grind meal ; take off your veil , strip off your skirt , uncover your legs , wade through the streams .
CJB	Isaiah	47	3	Your private parts will be exposed ; yes , your shame will be seen . I am going to take vengeance , and no one will stand in my way. ”
CJB	Isaiah	47	4	Our Redeemer ! Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is his name , the Holy One of Isra ’ el !
CJB	Isaiah	47	5	“ Sit there speechless , go into darkness , you daughter of the Kasdim ! For you will no longer be called the mistress of kingdoms .
CJB	Isaiah	47	6	I was angry with my people , I desecrated my own possession and gave them over to you . But you showed them no mercy ; you made your yoke very heavy , even upon the aged .
CJB	Isaiah	47	7	You said , ‘ I will be mistress forever. ’ so you didn ’ t consider these things or think about the consequences .
CJB	Isaiah	47	8	Now hear this , you lover of luxuries , lolling at ease and saying to yourself , ‘ I am important , and no one else ! I will never be a widow or know the loss of children. ’
CJB	Isaiah	47	9	But both will come over you in an instant , in a single day loss of children and widowhood ; they will utterly overwhelm you , despite your many occult practices and powerful spells to prevent it. ”
CJB	Isaiah	47	10	You were at ease in your wickedness , you thought , “ No one sees me. ” Your “ wisdom ” and “ knowledge ” perverted you , as you thought to yourself , “ I am important , and no one else. ”
CJB	Isaiah	47	11	Yet disaster will befall you , and you won ’ t know how to charm it away ; calamity will come upon you , and you won ’ t be able to turn it aside ; ruin will overcome you , suddenly , before you know it .
CJB	Isaiah	47	12	So for now , keep on with your powerful spells and your many occult practices ; from childhood you have been working at them ; maybe they will do you some good , maybe you will inspire terror !
CJB	Isaiah	47	13	You are worn out with all your consultations — so let the astrologers and stargazers , the monthly horoscope-makers , come forward now and save you from the things that will come upon you !
CJB	Isaiah	47	14	Look , they will be like straw ! The fire will consume them . They will not save even themselves from the power of the flame . It will not be coals for warming oneself , not a fire to sit beside !
CJB	Isaiah	47	15	So much for your [ wizards ] , with whom you have worked all your life ! Each will wander off in his own direction , and nobody will save you .
CJB	Isaiah	48	48	Listen to this , house of Ya ‘ akov , called by the name of Isra ’ el , who have come from the spring of Y ’ hudah , who swear by the name of Adonai and invoke the God of Isra ’ el ! — it is not sincerely or justifiably
CJB	Isaiah	48	2	that they call themselves people of the holy city or rely on the God of Isra ’ el — Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is his name :
CJB	Isaiah	48	3	“ I announced things that happened at the beginning , long ago ; they issued from my mouth , I proclaimed them . Then suddenly I acted , and they occurred .
CJB	Isaiah	48	4	Because I knew that you were stubborn , your neck an iron sinew , your forehead bronze ,
CJB	Isaiah	48	5	I announced it to you long ago ; before it occurred , I proclaimed it to you ; so that you could not say , ‘ My idol did it ; my carved image , my statue , gave the order for it. ’
CJB	Isaiah	48	6	You have heard and seen all this , so why won ’ t you admit it ? “ Now I am announcing new things to you , secret things you have not known ,
CJB	Isaiah	48	7	created now , not long ago ; before today , you did not hear them : so you can ’ t say , ‘ I already know about them. ’
CJB	Isaiah	48	8	No , you haven ’ t heard , and you haven ’ t known ; these things have not reached your ears before . For I knew how treacherous you were — you were called a rebel from the womb .
CJB	Isaiah	48	9	Yet for the sake of my own reputation I am deferring my anger ; for the sake of my praise I am patient with you , so as not to cut you off .
CJB	Isaiah	48	10	“ Look , I have refined you , but not [ as severely ] as silver ; [ rather ] I have tested you in the furnace of affliction .
CJB	Isaiah	48	11	For my sake I will do it , for my own sake . I will not let [ my reputation ] be tarnished ; I will not yield my glory to anyone else .
CJB	Isaiah	48	12	“ Listen to me , Ya ‘ akov ; Isra ’ el , whom I have called : I am he who is first ; I am also the last .
CJB	Isaiah	48	13	My hand laid the foundation of the earth , my right hand spread out the heavens ; when I summoned them , at once they rose into being .
CJB	Isaiah	48	14	“ All of you , assemble and listen : which of you has foretold what is coming ? Adonai ’ s friend will do his will against Bavel , using his arm against the Kasdim .
CJB	Isaiah	48	15	It is I who have spoken , I have summoned him , I have brought him , and he will succeed .
CJB	Isaiah	48	16	“ Come close to me , and listen to this : since the beginning I have not spoken in secret , since the time things began to be , I have been there ; and now Adonai Elohim has sent me and his Spirit. ”
CJB	Isaiah	48	17	Thus says Adonai , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Isra ’ el : “ I am Adonai , your God , who teaches you for your own good , who guides you on the path you should take .
CJB	Isaiah	48	18	If only you would heed my mitzvot ! Then your peace would flow on like a river , and your righteousness like the waves of the sea .
CJB	Isaiah	48	19	Your descendants would be numerous as the sand , your offspring countless as its grains . Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from my presence. ”
CJB	Isaiah	48	20	Get out of Bavel ! Flee the Kasdim ! With shouts of joy announce it , proclaim it ! Send the news out to the ends of the earth ! Say , “ Adonai has redeemed his servant Ya ‘ akov. ”
CJB	Isaiah	48	21	They weren ’ t thirsty when he led them through the deserts , he made water flow from the rock for them — he split the rock , and out gushed the water .
CJB	Isaiah	48	22	But there is no peace , says Adonai , for the wicked .
CJB	Isaiah	49	49	Coastlands , listen to me ; listen , you peoples far away : Adonai called me from the womb ; before I was born , he had spoken my name .
CJB	Isaiah	49	2	He has made my mouth like a sharp sword while hiding me in the shadow of his hand ; he has made me like a sharpened arrow while concealing me in his quiver .
CJB	Isaiah	49	3	He said to me , “ You are my servant , Isra ’ el , through whom I will show my glory. ”
CJB	Isaiah	49	4	But I said , “ I have toiled in vain , spent my strength for nothing , futility. ” Yet my cause is with Adonai , my reward is with my God .
CJB	Isaiah	49	5	So now Adonai says — he formed me in the womb to be his servant , to bring Ya ‘ akov back to him , to have Isra ’ el gathered to him , so that I will be honored in the sight of Adonai , my God having become my strength —
CJB	Isaiah	49	6	he has said , “ It is not enough that you are merely my servant to raise up the tribes of Ya ‘ akov and restore the offspring of Isra ’ el . I will also make you a light to the nations , so my salvation can spread to the ends of the earth. ”
CJB	Isaiah	49	7	Here is what Adonai , the Redeemer of Isra ’ el , his Holy One , says to the one despised , whom the nations detest , to the servant of tyrants : “ When kings see you , they will stand up ; princes too will prostrate themselves , because of Adonai , who is faithful , the Holy One of Isra ’ el , who has chosen you. ”
CJB	Isaiah	49	8	Here is what Adonai says : “ At the time when I choose , I will answer you ; on the day of salvation , I will help you . I have preserved you , and I have appointed you to be the covenant for a people , to restore the land and distribute again its ruined inheritances to their owners ,
CJB	Isaiah	49	9	to say to the prisoners , ‘ Come out ! ’ to those in darkness , ‘ Show yourselves ! ’ They will feed along the paths , and all the high hills will be their pastures .
CJB	Isaiah	49	10	They will be neither hungry nor thirsty ; neither scorching wind nor sun will strike them ; for he who has mercy on them will lead them and guide them to springs of water .
CJB	Isaiah	49	11	I will turn all my mountains into a road , my highways will be raised up .
CJB	Isaiah	49	12	There they come , some from far away , some from the north , some from the west , and some from the land of Sinim. ”
CJB	Isaiah	49	13	Sing , heaven ! Rejoice , earth ! Break out in song , you mountains ! For Adonai is comforting his people , having mercy on his own who have suffered .
CJB	Isaiah	49	14	“ But Tziyon says , ‘ Adonai has abandoned me , Adonai has forgotten me. ’
CJB	Isaiah	49	15	Can a woman forget her child at the breast , not show pity on the child from her womb ? Even if these were to forget , I would not forget you .
CJB	Isaiah	49	16	I have engraved you on the palms of my hands , your walls are always before me. ”
CJB	Isaiah	49	17	Your children are coming quickly , your destroyers and plunderers are leaving and going .
CJB	Isaiah	49	18	Raise your eyes , and look around : they are all gathering and coming to you . Adonai swears : “ As surely as I am alive , you will wear them all like jewels , adorn yourself with them like a bride. ”
CJB	Isaiah	49	19	For your desolate places and ruins and your devastated land will be too cramped for those living in it ; your devourers will be far away .
CJB	Isaiah	49	20	The day will come when the children born when you were mourning will say to you , “ This place is too cramped for me ! Give me room , so I can live ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	49	21	Then you will ask yourself , “ Who fathered these for me ? I ’ ve been mourning my children , alone , as an exile , wandering to and fro ; so who has raised these ? I was left alone , so where have these come from ? ”
CJB	Isaiah	49	22	Adonai Elohim answers : “ I am beckoning to the nations , raising my banner for the peoples . They will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders .
CJB	Isaiah	49	23	Kings will be your foster-fathers , their princesses your nurses . They will bow to you , face toward the earth , and lick the dust on your feet . Then you will know that I am Adonai — those who wait for me will not be sorry. ”
CJB	Isaiah	49	24	But can booty be wrested from a warrior ? Can a victor ’ s captives be freed ?
CJB	Isaiah	49	25	Here is Adonai ’ s answer : “ Even a warrior ’ s captives will be snatched away , and the booty of the fearful will be freed . I will fight those who fight you , and I will save your children .
CJB	Isaiah	49	26	I will feed those oppressing you with their own flesh ; they will be drunk on their own blood as with wine . Then everyone will know that I , Adonai , am your Savior and your Redeemer , the Mighty One of Ya ‘ akov . ”
CJB	Isaiah	50	50	Adonai says : “ Where is your mother ’ s divorce document which I gave her when I divorced her ? Or : to which of my creditors did I sell you ? You were sold because of your sins ; because of your crimes was your mother divorced .
CJB	Isaiah	50	2	Why was no one here when I came ? Why , when I called , did nobody answer ? Is my arm too short to redeem ? Have I too little power to save ? With my rebuke I dry up the sea ; I turn rivers into desert , their fish rot for lack of water and they die of thirst ;
CJB	Isaiah	50	3	I dress the heavens in black to mourn and make their covering sackcloth. ”
CJB	Isaiah	50	4	Adonai Elohim has given me the ability to speak as a man well taught , so that I , with my words , know how to sustain the weary . Each morning he awakens my ear to hear like those who are taught .
CJB	Isaiah	50	5	Adonai Elohim has opened my ear , and I neither rebelled nor turned away .
CJB	Isaiah	50	6	I offered my back to those who struck me , my cheeks to those who plucked out my beard ; I did not hide my face from insult and spitting .
CJB	Isaiah	50	7	For Adonai Elohim will help . This is why no insult can wound me . This is why I have set my face like flint , knowing I will not be put to shame .
CJB	Isaiah	50	8	My vindicator is close by ; let whoever dares to accuse me appear with me in court ! Let whoever has a case against me step forward !
CJB	Isaiah	50	9	Look , if Adonai Elohim helps me , who will dare to condemn me ? Here , they are all falling apart like old , moth-eaten clothes .
CJB	Isaiah	50	10	Who among you fears Adonai ? Who obeys what his servant says ? Even when he walks in the dark , without any light , he will trust in Adonai ’ s reputation and rely on his God .
CJB	Isaiah	50	11	But all of you who are lighting fires and arming yourselves with firebrands : go , walk in the flame of your own fire , among the firebrands you lit ! From my hands this [ fate ] awaits you : you will lie down in torment .
CJB	Isaiah	51	51	“ Listen to me , you pursuers of justice , you who seek Adonai : consider the rock from which you were cut , the quarry from which you were dug —
CJB	Isaiah	51	2	consider Avraham your father and Sarah , who gave birth to you ; in that I called him when he was only one person , then blessed him and made him many .
CJB	Isaiah	51	3	For Adonai will comfort Tziyon , will comfort all her ruined places , will make her desert like ‘ Eden , her ‘ Aravah like the garden of Adonai . Joy and gladness will be there , thanksgiving and the sound of music .
CJB	Isaiah	51	4	“ Pay attention to me , my people ! My nation , listen to me ! For Torah will go out from me ; I will calm them with my justice as a light for the peoples .
CJB	Isaiah	51	5	My righteousness is at hand , my salvation goes out , my arms will judge the peoples . The coastlands are putting their hope in me , trusting in my arm .
CJB	Isaiah	51	6	“ Raise your eyes toward the skies , look at the earth below . The skies will vanish like smoke , the earth will wear out like clothing . Those living on it will die like flies ; but my salvation will be forever , and my justice will never end .
CJB	Isaiah	51	7	“ Listen to me , you who know justice , you people who have my Torah in your heart : don ’ t be afraid of people ’ s taunts , don ’ t be upset by their insults .
CJB	Isaiah	51	8	For the moth will eat them up like clothing , the worm will eat them like wool ; but my justice will be forever , and my salvation for all generations. ”
CJB	Isaiah	51	9	Awake ! Awake ! Arm of Adonai , clothe yourself with strength ! Awake , as in days of old , as in ancient generations ! Wasn ’ t it you who hacked Rahav to pieces , you who pierced the sea monster ? *
CJB	Isaiah	51	10	Wasn ’ t it you who dried up the sea , the waters of the great deep ; you who made the sea bottom a road for the redeemed to cross ?
CJB	Isaiah	51	11	Those ransomed by Adonai will return and come with singing to Tziyon ; on their heads will be everlasting joy . They will acquire gladness and joy , while sorrow and sighing will flee .
CJB	Isaiah	51	12	“ I , yes I , am the one who comforts you ! Why are you afraid of a man , who must die ; of a human being , who will wither like grass ?
CJB	Isaiah	51	13	You have forgotten Adonai , your maker , who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth . Instead , you are in constant fear all day because of the oppressor ’ s rage , as he prepares to destroy ! But where is the oppressor ’ s rage ?
CJB	Isaiah	51	14	The captive will soon be set free ; he will not die and go down to Sh ’ ol ; on the contrary , his food supply will be secure .
CJB	Isaiah	51	15	For I am Adonai your God , who stirs up the sea , who makes its waves roar — Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is my name .
CJB	Isaiah	51	16	I have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand , in order to plant the skies [ anew ] , lay the foundations of the earth [ anew ] and say to Tziyon , ‘ You are my people. ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	51	17	Awake ! Awake ! Stand up , Yerushalayim ! At Adonai ’ s hand you drank the cup of his fury ; you have drained to the dregs the goblet of drunkenness .
CJB	Isaiah	51	18	There is no one to guide her among all the sons she has borne . Not one of all the children she raised is taking her by the hand .
CJB	Isaiah	51	19	These two disasters have overcome you — yet who will grieve with you ? — plunder and destruction , famine and sword ; by whom can I comfort you ?
CJB	Isaiah	51	20	Your children lie helpless at every street corner , like an antelope trapped in a net ; they are full of Adonai ’ s fury , the rebuke of your God .
CJB	Isaiah	51	21	Therefore , please hear this in your affliction , you who are drunk , but not with wine ;
CJB	Isaiah	51	22	this is what your Lord Adonai says , your God , who defends his people : “ Here , I have removed from your hand the cup of drunkenness , the goblet of my fury . You will never drink it again .
CJB	Isaiah	51	23	I will put it in the hands of your tormentors , who said to you , ‘ Bend down , so we can trample you , ’ and you flattened your back on the ground like a street for them to walk on . ”
CJB	Isaiah	52	52	Awake ! Awake , Tziyon ! Clothe yourself with your strength ! Dress in your splendid garments , Yerushalayim , the holy city ! For the uncircumcised and the unclean will enter you no more .
CJB	Isaiah	52	2	Shake off the dust ! Arise ! Be enthroned , Yerushalayim ! Loosen the chains on your neck , captive daughter of Tziyon !
CJB	Isaiah	52	3	For thus says Adonai : “ You were sold for nothing , and you will be redeemed without money. ”
CJB	Isaiah	52	4	For thus says Adonai Elohim : “ Long ago my people went down to Egypt to live there as aliens , and Ashur oppressed them for no reason .
CJB	Isaiah	52	5	So now , what should I do here , ” asks Adonai , “ since my people were carried off for nothing ? Their oppressors are howling , ” says Adonai , “ and my name is always being insulted , daily .
CJB	Isaiah	52	6	Therefore my people will know my name ; therefore on that day they will know that I , the one speaking — here I am ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	52	7	How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news , proclaiming shalom , bringing good news of good things , announcing salvation and saying to Tziyon , “ Your God is King ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	52	8	Listen ! Your watchmen are raising their voices , shouting for joy together . For they will see , before their own eyes , Adonai returning to Tziyon .
CJB	Isaiah	52	9	Break out into joy ! Sing together , you ruins of Yerushalayim ! For Adonai has comforted his people , he has redeemed Yerushalayim !
CJB	Isaiah	52	10	Adonai has bared his holy arm in the sight of every nation , and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God .
CJB	Isaiah	52	11	Leave ! Leave ! Get out of there ! Don ’ t touch anything unclean ! Get out from inside it , and be clean , you who carry Adonai ’ s temple equipment .
CJB	Isaiah	52	12	You need not leave in haste , you do not have to flee ; for Adonai will go ahead of you , and the God of Isra ’ el will also be behind you .
CJB	Isaiah	52	13	“ See how my servant will succeed ! He will be raised up , exalted , highly honored !
CJB	Isaiah	52	14	Just as many were appalled at him , because he was so disfigured that he didn ’ t even seem human and simply no longer looked like a man ,
CJB	Isaiah	52	15	so now he will startle many nations ; because of him , kings will be speechless . For they will see what they had not been told , they will ponder things they had never heard . ”
CJB	Isaiah	53	53	Who believes our report ? To whom is the arm of Adonai revealed ?
CJB	Isaiah	53	2	For before him he grew up like a young plant , like a root out of dry ground . He was not well-formed or especially handsome ; we saw him , but his appearance did not attract us .
CJB	Isaiah	53	3	People despised and avoided him , a man of pains , well acquainted with illness . Like someone from whom people turn their faces , he was despised ; we did not value him .
CJB	Isaiah	53	4	In fact , it was our diseases he bore , our pains from which he suffered ; yet we regarded him as punished , stricken and afflicted by God .
CJB	Isaiah	53	5	But he was wounded because of our crimes , crushed because of our sins ; the disciplining that makes us whole fell on him , and by his bruises * we are healed .
CJB	Isaiah	53	6	We all , like sheep , went astray ; we turned , each one , to his own way ; yet Adonai laid on him the guilt of all of us .
CJB	Isaiah	53	7	Though mistreated , he was submissive — he did not open his mouth . Like a lamb led to be slaughtered , like a sheep silent before its shearers , he did not open his mouth .
CJB	Isaiah	53	8	After forcible arrest and sentencing , he was taken away ; and none of his generation protested his being cut off from the land of the living for the crimes of my people , who deserved the punishment themselves .
CJB	Isaiah	53	9	He was given a grave among the wicked ; in his death he was with a rich man . Although he had done no violence and had said nothing deceptive ,
CJB	Isaiah	53	10	yet it pleased Adonai to crush him with illness , to see if he would present himself as a guilt offering . If he does , he will see his offspring ; and he will prolong his days ; and at his hand Adonai ’ s desire will be accomplished .
CJB	Isaiah	53	11	After this ordeal , he will see satisfaction . “ By his knowing [ pain and sacrifice ] , my righteous servant makes many righteous ; it is for their sins that he suffers .
CJB	Isaiah	53	12	Therefore I will assign him a share with the great , he will divide the spoil with the mighty , for having exposed himself to death and being counted among the sinners , while actually bearing the sin of many and interceding for the offenders . ”
CJB	Isaiah	54	54	“ Sing , barren woman who has never had a child ! Burst into song , shout for joy , you who have never been in labor ! For the deserted wife will have more children than the woman who is living with her husband , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	54	2	Enlarge the space for your tent , extend the curtains of your dwelling ; do not hold back , lengthen your cords , make your tent pegs firm .
CJB	Isaiah	54	3	For you will spread out to the right and the left , your descendants will possess the nations and inhabit the desolated cities .
CJB	Isaiah	54	4	Don ’ t be afraid , for you won ’ t be ashamed ; don ’ t be discouraged , for you won ’ t be disgraced . You will forget the shame of your youth , no longer remember the dishonor of being widowed .
CJB	Isaiah	54	5	For your husband is your Maker , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is his name . The Holy One of Isra ’ el is your Redeemer . He will be called the God of all the earth .
CJB	Isaiah	54	6	For Adonai has called you back like a wife abandoned and grief-stricken ; “ A wife married in her youth can not be rejected , ” says your God .
CJB	Isaiah	54	7	“ Briefly I abandoned you , but with great compassion I am taking you back .
CJB	Isaiah	54	8	I was angry for a moment and hid my face from you ; but with everlasting grace I will have compassion on you , ” says Adonai your Redeemer .
CJB	Isaiah	54	9	“ For me this is like Noach ’ s flood . Just as I swore that no flood like Noach ’ s would ever again cover the earth , so now I swear that never again will I be angry with you or rebuke you .
CJB	Isaiah	54	10	For the mountains may leave and the hills be removed , but my grace will never leave you , and my covenant of peace will not be removed , ” says Adonai , who has compassion on you .
CJB	Isaiah	54	11	“ Storm-ravaged [ city ] , unconsoled , I will set your stones in the finest way , lay your foundations with sapphires ,
CJB	Isaiah	54	12	make your windows shine with rubies , your gates with garnet , your walls with gemstones .
CJB	Isaiah	54	13	All your children will be taught by Adonai ; your children will have great peace .
CJB	Isaiah	54	14	In righteousness you will be established , far from oppression , with nothing to fear ; far from ruin , for it will not come near you .
CJB	Isaiah	54	15	Any alliance that forms against you will not be my doing ; whoever tries to form such an alliance will fall because of you .
CJB	Isaiah	54	16	It is I who created the craftsman who blows on the coals and forges weapons suited to their purpose ; I also created the destroyer to work havoc .
CJB	Isaiah	54	17	No weapon made will prevail against you . In court you will refute every accusation . The servants of Adonai inherit all this ; the reward for their righteousness is from me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	55	55	“ All you who are thirsty , come to the water ! You without money , come , buy , and eat ! Yes , come ! Buy wine and milk without money — it ’ s free !
CJB	Isaiah	55	2	Why spend money for what isn ’ t food , your wages for what doesn ’ t satisfy ? Listen carefully to me , and you will eat well , you will enjoy the fat of the land .
CJB	Isaiah	55	3	Open your ears , and come to me ; listen well , and you will live — I will make an everlasting covenant with you , the grace I assured David .
CJB	Isaiah	55	4	I have given him as a witness to the peoples , a leader and lawgiver for the peoples .
CJB	Isaiah	55	5	You will summon a nation you do not know , and a nation that doesn ’ t know you will run to you , for the sake of Adonai your God , the Holy One of Isra ’ el , who will glorify you. ”
CJB	Isaiah	55	6	Seek Adonai while he is available , call on him while he is still nearby .
CJB	Isaiah	55	7	Let the wicked person abandon his way and the evil person his thoughts ; let him return to Adonai , and he will have mercy on him ; let him return to our God , for he will freely forgive .
CJB	Isaiah	55	8	“ For my thoughts are not your thoughts , and your ways are not my ways , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	55	9	“ As high as the sky is above the earth are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
CJB	Isaiah	55	10	For just as rain and snow fall from the sky and do not return there , but water the earth , causing it to bud and produce , giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater ;
CJB	Isaiah	55	11	so is my word that goes out from my mouth — it will not return to me unfulfilled ; but it will accomplish what I intend , and cause to succeed what I sent it to do. ”
CJB	Isaiah	55	12	Yes , you will go out with joy , you will be led forth in peace . As you come , the mountains and hills will burst out into song , and all the trees in the countryside will clap their hands .
CJB	Isaiah	55	13	Cypresses will grow in place of thorns , myrtles will grow instead of briars . This will bring fame to Adonai as an eternal , imperishable sign .
CJB	Isaiah	56	56	Here is what Adonai says : “ Observe justice , do what is right , for my salvation is close to coming , my righteousness to being revealed. ”
CJB	Isaiah	56	2	Happy is the person who does this , anyone who grasps it firmly , who keeps Shabbat and does not profane it , and keeps himself from doing any evil .
CJB	Isaiah	56	3	A foreigner joining Adonai should not say , “ Adonai will separate me from his people ” ; likewise the eunuch should not say , “ I am only a dried-up tree. ”
CJB	Isaiah	56	4	For here is what Adonai says : “ As for the eunuchs who keep my Shabbats , who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant :
CJB	Isaiah	56	5	in my house , within my walls , I will give them power and a name greater than sons and daughters ; I will give him an everlasting name that will not be cut off .
CJB	Isaiah	56	6	“ And the foreigners who join themselves to Adonai to serve him , to love the name of Adonai , and to be his workers , all who keep Shabbat and do not profane it , and hold fast to my covenant ,
CJB	Isaiah	56	7	I will bring them to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer ; their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar ; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples. ”
CJB	Isaiah	56	8	Adonai Elohim says , he who gathers Isra ’ el ’ s exiles : “ There are yet others I will gather , besides those gathered already. ”
CJB	Isaiah	56	9	All you wild animals , come and devour , yes , all you animals in the forest !
CJB	Isaiah	56	10	[ Isra ’ el ’ s ] watchmen are , all of them , blind ; they don ’ t know anything . They are all dumb dogs , unable to bark , lying there dreaming , loving to sleep .
CJB	Isaiah	56	11	Greedy dogs , never satisfied — such are the shepherds , unable to understand ; they all turn to their own way , each one intent on his own gain :
CJB	Isaiah	56	12	“ Come , I ’ ll get some wine , we ’ ll fill up on good , strong liquor ! Tomorrow will be like today ; in fact , it will be even better ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	57	57	The righteous person perishes , and nobody gives it a thought . Godly men are taken away , and no one understands that the righteous person is taken away from the evil yet to come .
CJB	Isaiah	57	2	Yes , those who live uprightly will have peace as they rest on their couches .
CJB	Isaiah	57	3	“ But you , you witches ’ children , come here , you spawn of adulterers and whores !
CJB	Isaiah	57	4	Whom are you making fun of ? At whom are you laughing and sticking out your tongue ? Aren ’ t you rebellious children , just a brood of liars ?
CJB	Isaiah	57	5	You go into heat among the oak trees , under every spreading tree . You kill the children in the valleys under the cracks in the rocks .
CJB	Isaiah	57	6	Your place is among the smooth stones in the vadi ; these , these are what you deserve ; you pour out drink offerings to them , you offer grain offerings to them . Should I calmly ignore these things ?
CJB	Isaiah	57	7	You set up your bed on a high , lofty mountain ; you also went up there to offer sacrifices .
CJB	Isaiah	57	8	Behind door and doorpost you set up your [ lewd ] memorial ; then , far from me , you uncovered your bed , climbed up on it and opened it wide , made an agreement with some of them , whose bed you loved when you saw their hand beckoning .
CJB	Isaiah	57	9	You went to the king with scented oil ; you added to your perfumes ; you sent your envoys far away , even down to Sh ’ ol .
CJB	Isaiah	57	10	Though worn out by so much travel , you did not say , ‘ All hope is gone ’ ; rather , finding your strength renewed , you did not grow weak .
CJB	Isaiah	57	11	Of whom have you been so afraid , so fearful that you lied ? But me you don ’ t remember , you don ’ t give me a thought ! I have held my peace so long that you no longer fear me .
CJB	Isaiah	57	12	I will expose your [ so-called ] ‘ righteousness ’ ; and what you have done won ’ t help you .
CJB	Isaiah	57	13	When you cry , will those [ idols ] you gathered rescue you ? The wind will carry them all away , a puff of air will take them off . But whoever takes refuge in me will possess the land and inherit my holy mountain. ”
CJB	Isaiah	57	14	Then he will say , “ Keep building ! Keep building ! Clear the way ! Remove everything blocking my people ’ s path ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	57	15	For thus says the High , Exalted One who lives forever , whose name is Holy : “ I live in the high and holy place but also with the broken and humble , in order to revive the spirit of the humble and revive the hearts of the broken ones .
CJB	Isaiah	57	16	For I will not fight them forever or always nurse my anger ; otherwise their spirits would faint before me , the creatures I myself have made .
CJB	Isaiah	57	17	It was because of their flagrant greed that I was angry and struck them ; I hid myself and was angry , but they continued on their own rebellious way .
CJB	Isaiah	57	18	I have seen their ways , and I will heal them ; I will lead them and give comfort to them and to those who mourn for them —
CJB	Isaiah	57	19	I will create the right words : ‘ Shalom shalom to those far off and to those nearby ! ’ says Adonai ; ‘ I will heal them ! ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	57	20	But the wicked are like the restless sea — unable to be still , its waters toss up mud and dirt .
CJB	Isaiah	57	21	There is no shalom , says my God , for the wicked .
CJB	Isaiah	58	58	Shout out loud ! Don ’ t hold back ! Raise your voice like a shofar ! Proclaim to my people what rebels they are , to the house of Ya ‘ akov their sins .
CJB	Isaiah	58	2	“ Oh yes , they seek me day after day and [ claim to ] delight in knowing my ways . As if they were an upright nation that had not abandoned the rulings of their God , they ask me for just rulings and [ claim ] to take pleasure in closeness to God ,
CJB	Isaiah	58	3	[ asking , ] ‘ Why should we fast , if you don ’ t see ? Why mortify ourselves , if you don ’ t notice ? ’ “ Here is my answer : when you fast , you go about doing whatever you like , while keeping your laborers hard at work .
CJB	Isaiah	58	4	Your fasts lead to quarreling and fighting , to lashing out with violent blows . On a day like today , fasting like yours will not make your voice heard on high .
CJB	Isaiah	58	5	“ Is this the sort of fast I want , a day when a person mortifies himself ? Is the object to hang your head like a reed and spread sackcloth and ashes under yourself ? Is this what you call a fast , a day that pleases Adonai ?
CJB	Isaiah	58	6	“ Here is the sort of fast I want — releasing those unjustly bound , untying the thongs of the yoke , letting the oppressed go free , breaking every yoke ,
CJB	Isaiah	58	7	sharing your food with the hungry , taking the homeless poor into your house , clothing the naked when you see them , fulfilling your duty to your kinsmen ! ”
CJB	Isaiah	58	8	Then your light will burst forth like the morning , your new skin will quickly grow over your wound ; your righteousness will precede you , and Adonai ’ s glory will follow you .
CJB	Isaiah	58	9	Then you will call , and Adonai will answer ; you will cry , and he will say , “ Here I am. ” If you will remove the yoke from among you , stop false accusation and slander ,
CJB	Isaiah	58	10	generously offer food to the hungry and meet the needs of the person in trouble ; then your light will rise in the darkness , and your gloom become like noon .
CJB	Isaiah	58	11	Adonai will always guide you ; he will satisfy your needs in the desert , he will renew the strength in your limbs ; so that you will be like a watered garden , like a spring whose water never fails .
CJB	Isaiah	58	12	You will rebuild the ancient ruins , raise foundations from ages past , and be called “ Repairer of broken walls , Restorer of streets to live in. ”
CJB	Isaiah	58	13	“ If you hold back your foot on Shabbat from pursuing your own interests on my holy day ; if you call Shabbat a delight , Adonai ’ s holy day , worth honoring ; then honor it by not doing your usual things or pursuing your interests or speaking about them .
CJB	Isaiah	58	14	If you do , you will find delight in Adonai — I will make you ride on the heights of the land and feed you with the heritage of your ancestor Ya ‘ akov , for the mouth of Adonai has spoken . ”
CJB	Isaiah	59	59	Adonai ’ s arm is not too short to save , nor is his ear too dull to hear .
CJB	Isaiah	59	2	Rather , it is your own crimes that separate you from your God ; your sins have hidden his face from you , so that he doesn ’ t hear .
CJB	Isaiah	59	3	For your hands are stained with blood and your fingers with crime ; your lips speak lies , your tongues utter wicked things .
CJB	Isaiah	59	4	No one sues with just cause , no one pleads honestly in court , they trust in empty words and say worthless things ; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil .
CJB	Isaiah	59	5	They hatch viper eggs and spin spiderwebs ; whoever eats their eggs dies , and the crushed egg hatches a snake .
CJB	Isaiah	59	6	Their webs are useless as clothing , their deeds are useless for wearing ; their deeds are deeds of wickedness , their hands produce violence .
CJB	Isaiah	59	7	Their feet run to evil , they rush to shed innocent blood , their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness , their paths lead to havoc and ruin .
CJB	Isaiah	59	8	The way of shalom they do not know , their goings-about obey no law , they make devious paths for themselves ; no one treading them will ever know shalom .
CJB	Isaiah	59	9	This is why justice is far from us , and righteousness doesn ’ t catch up with us ; we look for light , but see only darkness , for brightness , but we walk in gloom .
CJB	Isaiah	59	10	We grope for the wall like the blind ; like people without eyes we feel our way ; we stumble at noonday as if it were dusk , we are in dark places like the dead .
CJB	Isaiah	59	11	We growl , all of us , like bears and moan pitifully like doves ; we look for justice , but there is none ; for salvation , but it is far from us .
CJB	Isaiah	59	12	For our crimes multiply before you , our sins testify against us ; for our crimes are present with us ; and our sins , we know them well :
CJB	Isaiah	59	13	rebelling and denying Adonai , turning away from following our God , talking about oppression and revolt , uttering lies which our hearts have conceived .
CJB	Isaiah	59	14	Thus justice is repelled , righteousness stands apart , at a distance ; for truth stumbles in the public court , and uprightness can not enter .
CJB	Isaiah	59	15	Honesty is lacking , he who leaves evil becomes a target . Adonai saw it , and it displeased him that there was no justice .
CJB	Isaiah	59	16	He saw that there was no one , was amazed that no one interceded . Therefore his own arm brought him salvation , and his own righteousness sustained him .
CJB	Isaiah	59	17	He put on righteousness as his breastplate , salvation as a helmet on his head ; he clothed himself with garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in a mantle of zeal .
CJB	Isaiah	59	18	He repays according to their deeds — fury to his foes , reprisal to his enemies ; to the coastlands he will repay their due ;
CJB	Isaiah	59	19	in the west they will fear the name of Adonai , and likewise , in the east , his glory . For he will come like a pent-up stream , impelled by the Spirit of Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	59	20	“ Then a Redeemer will come to Tziyon , to those in Ya ‘ akov who turn from rebellion. ” So says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	59	21	“ And as for me , ” says Adonai , “ this is my covenant with them : my Spirit , who rests on you , and my words which I put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth or from the mouth of your children , or from the mouth of your children ’ s children , now or ever , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	60	60	“ Arise , shine [ Yerushalayim ] , for your light has come , the glory of Adonai has risen over you .
CJB	Isaiah	60	2	For although darkness covers the earth and thick darkness the peoples ; on you Adonai will rise ; over you will be seen his glory .
CJB	Isaiah	60	3	Nations will go toward your light and kings toward your shining splendor .
CJB	Isaiah	60	4	Raise your eyes and look around : they are all assembling and coming to you ; your sons are coming from far off , your daughters being carried on their nurses ’ hips .
CJB	Isaiah	60	5	Then you will see and be radiant , your heart will throb and swell with delight ; for the riches of the seas will be brought to you , the wealth of nations will come to you .
CJB	Isaiah	60	6	Caravans of camels will cover your land , young camels from Midyan and ‘ Eifah , all of them coming from Sh ’ va , bringing gold and frankincense , and proclaiming the praises of Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	60	7	All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered for you , the rams of N ’ vayot will be at your service ; they will come up and be received on my altar , as I glorify my glorious house .
CJB	Isaiah	60	8	“ Who are these , flying along like clouds , like doves to their dovecotes ?
CJB	Isaiah	60	9	The coastlands are putting their hope in me , with the ‘ Tarshish ’ ships in the lead , to bring your children from far away , and with them their silver and gold , for the sake of Adonai your God , the Holy One of Isra ’ el , who glorifies you .
CJB	Isaiah	60	10	Foreigners will rebuild your walls , their kings will be at your service ; for in my anger I struck you , but in my mercy I pity you .
CJB	Isaiah	60	11	Your gates will always be open , they will not be shut by day or by night , so that people can bring you the wealth of nations , with their kings led in procession .
CJB	Isaiah	60	12	For the nation or kingdom that won ’ t serve you will perish ; yes , those nations will be utterly destroyed .
CJB	Isaiah	60	13	“ The glory of the L ’ vanon will come to you , cypresses together with elm trees and larches , to beautify the site of my sanctuary — I will glorify the place where I stand .
CJB	Isaiah	60	14	The children of your oppressors will come and bow low before you , all who despised you will fall at your feet , calling you the city of Adonai , Tziyon of the Holy One of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Isaiah	60	15	“ In the past you were abandoned and hated , so that no one would even pass through you ; but now I will make you the pride of the ages , a joy for many generations .
CJB	Isaiah	60	16	You will drink the milk of nations , you will nurse at royal breasts and know that I , Adonai , am your Savior , your Redeemer , the Mighty One of Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Isaiah	60	17	“ For bronze I will bring you gold , for iron I will bring you silver , bronze in place of wood , and iron in place of stones . I will make shalom your governor and righteousness your taskmaster .
CJB	Isaiah	60	18	Violence will no longer be heard in your land , desolation or destruction within your borders ; instead , you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise .
CJB	Isaiah	60	19	“ No more will the sun be your light by day , nor will moonlight shine on you ; instead Adonai will be your light forever and your God your glory .
CJB	Isaiah	60	20	No longer will your sun go down ; your moon will no longer wane ; for Adonai will be your light forever ; your days of mourning will end .
CJB	Isaiah	60	21	All your people will be tzaddikim ; they will inherit the land forever ; they will be the branch I planted , my handiwork , in which I take pride .
CJB	Isaiah	60	22	The smallest will grow to a thousand , the weakest will become a mighty nation . I , Adonai , when the right time comes , will quickly bring it about . ”
CJB	Isaiah	61	61	The Spirit of Adonai Elohim is upon me , because Adonai has anointed me to announce good news to the poor . He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted ; to proclaim freedom to the captives , to let out into light those bound in the dark ;
CJB	Isaiah	61	2	to proclaim the year of the favor of Adonai and the day of vengeance of our God ; to comfort all who mourn ,
CJB	Isaiah	61	3	yes , provide for those in Tziyon who mourn , giving them garlands instead of ashes , the oil of gladness instead of mourning , a cloak of praise instead of a heavy spirit , so that they will be called oaks of righteousness planted by Adonai , in which he takes pride .
CJB	Isaiah	61	4	They will rebuild the ancient ruins , restore sites long destroyed ; they will renew the ruined cities , destroyed many generations ago .
CJB	Isaiah	61	5	Strangers will stand and feed your flocks , foreigners plow your land and tend your vines ;
CJB	Isaiah	61	6	but you will be called cohanim of Adonai , spoken of as ministers to our God . You will feed on the wealth of nations , and revel in their riches .
CJB	Isaiah	61	7	Because of your shame , which was doubled , and because they cried , “ They deserve disgrace , ” therefore in their land what they own will be doubled , and joy forever will be theirs .
CJB	Isaiah	61	8	“ For I , Adonai , love justice ; I hate robbery for burnt offerings . So I will be faithful to reward them and make an eternal covenant with them. ”
CJB	Isaiah	61	9	Their descendants will be known among the nations , their offspring among the peoples ; all who see them will acknowledge that they are the seed Adonai has blessed .
CJB	Isaiah	61	10	I am so joyful in Adonai ! My soul rejoices in my God , for he has clothed me in salvation , dressed me with a robe of triumph , like a bridegroom wearing a festive turban , like a bride adorned with her jewels .
CJB	Isaiah	61	11	For just as the earth brings forth its plants , or a garden makes its plants spring up , so Adonai , God , will cause victory and glory to spring up before all nations .
CJB	Isaiah	62	62	For Tziyon ’ s sake I will not be silent , for Yerushalayim ’ s sake I will not rest , until her vindication shines out brightly and her salvation like a blazing torch .
CJB	Isaiah	62	2	The nations will see your vindication and all kings your glory . Then you will be called by a new name which Adonai himself will pronounce .
CJB	Isaiah	62	3	You will be a glorious crown in the hand of Adonai , a royal diadem held by your God .
CJB	Isaiah	62	4	You will no longer be spoken of as ‘ Azuvah [ Abandoned ] or your land be spoken of as ‘ Sh ’ mamah [ Desolate ] ; rather , you will be called Heftzi-Vah [ My-Delight-Is-In-Her ] and your land Be ‘ ulah [ Married ] . For Adonai delights in you , and your land will be married —
CJB	Isaiah	62	5	as a young man marries a young woman , your sons will marry you ; as a bridegroom rejoices over the bride , your God will rejoice over you .
CJB	Isaiah	62	6	I have posted watchmen on your walls , Yerushalayim ; they will never fall silent , neither by day nor by night . You who call on Adonai , give yourselves no rest ;
CJB	Isaiah	62	7	and give him no rest till he restores Yerushalayim and makes it a praise on earth .
CJB	Isaiah	62	8	Adonai has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm : “ Never again will I give your grain to your enemies as food ; nor will strangers drink your wine , for which you worked so hard ;
CJB	Isaiah	62	9	but those who harvest the grain will eat it with praises to Adonai ; those who gathered the wine will drink it in the courtyards of my sanctuary. ”
CJB	Isaiah	62	10	Go on through , go on through the gates , clear the way for the people ! Build up a highway , build it up ! Clear away the stones ! Raise a banner for the peoples !
CJB	Isaiah	62	11	Adonai has proclaimed to the end of the earth , “ Say to the daughter of Tziyon , ‘ Here , your Salvation is coming ! Here , his reward is with him , and his recompense is before him. ’ ”
CJB	Isaiah	62	12	They will call them The Holy People , The Redeemed of Adonai . You will be called D ’ rushah [ Sought-After ] , ‘ Ir Lo Ne ‘ ezvah [ City-No-Longer-Abandoned ] .
CJB	Isaiah	63	63	Who is this , coming from Edom , from Botzrah with clothing stained crimson , so magnificently dressed , so stately in his great strength ? “ It is I , who speak victoriously , I , well able to save. ”
CJB	Isaiah	63	2	Why is your apparel red , your clothes like someone treading a winepress ?
CJB	Isaiah	63	3	“ I have trodden the winepress alone ; from the peoples , not one was with me . So I trod them in my anger , trampled them in my fury ; so their lifeblood spurted out on my clothing , and I have stained all my garments ;
CJB	Isaiah	63	4	for the day of vengeance that was in my heart and my year of redemption have come .
CJB	Isaiah	63	5	I looked , but there was no one to help , and I was appalled that no one upheld me . Therefore my own arm brought me salvation , and my own fury upheld me .
CJB	Isaiah	63	6	In my anger I trod down the peoples , made them drunk with my fury , then poured out their lifeblood on the earth. ”
CJB	Isaiah	63	7	I will recall the grace of Adonai and the praises of Adonai , because of all that Adonai has granted us and his great goodness toward the house of Isra ’ el , which he bestowed on them in keeping with his mercy , in keeping with the greatness of his grace .
CJB	Isaiah	63	8	For he said , “ They are indeed my people , children who are not disloyal. ” So he became their Savior .
CJB	Isaiah	63	9	In all their troubles he was troubled ; then the Angel of His Presence saved them ; in his love and pity he redeemed them . He had lifted them up and carried them throughout the days of old .
CJB	Isaiah	63	10	However , they rebelled , they grieved his Holy Spirit ; so he became their enemy and himself fought against them .
CJB	Isaiah	63	11	But then his people remembered the days of old , the days of Moshe : “ Where is he who brought them up from the sea with the shepherds of his flock ? Where is he who put his Holy Spirit right there among them ,
CJB	Isaiah	63	12	who caused his glorious arm to go at Moshe ’ s right hand ? He divided the water ahead of them , to make himself an eternal name ;
CJB	Isaiah	63	13	he led them through the deep like a sure-footed horse through the desert ;
CJB	Isaiah	63	14	like cattle going down into a valley the Spirit of Adonai had them rest . This is how you led your people , to make yourself a glorious name. ”
CJB	Isaiah	63	15	Look down from heaven ; and see from your holy , glorious dwelling . Where are your zeal and your mighty deeds , your inner concern and compassion ? Don ’ t hold back ,
CJB	Isaiah	63	16	for you are our father . Even if Avraham were not to know us , and Isra ’ el were not to acknowledge us , you , Adonai , are our father , Our Redeemer of Old is your name .
CJB	Isaiah	63	17	Adonai , why do you let us wander from your ways and harden our hearts , so that we do not fear you ? Return , for the sake of your servants , the tribes who are your possession .
CJB	Isaiah	63	18	Your holy people held your sanctuary such a short time , before our adversaries trampled it down .
CJB	Isaiah	63	19	For so long we have been like those you never ruled , like those who were not called by your name ! ( 64:1 ) We wish you would tear open heaven and come down , so the mountains would shake at your presence !

CJB	Isaiah	64	11	(
CJB	Isaiah	64	12	) Adonai , after all this , will you still hold back ? Will you still stay silent and punish us past endurance ?
CJB	Isaiah	65	65	“ I made myself accessible to those who didn ’ t ask for me , I let myself be found by those who didn ’ t seek me . I said , ‘ Here I am ! Here I am ! ’ to a nation not called by my name .
CJB	Isaiah	65	2	I spread out my hands all day long to a rebellious people who live in a way that is not good , who follow their own inclinations ;
CJB	Isaiah	65	3	a people who provoke me to my face all the time , sacrificing in gardens and burning incense on bricks .
CJB	Isaiah	65	4	They sit among the graves and spend the night in caverns ; they eat pig meat and their pots hold soup made from disgusting things .
CJB	Isaiah	65	5	They say , ‘ Keep your distance , don ’ t come near me , because I am holier than you. ’ These are smoke in my nose , a fire that burns all day !
CJB	Isaiah	65	6	See , it is written before me ; I will not be silent until I repay them ; I will repay them to the full ,
CJB	Isaiah	65	7	your own crimes and those of your ancestors together , ” says Adonai . “ They offered incense on the mountains and insulted me on the hills . First I will measure out their wages and then repay them in full. ”
CJB	Isaiah	65	8	Here is what Adonai says : “ As when juice is found in a cluster of grapes , and people say , ‘ Don ’ t destroy it , there is still some good in it , ’ so I will do likewise for the sake of my servants , and not destroy them all .
CJB	Isaiah	65	9	I will bring forth descendants from Ya ‘ akov , heirs of my mountains from Y ’ hudah ; my chosen ones will possess them , and my servants will live there .
CJB	Isaiah	65	10	The Sharon will be a pasture for flocks , the Akhor Valley a place for cattle to rest , for my people who have sought me .
CJB	Isaiah	65	11	“ But as for you who abandon Adonai , who forget my holy mountain , who prepare a table for a Gad , a god of luck , and fill bowls of mixed wine for Meni , a god of destiny —
CJB	Isaiah	65	12	I will destine you to the sword , you will all bow down to be slaughtered ; because when I called , you did not answer ; when I spoke , you did not hear , but did what was evil from my point of view and chose what did not please me. ”
CJB	Isaiah	65	13	Therefore this is what Adonai Elohim says : “ My servants will eat , while you go hungry ; my servants will drink , while you go thirsty . My servants will rejoice , while you will be ashamed .
CJB	Isaiah	65	14	Yes , my servants will sing for joy from their hearts , but you will cry out from the pain in your heart and howl from an anguished spirit .
CJB	Isaiah	65	15	My chosen will use your name as a curse — ‘ May Adonai Elohim strike you dead ! ’ But to his servants he will give another name .
CJB	Isaiah	65	16	Thus someone on earth who blesses himself will bless himself by the God of truth , and someone on earth who swears an oath will swear by the God of truth ; for past troubles will be forgotten , hidden from my eyes .
CJB	Isaiah	65	17	“ For , look ! I create new heavens and a new earth ; past things will not be remembered , they will no more come to mind .
CJB	Isaiah	65	18	So be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating ; for look ! I am making Yerushalayim a joy , and her people a delight .
CJB	Isaiah	65	19	I will rejoice in Yerushalayim and take joy in my people . The sound of weeping will no longer be heard in it , no longer the sound of crying .
CJB	Isaiah	65	20	No more will babies die in infancy , no more will an old man die short of his days — he who dies at a hundred will be thought young , and at less than a hundred thought cursed .
CJB	Isaiah	65	21	They will build houses and live in them , they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
CJB	Isaiah	65	22	They will not build and others live there , they will not plant and others eat ; for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree , and my chosen will themselves enjoy the use of what they make .
CJB	Isaiah	65	23	They will not toil in vain or raise children to be destroyed , for they are the seed blessed by Adonai ; and their offspring with them .
CJB	Isaiah	65	24	Before they call , I will answer ; while they are still speaking , I will hear .
CJB	Isaiah	65	25	The wolf and the lamb will feed together , and the lion eat straw like an ox ( but the serpent — its food will be dust ) . They will not hurt or destroy anywhere on my holy mountain , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	66	66	“ Heaven is my throne , ” says Adonai , “ and the earth is my footstool . What kind of house could you build for me ? What sort of place could you devise for my rest ?
CJB	Isaiah	66	2	Didn ’ t I myself make all these things ? This is how they all came to be , ” says Adonai . “ The kind of person on whom I look with favor is one with a poor and humble spirit , who trembles at my word .
CJB	Isaiah	66	3	Those others might as well kill a person as an ox , as well break a dog ’ s neck as sacrifice a lamb , as well offer pig ’ s blood as offer a grain offering , as well bless an idol as burn incense . Just as these have chosen their ways and enjoy their disgusting practices ,
CJB	Isaiah	66	4	so I will enjoy making fools of them , and bring on them the very things they fear . For when I called , no one answered ; when I spoke , they did not hear . Instead they did what was evil in my sight and chose what did not please me. ”
CJB	Isaiah	66	5	Hear the word of Adonai , you who tremble at his word : “ Your brothers , who hate you and reject you because of my name , have said : ‘ Let Adonai be glorified , so we can see your joy. ’ But they will be put to shame. ”
CJB	Isaiah	66	6	That uproar in the city , that sound from the temple , is the sound of Adonai repaying his foes what they deserve .
CJB	Isaiah	66	7	Before going into labor , she gave birth ; before her pains came , she delivered a male child .
CJB	Isaiah	66	8	Who ever heard of such a thing ? Who has ever seen such things ? Is a country born in one day ? Is a nation brought forth all at once ? For as soon as Tziyon went into labor , she brought forth her children .
CJB	Isaiah	66	9	“ Would I let the baby break through and not be born ? ” asks Adonai . “ Would I , who cause the birth , shut the womb ? ” asks your God .
CJB	Isaiah	66	10	Rejoice with Yerushalayim ! Be glad with her , all you who love her ! Rejoice , rejoice with her , all of you who mourned for her ;
CJB	Isaiah	66	11	so that you nurse and are satisfied by her comforting breast , drinking deeply and delighting in the overflow of her glory .
CJB	Isaiah	66	12	For Adonai says , “ I will spread shalom over her like a river , and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream ; you will nurse and be carried in her arm and cuddled in her lap .
CJB	Isaiah	66	13	Like someone comforted by his mother , I will comfort you ; in Yerushalayim you will be comforted. ”
CJB	Isaiah	66	14	Your heart will rejoice at the sight , your bodies will flourish like newly sprouted grass . It will be known that the hand of Adonai is with his servants ; but with his enemies , his fury .
CJB	Isaiah	66	15	For — look ! — Adonai will come in fire , and his chariots will be like the whirlwind , to render his anger furiously , his rebuke with blazing fire .
CJB	Isaiah	66	16	For Adonai will judge all humanity with fire and with the sword , and those slain by Adonai will be many .
CJB	Isaiah	66	17	“ Those who consecrate and purify themselves in order to enter the gardens , then follow the one who was already there , eating pig meat , reptiles and mice , will all be destroyed together , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	66	18	“ For I [ know ] their deeds and their thoughts . “ [ The time ] is coming when I will gather together all nations and languages . They will come and see my glory ,
CJB	Isaiah	66	19	and I will give them a sign . I will send some of their survivors to the nations of Tarshish , Pul , Lud ( these are archers ) , Tuval , Greece and more distant coasts , where they have neither heard of my fame nor seen my glory . They will proclaim my glory in these nations ;
CJB	Isaiah	66	20	and they will bring all your kinsmen out of all the nations as an offering to Adonai — on horses , in chariots , in wagons , on mules , on camels — to my holy mountain Yerushalayim , ” says Adonai , “ just as the people of Isra ’ el themselves bring their offerings in clean vessels to the house of Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	66	21	I will also take cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im from them , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	66	22	“ For just as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making will continue in my presence , ” says Adonai , “ so will your descendants and your name continue .
CJB	Isaiah	66	23	“ Every month on Rosh-Hodesh and every week on Shabbat , everyone living will come to worship in my presence , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Isaiah	66	24	“ As they leave , they will look on the corpses of the people who rebelled against me . For their worm will never die , and their fire will never be quenched ; but they will be abhorrent to all humanity. ” [ “ Every month on Rosh-Hodesh and every week on Shabbat , everyone living will come to worship in my presence , ” says Adonai . ]
CJB	Jeremiah	1	1	These are the words of Yirmeyahu the son of Hilkiyahu , one of the cohanim living in ‘ Anatot , in the territory of Binyamin .
CJB	Jeremiah	1	2	The word of Adonai came to him during the days of Yoshiyahu the son of Amon , king of Y ’ hudah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
CJB	Jeremiah	1	3	It also came during the days of Y ’ hoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu , king of Y ’ hudah , continuing until the eleventh year of Tzidkiyahu the son of Yoshiyahu , king of Y ’ hudah , right up until the time Yerushalayim was carried away captive , in the fifth month .
CJB	Jeremiah	1	4	Here is the word of Adonai that came to me :
CJB	Jeremiah	1	5	“ Before I formed you in the womb , I knew you ; before you were born , I separated you for myself . I have appointed you to be a prophet to the nations. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	1	6	I said , “ Oh , Adonai Elohim , I don ’ t even know how to speak ! I ’ m just a child ! ”
CJB	Jeremiah	1	7	But Adonai said to me , “ Don ’ t say , ‘ I ’ m just a child. ’ “ For you will go to whomever I send you , and you will speak whatever I order you .
CJB	Jeremiah	1	8	Do not be afraid of them , for I am with you , says Adonai , to rescue you. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	1	9	Then Adonai put out his hand and touched my mouth , and Adonai said to me , “ There ! I have put my words in your mouth .
CJB	Jeremiah	1	10	Today I have placed you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and to tear down , to destroy and to demolish , to build and to plant. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	1	11	The word of Adonai came to me , asking , “ Yirmeyahu , what do you see ? ” I answered , “ I see a branch from an almond tree [ a ] .
CJB	Jeremiah	1	12	Then Adonai said to me , “ You have seen well , because I am watching [ b ] to fulfill my word. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	1	13	A second time the word of Adonai came to me , asking , “ What do you see ? ” I answered , “ I see a caldron tilted away from the north , over a fire fanned by the wind. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	1	14	Then Adonai said to me , “ From the north calamity will boil over onto everyone living in the land ,
CJB	Jeremiah	1	15	because I will summon all the families in the kingdoms of the north , ” says Adonai , “ and they will come and sit , each one , on his throne at the entrance to the gates of Yerushalayim , opposite its walls , all the way around , and opposite all the cities of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Jeremiah	1	16	I will pronounce my judgments against them for all their wickedness in abandoning me , offering incense to other gods and worshipping what their own hands made .
CJB	Jeremiah	1	17	“ But you , dress for action ; stand up and tell them everything I order you to say . When you confront them , don ’ t break down ; or I will break you down in front of them !
CJB	Jeremiah	1	18	For today , you see , I have made you into a fortified city , a pillar of iron , a wall of bronze against the whole land — against the kings of Y ’ hudah , against its princes , against its cohanim and the people of the land .
CJB	Jeremiah	1	19	They will fight against you , but they will not overcome you , for I am with you , ” says Adonai , “ to rescue you. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 1:11 Hebrew : shaked - Jeremiah 1:12 Hebrew : shoked
CJB	Jeremiah	2	2	“ Go and shout in the ears of Yerushalayim that this is what Adonai says : ‘ I remember your devotion when you were young ; how , as a bride , you loved me ; how you followed me through the desert , through a land not sown .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	3	“ ‘ Isra ’ el is set aside for Adonai , the firstfruits of his harvest ; all who devour him will incur guilt ; evil will befall them , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	4	Hear the word of Adonai , house of Ya ‘ akov and all families in the house of Isra ’ el ;
CJB	Jeremiah	2	5	here is what Adonai says : “ What did your ancestors find wrong with me to make them go so far away from me , to make them go after nothings and become themselves nothings ?
CJB	Jeremiah	2	6	They didn ’ t ask , ‘ Where is Adonai , who brought us out of the land of Egypt , who led us through the desert , through a land of wastes and ravines , through a land of drought and death-dark shadows , through a land where no one travels and where no one ever lived ? ’
CJB	Jeremiah	2	7	I brought you into a fertile land to enjoy its fruit and all its good things ; but when you entered , you defiled my land and made my heritage loathsome .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	8	The cohanim didn ’ t ask , ‘ Where is Adonai ? ’ Those who deal with the Torah did not know me , the people ’ s shepherds rebelled against me ; the prophets prophesied by Ba ‘ al and went after things of no value .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	9	“ So again I state my case against you , ” says Adonai , “ and state it against your grandchildren too .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	10	Cross to the coasts of the Kitti ’ im and look ; send to Kedar and observe closely ; see if anything like this has happened before :
CJB	Jeremiah	2	11	has a nation ever exchanged its gods ( and theirs are not gods at all ! ) ? Yet my people have exchanged their Glory for something without value .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	12	Be aghast at this , you heavens ! Shudder in absolute horror ! ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	13	“ For my people have committed two evils : they have abandoned me , the fountain of living water , and dug themselves cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water !
CJB	Jeremiah	2	14	“ Is Isra ’ el a slave , born into serfdom ? If not , why has he become plunder ?
CJB	Jeremiah	2	15	The young lions are roaring at him — how loudly they are roaring ! They desolate his country , demolishing and depopulating his cities .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	16	The people of Nof and Tachpanches feed on the crown of your head .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	17	“ Haven ’ t you brought this on yourself by abandoning Adonai your God when he led you along the way ?
CJB	Jeremiah	2	18	If you go to Egypt , what ’ s in it for you ? Drinking water from the Nile ? If you go to Ashur , what ’ s in it for you ? Drinking water from the [ Euphrates ] River ?
CJB	Jeremiah	2	19	Your own wickedness will correct you , your own backslidings will convict you ; you will know and see how bad and bitter it was to abandon Adonai your God , and how fear of me is not in you , ” says Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	20	“ For long ago I broke your yoke ; when I snapped your chains , you said , ‘ I won ’ t sin. ’ Yet on every high hill , under every green tree , you sprawled and prostituted yourself .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	21	But I planted you as a choice vine of seed fully tested and true . How did you degenerate into a wild vine for me ?
CJB	Jeremiah	2	22	Even if you scrub yourself with soda and plenty of soap , the stain of your guilt is still there before me , ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	23	“ How can you say , ‘ I am not defiled , I have not pursued the ba ‘ alim ’ ? Look at your conduct in the valley , understand what you have done . You are a restive young female camel , running here and there ,
CJB	Jeremiah	2	24	wild , accustomed to the desert , sniffing the wind in her lust — who can control her when she ’ s in heat ? Males seeking her need not weary themselves , for at mating season they will find her .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	25	“ Stop before your shoes wear out , and your throat is dry from thirst ! But you say , ‘ No , it ’ s hopeless ! I love these strangers , and I ’ m going after them. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	2	26	Just as a thief is ashamed when caught , so is the house of Isra ’ el ashamed — they , their kings , their leaders , their cohanim and their prophets ,
CJB	Jeremiah	2	27	who say to a log , ‘ You are my father , ’ and to a stone , ‘ You gave us birth. ’ For they have turned their backs to me instead of their faces . But when trouble comes , they will plead , ‘ Rouse yourself and save us ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	2	28	Where are your gods that you made for yourselves ? Let them rouse themselves , if they can save you when trouble comes . Y ’ hudah , you have as many gods as you have cities !
CJB	Jeremiah	2	29	Why argue with me ? You have all rebelled against me ! ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	30	“ In vain have I struck down your people . They would not receive correction . Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a marauding lion .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	31	You of this generation , look at the word of Adonai : Have I been a desert to Isra ’ el ? or a land of oppressive darkness ? Why do my people say , ‘ We ’ re free to roam , we will no longer come to you ’ ?
CJB	Jeremiah	2	32	Does a girl forget her jewellery , or a bride her wedding sash ? Yet my people have forgotten me , days beyond numbering .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	33	You are so clever in your search for love that the worst of women can learn from you !
CJB	Jeremiah	2	34	Right there on your clothing is the blood of the innocent poor , although you never caught them breaking and entering . Yet concerning all these things ,
CJB	Jeremiah	2	35	you say , ‘ I am innocent ; surely he ’ s no longer angry at me. ’ Here , I am passing sentence on you , because you say , ‘ I have done nothing wrong. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	2	36	You cheapen yourself when you change course so often — you will be disappointed by Egypt too , just as you were disappointed by Ashur .
CJB	Jeremiah	2	37	Yes , you will leave him too , with your hands on your heads [ in shame ] . For Adonai rejects those in whom you trust ; from them you will gain nothing . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	3	3	For this reason the showers have been withheld , there has been no rain in the spring ; still you maintain a whore ’ s brazen look and refuse to be ashamed .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	2	“ Raise your eyes to the bare hills , take a look : where have you not had sex ? You sat by the roadsides waiting for them like a nomad in the desert . You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	4	Didn ’ t you just now cry to me , ‘ My father , you are my friend from my youth ’ ? —
CJB	Jeremiah	3	5	[ thinking , ] ‘ He won ’ t bear a grudge forever , will he ? He wouldn ’ t maintain it right to the end. ’ You say this , but you keep doing evil things , you just do whatever you want. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	3	6	In the days of Yoshiyahu the king , Adonai asked me , “ Have you seen the things that backsliding Isra ’ el has been doing ? She goes up on every bare hill and under every green tree and prostitutes herself there .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	7	I said that after she had done all these things , she would return to me ; but she hasn ’ t returned . Meanwhile , her unfaithful sister Y ’ hudah has been watching .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	8	I saw that even though backsliding Isra ’ el had committed adultery , so that I had sent her away and given her a divorce document , unfaithful Y ’ hudah her sister was not moved to fear — instead she too went and prostituted herself .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	9	The ease with which Isra ’ el prostituted herself defiled the land , as she committed adultery with stones and with logs .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	10	Yet in spite of all this , her unfaithful sister Y ’ hudah has not returned to me wholeheartedly ; she only makes a pretense of it , ” said Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	11	Then Adonai said to me , “ Backsliding Isra ’ el has proved herself more righteous than unfaithful Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	12	Go and proclaim these words toward the north : ‘ “ Return , backsliding Isra ’ el , ” says Adonai . “ I will not frown on you , for I am merciful , ” says Adonai . “ I will not bear a grudge forever .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	13	Only acknowledge your guilt , that you have committed crimes against Adonai your God , that you were promiscuous with strangers under every green tree , and that you have not paid attention to my voice , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	14	“ Return , backsliding children , ” says Adonai ; “ for I am your master . I will take you , one from a city , two from a family , and bring you to Tziyon .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	15	I will give you shepherds after my own heart , and they will feed you with knowledge and understanding .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	16	“ ‘ “ And , ” says Adonai , “ in those days , when your numbers have increased in the land , people will no longer talk about the ark for the covenant of Adonai — they won ’ t think about it , they won ’ t miss it , and they won ’ t make another one .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	17	When that time comes , they will call Yerushalayim the throne of Adonai . All the nations will be gathered there to the name of Adonai , to Yerushalayim . No longer will they live according to their stubbornly evil hearts .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	18	In those days , the house of Y ’ hudah will live together with the house of Isra ’ el ; they will come together from the lands in the north to the land I gave your ancestors as their heritage .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	19	“ ‘ “ I thought that I would like to put you among the sons [ with inheritance rights ] and give you a pleasant land , the best heritage of all the nations . I thought that you would call me ‘ My father ’ and never stop following me .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	20	But like a faithless woman who betrays her husband , you , house of Isra ’ el , have betrayed me , ” says Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	3	21	A sound is heard on the heights , the house of Isra ’ el crying , pleading for mercy , because they have perverted their way and forgotten Adonai their God .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	22	“ Return , backsliding children , and I will heal your backsliding. ” “ Here we are , we are coming to you , for you are Adonai our God .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	23	Indeed the hills have proved a delusion , likewise the orgies on the mountains . Truly the salvation of Isra ’ el is in Adonai our God .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	24	But from our youth the shameful thing [ idolatry ] has devoured the fruit of our ancestors ’ work , their flocks and herds , their sons and daughters .
CJB	Jeremiah	3	25	Let us lie down in our shame , let our disgrace cover us , for we have sinned against Adonai our God , both we and our ancestors , from our youth until today ; we have not paid attention to the voice of Adonai our God . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	4	“ People of Y ’ hudah and inhabitants of Yerushalayim , circumcise yourselves for Adonai , remove the foreskins of your heart ! Otherwise my fury will lash out like fire , burning so hot that no one can quench it , because of how evil your actions are .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	2	and if you will swear , ‘ As Adonai lives , ’ in truth , justice and righteousness ; then the nations will bless themselves by him , and in him will they glory. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	3	For here is what Adonai says to the people of Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim : “ Break up your ground that hasn ’ t been plowed , and do not sow among thorns. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	5	“ Announce in Y ’ hudah , proclaim in Yerushalayim ; say : ‘ Blow the shofar in the land ! ’ Shout the message aloud : ‘ Assemble ! Let us go to the fortified cities ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	4	6	Set up a signal toward Tziyon , head for cover without delay . For I will bring disaster from the north , yes , dire destruction .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	7	A lion has risen from his lair , a destroyer of nations has set out , left his own place to ruin your land , to demolish and depopulate your cities. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	8	So wrap yourselves in sackcloth , lament and wail , for Adonai ’ s fierce anger has not turned away from us .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	9	“ When that day comes , ” says Adonai , “ the king ’ s heart will fail him , likewise the princes ’ ; the cohanim will be appalled and the prophets stupefied. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	10	Then I said , “ Oh , Adonai Elohim ! Surely you have sadly deceived this people and Yerushalayim by saying , ‘ You will have peace , ’ when the sword is at our very throats ! ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	11	“ At that time it will be said of this people and of Yerushalayim : ‘ A scorching wind from the desert heights is sweeping down on my people. ’ It is not coming to winnow or cleanse ;
CJB	Jeremiah	4	12	this wind of mine is too strong for that . Now I will pass sentence on them. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	13	Here he comes , like the clouds , his chariots like the whirlwind , his horses faster than eagles ! Woe to us , we are doomed !
CJB	Jeremiah	4	14	Wash the evil from your heart , Yerushalayim , so that you can be saved . How long will you harbor within yourselves your evil thoughts ?
CJB	Jeremiah	4	15	For a voice is announcing the news from Dan , proclaiming disaster from the hills of Efrayim :
CJB	Jeremiah	4	16	“ Report it to the nations , proclaim about Yerushalayim : ‘ [ Enemies ] are coming from a distant country , watching and shouting their war cry against the cities of Y ’ hudah. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	4	17	Like guards in a field they surround her , because she has rebelled against me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	18	“ Your own ways and your actions have brought these things on yourselves . This is your wickedness , so bitter ! It has reached your very heart. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	19	My guts ! My guts ! I ’ m writhing in pain ! My heart ! It beats wildly — I can ’ t stay still ! — because I have heard the shofar sound ; it ’ s the call to war .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	20	The news is disaster after disaster ! All the land is ruined ! My tents are suddenly destroyed , my tent curtains in an instant .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	21	How long must I see that signal and hear the shofar sound ?
CJB	Jeremiah	4	22	“ It is because my people are foolish — they do not know me ; they are stupid children , without understanding , wise when doing evil ; but they don ’ t know how to do good. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	23	I looked at the land — it was unformed and void — and at the sky — it had no light .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	24	I looked at the mountains , and they shook — all the hills moved back and forth .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	25	I looked , and there was no human being ; all the birds in the air had fled .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	26	I looked , and the fertile fields were a desert , all the land ’ s cities were razed to the ground at the presence of Adonai , before his burning anger .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	27	For here is what Adonai says : “ The whole land will be desolate ( although I will not destroy it completely ) .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	28	Because of this , the land will mourn and the sky above be black ; for I have spoken , I have decided , I will not change my mind , I will not turn back. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	4	29	At the noise of the horsemen and archers , the entire city flees — some plunge into thickets ; others climb rocks ; all cities are deserted ; no one lives there .
CJB	Jeremiah	4	30	And you , who are doomed to be plundered , what do you mean by putting on crimson , decking yourselves with jewels and gold , enlarging your eyes with eye make-up ? You beautify yourself in vain — your lovers despise you , they seek your life !
CJB	Jeremiah	4	31	For I have heard a sound like a woman in labor , in anguish giving birth to her first child . It is the sound of the daughter of Tziyon gasping for breath as she spreads her hands : “ Woe to me ! Everything in me is so weary before the killers . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	5	5	I will go to the prominent men , and I will speak to them ; for they know the way of Adonai and the rulings of their God. ” But these had completely broken the yoke and torn the harness off .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	2	And though they say , ‘ As Adonai lives , ’ the fact is that they are swearing falsely. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	5	3	Adonai , your eyes look for truth . You struck them , but they weren ’ t affected ; you [ nearly ] destroyed them , but they refused correction . They made their faces harder than rock , refusing to repent .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	4	My reaction was , “ These must be the poor , the foolish , not knowing the way of Adonai or the rulings of their God .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	6	This is why a forest lion kills them , why a desert wolf can plunder them , why a leopard guards their cities — all who leave are torn to pieces — because their crimes are many , their backslidings keep increasing .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	7	“ Why should I forgive you ? Your people have abandoned me and sworn by non-gods . When I fed them to the full , they committed adultery , thronging to the brothels .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	8	They have become like well-fed horses , lusty stallions , each one neighing after his neighbor ’ s wife .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	9	Should I not punish for this ? ” asks Adonai . “ Should I not be avenged on a nation like this ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	5	10	Go through her rows [ of vines ] , and destroy them ( but don ’ t destroy them completely ) : strip away her branches , they do not belong to Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	11	“ For the house of Isra ’ el and the house of Y ’ hudah have thoroughly betrayed me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	12	They have denied Adonai , they have said , “ He won ’ t do anything , calamity will not strike us , we will see neither sword nor famine .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	13	The prophets are merely wind , they do not have the word ; the things that they are predicting will happen only to them. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	5	14	Therefore Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot says : “ Because you people speak this way , I will make my words fire in your mouth , [ Yirmeyahu , ] and this people wood ; so that it will devour them .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	15	I will bring on you , house of Isra ’ el , a distant nation , ” says Adonai , “ an enduring nation , an ancient nation , a nation whose language you do not know — you will not understand what they are saying .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	16	Their quiver is like an open grave , they are all mighty warriors .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	17	They will eat up your harvest and your bread , they will eat up your sons and your daughters , they will eat up your flocks and your herds , they will eat up your vines and your fig trees ; with the sword they will beat down your fortified cities , in which you trust .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	18	But even in those days , ” says Adonai , “ I will not completely destroy you .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	19	And when your people ask , ‘ Why has Adonai our God done all these things to us ? ’ you are to give them this answer : ‘ Just as you abandoned me and served strange gods in your own land , so likewise you will serve strangers in a land that is not your own. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	5	20	Announce this in the house of Ya ‘ akov , proclaim it in Y ’ hudah ; say :
CJB	Jeremiah	5	21	‘ Hear this , stupid , brainless people , who have eyes but do not see , who have ears but do not hear :
CJB	Jeremiah	5	22	Don ’ t you fear me ? — says Adonai . Won ’ t you tremble at my presence ? I made the shore the limit for the sea ; by eternal decree it can not pass . Its waves may toss , but to no avail ; although they roar , they can not cross it .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	23	But this people has a rebellious , defiant heart ; they have rebelled and gone !
CJB	Jeremiah	5	24	They don ’ t say to themselves , “ Let ’ s fear Adonai our God , who gives the fall and spring rains in season , who reserves us the weeks assigned for harvest. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	5	25	Your crimes have overturned nature ’ s rules , your sins have kept back good from you. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	5	26	“ For among my people there are wicked men , who , like fowlers , lie in wait and set traps to catch their fellow human beings .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	27	Their houses are as full of fraud as a cage full of birds . They grow rich and great ,
CJB	Jeremiah	5	28	sleek and bloated ; they excel in acts of wickedness but do not plead on behalf of the orphan , thus enabling his cause to succeed ; nor do they judge in favor of the poor .
CJB	Jeremiah	5	29	“ Should I not punish for this ? ” asks Adonai . “ Should I not be avenged on a nation like this ?
CJB	Jeremiah	5	30	A shocking and horrifying thing has happened in the land :
CJB	Jeremiah	5	31	The prophets prophesy lies , the cohanim obey the prophets , and my people love it that way . But what will you do at the end of it all ?
CJB	Jeremiah	6	6	For Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says this : “ Cut down her trees , and raise a siege-ramp against Yerushalayim ! This is the city to be punished ; in her there is nothing but oppression .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	2	Although she is beautiful and delicate , I am cutting off the daughter of Tziyon. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	6	3	Shepherds advance on her with their flocks ; all around her they pitch their tents , each grazing his own plot of pasture .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	4	“ Prepare for war against her ! Get up ! Let ’ s attack at noon ! ” “ Woe to us ! for the day is waning , evening shadows are lengthening. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	6	5	“ Get up ! Let ’ s attack at night ! Let ’ s destroy her palaces ! ”
CJB	Jeremiah	6	7	Just as a cistern keeps its water fresh , so she keeps her wickedness fresh ! Violence and destruction are heard within her , always before me sickness and wounds .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	8	Accept correction , Yerushalayim , or I will be estranged from you and turn you into a desolate waste , a land without inhabitants. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	6	9	Thus says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot : “ They will glean the remnant of Isra ’ el as thoroughly as in a vineyard — one last time , like a grape-picker , pass your hand over the vines. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	6	10	To whom should I speak ? Whom should I warn ? Who will listen to me ? Their ears are dull , they can ’ t pay attention . For them the word of Adonai has become unattractive , an object of scorn .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	11	This is why I am full of Adonai ’ s fury ; I am weary of holding it back . “ Pour it out on the children in the street and on the groups of young men gathered ; for husbands and wives will be taken together , seniors as well as the very old .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	12	Their homes will be turned over to others , their fields together with their wives . Yes , I will stretch out my hand against those who are living in the land , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	13	“ For from the least to the greatest of them , all are greedy for gains ; prophets and cohanim alike , they all practice fraud —
CJB	Jeremiah	6	14	they dress the wound of my people , but only superficially , saying , ‘ There is perfect shalom , ’ when there is no shalom .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	15	“ They should be ashamed of their detestable deeds , but they are not ashamed at all ; they don ’ t know how to blush . Therefore when others fall , they too will fall ; when I punish them , they will stumble , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	16	Here is what Adonai says : “ Stand at the crossroads and look ; ask about the ancient paths , ‘ Which one is the good way ? ’ Take it , and you will find rest for your souls . But they said , ‘ We will not take it. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	6	17	I appointed sentinels to direct them : ‘ Listen for the sound of the shofar. ’ But they said , ‘ We will not listen. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	6	18	So hear , you nations ; know , you assembly , what there is against them .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	19	Hear , oh earth ! I am going to bring disaster on this people ; it is the consequence of their own way of thinking ; for they pay no attention to my words ; and as for my Torah , they reject it .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	20	What do I care about incense from Sh ’ va or sweet cane from a distant land ? Your burnt offerings are unacceptable , your sacrifices don ’ t please me. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	6	21	Therefore thus says Adonai : “ I will put obstacles in the way of this people that they will stumble over — fathers and sons , neighbors and friends , all will perish together. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	6	22	Here is what Adonai says : “ A people is coming from the land of the north , a great nation will be aroused from the ends of the earth .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	23	They will take hold of bow and spear ; they are cruel ; they have no compassion : their noise as they ride on horses is like the roaring sea ; and they are equipped for battle against you , daughter of Tziyon .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	24	‘ We have heard the news , and our hands fall limp ; anguish has seized us , pain like a mother ’ s in childbirth. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	6	25	Don ’ t go into the countryside , don ’ t walk out on the road ; for the sword of the enemy is spreading terror in every direction .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	26	Daughter of my people , put on sackcloth , roll in ashes , mourn as if for an only son , wail most bitterly ; for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	27	“ I have made you a refiner and tester of my people , to know and test how they behave .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	28	All of them are total rebels , spreading slanderous gossip ; they are bronze and iron , [ inferior metals , ] all of them corrupt .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	29	The bellows blast away ; and though the lead is consumed by the fire , in vain has the smelter refined , for the wicked have not been separated .
CJB	Jeremiah	6	30	They are called ‘ rejected silver , ’ because Adonai has rejected them . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	7	7	then I will let you stay in this place , in the land I gave to your ancestors forever and ever .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	2	“ Stand at the gate of the house of Adonai and proclaim this word : ‘ Listen to the word of Adonai , all you from Y ’ hudah who enter these gates to worship Adonai !
CJB	Jeremiah	7	3	Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ Improve your ways and actions , and I will let you stay in this place .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	4	Don ’ t rely on that deceitful slogan , ‘ The temple of Adonai , the temple of Adonai — these [ buildings ] are the temple of Adonai. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	7	5	No , but if you really improve your ways and actions ; if you really administer justice between people ;
CJB	Jeremiah	7	6	if you stop oppressing foreigners , orphans and widows ; if you stop shedding innocent blood in this place ; and if you stop following other gods , to your own harm ;
CJB	Jeremiah	7	8	Look ! You are relying on deceitful words that can ’ t do you any good .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	9	First you steal , murder , commit adultery , swear falsely , offer to Ba ‘ al and go after other gods that you haven ’ t known .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	10	Then you come and stand before me in this house that bears my name and say , ‘ We are saved ’ — so that you can go on doing these abominations !
CJB	Jeremiah	7	11	Do you regard this house , which bears my name , as a cave for bandits ? I can see for myself what ’ s going on , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	12	“ Go to the place in Shiloh that used to be mine , that used to bear my name , and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Isra ’ el .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	13	I spoke to you again and again , but you wouldn ’ t listen . I called you , but you wouldn ’ t answer . Now , ” says Adonai , “ because you have done all these things ,
CJB	Jeremiah	7	14	I will do to the house that bears my name , on which you rely , and to the place I gave you and your ancestors , what I did to Shiloh ;
CJB	Jeremiah	7	15	and I will drive you out of my presence , just as I drove out all your kinsmen , all the descendants of Efrayim. ” ’
CJB	Jeremiah	7	16	“ So you , [ Yirmeyahu , ] don ’ t pray for this people ! Don ’ t cry , pray or intercede on their behalf with me ; because I won ’ t listen to you .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	17	Don ’ t you see what they are doing in the cities of Y ’ hudah and in the streets of Yerushalayim ?
CJB	Jeremiah	7	18	The children gather the wood , the fathers light the fire , and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven ; and , just to provoke me , they pour out drink offerings to other gods !
CJB	Jeremiah	7	19	Are they really provoking me , ” asks Adonai , “ or are they provoking themselves , to their own ruin ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	7	20	Therefore , here is what Adonai Elohim says : “ My anger and fury will be poured out on this place , on men , animals , trees in the fields and produce growing from the ground ; and it will burn without being quenched. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	7	21	Thus says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el : “ You may as well eat the meat of your burnt offerings along with that of your sacrifices .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	22	For I didn ’ t speak to your ancestors or give them orders concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices when I brought them out of the land of Egypt .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	23	Rather , what I did order them was this : ‘ Pay attention to what I say . Then I will be your God , and you will be my people . In everything , live according to the way that I order you , so that things will go well for you. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	7	24	But they neither listened nor paid attention , but lived according to their own plans , in the stubbornness of their evil hearts , thus going backward and not forward .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	25	You have done this from the day your ancestors came out of Egypt until today . Even though I sent you all my servants the prophets , sending them time after time ,
CJB	Jeremiah	7	26	they would not listen or pay attention to me , but stiffened their necks ; they did worse than their ancestors .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	27	So tell them all this ; but they won ’ t listen to you ; likewise , call to them ; but they won ’ t answer you .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	28	Therefore , say to them , ‘ This is the nation that has not listened to the voice of Adonai their God . They won ’ t take correction ; faithfulness has perished ; it has vanished from their mouths .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	29	Cut off your hair , and throw it away , take up a lament on the bare hills , for Adonai has rejected and abandoned the generation that rouses his anger. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	7	30	“ For the people of Y ’ hudah have done what is evil from my perspective , ” says Adonai ; “ they have set up their detestable things in the house which bears my name , to defile it .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	31	They have built the high places of Tofet in the Ben-Hinnom Valley , to burn their sons and daughters in the fire , something I never ordered ; in fact , such a thing never even entered my mind !
CJB	Jeremiah	7	32	Therefore , the days are coming , ” says Adonai , “ when it will no longer be called either Tofet or the Ben-Hinnom Valley , but the Valley of Slaughter — they will put the dead in Tofet , because there will be no space left [ anywhere else ] .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	33	The corpses of this people will become food for the birds in the air and the wild animals ; no one will frighten them away .
CJB	Jeremiah	7	34	Then in the cities of Y ’ hudah and the streets of Yerushalayim I will silence the sounds of joy and gladness and the voices of bridegroom and bride ; because the land will be reduced to ruins .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	8	“ ‘ How can you say , “ We are wise ; Adonai ’ s Torah is with us , ” when in fact the lying pen of the scribes has turned it into falsehood ?
CJB	Jeremiah	8	2	They will spread them out , exposed to the sun , the moon and the entire army of heaven , whom they loved , served , walked after , sought after and worshipped . The bones will not be collected or reburied but will be left lying on the ground like dung .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	3	All the survivors of this evil family who remain wherever I have driven them will prefer death to life , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	4	“ You are to tell them that Adonai says : ‘ If a person falls , doesn ’ t he get up again ? If someone goes astray , doesn ’ t he turn back ?
CJB	Jeremiah	8	5	Why do these people keep backsliding ? Why is their backsliding so persistent ? They cling to deceit and refuse to return !
CJB	Jeremiah	8	6	I listened attentively but they spoke nothing right . No one repents of his wickedness , saying , “ What have I done ! ” Each runs off in his own direction , like a horse plunging headlong into battle .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	7	Storks in the sky know their seasons ; doves , swallows and cranes their migration times ; but my people do not know the rulings of Adonai !
CJB	Jeremiah	8	9	The wise are put to shame , alarmed , entrapped . They have rejected the word of Adonai , so what wisdom do they have ?
CJB	Jeremiah	8	10	“ ‘ Therefore I will give their wives to others , and their fields to those who take them over ; for from the least to the greatest , all are greedy for gains ; prophets and cohanim alike all practice fraud —
CJB	Jeremiah	8	11	they dress the wound of the daughter of my people , but only superficially , saying , “ There is perfect shalom , ” when there is no shalom .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	12	They should be ashamed of their detestable deeds , but they are not ashamed at all , they don ’ t know how to blush . So when others fall , they too will fall ; when I punish them , they will stumble , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	13	“ ‘ I will put an end to them , ’ says Adonai . ‘ There are no grapes on the vine , and no figs on the fig tree ; the leaf has withered ; and what I have given them will pass from their possession. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	8	14	“ Why are we sitting still ? Assemble ! Let ’ s enter the fortified cities and meet our doom there ! For Adonai our God has doomed us ; he has given us bitter water to drink , because we have sinned against Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	15	When we look for peace , nothing good comes ; when we seek a time of healing , instead there is terror. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	8	16	From Dan can be heard the snorting of his horses ; when his stallions neigh , the whole land trembles . For they come devouring the land and all in it , the city and those who dwell there .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	17	“ Yes , now I am sending snakes among you , vipers that no one can charm , and they will bite you , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	18	My grief has no cure , I am sick at heart .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	19	Listen to my people ’ s cry of distress out of a distant land : “ Is Adonai no longer in Tziyon ? Is her king no longer there ? ” “ Why do they provoke me with their idols and their futile foreign gods ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	8	20	“ The harvest has passed , the summer is over , and still we are not saved. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	8	21	The daughter of my people is broken , and it ’ s tearing me to pieces ; everything looks dark to me , horror seizes me .
CJB	Jeremiah	8	22	Has Gil ‘ ad exhausted its healing resin ? Is no physician there ? If there is , then why is the daughter of my people so slow to recover her health ?
CJB	Jeremiah	8	23	( 9:1 ) I wish my head were made of water and my eyes were a fountain of tears , so that I could cry day and night over the slain of the daughter of my people !

CJB	Jeremiah	10	10	But Adonai , God , is the true God , the living God , the everlasting king . At his anger , the earth trembles ; the nations can not endure his fury .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	2	Here is what Adonai says : “ Don ’ t learn the way of the Goyim , don ’ t be frightened by astrological signs , even if the Goyim are afraid of them ;
CJB	Jeremiah	10	3	for the customs of the peoples are nothing . They cut down a tree in the forest ; a craftsman works it with his axe ;
CJB	Jeremiah	10	4	they deck it with silver and gold . They fix it with hammer and nails , so that it won ’ t move .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	5	Like a scarecrow in a cucumber patch , it can not speak . It has to be carried , because it can not walk . Do not be afraid of it — it can do nothing bad ; likewise it is unable to do anything good ! ”
CJB	Jeremiah	10	6	There is no one like you , Adonai ! You are great , and your name is great and mighty .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	7	Who would not fear you , king of the nations ? For it is your due ! — since among all the wise of the nations and among all their royalty , there is no one like you .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	8	One and all they are boorish and stupid ; the teaching of their nothings is a piece of wood !
CJB	Jeremiah	10	9	Silver is beaten into plates , then imported from Tarshish . Gold from Ufaz is worked by a craftsman and shaped by the hands of a goldsmith . They are clothed in blue and purple , all the work of skillful men .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	11	“ This is what you must say to them : ‘ The gods that did not make heaven and earth will perish from earth and from under heaven. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	10	12	God made the earth by his power , established the world by his wisdom spread out the sky by his understanding .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	13	When he thunders , the waters in heaven roar , he raises clouds from the ends of the earth , he makes the lightning flash in the rain and brings the wind out from his storehouses .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	14	At this , everyone is proved stupid , ignorant , every goldsmith put to shame by his idol ! The figures he casts are a fraud ; there is no breath in them ;
CJB	Jeremiah	10	15	they are nothings , ridiculous objects ; when the day for their punishment comes , they will perish .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	16	Ya ‘ akov ’ s portion is not like these , for he is the one who formed all things . Isra ’ el is the tribe he claims as his heritage ; Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is his name .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	17	You who are living under the siege , gather your belongings off the ground ,
CJB	Jeremiah	10	18	for here is what Adonai says : “ At this time I am slinging away the inhabitants of the land ; I will distress them , so that they will feel it. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	10	19	Woe to me because of my wound ! My injury is incurable ! I used to say , “ It ’ s only an illness , and I can bear it. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	10	20	But now my tent is ruined , all its cords are severed ; my children have left me and are no more ; there is no one to set up my tent again , no one to raise its curtains .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	21	The shepherds have become stupid , they have not consulted Adonai . This is why they have not prospered , and all their flocks are scattered .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	22	Listen ! A noise ! It ’ s coming closer ! A great uproar from the land to the north , to make the cities of Y ’ hudah desolate , a place for jackals to live .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	23	Adonai , I know that the way of humans is not in their control , humans are not able to direct their steps as they walk .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	24	Adonai , correct me , but in moderation , not in your anger , or you ’ ll reduce me to nothing .
CJB	Jeremiah	10	25	Pour out your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you , also on the families that do not call on your name . For they have consumed Ya ‘ akov — consumed him and finished him off , and laid waste to his home .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	11	Therefore Adonai says , “ I am going to bring on them a disaster which they will not be able to escape ; and even if they cry to me , I will not listen to them .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	2	“ Listen to the words of this covenant ; then speak to the people of Y ’ hudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim ;
CJB	Jeremiah	11	3	tell them that Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ A curse on anyone who does not pay attention to the words of this covenant ,
CJB	Jeremiah	11	4	which I enjoined on your ancestors at the time that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , out of that iron-smelter . I said , “ Listen to my voice , and carry out all my orders ; then you will be my people , and I will be your God ;
CJB	Jeremiah	11	5	so that I can fulfill the oath that I swore to your ancestors , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as it is today. ” ’ ” Then I responded , “ Amen , Adonai. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	11	6	Adonai said to me , “ Proclaim all these words in the cities of Y ’ hudah and in the streets of Yerushalayim : ‘ Listen to the words of this covenant , and obey them .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	7	For I solemnly warned your ancestors at the time when I brought them out of the land of Egypt ; and until this day I have frequently warned them , “ Listen to my voice ! ”
CJB	Jeremiah	11	8	But they have not listened or paid attention ; instead , each one has lived according to the stubbornness of his own evil heart . For this reason I have brought upon them all the words of this covenant , which I ordered them to obey , but which they did not obey. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	11	9	Then Adonai said to me , “ The men of Y ’ hudah and the people living in Yerushalayim have formed a conspiracy .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	10	They have returned to the sins of their ancestors , who refused to hear my words , and they have gone after other gods to serve them . The house of Isra ’ el and the house of Y ’ hudah have broken my covenant which I made with their ancestors. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	11	12	Then the cities of Y ’ hudah and the people living in Yerushalayim will go and cry to the gods to whom they are making offerings ; but they will not save them at all in their time of trouble .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	13	For you have as many gods , Y ’ hudah , as you have towns ; and you have erected as many altars for sacrificing to that shameful thing , Ba ‘ al , as there are streets in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	14	“ So you , [ Yirmeyahu , ] don ’ t pray for this people ! Don ’ t cry or pray on their behalf , because I won ’ t listen to them when they cry to me because of their troubles .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	15	What right does my beloved have to be in my house , when she has behaved so shamelessly with so many ? Offerings of consecrated meat can no longer help , because it is when you are doing evil that you are happy. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	11	16	Adonai once called you an olive tree , beautiful , full of leaves and good fruit . Now with the roar of a violent storm , he has set it on fire ; and its branches will be consumed .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	17	For Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , who planted you , has decreed evil for you . “ It is because of the evil which the house of Isra ’ el and the house of Y ’ hudah did to themselves , provoking me with their offerings of incense to Ba ‘ al. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	11	18	Adonai made this known to me , and then I knew — you showed me what they were doing .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	19	But I was like a tame lamb led to be slaughtered ; I did not know that they were plotting schemes against me — “ Let ’ s destroy the tree with its fruit , we ’ ll cut him off from the land of the living , so that his name will be forgotten. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	11	20	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , righteous judge , tester of motives and thoughts , I have committed my cause to you ; so let me see your vengeance on them .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	21	Therefore , here is what Adonai says concerning the men from ‘ Anatot who seek your life and who tell you , “ Stop prophesying in the name of Adonai , or we will kill you ourselves ” —
CJB	Jeremiah	11	22	this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : “ I will punish them . Their young men will die by the sword , their sons and daughters will die by famine .
CJB	Jeremiah	11	23	None of them will remain , for I will bring disaster on the men from ‘ Anatot when the year comes for them to be punished . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	12	12	On all the desert ’ s bare hills plunderers have come ; yes , the sword of Adonai devours the land from one end to the other ; nothing alive is safe .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	2	You planted them , and they took root ; they grow , and they bear fruit . You are near in their mouths , though far from their hearts .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	3	But , Adonai , you know me and see me ; you test my devotion to you ; drag them away like sheep to be slaughtered , and set them apart for the day of slaughter .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	4	How long must the land mourn and the grass in all the fields wither ? The wild animals and birds are consumed because of the wickedness of those who live there ; for they say , “ He will not see how we end up. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	12	5	If racing men on foot exhausts you , how will you compete against horses ? You may feel secure in a land at peace , but how will you do in the Yarden ’ s thick brush ?
CJB	Jeremiah	12	6	For even your own brothers and your father ’ s family are betraying you ; they are in full cry after you . Despite all their nice speech , don ’ t believe them .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	7	“ I have abandoned my house , I have rejected my heritage , I have given my heart ’ s beloved over to the hands of her foes .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	8	For me , my heritage has become like a lion in the forest — she roared out against me ; so now I hate her .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	9	For me , my heritage is like a speckled bird of prey — other birds of prey surround her and attack her . Go , gather all the wild animals , and bring them to devour her .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	10	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard , they have trampled my plot of land , they have turned my desirable property into a desert waste .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	11	Yes , they have made it a waste ; wasted , it mourns to me ; the whole land is wasted , because nobody really cares. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	12	13	They sowed wheat and reaped thorns , they wore themselves out and gained nothing . So be ashamed of your [ tiny ] harvest , the result of Adonai ’ s fierce anger .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	14	Here is what Adonai says : “ As for all my evil neighbors who encroach on the heritage I gave to my people Isra ’ el as their possession , I will uproot them from their own land , and I will uproot Y ’ hudah from among them .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	15	Then , after I have uprooted them , I will take pity on them again and bring them back , each one to his inheritance , each one to his own land .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	16	Then , if they will carefully learn my people ’ s ways , swearing by my name , ‘ As Adonai lives , ’ just as they taught my people to swear by Ba ‘ al , they will be built up among my people .
CJB	Jeremiah	12	17	But if they refuse to listen , then I will uproot that nation , uproot and destroy it , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	13	you are to answer them , “ This is what Adonai says : ‘ I am going to fill all the inhabitants of this land — including the kings sitting on the throne of David , the cohanim , the prophets and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim — with drunkenness .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought a loincloth , as Adonai had said , and put it on .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	3	Then the word of Adonai came to me a second time :
CJB	Jeremiah	13	4	“ Take the loincloth you bought and are wearing , get up , go to Parah , and hide it there in a hole in the rock. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went and hid it in Parah , as Adonai had ordered me .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	6	A long time afterwards , Adonai said to me , “ Get up , go to Parah , and recover the loincloth I ordered you to hide there. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	13	7	So I went to Parah and dug up the loincloth ; but when I took it from the place where I had hidden it , I saw that it was ruined and useless for anything .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	8	Then the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Jeremiah	13	9	“ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ This is how I will ruin what makes Y ’ hudah so proud and Yerushalayim so very proud :
CJB	Jeremiah	13	10	I will ruin this evil people , who refuse to hear my words and live according to their own stubborn inclinations , who go after other gods to serve and worship them . They will be like this loincloth , which is useless for anything .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	11	For just as a loincloth clings to a man ’ s body , I made the whole house of Isra ’ el and the whole house of Y ’ hudah cling to me , ’ says Adonai , ‘ so that they could be my people , building me a name and becoming for me a source of praise and honor . But they would not listen .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	12	So you are to tell them , “ This is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ Every bottle is filled with wine. ’ ” Then when they ask you , “ Don ’ t we already know that every bottle is filled with wine ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	13	14	Then I will smash them one against another , even fathers and sons together , ’ says Adonai ‘ I will show neither pity nor compassion , but I will destroy them relentlessly. ’ ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	13	15	Listen and pay attention ; don ’ t be proud ! For Adonai has spoken .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	16	Give glory to Adonai your God before the darkness falls , before your feet stumble on the mountains in the twilight , and , while you are seeking light , he turns it into deathlike shadows and makes it completely dark .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	17	But if you will not hear this warning , I will weep secretly because of your pride ; my eyes will weep bitterly , streaming with tears , because Adonai ’ s flock is carried away captive .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	18	Tell the king and the queen mother , “ Come down from your thrones , for your magnificent crowns are falling from your heads. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities of the Negev are besieged , and no one can relieve them ; all of Y ’ hudah is carried into exile , completely swept into exile .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	20	Raise your eyes , and you will see them coming from the north . Where is the flock once entrusted to you , the sheep that were your pride ?
CJB	Jeremiah	13	21	When he sets over you as rulers those you trained to be allies , what will you say ? Won ’ t pains seize you like those of a woman in labor ?
CJB	Jeremiah	13	22	And if you ask yourself , “ Why have these things happened to me ? ” it is because of your many sins that your skirts are pulled up and you have been violated .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	23	Can an Ethiopian change his skin ? or a leopard its spots ? If they can , then you can do good , who are so accustomed to doing evil .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	24	“ So I will scatter them like chaff that flies away in the desert wind .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	25	This is what you get , ” says Adonai , “ the portion I measure out to you , because you have forgotten me and trusted in the lie .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	26	I myself will lift your skirts above your face , and your privates will be exposed .
CJB	Jeremiah	13	27	On the hills and in the fields , I have seen your abominations — your adulteries , your lustful neighings your shameless prostitution . Woe to you , Yerushalayim ! You refuse to be purified ! Won ’ t you ever allow it ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	14	14	Adonai replied , “ The prophets are prophesying lies in my name . I didn ’ t send them , order them or speak to them . They are prophesying false visions to you , worthless divinations , the delusions of their own minds .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	2	“ Y ’ hudah is mourning , her gates are languishing ; they sit on the ground in gloom ; Yerushalayim sends up a cry of anguish .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	3	Her nobles send their servants for water ; they go to the cisterns but find no water , so they return with empty jars . Ashamed and dismayed , they cover their heads .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	4	Because of the ground , which is cracked , since it has not rained in the land , the farmers are ashamed ; they cover their heads .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	5	The doe in the countryside , giving birth , abandons her young for lack of grass .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	6	The wild donkeys standing on the bare heights gasp for air like jackals ; their eyes grow dim from trying to spot any vegetation. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	14	7	Although our crimes witness against us , take action , Adonai , for your name ’ s sake ; for our backslidings are many ; we have sinned against you .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	8	You , hope of Isra ’ el , its savior in time of trouble , why should you be like a stranger in the land , like a traveler turning aside for the night ?
CJB	Jeremiah	14	9	Why should you be like a man in shock , like a champion unable to save ? You , Adonai , are right here with us ; we bear your name — don ’ t leave us !
CJB	Jeremiah	14	10	Here is what Adonai says to this people : “ They so love to wander , they don ’ t restrain their feet ; so Adonai does not want them . Now he will remember their crimes , and he will punish their sins. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	14	11	Then Adonai said to me , “ Don ’ t pray for this people or for their welfare .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	12	When they fast , I will not hear their cry ; when they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings , I will not accept them . Rather , I will destroy them with war , famine and disease. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	14	13	Then I said , “ Adonai , God ! The prophets are telling them , ‘ You won ’ t see war , and you won ’ t have famine ; but I will give you secure peace in this place. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	14	15	Therefore , ” Adonai says , “ concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name , whom I did not send , yet they say , ‘ There will be neither war nor famine in this land ’ — it will be war and famine that will destroy those prophets .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Yerushalayim because of the famine and war , with no one to bury them — them , or their wives , or their sons , or their daughters — because I will pour their own wickedness out upon them .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	17	You are to give them this message : ‘ Let my eyes stream with tears night and day , unceasingly , because the virgin daughter of my people has been severely broken ; she has been dealt a crushing blow .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go out in the field , I see those slain with the sword . If I enter the city , I see the victims of famine . Meanwhile , prophets and cohanim ply their trade in the land , knowing nothing. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	14	19	Have you rejected Y ’ hudah completely ? Is Tziyon loathsome to you ? Why have you struck us irreparably ? We looked for peace , but to no avail ; for a time of healing , but instead found terror !
CJB	Jeremiah	14	20	We confess our rebellion , Adonai , also the crimes of our ancestors ; yes , we have sinned against you .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	21	For your name ’ s sake , do not spurn us ; do not dishonor your glorious throne . Remember your covenant with us ; do not break it .
CJB	Jeremiah	14	22	Among the nations ’ idols , can any make it rain ? Can the skies , of themselves , send showers ? Aren ’ t you the one , Adonai , our God ? Don ’ t we look to you ? For you do all these things .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	15	Adonai , you know . Remember me , think of me , and take vengeance for me on my persecutors . Because you are patient , don ’ t banish me ; know that for your sake I suffer insults .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	2	And when they ask you where they should go , tell them that this is what Adonai says : ‘ Those destined for death — to death ! Those destined for the sword — to the sword ! Those destined for famine — to famine ! Those destined for captivity — to captivity ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	15	3	“ I will assign them four kinds [ of scourges ] , ” says Adonai , “ the sword to kill , dogs to drag away , birds in the air and wild animals to devour and destroy .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	4	I will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth , because of M ’ nasheh the son of Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah , because of what he did in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	5	“ Who will take pity on you , Yerushalayim ? Who will grieve for you ? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare ?
CJB	Jeremiah	15	6	You have rejected me , ” says Adonai . “ You are heading backward . So I am stretching out my hand against you ; tired of sparing you , I am destroying you .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	7	With a winnowing fork I am scattering them to the wind at the gates of the land ; I am bereaving them , destroying my people , because they will not return from their ways .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	8	Their widows increase in number more than the sand of the seas ; At midday I am bringing the destroyer on the mothers of young men , causing anguish and terror suddenly to fall upon her .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	9	The mother of seven sons grows faint , panting in despair ; her sun has gone down while it ’ s still daytime ; she is left disgraced and bewildered . And the rest of them I will give to the sword , to their enemies , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	10	Woe to me , mother , that you gave me birth , a man who is the object of strife and controversy throughout the land ! I neither lend nor borrow , yet all of them curse me .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	11	Adonai said , “ I promise to release you for good , I promise to make your enemies appeal to you when calamity and trouble come .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	12	“ Can iron break iron and bronze from the north ?
CJB	Jeremiah	15	13	I will give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder , and you will not be paid for them , because of all your sins throughout your territory ;
CJB	Jeremiah	15	14	and I will make you pass together with your enemies into a land you do not know . For my anger has become a blazing fire , and it will flare up against you. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	15	16	When I found your words , I devoured them ; your words made me glad , they gave me joy ; because , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , you had me bear your name .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	17	I have never kept company with merrymakers , I could not celebrate ; with your hand on me I sat by myself , for you filled me with indignation .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	18	Why is my pain unending , my wound incurable , refusing to be healed ? Will you be for me like a deceptive vadi , which is only sometimes filled with water ?
CJB	Jeremiah	15	19	This is Adonai ’ s answer : “ If you return — if I bring you back — you will stand before me . If you separate the precious from the base , you will be my spokesman . It will then be they who turn to you , not you who turn to them .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	20	Toward this people I will make you a fortified wall of bronze — they will fight against you but not prevail against you ; for I am with you to save you and rescue you , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	15	21	“ I will free you from the grasp of the wicked and redeem you from the clutches of the ruthless . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	16	16	“ ‘ Look , ’ says Adonai , ‘ I will send for many fishermen , and they will fish for them . Afterwards , I will send for many hunters ; and they will hunt them from every mountain and hill and out of caves in the rocks .
CJB	Jeremiah	16	2	“ You are not to marry or have sons and daughters in this place .
CJB	Jeremiah	16	3	For this is what Adonai says concerning the sons and daughters born here , as well as their mothers who gave birth to them and their fathers who conceived them in this land :
CJB	Jeremiah	16	4	‘ They will die terrible deaths without being mourned or buried ; they will be left on the ground like dung . They will die by the sword and by famine , and their corpses will be food for the birds in the air and the wild animals. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	16	5	“ For here is what Adonai says : ‘ Do not enter any house where there is mourning ; don ’ t lament them , and don ’ t grieve for them ; for I have removed my shalom from this people , as well as my grace and compassion , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	16	6	‘ Great and small alike will die in this land ; they will not be buried , people will not lament them ; nor will they cut their flesh or shave their heads for them .
CJB	Jeremiah	16	7	No one will prepare a meal for those in mourning , to comfort them for the dead ; and no one will give them a cup to drink , to console them for their father or mother. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	16	8	And you are not to go into any house where there is celebrating to sit with them , eating and drinking .
CJB	Jeremiah	16	9	For here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ In this place , while you are still alive , before your very eyes , I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bridegroom and bride. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	16	10	“ When you tell this people all that I have said , and they ask you , ‘ Why has Adonai decreed all this terrible disaster against us ? What is our iniquity , what is our sin , that we have committed against Adonai our God ? ’
CJB	Jeremiah	16	11	then you are to say to them , ‘ It is because your ancestors abandoned me , says Adonai , and went after other gods , serving and worshipping them , but abandoned me and did not keep my Torah .
CJB	Jeremiah	16	12	And you have done worse than your ancestors , for — look ! — each of you lives according to the stubbornness of his own evil heart , so that you don ’ t listen to me .
CJB	Jeremiah	16	13	Therefore I am thrusting you out of this land into a land you have not known , neither you nor your ancestors ; and there you will serve other gods day and night ; for I will show you no favor. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	16	14	“ ‘ Therefore , ’ says Adonai , ‘ the day will come when people will no longer swear , “ As Adonai lives , who brought the people of Isra ’ el out of the land of Egypt , ”
CJB	Jeremiah	16	15	but , “ As Adonai lives , who brought the people of Isra ’ el out of the land to the north and out of all the countries where he drove them ” ; for I will bring them back to their own land , which I gave to their ancestors .
CJB	Jeremiah	16	17	For I see all their ways ; they are not hidden from me ; their crimes are not concealed from my eyes .
CJB	Jeremiah	16	18	First , I will pay them back double for their crimes and sins ; because they have defiled the land which is mine ; they have filled my heritage with the corpses of their horrors and abominations. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	16	19	Adonai , my strength , my fortress , my refuge in time of trouble , the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth , saying , “ Our ancestors inherited nothing but lies , futile idols , completely useless. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	16	20	Can a person make himself gods ? ( In fact they aren ’ t gods at all . )
CJB	Jeremiah	16	21	“ Therefore , I will make them know , once and for all , I will make them know my power and my might . Then they will know that my name is Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	17	So do not be my ruin , you , my refuge on the day of disaster .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	2	As they remember their children , so they remember their altars and their sacred poles by the green trees on the high hills .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	3	My mountain in the field , your wealth and all your treasures will be plundered ; because of the sin of your high places throughout your territory .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	4	You will relinquish your hold on your heritage which I gave you . I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know . For you have kindled my fiery anger , and it will burn forever. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	17	5	Here is what Adonai says : “ A curse on the person who trusts in humans , who relies on merely human strength , whose heart turns away from Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	6	He will be like a tamarisk in the ‘ Aravah — when relief comes , it is unaffected ; for it lives in the sun-baked desert , in salty , uninhabited land .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	7	Blessed is the man who trusts in Adonai ; Adonai will be his security .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	8	He will be like a tree planted near water ; it spreads out its roots by the river ; it does not notice when heat comes ; and its foliage is luxuriant ; it is not anxious in a year of drought but keeps on yielding fruit .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	9	“ The heart is more deceitful than anything else and mortally sick . Who can fathom it ?
CJB	Jeremiah	17	10	I , Adonai , search the heart ; I test inner motivations ; in order to give to everyone what his actions and conduct deserve. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	17	11	A partridge hatches eggs it did not lay ; like this are those who get rich unjustly : in the prime of life their wealth will desert them ; in the end they will prove to be fools .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	12	Throne of Glory , exalted from the beginning ! Our Holy Sanctuary ,
CJB	Jeremiah	17	13	Hope of Isra ’ el , Adonai ! All who abandon you will be ashamed , those who leave you will be inscribed in the dust , because they have abandoned Adonai , the source of living water .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	14	Heal me , Adonai , and I will be healed ; save me , and I will be saved , for you are my praise .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	15	They keep asking me , “ Where is the word of Adonai ? Let it come now. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	17	16	As for me , I have not run away from being a shepherd who follows you ; you know I didn ’ t want this fatal day ; what came from my lips has been clear to you .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	18	Let my persecutors be ashamed , not me ; let them be terrified , not me . Bring on them the day of disaster , destroy them with double destruction .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	19	Then Adonai said this to me : “ Go , and stand at the People ’ s Gate , where the kings of Y ’ hudah go in and out , and at all the gates of Yerushalayim ;
CJB	Jeremiah	17	20	and say to them : ‘ Kings of Y ’ hudah , all Y ’ hudah and all living in Yerushalayim who enter through these gates , hear the word of Adonai !
CJB	Jeremiah	17	21	Here is what Adonai says : “ If you value your lives , don ’ t carry anything on Shabbat or bring it in through the gates of Yerushalayim ;
CJB	Jeremiah	17	22	don ’ t carry anything out of your houses on Shabbat ; and don ’ t do any work . Instead , make Shabbat a holy day . I ordered your ancestors to do this ,
CJB	Jeremiah	17	23	but they neither listened nor paid attention ; rather , they stiffened their necks , so that they wouldn ’ t have to hear or receive instruction .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	24	However , if you will pay careful heed to me , ” says Adonai “ and carry nothing through the gates of this city on Shabbat , but instead make Shabbat a day which is holy and not for doing work ;
CJB	Jeremiah	17	25	then kings and princes occupying the throne of David will enter through the gates of this city , riding in chariots and on horses . They , their princes , the people of Y ’ hudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim will enter ; and this city will be inhabited forever .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	26	They will come from the cities of Y ’ hudah , from the places surrounding Yerushalayim , from the land of Binyamin , from the Sh ’ felah , from the hills and from the Negev , bringing burnt offerings , sacrifices , grain offerings , frankincense and thanksgiving sacrifices to the house of Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	17	27	But if you will not obey me and make Shabbat a holy day and not carry loads through the gates of Yerushalayim on Shabbat , then I will set its gates on fire ; it will burn up the palaces of Yerushalayim and not be quenched . ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	18	18	Then they said , “ Let ’ s develop a plan for dealing with Yirmeyahu . Torah won ’ t be lost from the cohanim , or counsel from the wise , or words from the prophets . So come , let ’ s destroy him with slander ; and meanwhile , we won ’ t pay attention to anything he says. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	18	2	“ Get up , and go down to the potter ’ s house ; there I will tell you more. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	18	3	So I went down to the house of the potter ; and there he was , working at the wheels .
CJB	Jeremiah	18	4	Whenever a pot he made came out imperfect , the potter took the clay and made another pot with it , in whatever shape suited him .
CJB	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Jeremiah	18	6	“ House of Isra ’ el , can ’ t I deal with you as the potter deals with his clay ? — says Adonai . Look ! You , house of Isra ’ el , are the same in my hand as the clay in the potter ’ s hand .
CJB	Jeremiah	18	7	At one time , I may speak about uprooting , breaking down and destroying a nation or kingdom ;
CJB	Jeremiah	18	8	but if that nation turns from their evil , which prompted me to speak against it , then I relent concerning the disaster I had planned to inflict on it .
CJB	Jeremiah	18	9	Similarly , at another time , I may speak about building and planting a nation or kingdom ;
CJB	Jeremiah	18	10	but if it behaves wickedly from my perspective and doesn ’ t listen to what I say , then I change my mind and don ’ t do the good I said I would do that would have helped it .
CJB	Jeremiah	18	11	“ So now , tell the people of Y ’ hudah and those living in Yerushalayim that this is what Adonai says : ‘ I am designing disaster for you , working out my plan against you . Turn , each of you , from his evil ways ; improve your conduct and actions. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	18	12	“ But they will answer , ‘ It ’ s hopeless ! We will stick to our own plans ; each of us will stubbornly follow his own evil desires ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	18	13	“ Therefore , Adonai says this : ‘ Ask among the nations who has heard anything like this . The virgin Isra ’ el has done a most horrible thing .
CJB	Jeremiah	18	14	Does the snow of the L ’ vanon disappear from the mountain crags ? Do the cold waters of foreign lands ever run dry ?
CJB	Jeremiah	18	15	No , but my people have forgotten me and offer incense to nothings . This causes them to stumble as they walk the ancient paths ; they leave the highway to walk on side-trails .
CJB	Jeremiah	18	16	Thus they make their land an object of horror and ongoing ridicule . Passers-by shake their heads , appalled , every one .
CJB	Jeremiah	18	17	Like a strong east wind , I will scatter them before the enemy . I will see their back , not their face , on their day of disaster. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	18	19	Pay attention to me , Adonai ! Listen to what my opponents are saying !
CJB	Jeremiah	18	20	Is good to be repaid with evil ? For they have dug a pit [ to trap ] me . Remember how I stood before you and spoke well of them , in order to turn your anger away from them ?
CJB	Jeremiah	18	21	Therefore , hand their sons over to famine , hurl them into the power of the sword , let their wives be made childless and widows , let their husbands be slain by disease , let their young men be slain by the sword in battle ,
CJB	Jeremiah	18	22	let screams be heard from their houses when you bring raiders on them without warning . For they have dug a pit to catch me and have laid snares for my feet .
CJB	Jeremiah	18	23	Nevertheless , Adonai , you know all their plans against me to stop me . Do not forgive their crime , do not blot out their sin from your sight ; but let them be made to stumble before you ; deal with them when you are angry .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	19	Adonai then said , “ Go ; buy a clay jar from the potter ; take some of the people ’ s leaders and some of the leading cohanim ;
CJB	Jeremiah	19	2	and go out into the Ben-Hinnom Valley , by the entry to the Potsherd Gate . There you are to proclaim the words I am about to tell you .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	3	Say : ‘ Hear the word of Adonai , kings of Y ’ hudah and inhabitants of Yerushalayim ! This is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ I am about to bring disaster on this place that will make the ears of whoever hears about it ring .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	4	This is because they have abandoned me and alienated this place . In it they have offered to other gods that neither they nor their ancestors have known , nor the kings of Y ’ hudah . They have filled this place with the blood of innocent people .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	5	They have built the high places of Ba ‘ al , in order to burn up their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Ba ‘ al — something I never ordered or said ; it never even entered my mind .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	6	“ ‘ “ Therefore the time is coming , ” says Adonai , “ when this place will no longer be called either Tofet or the Ben-Hinnom Valley , but the Valley of Slaughter .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	7	I will nullify the plans of Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim in this place . I will have them fall by the sword before their enemies and at the hand of those seeking their lives , and I will give their corpses as food for the birds in the air and the wild animals .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	8	I will make this city an object of horror and ridicule ; everyone passing by will be horrified and will ridicule it because of all its wounds .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	9	I will cause them to eat the flesh of their own sons and daughters ; everyone will be eating the flesh of his friends during the siege , because of the shortage imposed on them by their enemies and those set on killing them. ” ’
CJB	Jeremiah	19	10	“ Then you are to smash the jar in front of the people who went with you ,
CJB	Jeremiah	19	11	and say to them , ‘ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says that this is how I will break this people and this city , just as one smashes a potter ’ s vessel beyond the possibility of repair . The dead will be buried in Tofet , because there will be no space left for burial [ anywhere else ] .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	12	That is what I will do to this place , ’ says Adonai ‘ and to its inhabitants ; I will make it like Tofet .
CJB	Jeremiah	19	13	The houses of Yerushalayim and those of the kings of Y ’ hudah will be defiled like this place Tofet — yes , all the houses on whose roofs they have offered to all the stars in heaven and poured out drink offerings to other gods. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	19	14	Then Yirmeyahu returned from Tofet , where Adonai had sent him to prophesy , stood in the courtyard of Adonai ’ s house and said to all the people ,
CJB	Jeremiah	19	15	“ This is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ I am bringing on this city and all its surrounding villages all the disaster I have pronounced against it ; because they have stiffened their necks and refused to pay attention to my words . ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	20	20	Now when the cohen Pash ’ chur son of Immer , chief official in the house of Adonai , heard Yirmeyahu prophesying these things ,
CJB	Jeremiah	20	2	he had him flogged and put him in the stocks at the Upper Binyamin Gate of the house of Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	3	The following morning , when Pash ’ chur led Yirmeyahu out of the stocks , Yirmeyahu said to him , “ Adonai no longer calls you Pash ’ chur but Magor-Missaviv [ terror on every side ] .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	4	For this is what Adonai says : ‘ I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends . They will fall by the sword of their enemies , while you watch . I will hand over all of Y ’ hudah to the king of Bavel , and he will carry them off captive to Bavel and put them to the sword .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	5	Moreover , I will hand over everything stored in this city , all its valuables , all its wealth , indeed all the treasures of the kings of Y ’ hudah , to their enemies , who will plunder them , take them and carry them to Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	6	And you , Pash ’ chur , along with your entire household , will go into captivity ; you will go to Bavel , where you will die and be buried — you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	20	7	You fooled me , Adonai ; I have been your dupe . You overpowered me , and you have prevailed . All day long I ’ m a laughingstock ; everyone makes fun of me .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	8	Whenever I speak , I have to cry out ; I shout , “ Violence ! ” and “ Destruction ! ” Thus the word of Adonai becomes for me the cause of reproach and derision all day !
CJB	Jeremiah	20	9	But if I say , “ I won ’ t think about him , I won ’ t speak in his name any more , ” then it seems as though a fire is burning in my heart , imprisoned in my bones ; I wear myself out trying to hold it in , but I just can ’ t do it .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	10	I have heard many whispering their plot : “ ‘ Terror in every direction ’ ? Denounce him ! Let ’ s denounce him ! ” Even all my close friends are watching for me to make a false step — “ Maybe he can be tricked , then we ’ ll get the better of him , then we ’ ll take our revenge on him. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	20	11	But Adonai is with me like a dreaded warrior ; so my persecutors will stumble , defeated , greatly ashamed because of their failure ; their lasting disgrace will not be forgotten .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	12	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , you who test the righteous and see people ’ s hearts and thoughts , let me see you take vengeance on them , for I have committed my cause to you .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	13	Sing to Adonai ! Praise Adonai ! For he rescues those in need from the clutches of evildoers .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	14	A curse on the day I was born ! The day my mother gave birth to me — let it not be blessed !
CJB	Jeremiah	20	15	A curse on the man who brought the news to my father , “ A son has been born to you ! ” — thus making him very happy .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	16	Let that man be like the cities Adonai overthrew without mercy ! Let him hear cries of alarm in the morning and the sound of battle at noon ,
CJB	Jeremiah	20	17	because God did not put me to death in the womb and let my mother become my grave , her womb forever filled with me .
CJB	Jeremiah	20	18	Why did I have to emerge from the womb , just to see toil and sorrow , and end my days in shame ?
CJB	Jeremiah	21	21	This is the word that came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai when King Tzidkiyahu sent to him Pash ’ chur the son of Malkiyah and Tz ’ fanyah the son of Ma ‘ aseiyah with this message :
CJB	Jeremiah	21	2	“ Please consult Adonai for us , because N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel is making war on us . Maybe Adonai will perform a miracle for us and cause him to withdraw. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	21	3	Yirmeyahu answered them , “ Here is what you are to tell Tzidkiyahu :
CJB	Jeremiah	21	4	‘ This is what Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ I will make the weapons of war that you have in your hands ineffectual in your fight against the king of Bavel and the Kasdim who are outside the walls besieging you . Instead , I will gather them inside this city ;
CJB	Jeremiah	21	5	and I myself will fight against you with my hand stretched out and with a strong arm , in anger , rage and great fury .
CJB	Jeremiah	21	6	I will strike the inhabitants of this city , humans and animals alike , and they will die of a terrible plague .
CJB	Jeremiah	21	7	Afterwards , ” says Adonai “ I will hand over Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah , his servants , the people , and anyone remaining alive in this city after the plague , war and famine , to N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel and to their enemies , to those who seek their lives ; and he will put them to the sword . He will not spare them ; he will have no pity , no compassion. ” ’
CJB	Jeremiah	21	8	“ And here is what you are to tell this people : ‘ Adonai says : “ Look ! I am presenting you with the way of life and the way of death .
CJB	Jeremiah	21	9	Anyone who stays in this city will die by sword , famine and plague . But he who leaves and surrenders to the Kasdim besieging you will stay alive ; his own life will be his only ‘ spoils of war. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	21	10	For I have determined absolutely that this city will have evil , not good , ” says Adonai . “ It is going to be handed over to the king of Bavel , and he will burn it to the ground. ” ’
CJB	Jeremiah	21	11	“ To the royal house of Y ’ hudah say : ‘ Hear the word of Adonai ;
CJB	Jeremiah	21	12	house of David , this is what Adonai says : “ Judge fairly every morning , rescue the wronged from their oppressors ; or my fury will lash out like fire , burning so hot that no one can quench it , because of how evil your actions are. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	21	13	Adonai says , “ I am against you , [ Yerushalayim , ] situated in a valley like a rock on a plain . You who say , ‘ Who can come down against us ? Who can enter our lairs ? ’ —
CJB	Jeremiah	21	14	I will punish you , ” says Adonai , “ as your deeds deserve . I will set its forest on fire , and it will devour everything around it . ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	22	22	The wind will shepherd all your shepherds away , and your lovers will go into captivity . Then you will be ashamed and disgraced for all your wicked deeds .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	2	‘ King of Y ’ hudah occupying David ’ s throne , hear the word of Adonai — you , your servants and your people who enter through these gates .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	3	This is what Adonai says : “ Do what is right and just ; rescue the wronged from their oppressors ; do nothing wrong or violent to the stranger , orphan or widow ; don ’ t shed innocent blood in this place .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	4	“ ‘ “ If you are careful to do this , then future kings occupying David ’ s throne will enter these palace gates riding in chariots and on horses — he , his servants and his people .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	5	But if you will not pay attention to these words , then I swear by myself , ” says Adonai , “ that this palace will become a ruin. ” ’
CJB	Jeremiah	22	6	“ For here is what Adonai says concerning the palace of the king of Y ’ hudah : ‘ You are like Gil ‘ ad to me , like the peak of the L ’ vanon ; yet I will turn you into a desert , uninhabited cities .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	7	I will designate men to destroy you , each one with his weapons ; they will chop down your choice cedars and throw them in the fire. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	22	8	“ Many nations will pass by this city , and they will say to one another , ‘ Why has Adonai done such a thing to this great city ? ’
CJB	Jeremiah	22	9	The answer will be , ‘ Because they abandoned the covenant of Adonai their God and worshipped other gods , serving them. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	22	10	Do not weep for [ the king ] who has died , do not mourn for him [ Yoshiyahu ] . But weep for him who departs [ to Egypt ] , for he will never return or see his native land again .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	11	For this is what Adonai says about Shalum the son of Yoshiyahu , king of Y ’ hudah , who succeeded Yoshiyahu his father as king : “ He has left this place , never to return ;
CJB	Jeremiah	22	12	but he will die in the place where they have led him captive , without seeing this land again .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	13	“ Woe to him who builds his palace unfairly , its upper rooms by injustice ; who makes his neighbor work for free and will not give him his wages ;
CJB	Jeremiah	22	14	who says , ‘ I will build me a spacious palace with airy upper rooms , ’ then makes windows and cedar panels painted with vermilion !
CJB	Jeremiah	22	15	Your cedar may be excellent , but that doesn ’ t make you a better king . True , your father ate and drank , but he also did what was right and just , so things went well with him .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	16	He upheld the cause of the poor and the weak , so everything went well . Isn ’ t that what knowing me is all about ? ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	17	“ In contrast , your eyes and heart are controlled entirely by your greed , your desire for shedding innocent blood , oppressing and extorting. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	22	18	Therefore here is what Adonai says concerning Y ’ hoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu , king of Y ’ hudah : “ There will be no one to mourn for him , ‘ Oh ! My brother ! ’ or ‘ Oh ! My sister ! ’ There will be no one to mourn for him , ‘ Oh ! My master ! ’ or ‘ Oh ! His glory ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	22	19	He will be given a donkey ’ s ‘ burial ’ — dragged out the gates of Yerushalayim and thrown away [ to rot ] .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	20	Climb up to the L ’ vanon and cry out , raise your voice in Bashan , cry out from ‘ Avarim , for all your lovers are broken .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	21	I spoke to you in your times of prosperity , but you said , ‘ I won ’ t listen. ’ This has been your pattern since you were young — you pay no attention to what I say .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	23	You who live in the L ’ vanon , nesting in the cedars , how gracious will you be when pains come on you like a woman in labor ?
CJB	Jeremiah	22	24	“ As I live , ” says Adonai , “ even if Koniyahu the son of Y ’ hoyakim king of Y ’ hudah were the signet ring on my right hand , I would pull you off
CJB	Jeremiah	22	25	and hand you over to those who seek your life , to those you fear , N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel and the Kasdim .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	26	I will hurl you and the mother who gave birth to you into a country different from the one you were born in , and you will die there .
CJB	Jeremiah	22	27	They will not return to the country to which they long to return. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	22	28	Is this man Koniyahu a despised , broken pot , an instrument nobody wants ? Why are they being thrown out ? Why are he and his offspring thrown out into a country they do not know ?
CJB	Jeremiah	22	29	Oh , land , land , land ! Hear the word of Adonai !
CJB	Jeremiah	22	30	This what Adonai says : “ List this man as childless ; he is a lifetime failure — none of his offspring will succeed , none will sit on David ’ s throne or rule again in Y ’ hudah . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	23	23	Am I God only when near , ” asks Adonai , “ and not when far away ?
CJB	Jeremiah	23	2	Therefore this is what Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , says against the shepherds who shepherd my people : “ You have scattered my flock , driven them away and not taken care of them . So I will ‘ take care of ’ you because of your evil deeds , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	3	“ I myself will gather what remains of my flock from all the countries where I have driven them and bring them back to their homes , and they will be fruitful and increase their numbers .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	4	I will appoint shepherds over them who will shepherd them ; then they will no longer be afraid or disgraced ; and none will be missing , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	5	“ The days are coming , ” says Adonai when I will raise a righteous Branch for David . He will reign as king and succeed , he will do what is just and right in the land .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	6	In his days Y ’ hudah will be saved , Isra ’ el will live in safety , and the name given to him will be Adonai Tzidkenu [ Adonai our righteousness ] .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	7	“ Therefore , ” says Adonai , “ the day will come when people no longer swear , ‘ As Adonai lives , who brought the people of Isra ’ el out of the land of Egypt , ’
CJB	Jeremiah	23	8	but , ‘ As Adonai lives , who brought the descendants of the house of Isra ’ el up from the land to the north ’ and from all the countries where I drove them . Then they will live in their own land. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	23	9	Concerning the prophets : My heart within me is broken , all my bones are shaking ; I am like a drunk , like a man overcome by wine , because of Adonai , because of his holy words .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	10	For the land is full of adulterers ; because of a curse the land is in mourning — the desert pastures have dried up . Their course is evil , their power misused .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	11	“ Both prophet and cohen are godless ; In my own house I find their wickedness , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	12	“ Therefore their way will be slippery for them ; they will be driven into darkness and fall there . For I will bring disaster upon them , their year of punishment , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	13	“ I have seen inappropriate conduct in the prophets of Shomron — they prophesied by Ba ‘ al and led my people Isra ’ el astray .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	14	But in the prophets of Yerushalayim I have seen a horrible thing — they commit adultery , live in lies , so encouraging evildoers that none returns from his sin . For me they have all become like S ’ dom , its inhabitants like ‘ Amora. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	23	15	Therefore , this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says concerning the prophets : “ I will feed them bitter wormwood and make them drink poisonous water , for ungodliness has spread through all the land from the prophets of Yerushalayim. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	23	16	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : “ Don ’ t listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you . They are making you act foolishly , telling you visions from their own minds and not from the mouth of Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	17	They keep reassuring those who despise me , ‘ Adonai says you will be safe and secure , ’ and saying to all living by their own stubborn hearts , ‘ Nothing bad will happen to you. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	23	18	But which of them has been present at the council of Adonai to see and hear his word ? Who has paid attention to his word enough to hear it ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	23	19	Look ! The storm of Adonai , bursting out in fury , a whirling storm , whirling down upon the heads of the wicked !
CJB	Jeremiah	23	20	Adonai ’ s anger will not abate till he fully accomplishes the purpose in his heart . In the acharit-hayamim , you will understand everything .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	21	“ I did not send these prophets ; yet they ran . I did not speak to them ; yet they prophesied .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	22	If they have been present at my council , they should let my people hear my words and turn them from their evil way and the evil of their actions .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	24	Can anyone hide in a place so secret that I won ’ t see him ? ” asks Adonai . Adonai says , “ Do I not fill heaven and earth ?
CJB	Jeremiah	23	25	“ I have heard what these prophets prophesying lies in my name are saying : ‘ I ’ ve had a dream ! I ’ ve had a dream ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	23	26	How long will this go on ? Is [ my word ] in the hearts of prophets who are prophesying lies , who are prophesying the deceit of their own minds ?
CJB	Jeremiah	23	27	With their dreams that they keep telling each other , they hope to cause my people to forget my name ; just as their ancestors forgot my name when they worshipped Ba ‘ al .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	28	“ If a prophet has a dream , let him tell it as a dream . But someone who has my word should speak my word faithfully . What do chaff and wheat have in common ? ” asks Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	29	“ Isn ’ t my word like fire , ” asks Adonai , “ like a hammer shattering rocks ?
CJB	Jeremiah	23	30	So , I am against the prophets , ” says Adonai , “ who steal my words from each other .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	31	Yes , I am against the prophets , ” says Adonai , “ who speak their own words , then add , ‘ He says. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	23	32	“ I am against those who concoct prophecies out of fake dreams , ” says Adonai . “ They tell them , and by their lies and arrogance they lead my people astray . I didn ’ t send them , I didn ’ t commission them , and they don ’ t do this people any good at all , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	33	“ When [ someone from ] this people , a prophet or a cohen asks you , ‘ What is the burden of Adonai ? ’ you are to answer them , ‘ What burden ? I am throwing you off , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	34	As for a prophet , cohen or [ someone else from ] this people who speaks about ‘ the burden of Adonai , ’ I will punish him and his household. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	23	35	So , when you speak with your neighbor or brother , ask , “ What answer has Adonai given ? ” or “ What has Adonai said ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	23	36	Don ’ t use the expression , “ burden of Adonai ” any more ; for every person ’ s own word will be his burden . Must you twist the words of the living God , of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , our God ?
CJB	Jeremiah	23	37	So , when speaking to a prophet , ask , “ What answer has Adonai given you ? ” or “ What did Adonai say ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	23	38	But if you talk about “ the burden of Adonai , ” then here is what Adonai says : “ Because you use this expression , ‘ the burden of Adonai , ’ after I have already sent you the order not to say , ‘ the burden of Adonai , ’
CJB	Jeremiah	23	39	I will lift you up , burden that you are , and throw you off , away from my presence — you and the city I gave you and your ancestors .
CJB	Jeremiah	23	40	Then I will subject you to everlasting disgrace — eternal , unforgettable shame . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	24	24	It was after N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel had carried Y ’ khanyahu the son of Y ’ hoyakim , king of Y ’ hudah , along with the leaders of Y ’ hudah , the artisans and the skilled workers into exile from Yerushalayim and brought them to Bavel , that Adonai gave me a vision . There , in front of the temple of Adonai , two baskets of figs were placed .
CJB	Jeremiah	24	2	One of the baskets had in it very good figs , like those that ripen first ; while the other basket had very bad figs , so bad that they were inedible .
CJB	Jeremiah	24	3	Then Adonai asked me , “ Yirmeyahu , what do you see ? ” I answered , “ Figs — the good figs are very good ; but the bad ones are very bad , so bad they are inedible. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	24	4	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Jeremiah	24	5	“ Here is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ I will regard the exiles from Y ’ hudah , whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Kasdim , as good , just as I do these good figs .
CJB	Jeremiah	24	6	“ ‘ I will look after them for their good , I will bring them back to this land ; I will build them up and not tear them down , plant them and not pull them up .
CJB	Jeremiah	24	7	I will give them a heart to know me that I am Adonai . They will be my people , and I will be their God ; for they will return to me with all their heart. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	24	8	“ But concerning the bad figs that are so bad as to be inedible , Adonai says : ‘ I will make Tzidkiyahu the king of Y ’ hudah and his leaders resemble them , likewise the rest of Yerushalayim remaining in this land and those living in the land of Egypt .
CJB	Jeremiah	24	9	Everywhere I drive them I will make them an object of horror , repulsive to all the kingdoms of the earth , a disgrace , a byword , a laughingstock and a curse ;
CJB	Jeremiah	24	10	and I will send sword , famine and plague among them until they have disappeared from the land I gave them and their ancestors . ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	25	25	all the kings of Zimri , of ‘ Eilam and of the Medes ;
CJB	Jeremiah	25	2	Yirmeyahu the prophet proclaimed it before all the people of Y ’ hudah and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim :
CJB	Jeremiah	25	3	“ For twenty-three years , since the thirteenth year of Yoshiyahu the son of Amon , king of Y ’ hudah , until today , the word of Adonai has come to me ; and I have proclaimed it to you on numerous occasions ; but you haven ’ t listened .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	4	Moreover , Adonai sent you all his servants the prophets — again , on numerous occasions — but you didn ’ t listen or pay attention .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	5	The message was always : ‘ Every one of you , turn back from his evil way , from the evil of your actions . Then you will live in the land Adonai gave you and your ancestors forever and ever .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	6	Don ’ t follow other gods by serving and worshipping them . “ Don ’ t provoke my anger with things your own hands have made ; then I will do you no harm .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	7	But you wouldn ’ t listen to me , ” says Adonai , “ so that you could provoke me with the products of your hands , to your own harm. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	25	8	“ Therefore , here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ Because you haven ’ t paid attention to what I ’ ve been saying ,
CJB	Jeremiah	25	9	I ’ m going to send for all the families of the north , ’ says Adonai , ‘ and for my servant N ’ vukhadretzar the king of Bavel , and bring them against this land , against its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations . I will completely destroy them , making them an object of horror and ridicule , a perpetual ruin .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	10	Moreover , I will silence among them the sounds of joy and gladness , the voices of bridegroom and bride , the grinding of millstones and the light of lamps .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	11	This entire land will become a ruin , a waste ; and these nations will serve the king of Bavel for seventy years .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	12	But when the seventy years are over , I will punish the king of Bavel and that nation for their sin , ’ says Adonai , ‘ and I will turn the land of the Kasdim into everlasting ruins .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	13	I will inflict on that land all my words that I have decreed against it , everything written in this book , in which Yirmeyahu has prophesied against all the nations .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	14	For they too will become slaves to many nations and to powerful kings ; I will pay them back according to their deeds and the work of their own hands. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	25	15	“ For here is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says to me : ‘ Take this cup of the wine of fury from my hand , and make all the nations where I am sending you drink it .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	16	They will drink , stagger to and fro and behave like crazy people because of the sword that I will send among them. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	25	17	Then I took the cup from Adonai ’ s hand and made all the nations drink , where Adonai had sent me —
CJB	Jeremiah	25	18	Yerushalayim and the cities of Y ’ hudah , along with their kings and leaders , to make them a ruin and an object of horror , ridicule and cursing , as it is today ;
CJB	Jeremiah	25	19	Pharaoh king of Egypt , with his servants and leaders and all his people , both native
CJB	Jeremiah	25	20	and foreign ; all the kings of the land of ‘ Utz ; all the kings of the land of the P ’ lishtim , Ashkelon , ‘ Azah , ‘ Ekron and those remaining in Ashdod ;
CJB	Jeremiah	25	21	Edom , Mo ’ av , and the people of ‘ Amon ;
CJB	Jeremiah	25	22	all the kings of Tzor , of Tzidon and of the coastlands across the sea ;
CJB	Jeremiah	25	23	D ’ dan , Teima , Buz and all who cut the corners of their beards ;
CJB	Jeremiah	25	24	all the kings of Arabia and of the mixed peoples living in the desert ;
CJB	Jeremiah	25	26	and all the kings of the north , far and near , one after another — indeed , all the kingdoms of the world that there are on the surface of the earth . And the king of Sheshakh will drink last of all .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	27	“ You are to say to them , ‘ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : Drink until you ’ re so drunk that you throw up , fall down , and never get up again , because of the sword I am sending among you ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	25	28	If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink it , then say to them , ‘ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : You must drink !
CJB	Jeremiah	25	29	For , look ! — if I am bringing disaster on the city that bears my own name , do you expect to go unpunished ? Yes , I will summon a sword for all the inhabitants of the earth , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	30	“ As for you , [ Yirmeyahu , ] prophesy all these words against them ; say to them , ‘ Adonai is roaring from on high , raising his voice from his holy dwelling , roaring with might against his own habitation , shouting out loud , like those who tread grapes , against everyone living on earth .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	31	The sound resounds to the ends of the earth , for Adonai is indicting the nations , about to pass judgment on all humankind ; the wicked he has handed over to the sword , ’ says Adonai. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	25	32	Thus says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot : “ Disaster is spreading from nation to nation , a mighty tempest is being unleashed from the farthest ends of the earth. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	25	33	On that day , those killed by Adonai will be strewn from one end of the earth to the other ; they will not be mourned or gathered or buried , but will lie on the ground like dung .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	34	“ Wail , shepherds ! Cry ! Wallow in the dust , you lords of the flock ! For the days for your slaughter have come . I will break you in pieces , and like a prized vase you will fall. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	25	35	The shepherds have no way to flee , the lords of the flock no way to escape .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	36	Hear the cry of the shepherds , the wails of the lords of the flock ! For Adonai is destroying their pasture ,
CJB	Jeremiah	25	37	the peaceful grazing grounds are silenced , because of Adonai ’ s fierce anger .
CJB	Jeremiah	25	38	Like a lion , he has abandoned his lair ; for their land has become desolate because of the oppressor ’ s fierce sword and because of Adonai ’ s fierce anger .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	26	At the beginning of the reign of Y ’ hoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu , king of Y ’ hudah , this word came from Adonai :
CJB	Jeremiah	26	2	“ Adonai says : ‘ Stand in the courtyard of Adonai ’ s house and speak to the people from all the cities in Y ’ hudah who come to worship at Adonai ’ s house ; say everything I order you to say to them , and don ’ t leave out a word .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	3	Maybe they will listen , and each of them turn from his evil way ; then I will be able to relent from the disaster I intend to bring on them because of how evil their deeds are .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	4	So tell them that this is what Adonai says : “ If you will not pay attention to me and live according to my Torah , which I have given you ,
CJB	Jeremiah	26	5	and listen to what my servants the prophets , whom I send to you , say — I have sent them frequently , but you haven ’ t listened —
CJB	Jeremiah	26	6	then I will make this house like Shiloh , and I will make this city an object of cursing for all the nations of the earth. ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	26	7	The cohanim , the prophets and all the people heard Yirmeyahu speaking these words in the house of Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	8	When Yirmeyahu had finished saying everything Adonai had ordered him to say to all the people , the cohanim , prophets and all the people seized him , shouting , “ You will die for this !
CJB	Jeremiah	26	9	Why have you prophesied in the name of Adonai , ‘ This house will become like Shiloh , ’ and , ‘ This city will become uninhabited ruins ’ ? ” The people all crowded in on Yirmeyahu in Adonai ’ s house .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	10	When the officials of Y ’ hudah heard about it , they came up from the king ’ s palace to Adonai ’ s house and sat at the entrance to the New Gate of Adonai ’ s house .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	11	The cohanim and prophets said to the officials and all the people , “ This man deserves a death sentence , because he has prophesied against this city ; you have heard it with your own ears. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	26	12	Then Yirmeyahu said to the officials and all the people , “ Adonai sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words you have heard .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	13	Therefore now , improve your ways and your doings ; and listen to the voice of Adonai your God ; then Adonai will relent from the disaster he has decreed against you .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	14	But as for me , here , I am in your hands ; do with me whatever seems good and right to you .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	15	Only know for certain that if you put me to death , you will bring innocent blood on yourselves , on this city and on its inhabitants ; because the fact is that Adonai sent me to you to speak all these words , so that you could hear them. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	26	16	The officials and all the people then said to the cohanim and prophets , “ This man does not deserve a death sentence , because he has spoken to us in the name of Adonai our God. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	26	17	At this point some of the leaders of the land stood up and addressed all the people assembled :
CJB	Jeremiah	26	18	“ Back in the time of Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah , Mikhah from Moreshet was a prophet . He told all the people of Y ’ hudah , ‘ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , “ Tziyon will be plowed under like a field , Yerushalayim will become heaps of ruins , and the mountain of the house like a forested height. ” ’
CJB	Jeremiah	26	19	“ Did Hizkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah and all Y ’ hudah put him to death ? Not at all . Rather , he feared Adonai , and prayed for Adonai ’ s favor ; and Adonai relented from the disaster he had pronounced against them . So [ if we put Yirmeyahu to death , ] we might bring great disaster on ourselves. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	26	20	On the other hand , there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Adonai , Uriyahu the son of Sh ’ ma ‘ yahu from Kiryat-Ye ‘ arim , who prophesied against this city and against this land exactly what Yirmeyahu is saying .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	21	When Y ’ hoyakim the king , with all his military men and other officials , heard what he was saying , the king wanted to have him killed . On hearing of this , Uriyahu became frightened , fled and went to Egypt .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	22	Y ’ hoyakim the king sent men to Egypt — Elnatan the son of ‘ Akhbor and some others .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	23	They brought Uriyahu back from Egypt and took him to Y ’ hoyakim the king , who put him to the sword and threw his corpse into the burial-ground of the common people .
CJB	Jeremiah	26	24	But in this situation concerning Yirmeyahu , Achikam the son of Shafan used his influence to help him , so that he was not handed over to the people to be put to death .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	27	At the beginning of the reign of Y ’ hoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu , king of Y ’ hudah , this word came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai :
CJB	Jeremiah	27	2	“ Adonai says this to me : ‘ Make yourself a yoke of straps and crossbars , and put it on your neck .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	3	Send [ similar yokes ] to the kings of Edom , of Mo ’ av , of the people of ‘ Amon , of Tzor , and of Tzidon by means of the envoys they send to Yerushalayim , and to Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	4	Give them this message for their masters by telling their envoys that Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says for them to tell their masters :
CJB	Jeremiah	27	5	“ ‘ “ I made the earth , humankind , and the animals on the earth by my great power and my outstretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	6	For now , I have given over all these lands to my servant N ’ vukhadnetzar the king of Bavel ; I have also given him the wild animals to serve him .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	7	All the nations will serve him , his son and his grandson , until his own country gets its turn — at which time many nations and great kings will make him their slave .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	8	The nation and kingdom that refuses to serve this N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel , that will not put their necks under the yoke of the king of Bavel , I will punish , ” says Adonai “ with sword , famine and plague , until I have put an end to them through him .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	9	“ ‘ “ You , therefore , don ’ t listen to your prophets , diviners , dreamers , magicians or sorcerers , when they tell you that you won ’ t be subject to the king of Bavel ;
CJB	Jeremiah	27	10	for they are prophesying lies to you that will result in your being removed far from your land , with my driving you out , so that you perish .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	11	But the nation that puts its neck under the yoke of the king of Bavel and serves him , that nation I will allow to remain on their own soil , ” says Adonai . “ They will farm it and live there. ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	27	12	Then I spoke to Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah in just the same way : “ Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Bavel , serve him and his people , and you will live .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	13	Why would you want to die , you and your people , by sword , famine and plague — which is what Adonai has decreed for the nation that will not serve the king of Bavel ?
CJB	Jeremiah	27	14	Don ’ t listen to the words of the prophets who say to you , ‘ You will not serve the king of Bavel ’ ; because they are prophesying lies to you .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	15	‘ For I have not sent them , ’ says Adonai , ‘ and they are prophesying falsely in my name , with the result that I will drive you out , and you will perish — you and the prophets prophesying to you. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	27	16	I also spoke to the cohanim and to all this people ; I said , “ This is what Adonai says : ‘ Don ’ t listen to the words of the prophets prophesying to you that the articles from Adonai ’ s house will soon be returned from Bavel ; because they are prophesying lies to you .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	17	Don ’ t listen to them . Serve the king of Bavel , and stay alive ; why should this city become a ruin ? ’
CJB	Jeremiah	27	18	But if they are in fact prophets , and if the word of Adonai is with them , then let them now intercede with Adonai-Tzva ’ ot that the articles still remaining in the house of Adonai and in the palace of the king of Y ’ hudah will not go off to Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	27	19	For this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says concerning the columns , the Sea , the bases and the rest of the articles still here in this city ,
CJB	Jeremiah	27	20	that N ’ vukhadnetzar , king of Bavel did not seize when he carried off captive Y ’ khanyahu the son of Y ’ hoyakim , king of Y ’ hudah , from Yerushalayim to Bavel , along with all the leading men of Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim —
CJB	Jeremiah	27	21	yes , this is what Adonai Shaddai , the God of Isra ’ el , says about the things remaining in the house of Adonai , in the palace of the king of Y ’ hudah and in Yerushalayim :
CJB	Jeremiah	27	22	‘ They will be carried to Bavel ; and there they will stay until the day I remember them , bring them back and restore them to this place , ’ says Adonai . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	28	28	That same year , at the beginning of the reign of Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah , in the fifth month of the fourth year , Hananyah the son of ‘ Azur the prophet , from Giv ‘ on , spoke to me in Adonai ’ s house in front of the cohanim and all the people , saying ,
CJB	Jeremiah	28	2	“ This is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ I have broken the yoke of the king of Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	28	3	Within two years I will restore to this place all the articles from Adonai ’ s house that N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel removed from this place and carried to Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	28	4	Also I will bring back here Y ’ khanyah the son of Y ’ hoyakim , king of Y ’ hudah , along with all those from Y ’ hudah who were taken captive to Bavel , ’ says Adonai , ‘ for I will break the yoke of the king of Bavel. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	28	5	Then the prophet Yirmeyahu said to the prophet Hananyah in front of the cohanim and all the people standing in Adonai ’ s house —
CJB	Jeremiah	28	6	the prophet Yirmeyahu said , “ Amen ! May Adonai do it ! May Adonai fulfill the words you have prophesied and bring back from Bavel to this place the articles from Adonai ’ s house and all the people who were carried away captive !
CJB	Jeremiah	28	7	Nevertheless , listen now to this word that I am speaking for you to hear and for all the people to hear .
CJB	Jeremiah	28	8	The prophets who were here before me and before you prophesied in times past against many countries and against great kingdoms about war , disaster and plagues .
CJB	Jeremiah	28	9	As for a prophet who prophesies peace — when the word of that prophet is fulfilled , it will be evident concerning that prophet that Adonai indeed did send him. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	28	10	At this point Hananyah the prophet took the crossbar off the prophet Yirmeyahu ’ s neck and broke it .
CJB	Jeremiah	28	11	Then Hananyah , in front of all the people , said , “ Thus says Adonai : ‘ In just this way will I break off the yoke of N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel from the necks of all the nations within two years. ’ ” The prophet Yirmeyahu left them ;
CJB	Jeremiah	28	12	but then this word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu , after Hananyah the prophet had broken off the crossbar from the neck of the prophet Yirmeyahu :
CJB	Jeremiah	28	13	“ Go and tell Hananyah that Adonai : says , ‘ You have broken the crossbars of wood , but you will make in their place crossbars of iron .
CJB	Jeremiah	28	14	For here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations , so that they can serve N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel ; and they will serve him ; and I have given him the wild animals too. ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	28	15	Then the prophet Yirmeyahu said to Hananyah the prophet , “ Listen here , Hananyah ! Adonai has not sent you ! You are making these people trust in a lie !
CJB	Jeremiah	28	16	Therefore , here is what Adonai says : ‘ I am about to send you away from the face of the earth — this year you will die , because you have preached rebellion against Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	28	17	Hananyah the prophet died that same year , in the seventh month .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	29	Tz ’ fanyah the cohen read this letter to Yirmeyahu the prophet , and afterwards
CJB	Jeremiah	29	2	This was after Y ’ khanyah the king , the queen mother , the officers , the leaders of Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim , and the artisans and skilled workers had left Yerushalayim .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	3	The letter was entrusted to El ‘ asah the son of Shafan and G ’ maryah the son of Hilkiyah ; Tzidkiyah king of Y ’ hudah sent them to Bavel , to N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel . The letter said :
CJB	Jeremiah	29	4	“ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says to all those in exile , whom I have caused to be carried off captive from Yerushalayim to Bavel :
CJB	Jeremiah	29	5	‘ Build yourselves houses , and live in them . Plant gardens , and eat what they produce .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	6	Choose women to marry , and have sons and daughters . Choose wives for your sons , and give your daughters in marriage to men , so that they can have sons and daughters — increase your numbers there , don ’ t decrease .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	7	Seek the welfare of the city to which I have caused you to go in exile , and pray to Adonai on its behalf ; for your welfare is bound up in its welfare. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	29	8	For this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ Don ’ t let your prophets who are living among you and your diviners deceive you , and don ’ t pay attention to the dreams you urge them to dream .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	9	For they are prophesying falsely in my name ; I have not sent them , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	10	“ For here is what Adonai says : ‘ After Bavel ’ s seventy years are over , I will remember you and fulfill my good promise to you by bringing you back to this place .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	11	For I know what plans I have in mind for you , ’ says Adonai , ‘ plans for well-being , not for bad things ; so that you can have hope and a future .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	12	When you call to me and pray to me , I will listen to you .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	13	When you seek me , you will find me , provided you seek for me wholeheartedly ;
CJB	Jeremiah	29	14	and I will let you find me , ’ says Adonai . ‘ Then I will reverse your exile . I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have driven you , ’ says Adonai , ‘ and bring you back to the place from which I exiled you. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	29	15	“ You say that Adonai has raised up prophets for you in Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	16	But here is what Adonai says about the king occupying David ’ s throne and about all the people living in this city , your kinsmen who did not go into exile with you —
CJB	Jeremiah	29	17	thus says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot : ‘ I will attack them with sword , famine and plague ; I will make them like bad figs , so bad they are inedible .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	18	I will pursue them with sword , famine and plague and make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth ; and they will bring on themselves cursing , astonishment , ridicule and reproach among all the nations where I have driven them ;
CJB	Jeremiah	29	19	because they have not paid attention to my words , ’ says Adonai , ‘ which I sent to them through my servants the prophets . I sent them frequently , but you refused to listen , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	20	“ So pay attention now to the word of Adonai , all of you in exile , whom I sent away from Yerushalayim to Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	21	Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says about Ach ’ av the son of Kolayah and Tzidkiyahu the son of Ma ‘ aseiyah , who prophesy lies to you in my name : ‘ I will hand them over to N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel , and he will put them to death before your eyes .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	22	In fact , all those exiled from Y ’ hudah who are in Bavel will take up this formula for cursing : “ May Adonai make you like Tzidkiyahu and Ach ’ av , whom the king of Bavel roasted in the fire ! ”
CJB	Jeremiah	29	23	because they have done vile things in Isra ’ el , committing adultery with their neighbors ’ wives and speaking words in my name , falsely , which I did not order them to say . For I am he who knows ; I am witness to this , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	24	“ To Sh ’ ma ‘ yah the Nechelami you are to communicate this message :
CJB	Jeremiah	29	25	‘ This is a word from Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , because of the letters you sent in your own name to all the people in Yerushalayim , including Tz ’ fanyah the son of Ma ‘ aseiyah the cohen and all the cohanim .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	26	Your letter said , “ Adonai has made you cohen in place of Y ’ hoyada the cohen , in order to have officials in Adonai ’ s house who will arrest any crazy person who makes himself out to be a prophet , so that you can restrain him in stocks and collar .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	27	So why haven ’ t you rebuked Yirmeyahu of ‘ Anatot , who makes himself out to be a prophet for you ?
CJB	Jeremiah	29	28	He even sends word to us in Bavel saying that the exile will last a long time ; so build houses and live in them , plant gardens and eat what they produce. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	29	30	the word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu ,
CJB	Jeremiah	29	31	instructing him to send to all those in exile this message : “ Here is what Adonai says about Sh ’ ma ‘ yah the Nechelami : ‘ This Sh ’ ma ‘ yah has prophesied to you , even though I did not send him , and has caused you to put your trust in a lie .
CJB	Jeremiah	29	32	Because of this , ’ Adonai says , ‘ I will punish Sh ’ ma ‘ yah the Nechelami and his offspring . He will not have a man to live among this people , and he will not see the good I am planning to do for my people , ’ says Adonai , ‘ because he has preached rebellion against Adonai . ’ ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	30	30	This word came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai :
CJB	Jeremiah	30	2	“ This is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ Write all the words I have spoken to you in a scroll .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	3	For the day is coming , ’ says Adonai , ‘ when I will reverse the exile of my people Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah , ’ says Adonai . ‘ I will cause them to return to the land I gave their ancestors , and they will take possession of it. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	30	4	These are the words Adonai spoke concerning Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah :
CJB	Jeremiah	30	5	Here is what Adonai says : “ We have heard a cry of terror , of fear and not of peace .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask now and see : can men give birth to children ? Why , then , do I see all the men with their hands on their stomachs like women in labor , with every face turned pale ?
CJB	Jeremiah	30	7	How dreadful that day will be ! — there has never been one like it : a time of trouble for Ya ‘ akov , but out of it he will be saved .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	8	“ On that day , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ I will break his yoke from off your neck , I will snap your chains . Foreigners will no longer enslave him .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	9	Instead , they will serve Adonai their God and David their king , whom I will raise up for them .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	10	“ So don ’ t be afraid , Ya ‘ akov my servant , ” says Adonai , “ or be alarmed , Isra ’ el ; for I will return you from far away and your offspring from their country of exile . Ya ‘ akov will again be quiet , at rest ; and no one will make him afraid .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	11	“ For I am with you to save you , ” says Adonai , “ I will finish off all the nations where I have scattered you . However , you I will not finish off , but will discipline only as you deserve ; I will not completely destroy you. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	30	12	For here is what Adonai says : “ Your wound is past healing , your injury most severe ;
CJB	Jeremiah	30	13	no one thinks your wound can be bandaged ; you have no medicines that can heal you .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	14	All your friends have forgotten you , they no longer seek you out . I have struck you down as an enemy would , punished as a cruel man would , because of your great wickedness , because of your many sins .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	15	Why cry that your wound and pain are past healing ? I have done these things to you because of your great wickedness , because of your many sins .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	16	“ But all who devour you will be devoured , all your enemies will go into exile , those who plunder you will be plundered , those who pillage you will be pillaged .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	17	For I will restore your health , I will heal you of your wounds , ” says Adonai , “ because they called you an outcast , Tziyon , with no one who cares about her. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	30	18	Thus says Adonai : “ I will return Ya ‘ akov ’ s captives to their tents ; I will take pity on his dwellings . Cities will be rebuilt on their own tels , with palaces where they ’ re supposed to be .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	19	From them will come thanksgiving and the sound of people celebrating . I will increase them ; they will not be decreased ; I will honor them ; they will not be despised .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	20	Their children will be as they used to be , their community confirmed in my presence ; and I will punish everyone who oppresses them .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	21	Their leader will be one of their own , their ruler will come from among them . I will cause him to come close and let him approach me ; for , otherwise , who would guarantee his heart enough to approach me ? ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	22	“ You will be my people , and I will be your God. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	30	23	Look ! The storm of Adonai , bursting out in fury , a sweeping storm , whirling down upon the heads of the wicked !
CJB	Jeremiah	30	24	Adonai ’ s fierce anger will not abate till he accomplishes the purpose in his heart . In the acharit-hayamim , you will understand .
CJB	Jeremiah	30	25	( 31:1 ) “ When that time comes , ” says Adonai , “ I will be God of all the clans of Isra ’ el , and they will be my people . ”

CJB	Jeremiah	32	32	because of all the evil that the people of Isra ’ el and the people of Y ’ hudah have done in order to make me angry — they , their kings , their leaders , their cohanim , their prophets , the men of Y ’ hudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	2	At that time the army of the king of Bavel was besieging Yerushalayim ; and Yirmeyahu the prophet was imprisoned in the guards ’ quarters attached to the king of Y ’ hudah ’ s palace ,
CJB	Jeremiah	32	3	where Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah had imprisoned him after demanding , “ How dare you prophesy that Adonai says , ‘ I will hand this city over to the king of Bavel , and he will capture it ;
CJB	Jeremiah	32	4	Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah will not escape from the Kasdim but will certainly be handed over to the king of Bavel , who will address him face to face , with their eyes meeting ;
CJB	Jeremiah	32	5	and he will lead Tzidkiyahu to Bavel , where he will stay until I remember him , ’ says Adonai , ‘ and even if you fight the Kasdim , you will fail ’ ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	32	6	Yirmeyahu said , “ This word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Jeremiah	32	7	‘ Hanam ’ el , the son of your uncle Shalum , will approach you and say , “ Buy my field at ‘ Anatot ; you have next-of-kin ’ s right to redeem it ; so buy it. ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	32	8	As Adonai had said , my cousin Hanam ’ el came to me in the guards ’ quarters and said , “ Please buy my field at ‘ Anatot , in the territory of Binyamin ; because you will inherit it , and you have next-of-kin ’ s right to redeem it , so buy it for yourself. ” Then I was certain that this was Adonai ’ s word .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	9	So I bought the field at ‘ Anatot which belonged to my cousin Hanam ’ el and weighed out the money for him , seven ounces of silver shekels .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	10	I signed on the purchase contract , sealed it , called witnesses and weighed out the money for him on a balance scale .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	11	I took the purchase contract , both the sealed copy with the terms and conditions , and the unsealed copy ,
CJB	Jeremiah	32	12	and gave the purchase contract to Barukh the son of Neriyah , the son of Machseyah , in the presence of my cousin Hanam ’ el , the witnesses who had signed the purchase contract and the people from Y ’ hudah sitting by the guards ’ quarters .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	13	In their presence I instructed Barukh as follows :
CJB	Jeremiah	32	14	“ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ Take these contracts , both the sealed and unsealed copies , and place them in a clay jar , so that they can be preserved for a long time. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	32	15	For Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says that one day homes , fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	32	16	After giving the purchase contract to Barukh son of Neriyah , I prayed to Adonai :
CJB	Jeremiah	32	17	“ Adonai , God ! You made heaven and earth by your great power and outstretched arm ; nothing is too hard for you .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	18	You display your grace to thousands but also repay the guilt of the fathers into the lap of their children who follow them . Great , powerful God , whose name is Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ,
CJB	Jeremiah	32	19	great in counsel , mighty in deed ! Your eyes are open to all the ways of human beings in order to repay each one according to his ways , according to the consequences of what he does .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	20	You gave signs and performed miracles in the land of Egypt which continue to this day , also in Isra ’ el and among other people ; thus you made yourself the reputation you have today .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	21	You brought your people of Isra ’ el out of the land of Egypt with signs and miracles , with a strong hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	22	Then you gave them this land , which you had sworn to their ancestors that you would give them , a land flowing with milk and honey .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	23	They entered and took possession of it ; but they did not pay attention to your voice , did not live according to your Torah , and did nothing of all you ordered them to do . Therefore you made this complete disaster befall them —
CJB	Jeremiah	32	24	the siege-works are already there ; they have come to the city to capture it ; and the city , by means of sword , famine and plague , is being handed over to the Kasdim fighting against it . What you foretold is being fulfilled ; here , you see it , yourself .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	25	Yet you , Adonai , God , have said to me , ‘ Buy the field for money , and call witnesses ; even as the city is being turned over to the Kasdim ! ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	32	26	Then this word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu :
CJB	Jeremiah	32	27	“ Look , I am Adonai , the God of every living creature ; is there anything too hard for me ?
CJB	Jeremiah	32	28	Therefore , here is what Adonai says : ‘ I will hand this city over to the Kasdim and to N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel ; and he will capture it .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	29	The Kasdim who are fighting against this city will enter and set this city on fire ; they will burn it down , including its houses , on whose roofs they offered to Ba ‘ al and poured out drink offerings to other gods , in order to make me angry .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	30	For from their youth , the people of Isra ’ el and the people of Y ’ hudah have done only what is evil from my perspective ; the people of Isra ’ el have done nothing but provoke me with what their hands make , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	31	‘ This city has so provoked my anger and fury from the day they built it to this day that I ought to remove it from my presence ,
CJB	Jeremiah	32	33	They have turned their backs on me , not their faces ; and although I taught them , taught them frequently , they have not listened so as to receive instruction .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	34	Instead they put their detestable idols in the house that bears my name , to defile it ;
CJB	Jeremiah	32	35	and they built the high places for Ba ‘ al which are in the Ben-Hinnom Valley , to burn alive their sons and daughters to Molekh — something I did not order them to do , it never even entered my mind that they would do such an abominable thing — and thus they caused Y ’ hudah to sin. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	32	36	“ Therefore , thus says Adonai the God of Isra ’ el concerning this city , of which you say that it is handed over to the king of Bavel by sword , famine and plague :
CJB	Jeremiah	32	37	‘ I will gather them out of all the countries where I drove them in my anger , fury and great wrath ; and I will bring them back to this place and have them live here in safety .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	38	They will be my people , and I will be their God .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	39	I will give them singleness of heart and singleness of purpose , so that they will fear me forever — this will be for their own good and for the good of their children after them .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	40	I will make with them an everlasting covenant not to turn away from them , but to do them good ; I will put fear of me in their hearts , so that they will not leave me .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	41	I will take joy in them , so as to do them good . I will plant them in this land truly , with my whole heart and being. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	32	42	For here is what Adonai says : ‘ Just as I have brought this complete disaster on this people , so likewise I will bring on them all the good I have promised them .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	43	Fields will be bought in this land , even though you say about it that it is desolate , devoid of human beings or animals , and given over to the Kasdim .
CJB	Jeremiah	32	44	Yes , people will buy fields for money , sign the purchase contracts , seal them and call witnesses , in the territory of Binyamin , in the areas around Yerushalayim , in the cities of Y ’ hudah , in the cities of the hill-country , in the cities of the Sh ’ felah and in the cities of the Negev . For I will cause their exiles to return , ’ says Adonai . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	33	33	The word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu a second time while he was still imprisoned in the guards ’ quarters :
CJB	Jeremiah	33	2	“ Thus says Adonai the maker , Adonai who formed [ the universe ] so as to keep directing it — Adonai is his name :
CJB	Jeremiah	33	3	‘ Call out to me , and I will answer you — I will tell you great things , hidden things of which you are unaware. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	33	4	For here is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says concerning the houses of this city and the palaces of the kings of Y ’ hudah which are about to be destroyed and used as siege-works and ramparts ,
CJB	Jeremiah	33	5	where they will come to fight the Kasdim : “ These places will eventually be filled with the corpses of people whom I am striking down in my anger and fury , everyone whose wickedness has caused me to hide my face from this city .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	6	However , I will bring it health and healing ; I will heal them and reveal to them peace and truth in plenty .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	7	I will cause the captives of Y ’ hudah and the captives of Isra ’ el to return ; and I will build them up as I did at first .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	8	I will cleanse them from all their sins , through which they offended me ; and I will pardon all their sins , through which they offended and rebelled against me .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	9	Then the name of this city will bring me joy , praise and glory before all the nations of the earth that hear about all the good I am doing for them ; they will be overcome with fear and trembling at all the good and peace I am securing for it. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	33	10	Here is what Adonai says : “ You say that this place is a wasteland , with neither people nor animals in the cities of Y ’ hudah , and that the streets of Yerushalayim are desolate , without people or animals — no inhabitants . Yet there will again be heard here
CJB	Jeremiah	33	11	the sounds of joy and gladness and the voices of bridegroom and bride , the voices of those who sing , ‘ Give thanks to Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , for Adonai is good , for his grace continues forever , ’ as they bring offerings of thanksgiving into the house of Adonai . For I will cause those captured from the land to return , as before , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	12	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , “ In this place , which is a wasteland without people or animals , and in all its cities , there will once again be pasture-lands where shepherds can let their flocks rest .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	13	In the cities of the hill-country , in the cities of the Sh ’ felah , in the cities of the Negev , in the territory of Binyamin , in the areas around Yerushalayim and in the cities of Y ’ hudah flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	14	“ Here , the days are coming , ” says Adonai , “ when I will fulfill this good promise which I have proclaimed for the house of Isra ’ el and the house of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	15	When those days come , at that time , I will cause to spring up for David a Branch of Righteousness . He will do what is just and right in the land .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	16	When those days come , Y ’ hudah will be saved , Yerushalayim will live in safety , and the name given to her will be Adonai Tzidkenu [ Adonai our Righteousness ] . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	33	17	For this is what Adonai says : “ There will never be cut off from David a man to occupy the throne of the house of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	18	Nor will there ever be cut off from the cohanim who are L ’ vi ’ im a man before me to offer burnt offerings , burn grain offerings and offer sacrifices every day. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	33	19	This word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu :
CJB	Jeremiah	33	20	“ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night , so that daytime and nighttime no longer come when they are supposed to ,
CJB	Jeremiah	33	21	then my covenant with my servant David also can be broken , so that he will not have a descendant to reign from his throne or L ’ vi ’ im who are cohanim to minister to me .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	22	To the degree that the armies of heaven are past counting and the sand by the sea past measuring , I will increase the descendants of my servant David and the L ’ vi ’ im ministering to me. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	33	23	This word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu :
CJB	Jeremiah	33	24	“ Haven ’ t you noticed that these people are saying , ‘ Adonai has rejected the two families he chose ’ ? Hence they despise my people and no longer look at them as a nation .
CJB	Jeremiah	33	25	Here is what Adonai says : ‘ If I have not established my covenant with day and night and fixed the laws for sky and earth ,
CJB	Jeremiah	33	26	then I will also reject the descendants of Ya ‘ akov and of my servant David , not choosing from his descendants people to rule over the descendants of Avraham , Yis ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov . For I will cause their captives to come back , and I will show them compassion . ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	34	34	This word came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai when N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel , his whole army , all his vassal kingdoms and all the peoples fought against Yerushalayim and all its cities :
CJB	Jeremiah	34	2	“ Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says to go and speak to Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah . Tell him that Adonai says : ‘ I am going to hand this city over to the king of Bavel , and he will burn it to the ground .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	3	You will not escape but will surely be captured and handed over to him ; your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Bavel , he will speak with you face to face , and you will go to Bavel. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	34	4	Nevertheless , Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah , hear the word of Adonai . Adonai says this about you : ‘ You will not be put to the sword
CJB	Jeremiah	34	5	but will die peacefully ; and just as they burned spices for your ancestors , the earlier kings who preceded you , so they will burn spices for you and mourn you , “ Oh ! Master ! ” For I have spoken the word , ’ says Adonai. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	34	6	Yirmeyahu the prophet said all these words to Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah in Yerushalayim
CJB	Jeremiah	34	7	at the time when the king of Bavel ’ s army was fighting against Yerushalayim and against all the cities of Y ’ hudah that were left — that is , against Lakhish and ‘ Azekah , since only these remained of the fortified cities of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	8	This word came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai after King Tzidkiyahu had made a covenant with all the people in Yerushalayim to emancipate them .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	9	Everyone who had a male or female slave who was Hebrew was to let him go free ; none was to keep as his slave a fellow Jew .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	10	All the leaders and all the people listened who had entered into the covenant , wherein everyone was to free his male and female slaves and not keep them in bondage any longer . They listened , and they let them go .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	11	But afterwards , they changed their minds ; they made the male and female slaves , whom they had freed , return ; and they brought them back into subjection as slaves .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	12	Therefore this word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai :
CJB	Jeremiah	34	13	“ Here is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says : ‘ When I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt , where they lived as slaves , I made this covenant with them :
CJB	Jeremiah	34	14	“ At the end of seven years every one of you is to set free his brother Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years . You are to let him go free from you. ” But your ancestors did not listen to me or pay any attention .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	15	Now you repented , you did what is right from my viewpoint when each of you proclaimed freedom to his fellow ; and you made a covenant before me in the house bearing my name .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	16	But then you changed your minds . You profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves , whom you had set free to live as they wished , and brought them back into subjection as your slaves. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	34	17	Therefore here is what Adonai says : ‘ You did not heed me and proclaim freedom , each to his brother and each to his neighbor ; so now I proclaim for you a freedom , ’ says Adonai , ‘ for sword , plague and famine . I will make you an object of horror to all the kingdoms on earth .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	18	As for the men who violated my covenant by not living up to the conditions of the covenant which they made in my presence when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts —
CJB	Jeremiah	34	19	the leaders of Y ’ hudah , the leaders of Yerushalayim , the officials , the cohanim and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf ;
CJB	Jeremiah	34	20	I will hand them over to their enemies , hand them over to those who seek their lives ; and their corpses will become food for birds in the air and wild animals .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	21	Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah and his officials I will hand over to their enemies , to those who seek their lives and to the army of the king of Bavel , which has withdrawn .
CJB	Jeremiah	34	22	I will give the order , ’ says Adonai , ‘ and cause them to return to this city . They will attack it , capture it and burn it to the ground ; and I will make the cities of Y ’ hudah desolate and uninhabited . ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	35	35	This word came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai during the time of Y ’ hoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu , king of Y ’ hudah :
CJB	Jeremiah	35	2	“ Go to the Rekhavim , speak to them , bring them to one of the rooms in the house of Adonai , and give them some wine to drink. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	35	3	So I took Ya ’ azanyah the son of Yirmeyahu , the son of Havatzinyah , and his brothers , all his sons and all the Rekhavim ,
CJB	Jeremiah	35	4	and took them into the house of Adonai , to the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Yigdalyahu , a man of God . It was by the room of the officials , which was above the room of Ma ‘ aseiyah the son of Shalum , the gatekeeper .
CJB	Jeremiah	35	5	There I set in front of the members of the clan of the Rekhavim pitchers full of wine and cups , and said to them , “ Drink some wine. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	35	6	But they said , “ We will not drink any wine ; because Yonadav the son of Rekhav , our ancestor , gave us this order : ‘ You are not to drink wine , neither you nor your descendants , forever .
CJB	Jeremiah	35	7	Also you are not to build houses , sow seed , or plant or own vineyards . Rather , you are always to live in tents ; so that you may live a long time in the land , in which you are not citizens. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	35	8	We have heeded the words of Yonadav the son of Rekhav , our ancestor , in all that he instructed us to do : not to drink wine as long as we live — we , our wives , our sons and our daughters ;
CJB	Jeremiah	35	9	not to build houses for ourselves to live in ; and not to have vineyards , fields or seed .
CJB	Jeremiah	35	10	We have lived in tents , and we have heeded Yonadav our ancestor and done everything he ordered us to do .
CJB	Jeremiah	35	11	But when N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel came up to attack the land , we said , ‘ Come , let ’ s go up to Yerushalayim , ’ because we were afraid of the army of the Kasdim and the army of Aram ; hence we are living in Yerushalayim. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	35	12	Then the word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu :
CJB	Jeremiah	35	13	“ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot the God of Isra ’ el says to go to the men of Y ’ hudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim and say : ‘ Won ’ t you ever learn to listen to my words ? ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	35	14	‘ The words of Yonadav the son of Rekhav which he ordered his offspring , not to drink wine , are obeyed ; so to this day they don ’ t drink any ; because they heed their ancestor ’ s order . But I have spoken to you , spoken frequently , and you have not listened to me .
CJB	Jeremiah	35	15	I have also sent you all my servants the prophets , sent them frequently , with the message , “ Every one of you should turn back now from his evil way , improve your actions and not follow other gods in order to serve them . Then you will live in the land I gave you and your ancestors . But you have not paid attention or listened to me .
CJB	Jeremiah	35	16	Because the descendants of Yonadav the son of Rekhav have obeyed the order of their ancestor , which he ordered them ; but this people has not listened to me ;
CJB	Jeremiah	35	17	therefore — ” here is what Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ I will inflict on Y ’ hudah and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim all the disaster I have decreed against them ; because I have spoken to them , but they have not listened ; and I have called out to them , but they have not answered. ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	35	18	Then to the clan of the Rekhavim Yirmeyahu said , “ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ Because you have heeded the order of Yonadav your ancestor , observed all his commands and done what he ordered you to do ;
CJB	Jeremiah	35	19	therefore Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says this : “ Yonadav the son of Rekhav will never lack a descendant to stand before me . ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	36	36	In the fourth year of Y ’ hoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu , king of Y ’ hudah , this word came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai :
CJB	Jeremiah	36	2	“ Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you against Isra ’ el , Y ’ hudah and all the other nations , from the day I started speaking to you , back in the time of Yoshiyahu , until today .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	3	Perhaps the house of Y ’ hudah will listen to all the disaster I intend to bring on them , and turn back , each person from his evil way ; then I will forgive their wickedness and sin. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	36	4	So Yirmeyahu summoned Barukh the son of Neriyah ; and Barukh wrote down on a scroll , at Yirmeyahu ’ s dictation , all the words that Adonai had said to him .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	5	Then Yirmeyahu gave this order to Barukh : “ I am not allowed to enter the house of Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	6	Therefore , you take the scroll which you wrote at my dictation , go into the house of Adonai on a fast-day , and read from it the words of Adonai in the hearing of the people ; also read them to all Y ’ hudah as they exit their cities .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	7	Perhaps they will turn to Adonai in prayer and will return , each one , from his evil way . For the anger and fury which Adonai has decreed against this people is great. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	36	8	Barukh the son of Neriyah obeyed everything Yirmeyahu the prophet ordered him to do , reading the words of Adonai from the scroll in Adonai ’ s house .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	9	A fast was proclaimed in the ninth month of the fifth year of Y ’ hoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu , king of Y ’ hudah , for all the people in Yerushalayim and all the people who came from the cities of Y ’ hudah to Yerushalayim .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	10	It was then that Barukh read from the scroll the words of Yirmeyahu in the house of Adonai , in the chamber of G ’ maryahu the son of Shafan the secretary , in the upper courtyard , at the entry to the New Gate of Adonai ’ s house , for all the people to hear .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	11	When Mikhay ’ hu the son of G ’ maryahu , the son of Shafan , had heard from the scroll all the words of Adonai ,
CJB	Jeremiah	36	12	he went down to the king ’ s palace , into the secretary ’ s room . All the officials were there — Elishama the secretary , D ’ layahu the son of Sh ’ ma ‘ yahu , Elnatan the son of ‘ Akhbor , G ’ maryah the son of Shafan , Tzidkiyahu the son of Hananyahu and all the [ other ] officials .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	13	Mikhay ’ hu told them all the words he had heard when Barukh read the scroll in the people ’ s hearing ;
CJB	Jeremiah	36	14	whereupon all the officials sent Y ’ hudi the son of N ’ tanyahu , the son of Shelemyahu , the son of Kushi , to Barukh to say , “ Take in your hand the scroll from which you read in the hearing of the people , and come. ” So Barukh the son of Neriyah took the scroll in his hand and went to them .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	15	They said to him , “ Sit down , please , and read it to us. ” Barukh read it to them .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	16	After they had heard all the words , they turned in fear to each other and said to Barukh , “ We will certainly tell the king about all these words. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	36	17	Then they asked Barukh , “ Tell us now , how did you write all these words ? At his dictation ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	36	18	Barukh answered them , “ He said all these words to me with his mouth , and I wrote them with ink in the scroll. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	36	19	At this , the officials said to Barukh , “ Go and hide yourselves , you and Yirmeyahu ; don ’ t let anyone know where you are. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	36	20	After depositing the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary , they went in to the courtyard and told everything to the king .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	21	The king sent Y ’ hudi to bring the scroll , and he took it from the room of Elishama the secretary . Y ’ hudi read it to the king and all the officials standing near the king .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	22	The king was sitting in his winter house ; and since it was the ninth month , he had a fire burning in the stove in front of him .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	23	After Y ’ hudi had read three or four columns from the scroll , he would cut off that portion with a knife and throw it into the fire that was burning in the stove , until the entire scroll had been consumed by the fire in the stove .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	24	But even though they heard all these words , neither the king nor any of his servants grew afraid or tore their clothes .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	25	Elnatan , D ’ layahu and G ’ maryahu had begged the king not to burn the scroll ; but he wouldn ’ t listen to them .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	26	Then the king ordered Yerachme ’ el the king ’ s son , S ’ rayahu the son of ‘ Azri ’ el and Shelemyahu the son of ‘ Avde ’ el to arrest Barukh the scribe and Yirmeyahu the prophet ; but Adonai hid them .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	27	Then this word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu after the king had burned the scroll with the words Barukh had written at Yirmeyahu ’ s dictation :
CJB	Jeremiah	36	28	“ Take another scroll , and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll , which Y ’ hoyakim the king of Y ’ hudah burned up .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	29	And as far as Y ’ hoyakim king of Y ’ hudah is concerned , you are to say that Adonai says , ‘ You burned this scroll , asking , “ Why did you write in it that the king of Bavel will certainly come and destroy this land and leave it without either humans or animals ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	36	30	Therefore Adonai says this about Y ’ hoyakim king of Y ’ hudah : “ He will have no one to occupy David ’ s throne ; and his dead body will be thrown out to lie in the heat by day and in the frost by night .
CJB	Jeremiah	36	31	Moreover , I will punish him , his offspring and his officials for their wickedness ; and I will bring on them , the inhabitants of Yerushalayim and the people of Y ’ hudah all the disaster I have decreed against them , to which they have paid no attention. ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	36	32	Then Yirmeyahu took another scroll and gave it to Barukh the scribe , the son of Neriyah . At Yirmeyahu ’ s dictation he wrote in it all the words of the scroll which Y ’ hoyakim king of Y ’ hudah had burned up in the fire , and to those he added many similar words .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	37	Tzidkiyahu the son of Yoshiyahu became king , succeeding Koniyahu the son of Y ’ hoyakim , whom N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel had made king over the land of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	2	But neither he , his servants nor the people of the land paid attention to the words of Adonai , which he spoke through the prophet Yirmeyahu .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	3	Tzidkiyahu the king sent Y ’ hukhal the son of Shelemyahu and Tz ’ fanyahu the son of Ma ‘ aseiyah , the cohen , to the prophet Yirmeyahu with the message , “ Please pray to Adonai our God for us. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	37	4	At that time Yirmeyahu was mixing freely with the people , because they had not yet put him in prison .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	5	At the same time Pharaoh ’ s army marched out of Egypt ; and when the Kasdim besieging Yerushalayim heard about them , they lifted the siege from Yerushalayim .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	6	Then this word of Adonai came to the prophet Yirmeyahu :
CJB	Jeremiah	37	7	“ Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says to tell the king of Y ’ hudah , who sent you to me to consult me : ‘ Pharaoh ’ s army has marched out to assist you ; but they will return to Egypt , to their own country .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	8	The Kasdim will return , attack this city , capture it and burn it to the ground. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	37	9	Here is what Adonai says : ‘ Don ’ t deceive yourselves by thinking that the Kasdim must withdraw from you , because they will not withdraw .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	10	Even if you were to strike the entire army of the Kasdim fighting against you , to the degree that only their wounded were left , they would still rise up every man from his tent and burn this city to the ground. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	37	11	Then , at the time when the army of the Kasdim had lifted the siege of Yerushalayim out of fear of Pharaoh ’ s army ,
CJB	Jeremiah	37	12	Yirmeyahu left Yerushalayim to go to the territory of Binyamin to receive his share of an inheritance there . He was passing through the crowds
CJB	Jeremiah	37	13	and had reached the gate leading toward Binyamin when a guard commander there named Yir ’ iyah the son of Shelemyah , the son of Hananyah , seized Yirmeyahu the prophet , shouting , “ You ’ re deserting to the Kasdim ! ”
CJB	Jeremiah	37	14	Yirmeyahu answered , “ That is a lie ! I am not deserting to the Kasdim ” ; but Yir ’ iyah wouldn ’ t listen to him . So he arrested Yirmeyahu and brought him to the officials .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	15	The officials , furious with Yirmeyahu , had him beaten and jailed in the house of Y ’ honatan the secretary , which had been made over into a prison .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	16	The cistern had been made into a dungeon , and Yirmeyahu was put in one of its cells ; there he remained for a long time .
CJB	Jeremiah	37	17	Then Tzidkiyahu the king sent and had him brought ; and the king asked him secretly , in his palace , “ Is there any word from Adonai ? ” “ There is , ” Yirmeyahu said . “ You will be handed over to the king of Bavel. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	37	18	Yirmeyahu asked King Tzidkiyahu , “ In what way have I sinned against you or against your officials or against this people , that has caused you to put me in prison ?
CJB	Jeremiah	37	19	Where are your prophets now , the ones who prophesied to you that the king of Bavel wouldn ’ t attack you or this land ?
CJB	Jeremiah	37	20	So now , please listen , my lord king ! I beg you , approve my request — don ’ t make me return to the house of Y ’ honatan the secretary , or I will die there. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	37	21	At that , Tzidkiyahu the king gave the order , at which they committed Yirmeyahu to the guards ’ quarters and gave him daily a loaf of bread from the Bakers ’ Street , until all the bread in the city had been used up . Thus Yirmeyahu remained in the guards ’ quarters .
CJB	Jeremiah	38	38	But Sh ’ fatyah the son of Mattan , G ’ dalyahu the son of Pash ’ chur , Yukhal the son of Shelemyahu and Pash ’ chur the son of Malkiyah heard these words which Yirmeyahu had said to all the people ,
CJB	Jeremiah	38	2	“ Here is what Adonai says : whoever remains in this city will die by sword , famine and plague ; but whoever leaves and surrenders to the Kasdim will stay alive ; his own life will be his only ‘ spoils of war , ’ but he will stay alive .
CJB	Jeremiah	38	3	Adonai says that this city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Bavel , and he will capture it. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	4	The leaders said to the king , “ Please let this man be put to death ; because by speaking such words to the soldiers left in this city and to all the people , he is demoralizing them . This man is seeking not to benefit this people , but to harm them. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	5	Tzidkiyahu the king said , “ All right , he is in your hands ; for the king can ’ t prevent you from doing as you please. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	6	Then they took Yirmeyahu and threw him into the cistern of Malkiyahu the king ’ s son , which was in the guards ’ quarters ; they let down Yirmeyahu into it with ropes . In the pit there was no water , but there was mud ; and Yirmeyahu sank into the mud .
CJB	Jeremiah	38	7	‘ Eved-Melekh the Ethiopian , an officer in the king ’ s house , heard that they had put Yirmeyahu in the cistern . When the king was sitting at the gate leading toward Binyamin ,
CJB	Jeremiah	38	8	‘ Eved-Melekh left the palace and said to the king ,
CJB	Jeremiah	38	9	“ My lord , king ! What these men have done to Yirmeyahu the prophet is evil . They have thrown him into the cistern ; and he is likely to die there where he is , because of the famine ; for there is no more food in the city. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	10	Then the king ordered ‘ Eved-Melekh the Ethiopian , “ Take thirty men with you from here , and bring Yirmeyahu the prophet up out of the cistern before he dies. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	11	So ‘ Eved-Melekh took the men with him and entered a storeroom under the treasury in the king ’ s palace , from which he took some old clothes and rags . These he let down with ropes to Yirmeyahu in the cistern .
CJB	Jeremiah	38	12	‘ Eved-Melekh the Ethiopian then said to Yirmeyahu , “ Use these old clothes and rags as padding between your armpits and the ropes. ” After Yirmeyahu had done this ,
CJB	Jeremiah	38	13	they pulled Yirmeyahu up with the ropes and took him out of the cistern . Yirmeyahu remained in the guards ’ quarters .
CJB	Jeremiah	38	14	Tzidkiyahu summoned and had Yirmeyahu brought to him through the third entry in the house of Adonai . Then the king said to Yirmeyahu , “ I want to ask you something ; don ’ t hide anything from me. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	15	Yirmeyahu said to Tzidkiyahu , “ If I do say it to you , won ’ t you have me put to death ? And if I give you counsel , you won ’ t listen to me. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	16	So Tzidkiyahu swore secretly to Yirmeyahu , “ As Adonai lives , who gave us our lives , I will not put you to death ; nor will I hand you over to these men who want you put to death. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	17	Then Yirmeyahu said to Tzidkiyahu , “ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ If you will go out and surrender to the king of Bavel ’ s officers , then you will stay alive — this city will not be burned down ; and you and your family will live .
CJB	Jeremiah	38	18	But if you will not go out to the king of Bavel ’ s officers , then this city will be handed over to the Kasdim ; they will burn it to the ground ; and you will not escape from them. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	19	Tzidkiyahu the king said to Yirmeyahu , “ I am afraid of the Judeans who deserted to the Kasdim . The Kasdim might hand me over to them , and they would mistreat me. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	20	Yirmeyahu answered , “ They won ’ t hand you over . I beg you , listen to the voice of Adonai concerning what I ’ m telling you about ; then it will go well with you , and you will live .
CJB	Jeremiah	38	21	But if you refuse to surrender , then this is the word Adonai has shown me :
CJB	Jeremiah	38	22	all the women remaining in the king of Y ’ hudah ’ s palace will be brought out to the king of Bavel ’ s officers , and those women will taunt you : ‘ Your own close friends misled you and took advantage of you . Now that your feet are stuck in the mud , they have abandoned you. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	38	23	They will bring all your women and children out to the Kasdim , and you will not escape from them . Rather , you will be captured by the king of Bavel , and you will cause this city to be burned to the ground. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	24	Tzidkiyahu said to Yirmeyahu , “ Don ’ t tell anyone what you just said , or you will die .
CJB	Jeremiah	38	25	If the officials hear that I have talked with you , and they come to you and say , ‘ Tell us now what you said to the king ; don ’ t hide it from us , or we will put you to death , and also what the king said to you , ’
CJB	Jeremiah	38	26	then tell them , ‘ I presented my request to the king that he would not make me return to Y ’ honatan ’ s house , to die there. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	38	27	All the officials did come to Yirmeyahu and asked him , and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say . So they stopped speaking with him , since the matter had not been reported .
CJB	Jeremiah	38	28	Yirmeyahu remained in the guards ’ quarters until the day Yerushalayim was captured ; he was there when Yerushalayim was captured .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	39	In the ninth year of Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah , in the tenth month , N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel marched against Yerushalayim with his entire army and began to lay siege against it .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	2	On the ninth day of the fourth month of the eleventh year of Tzidkiyahu , they broke through into the city .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	3	All the officers of the king of Bavel entered and sat at the Middle Gate — Nergal-Sar ’ etzer , Samgar-N ’ vo , Sars ’ khim the Rav-Saris , Nergal-Sar ’ etzer the Rav-Mag and all the other officers of the king of Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	4	When Tzidkiyahu the king of Y ’ hudah and all the soldiers saw them , they fled , leaving the city by night through the king ’ s garden , exiting from the gate between the two walls , and continuing out by the route through the ‘ Aravah .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	5	But the army of the Kasdim went in pursuit of them and overtook Tzidkiyahu on the plains near Yericho . Upon capturing him , they brought him up to N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel at Rivlah , in the land of Hamat , where he passed judgment on him .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	6	The king of Bavel slaughtered the sons of Tzidkiyahu before his eyes in Rivlah ; the king of Bavel also slaughtered all the leading men of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	7	Then he put out Tzidkiyahu ’ s eyes and bound him in chains to be carried off to Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	8	The Kasdim burned down the royal palace and the people ’ s houses , and they broke down the walls of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	9	N ’ vuzar ’ adan commander of the guard then deported to Bavel the remaining population of the city , the deserters who had defected to him , and the rest of the people remaining .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	10	But N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard left behind in the territory of Y ’ hudah some of the poor people , those who had nothing , and at the same time gave them vineyards and fields .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	11	Concerning Yirmeyahu , N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel gave N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard this order :
CJB	Jeremiah	39	12	“ Take him , look after him well , and do him no harm , but treat him as he tells you. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	39	13	So N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard , N ’ vushazban the Rav-Saris , Nergal-Sar ’ etzer the Rav-Mag , and all the chief officers of the king of Bavel
CJB	Jeremiah	39	14	sent to have Yirmeyahu taken out of the guards ’ quarters ; they committed him to the care of G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam , the son of Shafan , to be brought home . There he lived among the people .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	15	This word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu while he was imprisoned in the guards ’ quarters :
CJB	Jeremiah	39	16	“ Go and tell ‘ Eved-Melekh the Ethiopian that Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ “ I am about to fulfill my words about this city for disaster , not for good ; when the day arrives , they will come true before your eyes .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	17	But at that time I will rescue you , ” says Adonai , “ and I will not hand you over to the men you fear .
CJB	Jeremiah	39	18	Yes , I will keep you safe ; you will not fall by the sword , but you will escape with your life , because you have put your trust in me , ” says Adonai . ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	40	40	This word came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai after N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard had let him leave Ramah , after having taken him , bound in chains , with all the captives from Yerushalayim and Y ’ hudah that had been carried off to Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	40	2	The commander of the guard took Yirmeyahu and said to him , “ Adonai your God decreed this disaster for this place ,
CJB	Jeremiah	40	3	and Adonai has brought it about ; he has done what he said he would do , because you people sinned against Adonai and did not listen to what he said ; that is why this has come upon you .
CJB	Jeremiah	40	4	Now , today , I am freeing you from the chains on your hand . If it seems good to you to come with me to Bavel , come ; and I will look after you well . But if it seems not good to you to come with me to Bavel , then don ’ t — the entire land is in front of you : wherever it seems good and right for you to go , go there. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	40	5	Before Yirmeyahu could answer , [ N ’ vuzar ’ adan said , ] “ Go back then to G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam , the son of Shafan , whom the king of Bavel has made governor over the cities of Y ’ hudah , and live with him among the people ; or go wherever it seems right for you to go. ” The commander of the guard gave him provisions and a gift , and dismissed him .
CJB	Jeremiah	40	6	Yirmeyahu then went to G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam in Mitzpah and lived with him among the people who were left in the land .
CJB	Jeremiah	40	7	Now when all the field force commanders and their men heard that the king of Bavel had made G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam governor in the land and had committed to his care men , women , children and some of the poorest people in the land of those who had not been carried captive to Bavel ;
CJB	Jeremiah	40	8	they approached G ’ dalyahu in Mitzpah — in particular , Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu , Yochanan and Yonatan the sons of Kareach , S ’ rayah the son of Tanchumet , the sons of ‘ Efai the N ’ tofati and Y ’ zanyahu the son of the Ma ‘ akhati , they and their men .
CJB	Jeremiah	40	9	G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam , the son of Shafan , swore to them and their men , “ Don ’ t be afraid to serve the Kasdim . Live in the land , serve the king of Bavel ; and things will go well with you .
CJB	Jeremiah	40	10	As for me , I will live in Mitzpah and be responsible to the Kasdim who come to us . But you — harvest wine , summer fruits and olive oil ; put them in your containers ; and live in your cities that you have taken over. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	40	11	Likewise , when all the Judeans who were in Mo ’ av , in Edom , among the people of ‘ Amon , and in all the other countries heard that the king of Bavel had left a remnant in Y ’ hudah and had appointed G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam , the son of Shafan , to govern them ;
CJB	Jeremiah	40	12	then all the Judeans returned from all the places where they had been driven and came to the land of Y ’ hudah , to G ’ dalyahu in Mitzpah , and harvested wine and summer fruit in great abundance .
CJB	Jeremiah	40	13	Yochanan the son of Kareach and all the field force commanders came to G ’ dalyahu in Mitzpah
CJB	Jeremiah	40	14	and said to him , “ Are you aware that Ba ‘ alis the king of the people of ‘ Amon has sent Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu to take your life ? ” But G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam did not believe them .
CJB	Jeremiah	40	15	Then Yochanan the son of Kareach spoke privately with G ’ dalyahu in Mitzpah : “ Please , let me go , and I will kill Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu ; no one will know . Why let him assassinate you ? Moreover , if he does , all the Judeans gathered around you will scatter ; and the remnant of Y ’ hudah will perish. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	40	16	But G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam said to Yochanan the son of Kareach , “ Don ’ t do it . What you are saying about Yishma ‘ el is not true . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	41	41	In the seventh month Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu , the son of Elishama , of royal blood and one of the chief officials of the king , came with ten men to G ’ dalyahu in Mitzpah . While eating a meal together there in Mitzpah ,
CJB	Jeremiah	41	2	Yishma ‘ el and the ten men with him rose and attacked G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam , the son of Shafan , struck him with their swords , and assassinated the man whom the king of Bavel had appointed governor of the land .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	3	Yishma ‘ el also murdered all the Judeans who were with G ’ dalyahu at Mitzpah , as well as the Kasdim soldiers they found there .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	4	The next day , before his assassination of G ’ dalyahu had become known ,
CJB	Jeremiah	41	5	eighty men from Sh ’ khem , Shiloh and Shomron came with beards shaved off , clothes torn and gashes on their bodies ; they had grain offerings and frankincense with them to present in the house of Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	6	Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu went out from Mitzpah to meet them , weeping all along the way ; on meeting them , he said to them , “ Come to G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	41	7	But once they were inside the city , Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu and the men with him slaughtered them and threw them into the cistern .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	8	However , ten of them said to Yishma ‘ el , “ Don ’ t kill us , for we have stores of wheat , barley , olive oil and honey hidden in the field. ” So he relented , and did not kill them along with their comrades .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	9	The cistern in which Yishma ‘ el threw the corpses of the men he had murdered with G ’ dalyahu was the one Asa the king had made in fear of Ba ‘ asha king of Isra ’ el ; it was this cistern that Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu filled with the slaughtered men .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	10	Then Yishma ‘ el carried off captive the rest of the people in Mitzpah — the king ’ s daughters and all the people left in Mitzpah , whom N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard had committed to the care of G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam . Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu carried them off captive and left to cross over to the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	11	When Yochanan the son of Kareach and all the military commanders with him heard of all the crimes committed by Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu ,
CJB	Jeremiah	41	12	they took all the men and went to attack Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu . They found him by the big pool in Giv ‘ on .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	13	When all Yishma ‘ el ’ s captives saw Yochanan the son of Kareach and all the military commanders with him , they were overjoyed .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	14	So all the people Yishma ‘ el had carried off captive from Mitzpah turned and joined Yochanan the son of Kareach .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	15	But Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu escaped from Yochanan with eight men and went on to the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	Jeremiah	41	16	Yochanan the son of Kareach and the military commanders with him then took all the rest of the people he had freed from Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu , those Yishma ‘ el had taken from Mitzpah after assassinating G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam — the heroes , the soldiers , the women , the children and the officers he had brought back from Giv ‘ on —
CJB	Jeremiah	41	17	and they left there to stay at Kimham ’ s Lodge , near Beit-Lechem , intending to go on to Egypt
CJB	Jeremiah	41	18	and thus escape the Kasdim . They were afraid of them , because Yishma ‘ el the son of N ’ tanyahu had murdered G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam , whom the king of Bavel had appointed governor of the land .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	42	Then all the military commanders , Yochanan the son of Kareach , Y ’ zanyah the son of Hosha ‘ yah and all the people , from the least to the greatest , approached
CJB	Jeremiah	42	2	and said to Yirmeyahu the prophet , “ I beg you , approve our request : pray for us to Adonai your God for all of this remnant . For , while once we were numerous , only a few of us are left , as you can see .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	3	Pray that Adonai your God will tell us what direction to take and what to do. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	42	4	Yirmeyahu the prophet said to them : “ I hear you . All right , I will pray to Adonai your God , as you have asked . And whatever Adonai answers you , I will tell you ; I will withhold nothing from you. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	42	5	They said to Yirmeyahu , “ May Adonai be a true and faithful witness against us if we fail to do any part of what Adonai your God gives you to tell us .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	6	Whether it be good or bad , we will listen to what Adonai our God says . We are dispatching you to him so that things will go well with us , as we heed what Adonai our God says. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	42	7	Ten days later the word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	8	So he called Yochanan the son of Kareach , all the military commanders with him and all the people , from the least to the greatest ,
CJB	Jeremiah	42	9	and said to them , “ You sent me to present your request to Adonai the God of Isra ’ el . This is what he says :
CJB	Jeremiah	42	10	‘ If you will stay in this land , then I will build you up , not pull you down ; I will plant you and not uproot you ; for I am relenting from the calamity I inflicted on you .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	11	Don ’ t be afraid of the king of Bavel — of whom you are afraid . Don ’ t be afraid of him , ’ says Adonai , ‘ for I am with you to save you and to rescue you from his power .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	12	I will take pity on you , so that he will take pity on you and cause you to return to your own land .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	13	“ But if you say , ‘ We will not stay in this land , ’ thereby not heeding what Adonai your God is saying ,
CJB	Jeremiah	42	14	and instead say , ‘ No , we will go to the land of Egypt ; because there we will not see war or hear the shofar sounding its alarm or be short of food ; so we ’ ll stay there ’ ;
CJB	Jeremiah	42	15	then hear what Adonai says , remnant of Y ’ hudah — this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ If you are determined to go to Egypt and stay there ,
CJB	Jeremiah	42	16	the sword , of which you are afraid , will overtake you there in the land of Egypt ; and the famine , of which you are afraid , will pursue you relentlessly there in Egypt ; and there you will die .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	17	This is how it will be for all the people determined to go to Egypt and stay there — they will die by sword , famine and plague ; none of them will remain or escape the disaster that I will bring upon them. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	42	18	For here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ Just as my anger and fury were poured out on the inhabitants of Yerushalayim , so likewise my fury will be poured out on you if you go to Egypt ; so that you will become an object of condemnation , astonishment , cursing and reproach ; and you will see this place no more. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	42	19	“ Adonai has spoken concerning you , remnant of Y ’ hudah ! Don ’ t go to Egypt ! You know for a fact that I have given you fair warning today .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	20	For you have been behaving deceitfully , against your own interests . You sent me to Adonai your God , saying , ‘ Pray for us to Adonai our God ; tell us everything Adonai our God says , and we will do it. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	42	21	Today I have told it to you , but you haven ’ t heeded any part of what Adonai your God gave me to tell you .
CJB	Jeremiah	42	22	Therefore , know for a fact that you will die by sword , famine and plague in the place where you want to go and live . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	43	43	When Yirmeyahu had finished telling all the people everything Adonai their God had said , which Adonai their God had sent him to tell them , the entire speech cited above ,
CJB	Jeremiah	43	2	then ‘ Azaryah the son of Hosha ‘ yah , Yochanan the son of Kareach and all the men with him had the effrontery to say to Yirmeyahu , “ You are lying ! Adonai our God did not send you to say , ‘ Don ’ t go to Egypt and live there ’ !
CJB	Jeremiah	43	3	Rather , Barukh the son of Neriyah is inciting you against us , so that we can be handed over to the Kasdim to be put to death or carried off as captives to Bavel. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	43	4	So Yochanan the son of Kareach , all the military commanders and all the people did not heed what Adonai said , to live in the land of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Jeremiah	43	5	Instead , Yochanan the son of Kareach and all the military commanders took all the remnant of Y ’ hudah who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven to live in the land of Y ’ hudah —
CJB	Jeremiah	43	6	the men , the women , the children , the king ’ s daughters , everyone N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard had committed to G ’ dalyahu the son of Achikam , the son of Shafan , and Yirmeyahu the prophet and Barukh the son of Neriyah —
CJB	Jeremiah	43	7	and went to the land of Egypt ; for they did not heed what Adonai had said ; and they arrived in Tachpanches .
CJB	Jeremiah	43	8	Then this word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu in Tachpanches :
CJB	Jeremiah	43	9	“ With the men of Y ’ hudah watching , take some big stones , and set them with mortar in the pavement at the entry to Pharaoh ’ s palace in Tachpanches .
CJB	Jeremiah	43	10	Tell them : ‘ This is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ I will summon N ’ vukhadretzar the king of Bavel , my servant , take him and set his throne on these stones I laid here ; he will come and spread his royal canopy over them .
CJB	Jeremiah	43	11	He will come and attack the land of Egypt . Those destined for death — to death ! Those destined for captivity — to captivity ! Those destined for the sword — to the sword !
CJB	Jeremiah	43	12	I will light a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt , and he will burn [ those gods ] or take them captive . He will fold up the land of Egypt like a shepherd folding up his cloak , and leave there victorious .
CJB	Jeremiah	43	13	He will also break the standing-stones of the temple of the sun in the land of Egypt and burn to the ground the temples of the gods of Egypt . ” ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	44	44	This word came to Yirmeyahu concerning all the people from Y ’ hudah living in the land of Egypt — in Migdol , Tachpanches , Nof and the land of Patros :
CJB	Jeremiah	44	2	“ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ You have seen all the disaster I inflicted on Yerushalayim and all the cities of Y ’ hudah ; there they are today , ruined , with no one living in them .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	3	It came about because of the wicked things they did to make me angry — sacrificing to and serving other gods , whom they did not know , neither they , nor you nor your ancestors .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	4	I had sent you all my servants the prophets , sent them frequently , with the message , “ Don ’ t do this horrible thing which I hate ! ”
CJB	Jeremiah	44	5	But they neither listened nor obeyed , so as to turn from their wickedness and stop offering to other gods .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	6	Hence my fury and anger were poured out and ignited in the cities of Y ’ hudah and the streets of Yerushalayim ; so that they became waste and desolate , as they are today. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	44	7	“ Therefore now , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says this : ‘ Why are you committing this great sin against yourselves ? The result can only be to cut you off from Y ’ hudah — men , women , children and babies — so that none of you remain .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	8	For you continue provoking me with the products of your own hands , offering to other gods in the land of Egypt , where you have gone to live as aliens . It will lead only to your destruction and becoming an object of curses and reproaches among all the nations of the earth .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	9	Have you forgotten the wicked deeds of your ancestors , the wicked deeds of the kings of Y ’ hudah , the wicked deeds of their wives , your own wicked deeds , and the wicked deeds of your wives , which they committed in the land of Y ’ hudah and in the streets of Yerushalayim ?
CJB	Jeremiah	44	10	To this day they remain unhumbled ; they have not been afraid , and they have not lived according to my Torah or my regulations that I presented to you and your ancestors. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	44	11	“ Therefore here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ I will decree disaster for you and destroy all of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	12	I will take the remnant of Y ’ hudah , who determined to go to Egypt and live there as aliens , and they will all perish — in the land of Egypt they will fall and perish by sword and famine . They will die , from the least to the greatest , by sword and famine ; and they will become an object of condemnation , astonishment , cursing and reproach .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	13	Yes , I will punish those living in the land of Egypt , as I punished Yerushalayim , by sword , famine and plague ;
CJB	Jeremiah	44	14	so that none of the remnant of Y ’ hudah who went into the land of Egypt to live as aliens will escape or remain , to be able to return to the land of Y ’ hudah . They long to return and live there , but none will return except a few refugees. ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	44	15	Then all the men who knew that their wives were offering incense to other gods , along with all the women standing by , a huge crowd , all the people living in Patros in the land of Egypt , answered Yirmeyahu :
CJB	Jeremiah	44	16	“ As for the word you have just spoken to us in the name of Adonai , we will not listen to you .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	17	Instead , we will certainly continue to fulfill every word our mouths have spoken : we will offer incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her , as we have done , we and our ancestors , our kings and our leaders , in the cities of Y ’ hudah and the streets of Yerushalayim . For then we had plenty of food ; everything was fine , we didn ’ t experience anything unpleasant .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	18	But since we stopped offering to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her , we have lacked everything , and we have been destroyed by sword and famine. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	44	19	[ Then the wives added , ] “ Are we the ones who offer incense to the queen of heaven ? Do we pour out drink offerings to her ? And did we make cakes marked with her image for her and pour out drink offerings to her without our husbands ’ consent ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Yirmeyahu said to all the people — to the men , the women , and all the people who had answered him back :
CJB	Jeremiah	44	21	“ The incense you offered in the cities of Y ’ hudah and in the streets of Yerushalayim — you , your ancestors , your kings , your leaders and the people of the land — Adonai kept remembering and taking note of this [ insult ] ,
CJB	Jeremiah	44	22	until Adonai could no longer bear it , so evil and so detestable were your deeds . This is why your land has become a wasteland , an object for astonishment and cursing , uninhabited , as it is today .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	23	It is because you offered incense , sinned against Adonai , didn ’ t listen to what Adonai said , and didn ’ t live by his Torah , regulations and instructions that this disaster has befallen you , as it is today. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	44	24	In addition , Yirmeyahu said to all the people , but especially the women : “ Hear the word of Adonai , all Y ’ hudah who are in the land of Egypt ;
CJB	Jeremiah	44	25	this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : ‘ You and your wives stated your intentions with your mouths and performed them with your hands — you said , “ We will certainly fulfill our vows that we made to offer incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her. ” ’ Without doubt , you will indeed fulfill every point of your vows .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	26	Therefore hear the word of Adonai , all Y ’ hudah living in the land of Egypt : ‘ I swear by my own great name , ’ says Adonai , ‘ that no man of Y ’ hudah will speak my name again in the land of Egypt , swearing , “ As Adonai , God , lives. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	44	27	I am watching over them for harm , not for good . All the men of Y ’ hudah in the land of Egypt will be destroyed by sword and famine , until none of them is left .
CJB	Jeremiah	44	28	Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Y ’ hudah few in number ; and all the remnant of Y ’ hudah who went into the land of Egypt to live will know whose word will stand — mine or theirs !
CJB	Jeremiah	44	29	Moreover , here is a sign for you , ’ says Adonai , ‘ that I will punish you in this place , so that you can know that my threats of disaster against you will come true. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	44	30	Adonai says , ‘ I will hand over Pharaoh Hofra king of Egypt to his enemies , to those seeking his life — just as I handed Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah over to N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel , his enemy , who sought his life . ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	45	45	% )
CJB	Jeremiah	45	2	“ This is what Adonai the God of Isra ’ el says concerning you , Barukh . You said ,
CJB	Jeremiah	45	3	‘ Woe to me now ! Adonai has compounded my pain with sorrow , I am weary from groaning , and I can find no relief ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	45	4	“ Tell him that Adonai says : ‘ I will tear down what I built up , I will uproot what I planted , and this throughout the land .
CJB	Jeremiah	45	5	Are you seeking great things for yourself ? Don ’ t !

CJB	Jeremiah	46	6	“ The swift can not flee , nor the heroes escape . In the north , by the Euphrates River , they have stumbled and fallen. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	46	7	Who is this , rising up like the Nile , like rivers whose waters surge out in flood ?
CJB	Jeremiah	46	8	It is Egypt , rising up like the Nile , like rivers whose waters surge out in flood , saying , “ I will surge out and cover the earth , destroying the city along with its people. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	46	9	Charge , horses ! Full speed ahead , chariots ! Let the warriors attack ! — Kush and Put , bearing their shields , and the Ludim , strung bows in hand .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	10	For on that day Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot will have a day of vengeance for avenging himself on his enemies . The sword will destroy , have its fill , be made drunk on their blood . Yes , Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot decrees slaughter in the land to the north by the Euphrates River .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	11	Go up to Gil ‘ ad for its healing resin , virgin daughter of Egypt . You try many medicines , all in vain ; for you there is no cure .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	12	The nations have heard about your disgrace ; your shrieks fill the earth as warrior trips over warrior , both falling down together .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	13	This word Adonai spoke to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning how N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel would come and attack the land of Egypt :
CJB	Jeremiah	46	14	“ Proclaim in Egypt , announce in Migdol , announce in Nof and Tachpanches ; say : ‘ Take your stand ! Get ready ! For all around you the sword is destroying .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	15	Why has your strong one been overthrown ? He failed to stand because Adonai pushed him down .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	16	He caused many to trip ; yes , they fell all over each other. ’ ” Then they said , “ Let ’ s get up , let ’ s return to our own people , back to the land where we were born , away from the sword that destroys. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	46	17	They cried there , “ Pharaoh king of Egypt makes noise , but he lets the right time [ for action ] slip by. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	46	18	“ As I live , ” says the king , whose name is Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ when he comes , he will be [ as mighty ] as Tavor among the mountains , as Karmel next to the sea .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	19	“ Daughter living in Egypt , prepare what you need for exile ; for Nof will become a ruin , laid waste , without inhabitant .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	20	Egypt is a beautiful female calf ; but a horsefly from the north has come to attack her .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	21	Her mercenaries too , that she had with her , were like well-fed calves in a stable ; but they too have withdrawn in retreat , they all ran away without standing their ground . For their day of disaster has come over them , the time for them to be punished .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	22	Egypt hisses like a snake , as the enemy ’ s army marches ahead , attacking her with their axes like lumbermen chopping trees .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	23	They cut down her forest , ” says Adonai , “ for they can not be numbered ; yes , there are more of them than locusts , far too many to count .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	24	The daughter of Egypt is put to shame , handed over to the people from the north. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	46	25	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ I will punish Amon from No , Pharaoh , and Egypt with her gods and kings — that is , Pharaoh and those who trust in him ;
CJB	Jeremiah	46	26	I will hand them over to those who seek their lives , to N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel and to his servants . But afterwards , Egypt will be inhabited , as in the past , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	27	“ Yet don ’ t be afraid , Ya ‘ akov my servant ; don ’ t be distressed , Isra ’ el . For I will save you from faraway places , and your offspring from the lands where they are held captive . Ya ‘ akov will return and be at peace , quiet , with no one to make him afraid .
CJB	Jeremiah	46	28	Don ’ t be afraid , Ya ‘ akov my servant , ” says Adonai , “ for I am with you . I will finish off all the nations where I have scattered you . However , you I will not finish off , I will discipline you as you deserve , but not completely destroy you . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	47	47	This word of Adonai came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning the P ’ lishtim before Pharaoh attacked ‘ Azah :
CJB	Jeremiah	47	2	“ Here is what Adonai says : ‘ Water is rising out of the north ; it will become a flooding stream , flooding the land and all that is in it , the city and its inhabitants . The people are crying out in alarm , everyone in the land is weeping
CJB	Jeremiah	47	3	at the thunderous pound of his stallions ’ hoofs , at his rattling chariots ’ rumbling wheels . Fathers fail to turn back for their children ; instead , their hands hang limp ,
CJB	Jeremiah	47	4	because the day has come for destroying all the P ’ lishtim , for cutting off from Tzor and Tzidon the last of their allies ; for Adonai is destroying the P ’ lishtim , the remnant from the island of Kaftor .
CJB	Jeremiah	47	5	‘ Azah is shaved bald , Ashkelon reduced to silence . Those of you who remain in their valley , how long will you go on gashing yourselves ? ’ ”
CJB	Jeremiah	47	6	Oh , sword of Adonai , how long till you can be quiet ? Put yourself back in your scabbard ! Stop ! Be still !
CJB	Jeremiah	47	7	But how can you be still ? For Adonai has given it orders against Ashkelon , against the seacoast ; he has assigned it its task there .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	48	Concerning Mo ’ av , this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ Woe to N ’ vo , for it is ravaged ; Kiryatayim disgraced and captured . Misgav is put to shame , distressed .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	2	“ In Mo ’ av , nothing is left to praise . At Heshbon they plotted her downfall : ‘ Come , we ’ ll cut her off as a nation. ’ You too , Madmein , will be silenced ; the sword pursues behind you .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	3	An agonized cry from Horonayim , ruin , terrible devastation !
CJB	Jeremiah	48	4	Mo ’ av has been shattered ; the cries of her young ones are heard ,
CJB	Jeremiah	48	5	as they ascend the slopes of Luchit , weeping bitterly as they climb . On the road down to Horonayim shrieks of destruction ring out. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	48	6	Flee ! Save your lives ! Be strong , like a tamarisk in the desert .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	7	Because you trust in your deeds and your wealth , you too will be captured . Together with his priests and princes , K ’ mosh will go into exile .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	8	A destroyer will descend on every city , no city will escape . The valley too will perish , the plain will be laid waste , as Adonai as said .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	9	Give Mo ’ av wings , so it can fly and get away . Its cities will become ruins , with no one to live in them .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	10	A curse on him who does the work of Adonai carelessly ! A curse on him who withholds his sword from blood !
CJB	Jeremiah	48	11	Mo ’ av has lived at ease from his youth ; he is [ wine ] settled on its dregs , not decanted from jar to jar — he has not gone into exile . Therefore it retains its own [ bad ] taste , its aroma remains unchanged .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	12	“ So the days are coming , ” says Adonai , “ when I will send people to tilt him ; they will tilt his jars , emptying them and shattering the wine-flasks to pieces .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	13	Mo ’ av will be disappointed by K ’ mosh then , just as the house of Isra ’ el was disappointed by Beit-El , a god in whom they had put their trust .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	14	“ How can you say , ‘ We are heroes , warriors valiant in battle ’ ?
CJB	Jeremiah	48	15	They are ravaging Mo ’ av , attacking its cities ; its best young men go down to be slaughtered , ” says the king , whose name is Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	16	Mo ’ av ’ s ruin is coming soon , its disaster speeds on swiftly .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	17	Pity him , all of you who are near him , all of you who know his name ; say , “ How the mighty scepter is shattered , that splendid staff ! ”
CJB	Jeremiah	48	18	Descend from your glory , and sit in thirst , daughter living in Divon ; for Mo ’ av ’ s destroyer advances on you ; he has destroyed your strongholds .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	19	Stand by the road and watch , inhabitant of ‘ Aro ‘ er ; ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping , “ What is going on ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	48	20	Mo ’ av is disgraced , indeed , destroyed . Wail aloud ! Shriek ! Proclaim it by the Arnon that Mo ’ av has been laid waste .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	21	Judgment has come on the Plain — on Holon , Yachtzah , Mefa ‘ at ,
CJB	Jeremiah	48	22	Divon , N ’ vo , Beit-Diblatayim ,
CJB	Jeremiah	48	23	Kiryatayim , Beit-Gamul , Beit-M ‘ on ,
CJB	Jeremiah	48	24	K ’ riot , Botzrah and all the cities in the land of Mo ’ av , far and near .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	25	“ Mo ’ av ’ s strength is cut down , his arm is broken , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	26	Because Mo ’ av boasted against Adonai , make him so drunk that he wallows in his own vomit and becomes a laughingstock .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	27	After all , Isra ’ el was a laughingstock for you . He didn ’ t associate with thieves ; nevertheless , whenever you spoke of him , you shook your head .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	28	You who live in Mo ’ av , leave the cities , and live on the rocks ; be like the dove who makes her nest in a hole in the rock at the mouth of a cave .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	29	We have heard of the pride of Mo ’ av : so very proud he is ! — presumptuous , proud , conceited ; so haughty his heart !
CJB	Jeremiah	48	30	“ I know what meager ground he has for his arrogance , ” says Adonai . “ His boasting has nothing behind it , and it hasn ’ t accomplished a thing. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	48	31	Therefore I wail for Mo ’ av ; for all Mo ’ av I cry ; for the people of Kir-Heres I lament .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	32	I will weep for you , vineyard of Sivmah , more than I wept for Ya ‘ zer . Your branches spread to the sea , reaching as far as the sea of Ya ‘ zer . On your summer fruits and on your vintage the destroyer has fallen .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	33	Gladness and joy have been removed from productive fields and the land of Mo ’ av . “ I have stopped the flow of wine from the vats and the shouts of those who tread the grapes — those shouts of joy are stilled. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	48	34	The cries from Heshbon to El ‘ aleh are heard as far away as Yachatz ; those from Tzo ‘ ar to Horonayim are heard in ‘ Eglat-Shlishiyah ; for even the waters of Nimrim have become a desolate waste .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	35	“ Moreover , ” says Adonai , “ in Mo ’ av I will put an end to anyone sacrificing on a high place or offering incense to his gods. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	48	36	This is why my heart is moaning for Mo ’ av like funeral flutes , why my heart moans for the men of Kir-Heres like funeral flutes ; for the wealth they produced has vanished .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	37	Every head has been shaved bald , every beard has been clipped short , gashes are on every hand , sackcloth around every waist .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	38	On all the housetops of Mo ’ av and in its open places — lamentation everywhere ! “ For I have broken Mo ’ av like a pot that nobody wants , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	39	Wail , “ How shattered is Mo ’ av ! How shamefully in retreat ! ” Thus will Mo ’ av become an object of ridicule and distress to all its neighbors .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	40	For here is what Adonai says : “ Look ! Down he swoops like a vulture , spreading his wings against Mo ’ av —
CJB	Jeremiah	48	41	the cities are captured , the strongholds are seized . On that day the hearts of Mo ’ av ’ s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	42	Mo ’ av will be destroyed as a people , because he boasted against Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	43	Terror , pit and trap are upon you , people of Mo ’ av , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	44	“ Whoever flees from the terror will fall into the pit ; and he who climbs up out of the pit will be caught in the trap . For I will bring on her , on Mo ’ av , the year for her punishment , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	45	“ In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stop , exhausted . For fire breaks out from Heshbon , a flame from inside Sichon , consuming the sides and tops of the heads of Mo ’ av ’ s noisy boasters .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	46	Woe to you , Mo ’ av ! K ’ mosh ’ s people are doomed ! For your sons have been taken captive , and your daughters led into captivity .
CJB	Jeremiah	48	47	Yet I will end Mo ’ av ’ s exile in the acharit-hayamim , ” says Adonai . This is the judgment on Mo ’ av .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	49	Concerning the people of ‘ Amon , here is what Adonai says : “ Has Isra ’ el no sons ? Has he no heir ? Then why has Malkam inherited Gad , with his people settled in its cities ?
CJB	Jeremiah	49	2	Therefore , ” says Adonai , “ the days are coming when I will sound the battle alarm against Rabbah and the people of ‘ Amon ; it will become a tel of ruins , her villages burned to the ground . Then Isra ’ el will inherit from them who disinherited him , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	3	“ Wail , Heshbon , for ‘ Ai is doomed ! Cry out , daughters of Rabbah ! Wear sackcloth and mourn , running here and there among the sheep pens . For Malkam will go into exile , together with his priests and officers .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	4	Why do you take such pride in the valleys , your well-watered valleys , rebellious daughter ? You trusted in your riches and thought , ‘ Who can attack me ? ’
CJB	Jeremiah	49	5	I am bringing terror on you , ” says Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot , “ from every side . Each of you will be driven out headlong , with no one to gather the fugitives .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	6	But afterwards , I will bring back the exiles of ‘ Amon , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	7	Concerning Edom , this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : “ Is there no wisdom left in Teman ? Have her wise men forgotten how to counsel ? Has their wisdom vanished ?
CJB	Jeremiah	49	8	Flee ! Turn back ! Hide yourselves well , you who live in D ’ dan ; for I am bringing calamity on ‘ Esav , when the time for me to punish him comes .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	9	If grape-pickers came to you , they would leave no grapes for gleaning . If thieves came at night , they would destroy until they were satisfied .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	10	So I , for my part , have stripped ‘ Esav bare , I have exposed his hiding-places ; he will not be able to hide himself . He is doomed — sons , brothers and neighbors — so that he is no more .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	11	Leave your orphans ; I will keep them alive ; let your widows trust in me. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	49	12	For this is what Adonai says : “ Those who do not deserve to drink from this cup will have to drink it anyway , so should you go unpunished ? No , you will not go unpunished ; you will certainly drink it .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	13	For I have sworn by myself , ” says Adonai , “ that Botzrah will become a ruin and an object of astonishment , reproach and cursing ; all its cities will be ruins forever. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	49	14	I have heard a message from Adonai : “ A messenger is sent among the nations , saying : ‘ Gather together , and march against her ! Prepare for battle ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	49	15	Here ! I will make you least among nations , the most despised of people .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	16	Your capacity to terrorize has deceived you and made you arrogant . You make your home in the rocky crags and seize the top of the mountain ; but even if you build your nest high as an eagle ’ s , from there I will drag you down , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	17	Edom will become an object of horror ; everyone passing by will whistle in astonishment at all its disasters .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	18	It will be like the overthrow of S ’ dom , ‘ Amora and their neighboring towns , ” says Adonai . “ No one will settle there any more , no human being will live there again .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	19	It will be like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Yarden against a strong settlement : in an instant I will chase him away and appoint over it whomever I choose . For who is like me ? Who can call me to account ? What shepherd can stand up to me ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	49	20	So hear the plan of Adonai that he has devised against Edom , and his purpose that he will accomplish against those who live in Teman : the least of the flock will drag them away ; their own pasture will be in shock at them .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	21	The earth quakes at the sound of their fall ; their cry can be heard at the Sea of Suf .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	22	Like a vulture he will soar , swoop down and spread out his wings against Botzrah . On that day the hearts of Edom ’ s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	23	Concerning Dammesek : “ Hamat and Arpad are confused ; having heard bad news , they dissolve in fear , like the churning sea , which can not calm itself .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	24	Dammesek , weakened , turns to flee ; trembling has seized her ; anguish and pain take hold of her like the pains of a woman in labor .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	25	How can a city so praised be deserted , a city that gave me such joy ?
CJB	Jeremiah	49	26	Therefore her young men will fall in her squares , and all her warriors be silenced on that day , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	27	“ I will light a fire inside Dammesek ’ s walls which will consume the palaces of Ben-Hadad. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	49	28	Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hatzor , which N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel struck , Adonai says : “ Set out ! March against Kedar ! Plunder the people of the east !
CJB	Jeremiah	49	29	They will seize their tents and their flocks , their tent curtains and all their equipment ; their camels too they will take for themselves and shout at them , ‘ Terror in every direction ! ’
CJB	Jeremiah	49	30	Flee ! Leave your homes ! Hide yourselves well , you who live in Hatzor , ” says Adonai ; “ for N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel has devised a plan against you ; he has formed a scheme against you .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	31	Get up ! March on a nation at ease , that lives secure , ” says Adonai . “ They have neither gates nor bars ; they live in isolation .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	32	Their camels will be booty , their many cattle a spoil . I will scatter to the winds those who shave the sides of their heads ; From every direction I will bring their disaster on them , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	33	“ Hatzor will be a place for jackals to live , desolate forever ; no one will settle there any more , no human being will live there again. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	49	34	This is the word of Adonai that came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning ‘ Eilam at the beginning of the reign of Tzidkiyahu king of Y ’ hudah :
CJB	Jeremiah	49	35	“ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ I will break ‘ Eilam ’ s bow , the mainstay of their might .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	36	I will bring against ‘ Eilam the four winds from the four quarters of the sky and scatter them to all those winds . There will not be one nation to which the dispersed of ‘ Eilam will not come .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	37	I will break ‘ Eilam before their foes , before those who seek their lives ; I will bring disaster on them , my burning anger , ’ says Adonai . ‘ I will send the sword to pursue them until I have finished them off .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	38	I will put my throne in ‘ Eilam and destroy their king and leaders , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	49	39	‘ But in the acharit-hayamim , I will bring back the exiles of ‘ Eilam , ’ says Adonai . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	50	50	This is the word which Adonai spoke concerning Bavel , concerning the land of the Kasdim , through Yirmeyahu the prophet :
CJB	Jeremiah	50	2	“ Declare it among the nations , proclaim it ! Hoist a banner , proclaim it , don ’ t hide it ! Say : ‘ Bavel is captured . Bel is shamed , M ’ rodakh disgraced , her images shamed , her idols disgraced. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	50	3	For from the north a nation is marching against her that will desolate her land . No one will live there — both humans and animals have fled and gone .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	4	In those days , at that time , ” says Adonai , “ the people of Isra ’ el will come , together with the people of Y ’ hudah . They will weep as they go their way , seeking Adonai their God .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	5	They will ask the way to Tziyon ; and , turning their faces toward it , will say , ‘ Come , join yourselves to Adonai by an everlasting covenant never to be forgotten. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	50	6	My people have been lost sheep . My shepherds made them go astray , turning them loose in the mountains . As they wandered from mountain to hill , they lost track of where their home is .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	7	Everyone finding them ate them up . Their enemies said , ‘ We aren ’ t guilty ; for they sinned against Adonai , the resting place of justice ; yes , against Adonai , their ancestors ’ hope. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	50	8	Flee from Bavel ! Leave the land of the Kasdim ! Be like male goats leading the flock ;
CJB	Jeremiah	50	9	for I will stir up and bring against Bavel an alliance of great nations from the country to the north . They will array themselves against her ; from there she will be captured . Their arrows are like those of a death-dealing warrior ; none will return in vain .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	10	The land of the Kasdim will be plundered ; all who plunder it will get enough , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	11	“ Because you are glad , because you exult , you plunderers of my heritage ; because you frisk like a calf in the grass and neigh like stallions ;
CJB	Jeremiah	50	12	your mother will be utterly shamed , she who bore you will be disgraced . Here she is ! — last among the nations , a desert , parched and barren .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	13	Because of the anger of Adonai , no one will live there any more ; all of it will be desolate . Everyone passing Bavel will whistle in shock at all her plagues .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	14	“ Take your positions surrounding Bavel , all you whose bows are strung ; shoot at her , spare no arrows ; because she sinned against Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	15	From all sides raise the war cry against her ! Now she surrenders ! Her buttresses fall , her walls are thrown down , for this is the vengeance of Adonai . Avenge yourself on her ! As she has done , do to her !
CJB	Jeremiah	50	16	Cut off the sower from Bavel and the reaper with sickle at harvest-time . For fear of the destroying sword everyone returns to his own people , each one flees to his own land .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	17	“ Isra ’ el is a stray lamb , driven away by lions . First to devour him was Ashur ’ s king ; and the last to break his bones is this N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	50	18	Therefore Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ I will punish the king of Bavel and his land as I punished the king of Ashur .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	19	I will bring Isra ’ el back to his pasture , to graze on the Karmel and the Bashan , on the hills of Efrayim and in Gil ‘ ad until he has his fill .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	20	In those days , at that time , ” says Adonai , “ Isra ’ el ’ s guilt will be sought , but there will be none , and Y ’ hudah ’ s sins , but they won ’ t be found ; for I will pardon the remnant I leave .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	21	“ Attack the land of Meratayim ; attack it and those living in P ’ kod . Waste them , utterly destroy them ; do all I have ordered you , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	22	“ The sound of battle is heard in the land , with great destruction !
CJB	Jeremiah	50	23	How the hammer of the whole earth lies hacked apart and shattered ! What an object of horror among the nations Bavel has become !
CJB	Jeremiah	50	24	I set a trap and caught you , Bavel , before you knew it . You were discovered and seized , because you challenged Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	25	Adonai has opened his store of arms and brought out the weapons of his wrath ; for Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot has work to do in the land of the Kasdim .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	26	Attack her from every direction ! Open her stores of grain ! Pile her up like heaps of grain ; destroy her completely ; leave nothing !
CJB	Jeremiah	50	27	Kill all her bulls ! let them go down to be slaughtered ! Woe to them ! for their day has come , the time for them to be punished. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	50	28	Hear the sound of the fugitives , of those escaping from Bavel , coming to proclaim in Tziyon the vengeance of Adonai our God , vengeance over his temple .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	29	“ Call up archers against Bavel , all whose bows are strung . Besiege her from every side , let no one escape . Repay her for her deeds ; as she has done , do to her . For she insulted Adonai , the Holy One of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	30	This is why her young men will fall in her open places , why all her warriors will be silenced on that day , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	31	“ I am against you , arrogant [ nation ] , ” says Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot . “ For your day has come , the time for you to be punished .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	32	The arrogant [ nation ] will stumble and fall , and no one will lift him up again . I will set his cities on fire , and it will devour everything around him. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	50	33	Thus says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot : “ The people of Isra ’ el are oppressed , and so are the people of Y ’ hudah . Those who took them captive hold them fast ; they refuse to let them go .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	34	But their redeemer is strong ; Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is his name . He will thoroughly plead their cause , so that he can give rest to the land but unrest to those who live in Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	35	Adonai says , “ A sword hangs over the Kasdim , and over those who live in Bavel , over her leaders and over her sages .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	36	A sword hangs over the lying diviners ; they will become fools . A sword hangs over her warriors ; they will be disgraced .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	37	A sword hangs over their horses , also over their chariots , also over the foreigners within her ; they will become like women . A sword hangs over her treasures ; they will be robbed .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	38	A drought hangs over her waters ; they will be dried up . For this is a land of idols ; they go mad over these horrors of theirs .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	39	“ Therefore wildcats and jackals will live there , and ostriches will settle there . It will never again be peopled , it will be uninhabited age after age ;
CJB	Jeremiah	50	40	as when God overthrew S ’ dom , ‘ Amora and their neighboring towns , ” says Adonai . “ No one will settle there any more , no human being will live there again .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	41	“ Look ! A people is coming from the north ; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	42	They are armed with bow and spear ; they are cruel , without compassion ; their sound is like the roaring sea , as they ride forth on horses . Their men take their battle positions against you , daughter of Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	43	The king of Bavel has heard news of them ; his hands droop , helpless . Anguish seizes hold of him and pain , like a woman in labor .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	44	“ It will be like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Yarden against a strong settlement ; in an instant I will chase him away and appoint over it whomever I choose . For who is like me ? Who can call me to account ? What shepherd can stand up to me ? ”
CJB	Jeremiah	50	45	So hear the plan of Adonai that he has devised against Bavel , and his goals that he will accomplish against the land of the Kasdim : the least of the flock will drag them away ; their own pasture will be in shock at them .
CJB	Jeremiah	50	46	At the sound of Bavel ’ s capture the earth quakes ; their cry is heard throughout the nations .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	51	“ The reproaches we have heard have put us to shame , disgrace covers our faces ; because foreigners have entered the sanctuaries of Adonai ’ s house. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	51	2	Against Bavel I will send foreigners to winnow her and leave her land empty . They will besiege her from every side on the day of disaster .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	3	Let the archer draw his bow , let him flaunt his coat of mail ; do not spare her young men , completely destroy her whole army .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	4	In the land of the Kasdim the slain will fall , those thrust through [ by the sword ] in her streets .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	5	Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah are not left widowed of their God , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ; but the land of [ the Kasdim ] is full of guilt before the Holy One of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	51	6	Flee from Bavel , let each one save his life ! Don ’ t perish because of her guilt . For the time has come for the vengeance of Adonai ; he will repay her what she deserves .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	7	Bavel was a gold cup in the hands of Adonai ; it made the whole earth drunk — the nations drank her wine ; this is why the nations have lost their senses .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	8	Bavel has suddenly fallen . She is broken ; wail for her . Bring healing ointment for her wounds ; perhaps she can be healed .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	9	“ We tried to heal Bavel , but she can not be healed . So leave her alone , and each of us will return to his own country. ” For the judgment against her rises to the skies and reaches even the clouds .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	10	Adonai has brought forth our victory . Come , let us proclaim in Tziyon the work of Adonai our God !
CJB	Jeremiah	51	11	Sharpen the arrows ! Fill the quivers ! Adonai roused the spirit of the kings of the Medes , because he plans to destroy Bavel . This is the vengeance of Adonai vengeance over his temple .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	12	Raise a standard against the walls of Bavel ! Strengthen the guard ! Post the sentries ! Prepare ambushes ! For Adonai has both planned and accomplished what he promised to do to those living in Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	13	You who live near plenty of water , so rich in treasure — your end has come , your time for being cut off !
CJB	Jeremiah	51	14	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot has sworn by himself , “ I will fill you with men as numerous as grasshoppers ; they will raise over you a shout of triumph. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	51	15	He made the earth by his power , established the world by his wisdom spread out the sky by his understanding .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	16	When he thunders , the waters in heaven roar , he raises clouds from the ends of the earth , he makes the lightning flash in the rain and brings the wind out from his storehouses .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	17	At this , everyone is proved stupid , ignorant , every goldsmith put to shame by his idol ! The figures he casts are a fraud , there is no breath in them ,
CJB	Jeremiah	51	18	they are nothings , ridiculous objects ; when the day for their punishment comes , they will perish .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	19	Ya ‘ akov ’ s portion is not like these , for he is the one who formed all things , including the tribe he claims as his heritage . Adonai-Tzva ’ ot is his name .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	20	“ [ Bavel ] you are my war club and weapons of war — with you I shatter nations ; with you I destroy kingdoms ;
CJB	Jeremiah	51	21	with you I shatter horses and their riders ; with you I shatter chariots and their drivers ;
CJB	Jeremiah	51	22	with you I shatter husbands and wives ; with you I shatter old and young ; with you I shatter young men and virgins ;
CJB	Jeremiah	51	23	with you I shatter shepherds and their flocks ; with you I shatter farmers and their teams ; with you I shatter governors and deputies .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	24	“ But I will repay Bavel and all living in the land of the Kasdim for all the evil they did in Tziyon , ” says Adonai , “ before your eyes [ , Y ’ hudah ] . ”
CJB	Jeremiah	51	25	“ I am against you , destructive mountain , destroying all the earth , ” says Adonai . “ I will stretch out my hand against you , to send you tumbling down from the crags and make you a burned-out mountain .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	26	No one will make cornerstones or foundation-stones from you again ; but you will be desolate forever , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	27	Raise up a banner in the land , blow the shofar among the nations . Prepare the nations for war against her . Summon kingdoms against her — Ararat , Minni and Ashkenaz . Appoint an officer against her ; bring up horses like bristling grasshoppers .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	28	Prepare the nations against her , the kings of the Medes , his governors and deputies , and all the land he controls .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	29	The earth quakes and writhes , as Adonai ’ s designs against Bavel are fulfilled , to make the land of Bavel a ruin , with no one living there .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	30	Bavel ’ s warriors have given up fighting ; they remain in their fortresses ; their courage has failed ; they are now like women . Her homes are on fire , her gate-bars broken .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	31	One runner runs to meet another , messenger to meet messenger , to report to the king of Bavel that every part of his city is taken ,
CJB	Jeremiah	51	32	the fords have been occupied , and the swamp thickets set on fire , while the warriors are seized with panic .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	33	For here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , says : “ The daughter of Bavel is like a threshing-floor at treading-time . Just a little while longer , and the time for harvesting her will come. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	51	34	N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel has devoured me , crushed me . He left me like an empty pot . Like a monster , he swallowed me whole . With my delicacies he stuffed his belly ; then he rinsed me out .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	35	But one who lives in Tziyon will say , “ May my torn flesh be avenged on Bavel ” ; and Yerushalayim will say , “ May my blood be avenged on the Kasdim. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	51	36	Therefore here is what Adonai says : “ I will plead your cause . I will take vengeance for you . I will dry up her river and make her water sources dry .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	37	Bavel will become a heap of ruins , a place for jackals to live , an object of horror and hissing , with no one living there .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	38	Together they roar like young lions , growl like lion cubs .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	39	When they are hot with desire , I will prepare them a drink . I will make them so drunk they will have convulsions , sleep forever and never wake up , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	40	“ I will drag them down like lambs to be slaughtered , like rams and male goats. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	51	41	Sheshakh has been captured , the pride of the whole earth seized ! Bavel has become an object of horror throughout the nations !
CJB	Jeremiah	51	42	The sea has flooded Bavel , overwhelmed her with its raging waves .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	43	Her cities have become desolate — parched , arid land , a land where no one lives ; nobody even passes through .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	44	“ I will punish Bel in Bavel and make him disgorge what he swallowed . The nations will no longer flow to him . Bavel ’ s wall will fall .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	45	Get out of her , my people ! Each one , save yourself from Adonai ’ s furious anger !
CJB	Jeremiah	51	46	Don ’ t be fainthearted , don ’ t be afraid of the rumors spreading abroad in the land . One year one rumor comes , the next year another one , rumors of violence in the land and rulers fighting rulers .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	47	Therefore , listen ! The days are coming when I will pass judgment on Bavel ’ s idols . Her whole land will be put to shame , as all her slain fall on home soil .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	48	Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will sing for joy over Bavel ; for the plunderers from the north are coming to her , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	49	Just as Bavel caused the slain of Isra ’ el to fall , so at Bavel will fall the slain of all the land .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	50	You who escaped the sword , go ! Don ’ t stand still ! Remember Adonai from afar , let Yerushalayim come into your minds .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	52	“ Therefore , ” says Adonai , “ the days are coming when I will pass judgment on her idols , and the wounded will groan throughout her land .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	53	Even if Bavel scales the heavens or reinforces her lofty stronghold , plunderers will come to her from me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	54	An agonized cry is heard from Bavel ! Great destruction in the land of the Kasdim !
CJB	Jeremiah	51	55	For Adonai is plundering Bavel and silencing her noisy din — their waves roar like the raging ocean , their clamor sounds and resounds .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	56	Yes , the plunderer has fallen upon her , fallen on Bavel . Her warriors are captured , their bows are broken . For Adonai is a God of retribution ; he will surely repay .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	57	“ I will intoxicate her leaders and sages , her governors , deputies and warriors . They will sleep forever and never wake up , ” says the king , whose name is Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	58	Thus says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot : “ The wide walls of Bavel will be razed to the ground , her lofty gates will be set on fire . The peoples are toiling for nothing , the nation ’ s labor goes up in flames , and everyone is exhausted. ”
CJB	Jeremiah	51	59	This is the order which Yirmeyahu the prophet gave to S ’ rayah the son of Neriyah , the son of Machseyah , when he went to Bavel with Tzidkiyahu the king of Y ’ hudah in the fourth year of his reign . S ’ rayah was quartermaster .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	60	Yirmeyahu had written on a separate scroll all the above words describing the disaster that was to befall Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	51	61	Yirmeyahu said to S ’ rayah , “ See to it that when you arrive in Bavel you read all these words aloud . Then say ,
CJB	Jeremiah	51	62	‘ Adonai , you have promised to destroy this place , that no one will live here , neither human nor animal , but that it will be desolate forever. ’
CJB	Jeremiah	51	63	When you finish reading this scroll , tie a rock to it , throw it into the middle of the Euphrates ,
CJB	Jeremiah	51	64	and say , ‘ Like this , Bavel will sink , never to rise again , because of the disaster I am bringing on her ; and they will grow weary. ’ ” ( Up to here , these have been the words of Yirmeyahu . )
CJB	Jeremiah	52	52	Tzidkiyahu was twenty-one years old when he began to rule , and he ruled for eleven years in Yerushalayim . His mother ’ s name was Hamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu , from Livnah .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	2	He did what was evil from Adonai ’ s perspective , following the example of everything Y ’ hoyakim had done .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	3	And it was because of Adonai ’ s anger that all these things happened to Yerushalayim and Y ’ hudah , until he had thrown them out of his presence . Tzidkiyahu rebelled against the king of Bavel ;
CJB	Jeremiah	52	4	so in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , on the tenth day of the month , N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel marched against Yerushalayim with his entire army . He set up camp against it and built siege towers against it on every side .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	5	The city remained under siege into the eleventh year of King Tzidkiyahu .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	6	On the ninth day of the fourth month , when the famine in the city was so severe that there was no food for the people of the land ,
CJB	Jeremiah	52	7	they broke through into the city . All the soldiers fled and left the city by night through the gate between the two walls , near the king ’ s garden . Because the Kasdim were surrounding the city , they took the route through the ‘ Aravah .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	8	But the army of the Kasdim went in pursuit of the king and overtook Tzidkiyahu on the plains near Yericho ; all his troops deserted him .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	9	Then they took the king and brought him up to the king of Bavel in Rivlah , in the land of Hamat , where he passed judgment on him .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	10	The king of Bavel slaughtered his sons before his eyes ; he also slaughtered all the leading men of Y ’ hudah in Rivlah .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	11	Then the king of Bavel put out Tzidkiyahu ’ s eyes , bound him in chains , carried him off to Bavel and kept him in prison until the day of his death .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	12	In the fifth month , on the tenth day of the month , which was also the nineteenth year of King N ’ vukhadretzar , king of Bavel , N ’ vuzar ’ adan , the commander of the guard and a close associate of the king of Bavel , entered Yerushalayim .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	13	He burned down the house of Adonai , the royal palace and all the houses in Yerushalayim — every notable person ’ s house he burned to the ground .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	14	The whole army of the Kasdim , who were with the commander of the guard , broke down all the walls of Yerushalayim on every side .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	15	N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard then deported some of the poor people , the remaining population of the city , the deserters who had defected to the king of Bavel and the rest of the common people .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	16	But N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard left behind some of the poor people of the land to be vineyard-workers and farmers .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	17	The Kasdim smashed the bronze columns of the house of Adonai , also the trolleys and bronze Sea that were in the house of Adonai , and carried their bronze to Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	18	They also took away the pots , shovels , snuffers , basins , pans , and all the bronze articles they had used in worship .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	19	The commander of the guard took the cups , censers , sprinkling bowls , pots , menorahs , pans and bowls — everything made of gold and everything made of silver .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	20	The bronze in the two columns , the one Sea , and the twelve bronze bulls under the bases , all of which Shlomo had made for the house of Adonai , was more than could be weighed .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	21	As for the columns , the height of one column was thirty-one-and-a-half feet ; it took a twenty-one-foot measuring line to go around it ; and its thickness was four fingers — it was hollow .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	22	On it was a capital of brass eight-and-three quarters feet high , with netting and pomegranates all around the capital , all of bronze ; the second column was similar , also with pomegranates .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the outside ; while the total number of pomegranates in the netting was one hundred .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	24	The commander of the guard took [ prisoner ] S ’ rayah the chief cohen , Tz ’ fanyah the second-ranking cohen , and three doorkeepers .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	25	From the city he took an official in charge of the soldiers , seven close associates of the king who had been found in the city , the army commander ’ s secretary in charge of military conscription , and sixty of the common people found inside the city .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	26	N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Bavel in Rivlah .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	27	There in Rivlah , in the land of Hamat , the king of Bavel had them put to death . Thus Y ’ hudah was carried away captive out of his land .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	28	The numbers of people deported by N ’ vukhadretzar were as follows : in the seventh year , 3,023 persons from Y ’ hudah ;
CJB	Jeremiah	52	29	in the eighteenth year of N ’ vukhadretzar ,
CJB	Jeremiah	52	832	persons from Yerushalayim ;
CJB	Jeremiah	52	30	and in the twenty-third year of N ’ vukhadretzar , N ’ vuzar ’ adan the commander of the guard deported
CJB	Jeremiah	52	745	persons from Y ’ hudah ; the total comes to 4,600 persons .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	31	In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Y ’ hoyakhin king of Y ’ hudah , in the twelfth month , on the twenty-fifth day of the month , Eveel-M ’ rodakh began his reign as king of Bavel ; and in his first year , he commuted the sentence of Y ’ hoyakhin king of Y ’ hudah and released him from prison .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	32	He treated him with kindness and gave him a throne higher than those of the other kings there with him in Bavel .
CJB	Jeremiah	52	33	So Y ’ hoyakhin no longer had to wear prison clothes ; moreover , he was provided with food as long as he lived ,
CJB	Jeremiah	52	34	and he was granted a daily allowance by the king of Bavel to spend on his other needs for as long as he lived , until the day of his death .
CJB	Lamentations	1	1	How lonely lies the city that once thronged with people ! Once great among the nations , now she is like a widow ! Once princess among provinces , she has become a vassal .
CJB	Lamentations	1	2	Bitterly she weeps at night , tears running down her cheeks . Not one of all her lovers is there to comfort her . Her friends have all betrayed her ; they have become her enemies .
CJB	Lamentations	1	3	Y ’ hudah has fled into exile from oppression and endless slavery . She lives among the nations , but there she finds no rest . Her pursuers have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress .
CJB	Lamentations	1	4	The roads to Tziyon are mourning because no one comes to the festivals . Her gateways are all deserted , her cohanim are groaning , her unmarried girls are grieving — how bitter it is for her !
CJB	Lamentations	1	5	Her foes have become the head , her enemies relax , for Adonai has made her suffer because of her many sins . Her young children have gone away captive before the foe .
CJB	Lamentations	1	6	All splendor has departed from the daughter of Tziyon . Her princes have become like deer unable to find pasture , running on , exhausted , fleeing from the hunter .
CJB	Lamentations	1	7	In the days of her affliction and anguish , Yerushalayim remembers all the treasures that were hers , ever since ancient times . Now her people fall into the power of the foe , and she has no one to help her ; her enemies are gloating over her , mocking her desolation .
CJB	Lamentations	1	8	Yerushalayim sinned grievously ; therefore she has become unclean . All who honored her now despise her , because they have seen her naked . She herself also moans and turns her face away .
CJB	Lamentations	1	9	Her filthiness was in her skirts ; she gave no thought to how it would end . Hence her astounding downfall , with no one to console her . “ Look , Adonai , how I suffer ; for the foe has triumphed ! ”
CJB	Lamentations	1	10	Enemies have reached out their hands to seize all her treasures . She has seen Goyim approach and go inside her sanctuary , those whom you forbade even to enter your assembly .
CJB	Lamentations	1	11	All her people are groaning , as they search for something to eat . They barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive . “ Look , Adonai ! See how despised I am .
CJB	Lamentations	1	12	“ May it not happen to you , all you passers-by ! Just look , and see if there is any pain like the pain inflicted on me , which Adonai made me suffer on the day of his blazing anger .
CJB	Lamentations	1	13	“ From on high , he sent down fire deep into my bones ; he spread a net to catch my feet ; he turned me back ; he left me desolate , in misery all day long .
CJB	Lamentations	1	14	“ My sins have been bound into a yoke , knit together by his hand . It weighs down on my neck , and it saps my strength . Adonai has put me into the power of those I can not withstand .
CJB	Lamentations	1	15	“ All the strong men within my walls Adonai has rejected . He has set a specific time for crushing my young men . Adonai has trodden , like grapes in a winepress , the virgin daughter of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Lamentations	1	16	“ Because of these things , I weep ; my eyes , my eyes stream with tears ; for anyone who could comfort me and revive my courage is far away . My children are in a state of shock , because the enemy has prevailed. ”
CJB	Lamentations	1	17	Tziyon spreads out her hands , but no one is there to console her . Concerning Ya ‘ akov , Adonai has ordered those around him to be his foes ; Yerushalayim has become for them an unclean , filthy thing .
CJB	Lamentations	1	18	“ Adonai is in the right , for I rebelled against his word . Listen , please , all you peoples ; and see how I am in pain ! My young women and my young men have gone into captivity .
CJB	Lamentations	1	19	“ I called out to my lovers , but they let me down . My cohanim and leaders perished in the city , as they were seeking food to keep themselves alive .
CJB	Lamentations	1	20	“ See , Adonai , how distressed I am ! Everything in me is churning ! My heart turns over inside me , because I have been so rebellious . Outside , the sword brings bereavement ; inside , it is like death .
CJB	Lamentations	1	21	“ People have heard how I groan , with no one to comfort me . All my foes have heard of my trouble ; they are glad that you have done it . Bring the day you have promised , so that they will suffer like me !
CJB	Lamentations	1	22	“ Let all their wickedness come before you . Then do to them as you have done to me because of all my offenses . For my groans are many , and I am sick at heart . ”
CJB	Lamentations	2	2	Without pity Adonai swallowed up all the dwellings of Ya ‘ akov . In his wrath he broke down the strongholds of the daughter of Y ’ hudah , brought them down to the ground , thus profaning the kingdom and its rulers .
CJB	Lamentations	2	3	In his fierce anger he cut off all the power of Isra ’ el , withdrew his protecting right hand at the approach of the enemy , and blazed up in Ya ‘ akov like a flaming fire devouring everything around it .
CJB	Lamentations	2	4	He bent his bow like an enemy , with his right hand set like a foe . He killed all who were pleasant to see . In the tent of the daughter of Tziyon , he poured out his fury like fire .
CJB	Lamentations	2	5	Adonai became like an enemy ; he swallowed up Isra ’ el , swallowed up all its palaces , and destroyed all its strongholds . For the daughter of Y ’ hudah he has multiplied mourning and moaning .
CJB	Lamentations	2	6	He wrecked his tabernacle as easily as a garden , destroyed his place of assembly . Adonai caused Isra ’ el to forget designated times and Shabbats . In the heat of his anger he rejected both king and cohen .
CJB	Lamentations	2	7	Adonai rejected his altar , disowned his sanctuary , and gave her palace walls over to the power of the foe , who raised such shouts in the house of Adonai that it sounded like a festival day .
CJB	Lamentations	2	8	Adonai resolved to destroy the wall of the daughter of Tziyon . He measured it with his line and did not stay his hand until it was all in ruins . He brought grief to rampart and wall ; together they lie dejected .
CJB	Lamentations	2	9	Her gates have sunk into the ground ; he destroyed and broke their bars . Her king and rulers are among the Goyim , there is no more Torah , and her prophets do not receive visions from Adonai .
CJB	Lamentations	2	10	The leaders of the daughter of Tziyon sit on the ground in silence . They throw dust on their heads ; they are wearing sackcloth . The unmarried women of Yerushalayim lower their heads to the ground .
CJB	Lamentations	2	11	My eyes are worn out from weeping , everything in me is churning ; I am empty of emotion because of the wounds to my people , because children and infants are fainting away in the streets of the city .
CJB	Lamentations	2	12	They keep asking their mothers , “ Where is something to eat or drink ? ” as they faint away in the streets of the city , gasping out their last breath in their mother ’ s bosom .
CJB	Lamentations	2	13	What can be said to you , what can be compared with you , daughter of Yerushalayim ? What example can I give to comfort you , virgin daughter of Tziyon ? For your downfall is as vast as the sea ; who can heal you ?
CJB	Lamentations	2	14	The visions your prophets saw for you were futile , just a whitewash . They did not expose your guilt , so as to reverse your fortunes — no , the visions they saw for you were alluring , but futile .
CJB	Lamentations	2	15	All who pass your way clap their hands at you , hissing and shaking their heads at the daughter of Yerushalayim : “ This city was called ‘ perfection in beauty ’ ? ‘ the joy of the whole earth ’ ? ”
CJB	Lamentations	2	16	All your adversaries open their mouths to jeer at you . They hiss , they grind their teeth ; they say , “ We have swallowed her up ! This is the day we were waiting for , and now we have lived to see it ! ”
CJB	Lamentations	2	17	Adonai has done what he planned , he has fulfilled his promise , which he decreed in ancient times . He has destroyed without pity , he has let the enemy gloat over you and filled your foes with pride .
CJB	Lamentations	2	18	Their hearts cried out to Adonai , “ Wall of the daughter of Tziyon ! Let your tears stream down like a torrent , day and night ! Give yourself no respite , give your eyes no rest !
CJB	Lamentations	2	19	“ Get up ! Cry out in the night , at the beginning of every watch ! Pour your heart out like water before the face of Adonai ! Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your babies , who are fainting away from hunger at every streetcorner. ”
CJB	Lamentations	2	20	Adonai , look and see who it is you have thus tormented ! Should women eat the fruit of their wombs , the children they have held in their hands ? Should cohanim and prophets be slaughtered in the sanctuary of Adonai ?
CJB	Lamentations	2	21	Youths and old men are lying on the ground in the streets , my unmarried women and young men have fallen by the sword . You killed them on the day of your anger , you slaughtered them without pity .
CJB	Lamentations	2	22	You have summoned my terrors from every direction , as on a festival day . On the day of Adonai ’ s anger , not one escaped ; not one survived — the children I held in my arms and raised , my enemy has destroyed .
CJB	Lamentations	3	3	Against me alone he turns his hand again and again , all day .
CJB	Lamentations	3	2	He has led me and made me walk in darkness and not in light .
CJB	Lamentations	3	4	He has worn away my skin and flesh , he has broken my bones .
CJB	Lamentations	3	5	He has besieged and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship .
CJB	Lamentations	3	6	He has made me live in darkness , like those who are long dead .
CJB	Lamentations	3	7	He has walled me in , so I can ’ t escape ; he has weighed me down with chains .
CJB	Lamentations	3	8	Even when I cry out , pleading for help , he shuts out my prayer .
CJB	Lamentations	3	9	He has barred my way with blocks of stone , he has made my paths crooked .
CJB	Lamentations	3	10	He lies in wait for me like a bear , like a lion in hiding .
CJB	Lamentations	3	11	He has forced me aside and torn me to pieces , leaving me stunned .
CJB	Lamentations	3	12	He has bent his bow and used me as a target for his arrows .
CJB	Lamentations	3	13	He has pierced my vital organs with shafts from his quiver .
CJB	Lamentations	3	14	I ’ m a laughingstock to all my people , the butt of their taunts all day long .
CJB	Lamentations	3	15	He has filled me with bitterness , sated me with wormwood .
CJB	Lamentations	3	16	He has broken my teeth with gravel and pressed me down into ashes .
CJB	Lamentations	3	17	I have been so deprived of peace , I have so forgotten what happiness is ,
CJB	Lamentations	3	18	that I think , “ My strength is gone , and so is my hope in Adonai. ”
CJB	Lamentations	3	19	Remember my utter misery , the wormwood and the gall .
CJB	Lamentations	3	20	They are always on my mind ; this is why I am so depressed .
CJB	Lamentations	3	21	But in my mind I keep returning to something , something that gives me hope —
CJB	Lamentations	3	22	that the grace of Adonai is not exhausted , that his compassion has not ended .
CJB	Lamentations	3	23	[ On the contrary , ] they are new every morning ! How great your faithfulness !
CJB	Lamentations	3	24	“ Adonai is all I have , ” I say ; “ therefore I will put my hope in him .
CJB	Lamentations	3	25	Adonai is good to those waiting for him , to those who are seeking him out .
CJB	Lamentations	3	26	It is good to wait patiently for the saving help of Adonai .
CJB	Lamentations	3	27	It is good for a man to bear the yoke from his youth .
CJB	Lamentations	3	28	Let him sit alone in silence when he has laid it on him .
CJB	Lamentations	3	29	Let him submit absolutely ; there may yet be hope .
CJB	Lamentations	3	30	Let him offer his cheek to the one who strikes it , and receive his fill of insults .
CJB	Lamentations	3	31	For rejection by Adonai does not last forever .
CJB	Lamentations	3	32	He may cause grief , but he will take pity , in keeping with the greatness of his grace .
CJB	Lamentations	3	33	For he does not arbitrarily torment or punish human beings .
CJB	Lamentations	3	34	When anyone tramples underfoot any of the prisoners of the land ;
CJB	Lamentations	3	35	when anyone deprives a person of justice , in defiance of the Most High ;
CJB	Lamentations	3	36	when someone is cheated of justice in court — does Adonai not take note of such things ?
CJB	Lamentations	3	37	Who can say something and have it happen without Adonai ’ s commanding it ?
CJB	Lamentations	3	38	Don ’ t both bad things and good proceed from the mouth of the Most High ?
CJB	Lamentations	3	39	Why should anyone alive complain , even a strong man , about the punishment for his sins ?
CJB	Lamentations	3	40	Let us examine and test our ways and return to Adonai .
CJB	Lamentations	3	41	Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven and say ,
CJB	Lamentations	3	42	“ We , for our part , have transgressed and rebelled ; you , for your part , have not forgiven .
CJB	Lamentations	3	43	“ You have covered us with anger , pursued and slaughtered us without pity .
CJB	Lamentations	3	44	You have covered yourself with a cloud so thick that no prayer can pass through .
CJB	Lamentations	3	45	You have reduced us to rubbish and filth among the peoples .
CJB	Lamentations	3	46	“ All our adversaries open their mouths to jeer at us .
CJB	Lamentations	3	47	Panic and pitfall have come upon us , desolation and destruction .
CJB	Lamentations	3	48	My eyes stream with rivers of water over the destruction of the daughter of my people. ”
CJB	Lamentations	3	49	My eyes weep ceaselessly ; there is no respite ,
CJB	Lamentations	3	50	until Adonai looks down and sees from heaven .
CJB	Lamentations	3	51	My eyes make me so upset at the fate of the women in my city .
CJB	Lamentations	3	52	Those who are my enemies for no reason hunted me down like a bird .
CJB	Lamentations	3	53	They forced me alive into a pit and threw stones on me .
CJB	Lamentations	3	54	Water rose above my head ; I thought , “ I am finished ! ”
CJB	Lamentations	3	55	I called on your name , Adonai , from the bottom of the pit .
CJB	Lamentations	3	56	You heard my voice ; don ’ t close your ear at my sighs , at my cries .
CJB	Lamentations	3	57	You came near when I called to you ; you said , “ Don ’ t be afraid. ”
CJB	Lamentations	3	58	Adonai , you defended my cause ; you redeemed my life .
CJB	Lamentations	3	59	Adonai , you see how I have been wronged ; give judgment in my favor !
CJB	Lamentations	3	60	You have seen all their vindictiveness and all their plots against me .
CJB	Lamentations	3	61	You have heard their taunts , Adonai , and all their plots against me ,
CJB	Lamentations	3	62	the whispered murmurings of my foes against me all day long .
CJB	Lamentations	3	63	See how , whether they sit or stand , I am the butt of their taunts .
CJB	Lamentations	3	64	Repay them , Adonai , as their deeds deserve .
CJB	Lamentations	3	65	Give them hardheartedness as your curse on them .
CJB	Lamentations	3	66	Pursue them in anger ! Destroy them from under your heavens !
CJB	Lamentations	4	4	The tongue of the baby at the breast sticks to the roof of its mouth from thirst ; young children are begging for bread , but no one is giving them any .
CJB	Lamentations	4	2	The precious sons of Tziyon , as precious as fine gold — to think they are now worth no more than clay jars made by a potter !
CJB	Lamentations	4	3	Even jackals bare their breasts in order to nurse their young , but the daughters of my people have become as cruel as ostriches in the desert .
CJB	Lamentations	4	5	People who once ate only the best lie dying in the streets ; those who were raised wearing purple are clawing at piles of garbage .
CJB	Lamentations	4	6	For the offense of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of S ’ dom , which was overthrown in an instant , without a hand to help her .
CJB	Lamentations	4	7	Her princes were purer than snow ; they were whiter than milk , their bodies more ruddy than pink pearls , as beautiful as sapphires .
CJB	Lamentations	4	8	Now their faces are blacker than coal ; in the streets they go unrecognized . Their skin has shriveled over their bones and become as dry as a stick .
CJB	Lamentations	4	9	Those slain by the sword are better off than those who are dying from hunger ; since these waste away as if pierced through , for lack of food from the fields .
CJB	Lamentations	4	10	With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children ; their children became their food when the daughter of my people was destroyed .
CJB	Lamentations	4	11	Adonai has finished with his fury , he has poured out his blazing wrath ; he kindled a fire in Tziyon that consumed its very foundations .
CJB	Lamentations	4	12	The kings of the earth could not believe , neither could anyone living in the world , that enemy or foe would ever enter the gates of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Lamentations	4	13	It happened because of the sins of her prophets and the offenses of her cohanim , who , within her walls , shed the blood of the righteous .
CJB	Lamentations	4	14	They wander in the streets like the blind ; they are so polluted with blood that nobody is able even to touch their clothing .
CJB	Lamentations	4	15	“ Keep away ! Unclean ! ” people shout at them , “ Keep away ! Away ! Don ’ t touch us ! ” They flee , to wander here and there ; but no nation allows them to stay .
CJB	Lamentations	4	16	Adonai himself scattered them ; he will no longer look after them ; they had no respect for cohanim and showed no kindness to the leaders .
CJB	Lamentations	4	17	As for us , our eyes are worn out from looking in vain for help ; we kept on watching and watching for a nation that couldn ’ t save us .
CJB	Lamentations	4	18	They keep dogging our steps , so that we can ’ t go out in our streets . Our end is near , our time is up ; yes , our end has come .
CJB	Lamentations	4	19	Those who pursued us were swifter than eagles in the sky . They chased us over the mountains and waylaid us in the desert .
CJB	Lamentations	4	20	Adonai ’ s anointed , our life-breath , was caught in their pits ; though of him we had said , “ Under his protection , we can live among the nations. ”
CJB	Lamentations	4	21	Rejoice , be glad , daughter of Edom , who lives in the land of ‘ Utz . To you too the cup will pass ; you will get drunk and strip yourself naked !
CJB	Lamentations	4	22	Your offenses , daughter of Tziyon , are atoned for ; he will keep you in exile no longer . Your offenses , daughter of Edom , he will punish ; he will expose your sins .
CJB	Lamentations	5	5	The yoke is on our necks ; we are persecuted ; we toil to exhaustion but are given no rest .
CJB	Lamentations	5	2	The land we possessed has been passed on to strangers , our homes to foreigners .
CJB	Lamentations	5	3	We have become fatherless orphans , our mothers now are widows .
CJB	Lamentations	5	4	We have to pay to drink our own water ; we have to buy our own wood .
CJB	Lamentations	5	6	We made pacts with Egypt and Ashur to get enough food .
CJB	Lamentations	5	7	Our ancestors sinned and no longer exist ; we bear the weight of their guilt .
CJB	Lamentations	5	8	We are ruled by slaves , and there is no one to save us from their power .
CJB	Lamentations	5	9	We get our food at the peril of our lives because of the sword in the desert .
CJB	Lamentations	5	10	Our skins are as black as a furnace because of the searing blasts of famine .
CJB	Lamentations	5	11	They have raped the women of Tziyon , virgins in the cities of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Lamentations	5	12	Princes are hung up by their hands , leaders receive no respect .
CJB	Lamentations	5	13	Young men are compelled to grind at the mill , boys stagger under loads of wood .
CJB	Lamentations	5	14	The old men have deserted the city gate , the young men have given up their music .
CJB	Lamentations	5	15	Joy has vanished from our hearts , our dancing has turned into mourning .
CJB	Lamentations	5	16	The crown has fallen from our heads . Woe to us ! for we have sinned .
CJB	Lamentations	5	17	This is why our hearts are sick ; this is why our eyes grow dim —
CJB	Lamentations	5	18	it ’ s because of Mount Tziyon , so wasted that jackals have overrun it .
CJB	Lamentations	5	19	You , Adonai , reign forever ; your throne endures through all generations .
CJB	Lamentations	5	20	Why do you never remember us ? Why abandon us for so long a time ?
CJB	Lamentations	5	21	Adonai , turn us back to you ; and we will come back ; renew our days , as they were in the past —
CJB	Lamentations	5	22	unless you have totally rejected us in a fury that knows no limits . [ Adonai , turn us back to you ; and we will come back ; renew our days , as they were in the past . ]
CJB	Ezekiel	1	1	In the thirtieth year , on the fifth day of the fourth month , while I was among the exiles by the K ’ var River , the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	2	On the fifth day of the month , which was during the fifth year of King Y ’ hoyakhin ’ s exile ,
CJB	Ezekiel	1	3	the word of Adonai came to the cohen Yechezk ’ el son of Buzi , in the land of the Kasdim by the K ’ var River ; there the hand of Adonai was on him .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	4	I looked and saw a windy storm approaching from the north and a huge cloud with flashing fire , glowing brightly all around with the color of gleaming amber from within the fire .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	5	Inside , there appeared to be four living creatures that looked like human beings ;
CJB	Ezekiel	1	6	but each one had four faces and four wings .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	7	Their legs were straight , with feet like calves ’ hoofs . They glittered like burnished bronze .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	8	Beneath their wings they had human hands on their four sides . The four of them had faces and wings as follows :
CJB	Ezekiel	1	9	they touched one another with their wings ; they did not turn when they moved , but each one moved straight forward ;
CJB	Ezekiel	1	10	as for the appearance of their faces , they had human faces [ in front ] , each of the four had a lion ’ s face on the right , each of the four had a bull ’ s face on the left , and each of the four had an eagle ’ s face [ toward the rear ] —
CJB	Ezekiel	1	11	thus their faces . As for their wings , each had two that stretched upward and joined those of others , and two more that covered their bodies .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	12	Each [ living creature ] moved in the direction of any of its faces ; in whichever direction the spirit wanted to go , they went , without turning as they moved —
CJB	Ezekiel	1	13	thus the appearance of the living creatures . With them was something that looked like fiery coals burning the way torches do , with the fire flashing here and there between the living creatures ; the fire had a brilliance , and out of the fire went lightning .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	14	The living creatures kept speeding here and there like flashes of lightning .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	15	As I gazed at the living creatures , I saw wheels on the ground , one next to each of the four-faced living creatures .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	16	All four wheels looked the same : their inner parts gleamed like beryl , and their structure seemed to be that of a wheel inside a wheel .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	17	When they moved , they could go in any of the four directions without turning as they moved .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	18	Their rims were tall and fearsome , because the rims of all four were full of eyes all around .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	19	When the living creatures moved , the wheels moved along with them ; and when the creatures were lifted off the ground , the wheels went with them .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	20	Wherever the spirit was to go , they went , in the direction the spirit wanted to go . The wheels were lifted up next to them , because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	21	When [ the living creatures ] moved , [ the wheels ] moved ; when the former stood still , the latter stood still ; and when the former were lifted off the ground , the wheels were lifted up next to them ; because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	22	Over the heads of the living creatures was what appeared to be a dome glittering like ice ; it was awesome , spread out over their heads , above them .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	23	Under the dome each had a pair of wings spread out straight toward those of others , and each had a pair which covered his body .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	24	I heard the sound of their wings when they moved ; it was like the sound of rushing water , like the voice of Shaddai , like the noise of a tumultuous crowd or army . When they stopped , they lowered their wings .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	25	Whenever there was a sound from above the dome over their heads , they stopped and lowered their wings .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	26	Above the dome that was over their heads was something like a throne that looked like a sapphire . On it , above it , was what appeared to be a person .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	27	I saw what looked like gleaming , amber-colored fire radiating from what appeared to be his waist upward . Downward from what appeared to be his waist , I saw what looked like fire , giving a brilliant light all around him .
CJB	Ezekiel	1	28	This brilliance around him looked like a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day . This was how the appearance of the glory of Adonai looked . When I saw it , I fell on my face , and I heard the voice of someone speaking .
CJB	Ezekiel	2	2	As he spoke to me , a spirit entered me and put me on my feet , and I heard him who was speaking to me .
CJB	Ezekiel	2	3	He said , “ Human being ! I am sending you to the people of Isra ’ el , that nation of rebels who have rebelled against me — they and their ancestors have been transgressing against me to this very day .
CJB	Ezekiel	2	4	Because they are defiant , hardhearted children , I am sending you ; and you are to tell them , ‘ Here is what Adonai Elohim says. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	2	5	Whether they listen or not , this rebellious house will still know that a prophet has been among them !
CJB	Ezekiel	2	6	“ As for you , human being , don ’ t be afraid of them or their words , even if briars and thorns surround you , and you sit among scorpions . Don ’ t be afraid of their words or be upset by their looks , for they are a rebellious house .
CJB	Ezekiel	2	7	You are to speak my words to them , whether they listen or not , for they are very rebellious .
CJB	Ezekiel	2	8	But you , human being , hear what I am telling you : don ’ t you be rebellious like that rebellious house . Open your mouth , and eat what I am about to give you. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	2	9	When I looked , there was a hand stretched out to me , holding a scroll .
CJB	Ezekiel	2	10	He spread it out in front of me , and it was covered with writing front and back . Written on it were laments , dirges and woes .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	3	as he said , “ Human being , eat this scroll I am giving you ; fill your insides with it. ” When I ate it , it tasted as sweet as honey .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth , and he gave me the scroll to eat ,
CJB	Ezekiel	3	4	“ Human being , ” he said to me , “ go to the house of Isra ’ el , and speak my words to them .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	5	For you are not being sent to a people with a difficult language and unintelligible speech , but to the house of Isra ’ el —
CJB	Ezekiel	3	6	not to many peoples with difficult languages and unintelligible speech , whose words you can ’ t understand when you hear them . Without doubt , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	7	But the house of Isra ’ el will not be willing to listen to you , because they aren ’ t willing to listen to me ; since all the house of Isra ’ el are obstinate and hardhearted .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	8	However , I am making you as defiant and obstinate as they are .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	9	Yes , I am making your resoluteness harder than flint , as hard as a diamond . So don ’ t be afraid of them or depressed by how they look at you , because they are a rebellious house. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	3	10	Then he said to me , “ Human being , receive in your heart and hear with your ears all my words that I speak to you .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	11	Then go to the exiles , to your countrymen ; and speak to them . Tell them , ‘ Here is what Adonai Elohim , says , ’ whether they listen or not. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	3	12	A spirit lifted me up , and I heard behind me a very loud sound — blessed be the glory of Adonai from his place !
CJB	Ezekiel	3	13	It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they beat against each other , and the sound of the wheels next to them , a very loud sound .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	14	So a spirit lifted me up and took me away . I went in bitterness and the heat of my spirit , with the hand of Adonai strong on me .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	15	I went to the exiles who were living in Tel-Aviv , by the K ’ var River and stayed with them there in a stupefied state for seven days .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	16	After seven days the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	3	17	“ Human being , I have appointed you to be a watchman for the house of Isra ’ el . When you hear a word from my mouth , you are to warn them for me .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	18	If I say to a wicked person , ‘ You will certainly die ’ ; and you fail to warn him , to speak and warn the wicked person to leave his wicked way and save his life ; then that wicked person will die guilty ; and I will hold you responsible for his death .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	19	On the other hand , if you warn the wicked person , and he doesn ’ t turn from his wickedness or his wicked way , then he will still die guilty ; but you will have saved your own life .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	20	Similarly , when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits wickedness , I will place a stumblingblock before him — he will die ; because you failed to warn him , he will die in his sin ; his righteous acts which he did will not be remembered ; and I will hold you responsible for his death .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	21	But if you warn the righteous person that a righteous person should not sin , and he doesn ’ t sin ; then he will certainly live , because he took the warning ; and you too will have saved your life. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	3	22	The hand of Adonai came on me there , and he said to me , “ Get up , go out to the valley , and I will speak with you there. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	3	23	So I got up and went out to the valley . The glory of Adonai was there , like the glory I had seen by the K ’ var River ; and I fell on my face .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	24	A spirit entered me and put me on my feet . Then he spoke with me and said to me , “ Go , shut yourself inside your house .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	25	Human being , you are going to be bound with ropes , unable to go out among the people .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	26	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , so that you will be mute , unable to reprove them ; for they are a rebellious house .
CJB	Ezekiel	3	27	But when I speak with you , I will open your mouth ; and you will say to them , ‘ This is what Adonai Elohim says. ’ Whoever is inclined to listen will listen , and whoever is inclined to refuse will refuse , because they are a rebellious house .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	4	“ Next , you are to lie on your left side , and have it bear the guilt of the house of Isra ’ el — for as many days as you lie on your side , you will bear their guilt .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	2	Show it under siege — build towers against it , raise earthworks against it , set up camps against it , and surround it with battering rams .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	3	Then take an iron griddle and put it in place as a wall of iron between yourself and the city , and fix your gaze on it — the city is under siege , and you are the one besieging it . This will be a sign for the house of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	5	For I am assigning you one day for each year of their guilt ; thus you are to bear the guilt of the house of Isra ’ el for
CJB	Ezekiel	4	390	days , this is what you are to eat .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	6	Then , when you have finished that , you are to lie on your right side and bear the guilt of the house of Y ’ hudah for forty days , each day corresponding to a year ; this is what I am assigning you .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	7	You are to fix your gaze on the siege of Yerushalayim , and , with your arm bared , prophesy against it .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	8	I am tying you down with ropes , and you are not to turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	9	“ Take wheat , barley , beans , lentils , millet and buckwheat ; put them together in one bowl ; and make bread from it . For as long as you lie on your side ,
CJB	Ezekiel	4	10	Each day the food you eat must weigh only three-quarters of a pound ; you may eat it from time to time [ during the day ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	11	You are also to drink a limited amount of water , two-thirds of a quart ; you may drink it from time to time [ during the day ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	12	[ The bread ] you eat is to be baked like barley cakes ; you are to bake it before their eyes , using human dung as fuel. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	4	13	Adonai said , “ This is how the people of Isra ’ el will eat their food — unclean — in the nations where I am driving them. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	4	14	I objected : “ No , Adonai Elohim ! I have never defiled myself — from my youth until now I have never eaten anything that died by itself or was killed by wild animals ; no such disgusting food has ever entered my mouth. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	4	15	He answered , “ All right , I will give you cow dung to use instead of human dung , and you can prepare your bread on it. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	4	16	He then said to me , “ Human being , I am going to cut off the supply of bread in Yerushalayim , so that they will anxiously weigh out bread to eat , and , horrified , ration water to drink .
CJB	Ezekiel	4	17	Finally , due to lack of bread and water , they will stare at each other in shock , wasting away because of their guilt . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	5	5	“ Here is what Adonai Elohim , says : ‘ This is Yerushalayim ! I have placed her in the middle of the nations ; countries can be found all around her .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	2	A third of it you are to burn in the city when the days of the siege are over . Take another third , and hit it with your sword all around the city . Scatter the last third to the wind , and I will pursue them with drawn sword .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	3	Also take a few hairs and tie them up in the folds of your garment .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	4	Again , of these take some ; throw them in the fire , and burn them up ; from there a fire will come out against the entire house of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	6	But she has rebelled against my rulings and committed wickedness more than the nations , against my laws more than the countries around her ; because they have rejected my rulings and not lived according to my laws. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	5	7	“ Therefore here is what Adonai Elohim , says : ‘ Because you have outdone the nations around you by not living according to my laws or following my rulings or even following the rules of the nations around you , ’
CJB	Ezekiel	5	8	therefore here is what Adonai Elohim , says : ‘ I too am against you , yes , I ; and I will execute judgments among you while all the nations look on .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	9	Moreover , because of all your disgusting practices , I will do things to you that I have never done before ; and I will never do such things again .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	10	Parents among you will eat their children , and children will eat their parents ! I will execute judgments among you and scatter to all the winds those of you who remain .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	11	For , as I live , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ because you defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and disgusting practices , therefore I swear that I will cut you off — my eye will not spare , I will have no pity .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	12	A third of you will die from plague or be consumed by famine inside [ Yerushalayim ] ; a third will fall by the sword all around [ Yerushalayim ] ; and a third I will scatter to all the winds and pursue with the sword. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	5	13	In this way my anger will spend itself , my fury against them will die down , and I will be satisfied . Then , when I have spent my fury on them , they will know that I , Adonai , have spoken out of my zeal .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	14	‘ I will make you a ruin and an object of reproach among the nations around you , in the sight of all passing by .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	15	When I execute judgments and furious punishments among you in anger and fury , [ Yerushalayim ] will be an object of reproach , derision and horror , and a lesson to warn the nations around you . I , Adonai , have announced it .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	16	I will send upon them the deadly , destructive arrows of famine , which I will send to destroy you . I will make the famine worse for you by cutting off your food supply .
CJB	Ezekiel	5	17	Yes , I will send famine and savage beasts upon you to leave you without children ; plague and bloodshed will sweep through you ; and I will bring the sword upon you . I , Adonai , have spoken it . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	6	6	Everywhere you live , the cities will be destroyed and the high places wrecked ; so that your altars can be destroyed and wrecked , your idols broken and abolished , your pillars for sun-worship cut down and the things you have made wiped out .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	2	“ Human being , face toward the mountains of Isra ’ el , and prophesy against them :
CJB	Ezekiel	6	3	‘ Mountains of Isra ’ el , hear the word of Adonai Elohim : here is what Adonai Elohim says about the mountains , hills , ravines and valleys : “ I myself will bring a sword against you and destroy your high places .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	4	Your altars will be wrecked and your pillars for sun-worship broken , and I will throw down your slain ones in front of your idols .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	5	I will lay the corpses of the people of Isra ’ el in front of their idols and scatter your bones all around your altars .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	7	The slain will fall among you ; then you will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	8	“ ‘ “ Nevertheless , I will leave a remnant , some who will escape the sword among the nations , when you have been scattered throughout the countries .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	9	Those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they have been exiled . How broken I have been over their whoring hearts that left me , and over their eyes that went whoring after their idols ! They are going to loathe themselves for all the evils they committed in their disgusting practices .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	10	Then they will know that I am Adonai ; it isn ’ t for nothing that I said I would bring this calamity upon them. ” ’
CJB	Ezekiel	6	11	“ Here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Strike with your hand , and stamp with your foot , and bemoan all the terrible disgusting practices of the house of Isra ’ el . For they will fall by sword , famine and plague .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	12	Those far away will die from the plague , those nearby will fall by the sword , and whoever stays and is besieged will die from famine . This is how I will spend my fury on them .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	13	You will know that I am Adonai when their slain men are lying among their idols around their altars on every high hill , on every mountaintop , under every green tree , under every thick pistachio tree , wherever they offered sweet-smelling sacrifices to appease their idols .
CJB	Ezekiel	6	14	I will stretch out my hand over them and make the land wherever they live into a desolate waste worse than the Divlah Desert . Then they will know that I am Adonai . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	7	7	Doom has come to you , you who live in the land ! The time has come , the day is near , for tumult , not joyful shouts on the mountains .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	2	“ As for you , human being , here is what Adonai Elohim says about the land of Isra ’ el : ‘ The end ! The end is coming to the four corners of the land !
CJB	Ezekiel	7	3	Now the end is upon you ! I will send my anger upon you , I will judge you according to your ways . I will bring on you all your disgusting practices .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	4	My eye will not spare you , I will have no pity , but I will bring your ways upon you , and your disgusting practices will be done among you . Then you will know that I am Adonai. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	7	5	“ Here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Disaster , unique disaster — here it comes !
CJB	Ezekiel	7	6	The end is coming ! The end is coming ! It rouses itself against you — here it comes !
CJB	Ezekiel	7	8	Now , soon , I will pour out my fury on you , I will spend my anger on you ; I will judge you according to your ways I will bring on you all your disgusting practices .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	9	My eye will not spare you , I will have no pity ; but will bring upon you what your ways deserve ; and your disgusting practices will be among you . Then you will know it is I , Adonai , striking you .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	10	“ ‘ Here is the day ! Here it comes ! Doom has gone out , the rod has blossomed , arrogance has budded .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	11	Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness . Nothing is left of them , nothing of their crowds , nothing of their wealth — there is nothing of importance in them .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	12	The time has come , the day has arrived ; let neither buyer rejoice nor seller regret ; for wrath is coming to all her many people .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	13	For the seller will not return to what he sold , even if he is still alive ; for though the vision was brought to all her many people , nobody repented . Each kept living his own wicked life ; they weren ’ t strong enough [ to repent ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	14	The shofar has sounded , everything is ready , but no one goes out to the battle , for my wrath is coming to all her many people .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	15	“ ‘ Outside is the sword , inside plague and famine . Those in the country will die by the sword . And as for those in the city , plague and famine will eat them up .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	16	But if any of them manage to escape , they will head for the mountains like doves from the valleys , all of them moaning , each for his sin .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	17	All hands will droop , all knees turn to water .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	18	They will put on sackcloth ; horror will cover them ; every face will be ashamed , every head shaved bald .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	19	They will throw their silver into the streets ; their gold will be like something unclean . On the day of Adonai ’ s wrath their silver and gold won ’ t be able to rescue them . These things won ’ t satisfy their hunger , these things won ’ t fill their stomachs , because these are what caused them to sin .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	20	From their beautiful jewellery , in which they took such pride , they made their abominable idols and their other detestable things ; therefore , for them I have caused it to be like something unclean .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	21	I will hand it over to foreigners as booty , to the wicked of the earth as spoil , and they will profane it .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	22	I will turn my face away from them ; then [ Bavel ] will profane my secret place , robbers will enter and profane it .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	23	“ ‘ Forge a chain , for the land is full of capital crimes and the city full of violence .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	24	Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their homes ; I will end the arrogance of the strong ; and their holy places will be profaned .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	25	When horror comes , they will seek peace ; but there will be none .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	26	Calamity will follow calamity , rumor will follow rumor ; they will seek a vision from the prophet , but Torah will perish from the cohen and advice from the leaders .
CJB	Ezekiel	7	27	The king will go into mourning , the prince will be clothed with fright , and the hands of the people of the land will tremble in terror . I will treat them as their way of life deserves and judge them as they have judged others . Then they will know that I am Adonai . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	8	8	He said to me , “ Human being , dig into the wall. ” After digging in the wall , I saw a door .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	2	I looked and saw what seemed like a man made of fire . From what appeared to be his waist downward was fire , and from his waist upward was what appeared to be a gleaming amber-colored brilliance .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	3	The form of a hand was put out , which took me by a lock of my hair ; and a spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me , in these visions from God , to Yerushalayim , to the entrance of the inner [ courtyard ] gate that faces north . There stood the idol that [ arouses God ’ s ] jealousy and provokes [ his ] zealous indignation .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	4	There before me was the glory of the God of Isra ’ el , as in the vision I had seen in the valley .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	5	Then he said to me , “ Human being , raise your eyes toward the north. ” I raised my eyes toward the north and saw , north of the Altar Gate , this image that [ arouses God ’ s ] jealousy in the entryway .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	6	He asked me , “ Human being , do you see what they are doing , the horribly disgusting practices that the house of Isra ’ el is committing here , so that I must distance myself from my own sanctuary ? But you will see even worse abominations. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	8	7	He brought me to the entrance of the courtyard ; and when I looked , I saw a hole in the wall .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	9	“ Go in , ” he said , “ and see the wicked practices they are engaged in here. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in and looked , and there , carved on the walls all around , were every kind of reptile and repulsive animal , along with all the idols of the house of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	11	Standing in front of them were seventy of the leading men of the house of Isra ’ el — in the center stood Ya ’ azanyahu the son of Shafan . Each man had his incense-burner in his hand , and a thick cloud of incense went up .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	12	Then he said to me , “ Human being , did you see what the leaders of the house of Isra ’ el are doing in the dark , each one in the room of his own carved image , because they say , ‘ Adonai can ’ t see us ; Adonai has left the land. ’ ? ”
CJB	Ezekiel	8	13	He also said to me , “ You will see even worse abominations that they are doing. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	8	14	He brought me to the entrance of the north gate to Adonai ’ s house ; and there before me were women weeping for Tammuz .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	15	“ Human being , ” he asked me , “ have you seen this ? You will see practices even more disgusting than these. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	8	16	He brought me into the inner courtyard of Adonai ’ s house ; and there , at the entrance to the temple of Adonai , between the porch and the altar , were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of Adonai and their faces toward the east ; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east .
CJB	Ezekiel	8	17	He asked me , “ Human being , have you seen this ? Does the house of Y ’ hudah consider it a casual matter that they commit the disgusting practices they are committing here , thus filling the land with violence , provoking me still more ? Look ! They are even putting the branch to their nose !
CJB	Ezekiel	8	18	Therefore I will act in fury , my eye will not spare , I will have no pity . Even if they cry loudly right in my ears , I will not listen to them . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	9	9	Then he said to me , “ The wickedness of the house of Isra ’ el and Y ’ hudah is enormous , the land is full of blood , and the city is full of justice denied ; because they say , ‘ Adonai has left the land , Adonai doesn ’ t see. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	9	2	At once , six men approached on the path from the upper gate , to the north , each man holding his weapon of destruction . Among them was a man clothed in linen , with a scribe ’ s writing equipment at his waist . They entered and stood by the bronze altar .
CJB	Ezekiel	9	3	Then the glory of the God of Isra ’ el was made to go up from over the keruv , where it had been , to the threshold of the house . He called to the man clothed in linen , who had the scribe ’ s writing equipment at his waist .
CJB	Ezekiel	9	4	Adonai said to him , “ Go throughout the city , through all Yerushalayim , and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and crying over all the disgusting practices that are being committed in it. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	9	5	To the others I heard him say , “ Go through the city after him and strike ! Don ’ t let your eye spare ; have no pity !
CJB	Ezekiel	9	6	Kill old men , young men , girls , little children , women — slaughter them all ! But don ’ t go near anyone with the mark . Begin at my sanctuary. ” They began with the leaders in front of the house .
CJB	Ezekiel	9	7	Then he said to them , “ Defile the house ! Fill the courtyards with corpses ! Get going ! ” So they went out , spreading death in the city .
CJB	Ezekiel	9	8	While the killing was going on , I was left alone . I fell on my face , cried , and said , “ Oh , Adonai Elohim ! In pouring out your fury on Yerushalayim , are you going to destroy everyone left in Isra ’ el ? ”
CJB	Ezekiel	9	10	But as far as I am concerned , my eye will not spare , and I will have no pity , but I will bring [ the consequences of ] their ways on their own heads. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	9	11	At this point the man clothed in linen with the writing equipment at his waist returned and reported , “ I have done everything you ordered me to do . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	10	10	Their shape was the same for all four , like a wheel inside a wheel .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	2	He spoke to the man clothed in linen ; he said , “ Go in between the wheels under the k ’ ruvim , fill both your hands with fiery coals from between the k ’ ruvim , and throw them on the city. ” As I watched , he went .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	3	Now the k ’ ruvim were standing to the right of the house when the man entered , and the cloud filled the inner courtyard .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	4	The glory of Adonai rose from above the keruv to the threshold of the house , leaving the house filled with the cloud and the courtyard full of the brilliance of Adonai ’ s glory .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	5	The sound of the wings of the k ’ ruvim could be heard even in the outer courtyard sounding like the voice of God , Shaddai , when he speaks .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	6	When he ordered the man clothed in linen to take fire from between the wheels , from between the k ’ ruvim , he went in and stood next to a wheel ;
CJB	Ezekiel	10	7	and a keruv put out his hand from between the k ’ ruvim into the fire between the k ’ ruvim , took some of it , and put it in the hands of the one clothed in linen , who took it and went out .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	8	Now there appeared among the k ’ ruvim the form of a man ’ s hand under their wings .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	9	I looked and saw four wheels next to the k ’ ruvim , one wheel next to one keruv and another wheel next to another keruv : the wheels had the color of beryl .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	11	When they moved , they could go in any of the four directions without turning as they moved ; rather , wherever the head looked , they followed without turning as they moved .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	12	Their whole bodies , including their backs , hands and wings , and also the wheels , were full of eyes all around — even the wheels of the four k ’ ruvim .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	13	As for the wheels , I heard them called “ the wheel apparatus. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	10	14	Every one [ of the k ’ ruvim ] had four faces : the first face was the face of a keruv , the second face was the face of a man , the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	15	Then the k ’ ruvim rose . These were the living creatures I had seen by the K ’ var River .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	16	When the k ’ ruvim moved , the wheels went with them ; and when the k ’ ruvim lifted their wings to rise off the ground , these wheels did not stop going with them .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	17	When [ the k ’ ruvim ] stood still , [ the wheels ] stood still ; and when the former rose , the latter rose with them ; because the spirit of the living creatures was in them .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	18	Now the glory of Adonai left the threshold of the house and halted above the k ’ ruvim .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	19	The k ’ ruvim lifted their wings and rose off the earth — I was watching as they went off with the wheels next to them . They paused at the entrance to the east gate of Adonai ’ s house , with the glory of the God of Isra ’ el over them , from above .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	20	This was the living creature I had seen beneath the God of Isra ’ el by the K ’ var River , so I knew they were k ’ ruvim .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	21	Each of the four had four faces , and each had four wings , and what looked like a man ’ s hands was under their wings .
CJB	Ezekiel	10	22	As for how their faces looked , they were the faces I had seen by the K ’ var River , identical in appearance . Each one moved straight ahead .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	11	This city will not be your cooking pot , but you will be the meat in it — I will judge you at Isra ’ el ’ s frontier ;
CJB	Ezekiel	11	2	He said to me , “ Human being , these are the men who make evil plans and give wicked advice in this city .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	3	They say , ‘ The time hasn ’ t come to build houses . This city is the cooking pot , and we ’ re the meat ! ’
CJB	Ezekiel	11	4	Therefore prophesy against them , human being , prophesy ! ”
CJB	Ezekiel	11	5	The Spirit of Adonai fell on me , and he said to me , “ Say , ‘ Here is what Adonai says : “ What you are saying is correct , house of Isra ’ el ; because I know how your minds work .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	6	You have killed many in this city , you have filled its streets with the dead. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	11	7	Therefore Adonai Elohim says this : “ Those you have killed and strewn all over it , they are the meat ; and this city is indeed the cooking pot ; but you will be removed from it .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	8	You are afraid of the sword , but I will bring the sword upon you , ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	9	“ I will bring you out of it , hand you over to foreigners and execute judgments among you .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	10	You will die by the sword ; I will judge you at the border of Isra ’ el ; and you will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	12	and you will know that I am Adonai . For you have not lived by my laws or obeyed my rulings but have acted according to the rules of the nations surrounding you. ” ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	11	13	As I was prophesying , P ’ latyahu the son of B ’ nayah died . I fell down on my face and cried out , “ Oh , Adonai Elohim ! Are you going to destroy completely those of Isra ’ el who are left ? ”
CJB	Ezekiel	11	14	Then the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	11	15	“ Human being , it is to your kinsmen — your brothers , your relatives and the whole house of Isra ’ el — that the people living in Yerushalayim have said , ‘ Get away from Adonai ! This land has been given to us to possess ! ’
CJB	Ezekiel	11	16	Therefore , say that Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ True , I removed them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries ; nevertheless , I have been a little sanctuary for them in the countries to which they have gone. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	11	17	Therefore , say that Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ “ I will gather you from the peoples and collect you from the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give the land of Isra ’ el to you. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	11	18	Then they will go there and remove all its loathsome things and disgusting practices ,
CJB	Ezekiel	11	19	and I will give them unity of heart . “ I will put a new spirit among you. ” I will remove from their bodies the hearts of stone and give them hearts of flesh ;
CJB	Ezekiel	11	20	so that they will live by my regulations , obey my rulings and act by them . Then they will be my people , and I will be their God .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	21	But as for those whose hearts go after the heart of their loathsome things and disgusting practices , I will bring [ the consequences of ] their ways on their own heads , ’ says Adonai Elohim. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	11	22	The k ’ ruvim lifted their wings , and the wheels were next to them , with the glory of the God of Isra ’ el over them , above .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	23	Next , the glory of Adonai rose from within the city and stood over the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	24	Then a spirit lifted me up and brought me , in the vision , by the Spirit of God , to the exiles in the land of the Kasdim ; after which the vision I had seen left me .
CJB	Ezekiel	11	25	So I told the exiles everything Adonai had shown me .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	12	The prince who is with them will shoulder his pack and leave in the dark . They will dig holes through the wall to carry out their supplies . He will cover his face , so that he won ’ t be able to see the ground with his eyes .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	2	“ Human being , you are living among a rebellious people . They have eyes that can see , but they don ’ t take notice ; and they have ears that can hear , but they don ’ t pay attention ; because they are a rebellious people .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	3	So you , human being , prepare supplies for exile ; and during the daytime , as they watch , go away as if you were going into exile — leave your place , and go somewhere else as they watch . Perhaps they will take notice , even though they are a rebellious house .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	4	Bring out your belongings during the day while they watch , as supplies for exile ; and you yourself , while they watch , are to leave as people do who are going into exile .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	5	Dig a hole through the wall while they watch , and carry [ your belongings ] out through it .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	6	While they watch , you are to shoulder your pack and carry it out into the dark , with your face covered , so that you can ’ t see the ground ; for I am making you a sign for the house of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	12	7	So I did as I had been ordered — I brought out my belongings during the day as supplies for exile , and in the evening I dug a hole through the wall with my hand ; then I carried my pack out on my shoulder in the dark as they watched .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	8	In the morning the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	12	9	“ Human being , the house of Isra ’ el , that rebellious house , has asked you what you are doing .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	10	Tell them that Adonai Elohim says this prophecy concerns the prince in Yerushalayim and all the house of Isra ’ el there .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	11	Say : ‘ I am a sign for you . As I have done , so will it be done to them — they will go into exile , into captivity .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	13	I will spread my net over him , and he will be caught in my snare . Then I will bring him to Bavel , to the land of the Kasdim . But he will not see it , even though he is going to die there .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	14	I will scatter to every wind all who are in attendance on him to help him , along with all his troops ; and I will pursue them with the sword .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	15	They will know that I am Adonai when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the countries .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	16	But I will spare a few of them from sword , famine and plague ; so that they can tell about all their disgusting practices among the nations where they go ; thus they too will know that I am Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	12	17	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	12	18	“ Human being , shake as you eat your food ; tremble anxiously as you drink your water ;
CJB	Ezekiel	12	19	and say to the people of the land , ‘ Here is what Adonai Elohim says concerning those living in Yerushalayim in the land of Isra ’ el : “ They will eat their bread in anxiety and drink their water in horror ; because the land will be desolated from everything that fills it , due to the violence of those living there .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	20	The inhabited cities will be laid waste , the land will be desolate , and you will know that I am Adonai. ” ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	12	21	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	12	22	“ Human being , don ’ t you have this proverb in the land of Isra ’ el , ‘ Time keeps passing , and none of the visions are fulfilled ’ ?
CJB	Ezekiel	12	23	Therefore tell them that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ I will put an end to that proverb ; never again will they use it as a proverb in Isra ’ el. ’ Tell them , ‘ The time has come for the fulfillment of every vision .
CJB	Ezekiel	12	24	There will no longer be empty visions or falsely optimistic divinations in the house of Isra ’ el ,
CJB	Ezekiel	12	25	because I am Adonai . I will speak ; and whatever statement I make , it will be accomplished . It will no longer be delayed ; for in your days , you rebellious house , I will speak the word and accomplish it , ’ says Adonai Elohim. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	12	26	Again , the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	12	27	“ Human being , look ! People from the house of Isra ’ el are saying , ‘ The vision he sees concerns the distant future ; he is prophesying about a time far off. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	12	28	Therefore , say to them that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ None of my words will be delayed any more , but the word that I speak will be accomplished , ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	13	13	Therefore Adonai Elohim says : “ In my rage I will cause gale-force winds to break out , and in my anger there will come a cloudburst , with huge hailstones to consume it in fury .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	2	“ Human being , prophesy against the prophets of Isra ’ el who prophesy . Tell those prophesying out of their own thoughts , ‘ Listen to what Adonai says !
CJB	Ezekiel	13	3	Adonai Elohim says : “ Woe to the vile prophets who follow their own spirits and things which they have not seen !
CJB	Ezekiel	13	4	Isra ’ el , your prophets have been like jackals among ruins .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	5	You [ prophets ] have not gone up to the breaks in the barricade or repaired it for the house of Isra ’ el , so that they can stand fast in battle on the day of Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	6	Their visions are futile and their divination is false ; they say , ‘ Adonai says , ’ when Adonai has not sent them ; yet they hope that the word will be confirmed .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	7	Haven ’ t you had a futile vision and spoken a false divination when you say , ‘ Adonai says , ’ and I have not spoken ?
CJB	Ezekiel	13	8	Therefore here is what Adonai Elohim does say : ‘ Because you have spoken futilities and seen falsehoods , therefore I am against you , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	9	“ ‘ “ My hand will be against the prophets who have futile visions and produce false divinations ; they will not be allowed into the council of my people , or be written in the register of the house of Isra ’ el , or enter the land of Isra ’ el . Then you will know that I am Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	10	They deserve this , because they have led my people astray by saying there is peace when there is no peace . If someone builds a wall without mortar , they ‘ plaster ’ it with whitewash [ to make it appear strong ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	11	Tell these ‘ plasterers ’ that a cloudburst is coming , with huge hailstones and gale-force winds ;
CJB	Ezekiel	13	12	and the wall will fall down . Then people will ask you , ‘ Where is the whitewash you used to “ plaster ” it ? ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	13	14	This is how I will break down the wall you covered with whitewash — I will smash it to the ground , so that its foundation will be revealed . The wall will fall down , and you will be consumed with it . Then you will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	15	In this way I will spend my fury on the wall and on those who covered it with whitewash ; and I will say to you , ‘ The wall is gone , and so are those who “ plastered ” it , ’
CJB	Ezekiel	13	16	that is , the prophets of Isra ’ el who prophesy about Yerushalayim and see visions of peace for her when there is no peace , ” says Adonai Elohim. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	13	17	“ You , human being , turn your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own thoughts . Prophesy against them ;
CJB	Ezekiel	13	18	tell them that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Woe to the women who sew magic pads for all arm joints and put veils over people of all sizes , in order to hunt human lives ! Will you hunt down the lives of my people while you keep your own lives safe ?
CJB	Ezekiel	13	19	You dishonor me before my people for a few handfuls of barley and crumbs of bread , killing people who should not die and sparing those who should not live , by your lying to my people , who love hearing lies. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	13	20	Therefore here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I am against your pads , with which you hunt human lives like birds ; I will tear them from your arms and let the lives go , yes , the human lives that you hunt like birds .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	21	I will also tear your veils and rescue my people from your clutches , so that they will no longer be in your power for you to hunt . Then you will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	13	22	Because you have disheartened the righteous with your lies when I was not trying to cause them pain and have encouraged the wicked not to turn from their wicked ways and thus be saved ,
CJB	Ezekiel	13	23	therefore you will have no more futile visions , and you will produce no more divinations . I will rescue my people from your clutches , and you will know that I am Adonai . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	14	14	even if these three men were in it — Noach , Dani ’ el and Iyov — they would by their righteousness save only themselves , ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	14	2	the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	14	3	“ Human being , these men have taken their idols into their hearts , thus setting in front of themselves the stumblingblock that leads to sin . Should I let them consult me at all ?
CJB	Ezekiel	14	4	Therefore speak to them , and tell them that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Everyone in the house of Isra ’ el who takes his idols into his heart , thus setting in front of himself the stumblingblock that leads to sin , and then comes to the prophet , I myself , Adonai , will answer him in a manner suited to his many idols ,
CJB	Ezekiel	14	5	in order to grab hold of the house of Isra ’ el in their hearts ; since , through their idols , they have all fallen away from me. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	14	6	“ Therefore say to the house of Isra ’ el that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Repent ! Turn yourselves away from your idols , turn your faces away from all your disgusting practices !
CJB	Ezekiel	14	7	For everyone , whether from the house of Isra ’ el or a foreigner living in Isra ’ el , who separates himself from me and takes his idols into his heart , thus setting in front of himself the stumblingblock that leads to sin , and then comes to the prophet , asking him to consult me for him , I myself , Adonai , will answer him .
CJB	Ezekiel	14	8	I will set my face against that person , make him a warning sign and an example , and cut him off from my people . Then you will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	14	9	“ ‘ Now , whenever a prophet is enticed into speaking a word , it will be I , Adonai , who will have enticed that prophet . I will stretch out my hand over him and destroy him from among my people Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	14	10	The prophets will bear the guilt for their sins — the sin of the prophet will be the same as the sin of the inquirer —
CJB	Ezekiel	14	11	so that the house of Isra ’ el will no longer wander away from me or defile themselves with all their crimes ; rather , they will be my people and I will be their God , ’ says Adonai Elohim. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	14	12	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	14	13	“ Human being , when a land sins against me by dealing treacherously with me , so that I stretch out my hand over it and break off its food supply , sending it famine and eliminating both its humans and its animals ;
CJB	Ezekiel	14	15	“ If I unleash wild beasts on the land , and they kill its children and desolate it , so that no one can pass through because of the animals ;
CJB	Ezekiel	14	16	even if these three men were in it , as I live , ” says Adonai Elohim , “ they would save neither sons nor daughters ; only they themselves would be saved , and the land would remain barren .
CJB	Ezekiel	14	17	“ Or if I bring the sword down on that land , saying , ‘ Let the sword pass through the land , ’ so that I eliminate both its humans and its animals ;
CJB	Ezekiel	14	18	even if these three men were in it , as I live , ” says Adonai Elohim , “ they would save neither sons nor daughters ; only they themselves would be saved .
CJB	Ezekiel	14	19	“ Or if I bring a plague into that land and pour out my fury on it in bloodshed , so that I eliminate both its humans and its animals ;
CJB	Ezekiel	14	20	even if Noach , Dani ’ el and Iyov were in it , as I live , ” says Adonai Elohim , “ they would save neither a son nor a daughter ; they would save only themselves by their righteousness. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	14	21	For here is what Adonai Elohim says : “ Even if I inflict my four dreadful judgments on Yerushalayim — sword , famine , wild animals and plagues — to eliminate both its humans and its animals ;
CJB	Ezekiel	14	22	there will still be left a remnant in it to be brought out , including both sons and daughters . When they come out to you , and you see their way of life and how they act , then you will be consoled over the calamity I have brought upon Yerushalayim , over everything I have done to it .
CJB	Ezekiel	14	23	Yes , they will console you when you see their way of life and how they act ; and you will understand that it was not without good reason that I did what I did in [ Yerushalayim ] , ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	15	15	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	15	2	“ Human being , why should wood from a grapevine be better than some other kind of wood , than some branch that one might find among the trees of the forest ?
CJB	Ezekiel	15	3	Its wood can ’ t be used to make anything , not even a pin on which to hang a pot .
CJB	Ezekiel	15	4	So now it is thrown in the fire as fuel , the fire consumes both ends of it , and the middle of it is singed — is it useful now for making something ?
CJB	Ezekiel	15	5	When it was whole , it was good for nothing ; so how much less , when the fire has consumed it , and it is singed , will it be useful for making something !
CJB	Ezekiel	15	6	“ So Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ Like wood from the vine among the trees of the forest , which I consign to the fire as fuel , so I give those living in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezekiel	15	7	I will set my face against them — they may have escaped one fire , but the fire will consume them yet . When I set my face against them , you will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	15	8	I will make the land desolate because they have dealt so treacherously , ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	16	16	You took your clothes and used them to decorate with bright colors the high places you made for yourself , and there you continued prostituting yourself . Such things shouldn ’ t happen , and in the future they won ’ t .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	2	“ Human being , make Yerushalayim realize how disgusting her practices are .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	3	Say that Adonai Elohim is telling Yerushalayim , ‘ By origin and birth you are of the land of the Kena ‘ ani — your father was an Emori , and your mother was a Hitti .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	4	As for your birth — on the day you were born nobody cut your umbilical cord , washed you in water to clean you off , rubbed salt on you or wrapped you in cloth .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	5	No one seeing you had enough pity on you to do any of these things for you — no one had any compassion on you . Instead , you were thrown into an open field in your own filth on the day you were born .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	6	“ ‘ I passed by and saw you there , wallowing in your own blood ; and as you lay in your blood I said to you , “ Live ! ” Yes , I said to you , as you lay in your blood , “ Live !
CJB	Ezekiel	16	7	I will increase your numbers just like plants growing in the field. ” And you did increase , you developed , you reached puberty , your breasts appeared , and your hair grew long ; but you were naked and exposed .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	8	“ ‘ Again I passed by you , looked at you and saw that your time had come , the time for love . So I spread my cloak over you to cover your private parts and entered into a covenant with you , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ and you became mine .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	9	Then I bathed you in water , washed the blood off you , and anointed you with oil .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	10	I also clothed you with an embroidered gown , gave you fine leather sandals to wear , put a fine linen headband on your head and covered you with silk .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	11	I gave you jewelry to wear , bracelets for your hands , a necklace for your neck ,
CJB	Ezekiel	16	12	a ring for your nose , earrings for your ears and a beautiful crown for your head .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	13	Thus you were decked out in gold and silver ; your clothing was of fine linen , silk and richly embroidered cloth ; you ate the finest flour , honey and olive oil . You grew increasingly beautiful — you were fit to be queen .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	14	Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty , because it was perfect , due to my having bestowed my own splendor on you ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	15	“ ‘ But you put your trust in your own beauty and began prostituting yourself because of your fame , soliciting everyone passing by and accepting all comers .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	17	You also took your beautiful jewels made of my gold and my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself male images , with which you continued to prostitute yourself .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	18	You took your embroidered clothing and covered them ; you set my olive oil and my incense in front of them ;
CJB	Ezekiel	16	19	and you took my food , which I had given you — my fine flour , olive oil and honey , that I had given you to eat — and set it in front of them to give a pleasant aroma . That is how it was , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	20	“ ‘ Moreover , your sons and daughters , whom you bore me , you took and sacrificed for them to devour . Were these fornications of yours a casual matter ? —
CJB	Ezekiel	16	21	killing my children , handing them over and setting them apart for [ these idols ] ?
CJB	Ezekiel	16	22	In all your disgusting practices and fornications you never remembered the condition you were in when you were young — naked , exposed and wallowing in your own blood .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	23	“ ‘ So , after all this wickedness of yours — woe , woe to you ! ’ says Adonai Elohim —
CJB	Ezekiel	16	24	‘ you built platforms and made yourself high places in every open space .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	25	You built your high places at every streetcorner , turning your beauty into an abomination , spreading your legs for every passer-by , and multiplying your acts of fornication .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	26	You had sex with your big-membered Egyptian neighbors and engaged in fornication over and over , just to provoke me .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	27	So now I have stretched out my hand over you , diminished your ration of food and put you at the mercy of those who hate you , the daughters of the P ’ lishtim , who find your lewd behavior revolting .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	28	“ ‘ Still unsatisfied , you acted like a whore also with the people of Ashur ; yes , you fornicated with them and were still not satisfied .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	29	You multiplied your acts of fornication with the land of traders , the Kasdim , and still weren ’ t satisfied .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	30	“ ‘ You are so weak-willed ! ’ says Adonai Elohim . ‘ You do all these things , behaving like a shameless whore ,
CJB	Ezekiel	16	31	building your platforms on every streetcorner , making your high places in every open space — and yet you aren ’ t like a whore , because you scorn getting paid .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	32	Here is a wife who commits adultery , who goes to bed with strangers instead of her husband ;
CJB	Ezekiel	16	33	but also instead of receiving gifts like every other prostitute , you give gifts to all your lovers , you bribe them to come to you from all over the place and have sex with you !
CJB	Ezekiel	16	34	You are the opposite of other women — you solicit the fornication , you aren ’ t solicited ; and you pay them , they don ’ t pay you — you ’ re the opposite !
CJB	Ezekiel	16	35	“ ‘ All right , you whore , listen to the word of Adonai ! ’
CJB	Ezekiel	16	36	Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Because your filth has been poured out and your privates exposed through your acts of fornication with your lovers , and because of all the idols of your disgusting practices , and because of the blood of your children , which you gave them ,
CJB	Ezekiel	16	37	therefore , look ! I am going to gather all your lovers , to whom you have been so very nice , all the ones you hate right along with all the ones you love — I will gather them against you from all over the place and expose your private parts to them , so that they will see you completely naked .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	38	I will pronounce on you the sentence that applies to women who commit adultery and murder ; I will bring on you the death [ decreed for ] furious jealousy .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	39	Yes , I will hand you over to them ; and they will make a ruin of your platforms , tear down your high places , strip you of your clothes , take away your jewels , and leave you naked and exposed .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	40	They will also bring up a mob against you , who will stone you to death and hack you to pieces with their swords .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	41	They will burn your houses to the ground and execute judgments against you in the presence of many women . I will make you stop fornicating , and you will never again pay for a lover .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	42	“ ‘ Yes , I will satisfy my fury against you . But after that , my jealousy will leave you ; and I will calm down and no longer be angry .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	43	“ ‘ Because you didn ’ t remember the condition you were in when you were young , but enraged me with all these things , therefore I will bring [ the consequences of ] your ways on your own head ’ says Adonai Elohim . “ ‘ You committed these obscenities in addition to all your other disgusting practices !
CJB	Ezekiel	16	44	Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb against you , “ Like mother , like daughter. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	16	45	Yes , you are your mother ’ s daughter , who despises her husband and children ; you are the sister of your sisters , who despise their husbands and children ; your mother was a Hitti and your father an Emori .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	46	Moreover , your older sister is Shomron , who lives at your left , she and her daughters ; and your younger sister , living at your right , is S ’ dom with her daughters .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	47	You didn ’ t merely live by their ways and act according to their disgusting practices , but in a very short time you acted more corruptly than they in all your ways .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	48	“ ‘ As I live ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ your sister S ’ dom has not done , neither she nor her daughters , [ as much evil ] as you have done , you and your daughters .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	49	The crimes of your sister S ’ dom were pride and gluttony ; she and her daughters were careless and complacent , so that they did nothing to help the poor and needy .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	50	They were arrogant and committed disgusting acts before me ; so that when I saw it , I swept them away .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	51	Shomron did not commit even half as many sins as you did . You committed many more disgusting acts than your sisters ; in fact , in comparison with all the disgusting acts you have committed , they seem innocent !
CJB	Ezekiel	16	52	But you too must bear your disgrace ; for by your passing judgment that your sisters were innocent , through your having committed sins worse than theirs , they are shown to be more righteous than you . So be ashamed , and bear the disgrace you deserve for making your [ guilty ] sisters seem innocent !
CJB	Ezekiel	16	53	“ ‘ I will end their exile — the exile of S ’ dom and her daughters , the exile of Shomron and her daughters , and the exile of your captives there among them ;
CJB	Ezekiel	16	54	so that you can bear your own shame and experience the disgrace you deserve for all you have done to shield them from feeling their own guilt .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	55	Your sisters , S ’ dom with her daughters and Shomron with her daughters , will return to their previous condition ; and you with your daughters will return to your previous condition .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	56	When you were so proud , you spoke with contempt about your sister S ’ dom ,
CJB	Ezekiel	16	57	before your own wickedness was exposed . But now the daughters of Aram mock you , as do her neighbors ; and the daughters of the P ’ lishtim on every side are repulsed by you .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	58	You have brought it all on yourself with your depravities and disgusting practices , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	59	“ For here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I will do to you as you have done — you treated the oath with contempt by breaking the covenant .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	60	Nevertheless , I will remember the covenant I made with you when you were a girl and will establish an everlasting covenant with you .
CJB	Ezekiel	16	61	Then you will remember your behavior and be ashamed of it as you receive your older and younger sisters and make them your daughters , even though the covenant with you does not cover that ;
CJB	Ezekiel	16	62	and I will re-establish my covenant with you . Then you will know that I am Adonai ;
CJB	Ezekiel	16	63	so that you will remember and be so ashamed that you will never open your mouth again , so ashamed will you be when I have forgiven you all that you have done , ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	17	17	Pharaoh with his mighty army and numerous troops will give him no help in the war , when they raise siege-works and build fortified towers to destroy many people ;
CJB	Ezekiel	17	2	“ Human being , propound this riddle , tell the house of Isra ’ el this allegory ,
CJB	Ezekiel	17	3	say that Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ A big eagle having great wings and long pinions full of varicolored feathers came to the L ’ vanon and took over the top of the cedar .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	4	He cropped off the topmost of its young twigs , carried them to a land of traders and set them down in a city of merchants .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	5	He also took some of the seed in the land and planted it in fertile soil , placing it where there was abundant water , as one would a willow .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	6	It grew to become a fruitful vine sprawling over the ground ; its branches turned toward him , and its roots were under him — thus it became a vine , sprouting branches and putting forth shoots .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	7	“ ‘ There was another big eagle with great wings and many feathers ; and the vine bent its roots toward him and put forth its branches toward him , so that he might water it more than in the bed where it was planted .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	8	It had been planted in good soil , near plenty of water , so that it would produce branches , bear fruit and become a noble vine. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	17	9	“ Say that Adonai Elohim asks : ‘ Will it succeed ? Won ’ t he pull it up by the roots and cut off its fruit ; so that it dries up ; and all its sprouting leaves wither ? There will be no great power and few people there when it is plucked up by the roots .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	10	Will it thrive just because it was planted ? Won ’ t it wither altogether when the east wind strikes it ? Yes , it will wither right there in the beds where it was growing. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	17	11	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	17	12	“ Say to the rebellious house : ‘ Don ’ t you know what these things mean ? ’ Tell them : ‘ Here , the king of Bavel came to Yerushalayim , took its king and princes and brought them to himself in Bavel .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	13	Then he took a member of the royal family and made a covenant with him , putting him under oath . He removed the powerful leaders of the land ,
CJB	Ezekiel	17	14	so that this kingdom of his would stay humble and not develop aspirations of its own ; rather , it would keep his covenant and live accordingly .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	15	But this man rebelled and sent representatives to Egypt , in order to obtain horses and a sizeable army . Can he succeed ? Can someone who does such things escape punishment ? Can he break the covenant and still escape punishment ?
CJB	Ezekiel	17	16	“ ‘ As I live , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ in the place where the king who gave him his throne lives , whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke , there with him in Bavel I swear that he will die .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	18	because he despised the oath by breaking the covenant to which he had sworn allegiance ; having done all these things , he will not escape unpunished. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	17	19	Therefore Adonai Elohim says : ‘ As I live , I swear that it is my oath he has despised and my covenant he has broken , and I will bring this on his own head .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	20	I will spread my net over him , and he will be caught in my snare ; I will bring him to Bavel and bring him to judgment there for breaking faith with me .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	21	The elite troops among his forces will die by the sword , and those who survive will be scattered to every wind . Then you will know that I , Adonai , said it. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	17	22	“ Adonai Elohim says , ‘ From the top of this tall cedar , from its highest branch , I will take a shoot and plant it myself on a high and prominent mountain .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	23	I will plant it on the highest mountain in Isra ’ el , where it will put out branches , bear fruit , and become a noble cedar . Under it will live all kinds of birds ; winged creatures of every description will live there in the shadow of its branches .
CJB	Ezekiel	17	24	Then all the trees of the field will know that I , Adonai , bring down the tall tree and raise up the low tree , wither the green tree and make the withered tree bear fruit . I , Adonai , have spoken ; and I will do it . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	18	18	Yet his father , because he oppressed so cruelly , committed robbery against his brother and never did anything good among his people — he will die for his sins .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	2	“ What does it mean , that you keep quoting this proverb in the land of Isra ’ el — ‘ When parents eat sour grapes , their children ’ s teeth are set on edge ’ ?
CJB	Ezekiel	18	3	“ As I live , ” says Adonai Elohim , “ I swear that you will never again quote this proverb in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	4	Look , all lives belong to me — both the parent ’ s life and the child ’ s life are equally mine — so it is the person who sins , himself , who must die .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	5	“ Consider someone who is righteous , who does what is lawful and right .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	6	He doesn ’ t eat on the mountains or raise his eyes toward the idols of the house of Isra ’ el ; he doesn ’ t defile his neighbor ’ s wife or touch a woman during her time of menstrual impurity ;
CJB	Ezekiel	18	7	he doesn ’ t wrong anyone ; he returns any pledged property a debtor has given as collateral for a loan ; he takes nothing by robbery , but gives his food to the hungry and clothing to those who need it ;
CJB	Ezekiel	18	8	he neither demands nor accepts interest on a loan ; he refrains from what is evil ; and he judges honestly between one person and another .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	9	In short , he lives according to my laws and observes my rulings , so as to act faithfully . Such a person is righteous , and he will certainly live , ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	10	“ Now suppose he is the father of a son who is a robber , a murderer , or who does any of these things to a brother —
CJB	Ezekiel	18	11	whereas the father himself does none of them . He eats on the mountains , defiles his neighbor ’ s wife ,
CJB	Ezekiel	18	12	wrongs the poor and needy , takes by robbery , doesn ’ t restore pledged property , raises his eyes toward the idols , engages in disgusting practices ,
CJB	Ezekiel	18	13	demands and accepts interest . Should he live ? He will not live , because he has engaged in all these disgusting practices — he must be put to death ; his blood is on him .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	14	“ But now suppose he has a son who sees all the sins his father committed , thinks about them , and behaves differently .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	15	He doesn ’ t eat on the mountains , raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Isra ’ el , defile his neighbor ’ s wife ,
CJB	Ezekiel	18	16	wrong others , keep pledged property or take by robbery , but gives his food to the hungry and clothing to those in need of it ;
CJB	Ezekiel	18	17	he refrains from oppressing the poor ; and he neither demands nor accepts interest . He obeys my rulings and lives according to my laws . So he will not die for his father ’ s sins but will certainly live .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	19	“ You ask , ‘ Why doesn ’ t the son bear his father ’ s guilt ? ’ When the son has done what is lawful and right , has kept all my laws and obeyed them , he will certainly live .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	20	The person who sins is the one that will die — a son is not to bear his father ’ s guilt with him , nor is the father to bear his son ’ s guilt with him ; but the righteousness of the righteous will be his own , and the wickedness of the wicked will be his own .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	21	“ However , if the wicked person repents of all the sins he committed , keeps my laws and does what is lawful and right ; then he will certainly live , he will not die .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	22	None of the transgressions he has committed will be remembered against him ; for the righteousness that he has done , he will live .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	23	Do I take any pleasure at all in having the wicked person die ? ” asks Adonai Elohim . “ Wouldn ’ t I prefer that he turn from his ways and live ?
CJB	Ezekiel	18	24	“ On the other hand , when the righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits wickedness by acting in accordance with all the disgusting practices that the wicked person does , will he live ? None of the righteous deeds he has done will be remembered ; for the trespasses and sins he has committed , he will die .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	25	“ So now you say , ‘ Adonai ’ s way isn ’ t fair. ’ Listen , house of Isra ’ el ! Is it my way that is unfair ? or your ways that are unfair ?
CJB	Ezekiel	18	26	When the righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits wickedness , he will die for it — for the wickedness he commits he will die .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	27	And when the wicked person turns away from all the wickedness he has committed and does what is lawful and right , he will save his life .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	28	Because he thinks it over and repents of all the transgressions he committed , he will certainly live , not die .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	29	Yet the house of Isra ’ el says , ‘ Adonai ’ s way isn ’ t fair. ’ House of Isra ’ el , is it my ways that are unfair , or your ways that are unfair ?
CJB	Ezekiel	18	30	Therefore , house of Isra ’ el , I will judge each of you according to his ways , ” says Adonai Elohim . “ Repent , and turn yourselves away from all your transgressions , so that they will not be a stumblingblock that brings guilt upon you .
CJB	Ezekiel	18	31	Throw far away from yourselves all your crimes that you committed , and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit ; for why should you die , house of Isra ’ el ?
CJB	Ezekiel	18	32	I take no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies , ” says Adonai Elohim , “ so turn yourselves around , and live !
CJB	Ezekiel	19	19	“ Moreover , raise a lament for the leaders of Isra ’ el ;
CJB	Ezekiel	19	2	say : ‘ What a mother you had — a lioness among lions ! She lay down among young lions and reared her cubs .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	3	One of her cubs she singled out : he became a young lion , he learned to seize his prey , he became a man-eater .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	4	The nations sounded an alarm against him ; and he was caught in their pit . With hooks they dragged him off to the land of Egypt .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	5	When she saw that she had been thwarted , that her hope was lost , she took another of her cubs and made a young lion of him .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	6	He prowled among the lions , grew to be a young lion , learned to seize his prey and became a man-eater .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	7	He raped their widows and destroyed their cities ; the land and all in it were appalled at the sound of his roaring .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	8	The nations set a snare for him from the provinces all around , they spread their net over him , and he was caught in their pit .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	9	With hooks they put him in a cage and brought him to the king of Bavel to imprison him in a fortress , so that his roar would be heard no more on the mountains of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	10	“ ‘ Your mother was like a strong grapevine planted by the water . It was fruitful and luxuriant because of the abundant water .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	11	It had strong branches to be used as scepters by rulers ; besides having thick foliage , it grew taller and taller , until its height was noticed , with its mass of branches .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	12	But it was torn up in fury and flung on the ground . An east wind withered her fruit , her strong branches were broken off ; they dried up ; and fire consumed the vine .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	13	It has been transplanted to the desert , to a dry , thirsty land .
CJB	Ezekiel	19	14	Fire has gone out from its own branches , burning up its fruit , so that now it has no strong branch to be a ruler ’ s scepter. ’ ” This lamentation became very well known .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	20	and keep my shabbats holy ; and they will be a sign between me and you , so that you will know that I am Adonai your God. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	20	2	and the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	20	3	“ Human being , speak to Isra ’ el ’ s leaders ; tell them that Adonai Elohim asks , ‘ Have you come to consult me ? As I live , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ I swear that I will not let you consult me. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	20	4	“ Are you going to judge them ? Human being , are you going to judge them ? Then have them realize how disgusting their ancestors ’ practices were .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	5	Tell them that Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ Back on the day when I chose Isra ’ el , I raised my hand to the descendants of the house of Ya ‘ akov . I revealed myself to them in the land of Egypt when I raised my hand to them and said , “ I am Adonai your God. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	20	6	On the day I raised my hand to them , pledging to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land I had reconnoitered for them , a land flowing with milk and honey , the most beautiful of all lands ,
CJB	Ezekiel	20	7	I told them , “ Each of you is to throw away the detestable things that draw your eyes . Do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt . I am Adonai your God. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	20	8	“ ‘ But they rebelled against me and wouldn ’ t listen to me ; they did not , each of them , throw away the detestable things that drew their eyes ; and they did not abandon the idols of Egypt . Then I said I would pour out my fury on them and spend my anger on them there in the land of Egypt .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	9	But concern for my own reputation kept me from letting it be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they were living , in the sight of whom I had made myself known to them , in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	10	So I had them leave the land of Egypt and brought them into the desert .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	11	I gave them my laws and showed them my rulings ; if a person obeys them , he will have life through them .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	12	I gave them my shabbats as a sign between me and them , so that they would know that I , Adonai , am the one who makes them holy .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	13	“ ‘ But the house of Isra ’ el rebelled against me in the desert . They did not live by my laws ; and they rejected my rulings , which , if a person does , he will have life through them ; moreover , they greatly profaned my shabbats . Then I said I would pour out my fury on them in the desert , in order to destroy them .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	14	But concern for my own reputation kept me from letting it be profaned in the sight of the nations who had seen when I brought them out .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	15	Yet I also raised my hand and swore to them in the desert that I would not bring them into the land I was giving them , a land flowing with milk and honey , the most beautiful of all lands ;
CJB	Ezekiel	20	16	because they had rejected my rulings , did not live by my laws and profaned my shabbats ; since their hearts went after their idols .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	17	However , I spared them from complete destruction ; I did not completely finish them off in the desert .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	18	“ ‘ I said to their children in the desert , “ Don ’ t live by the laws of your fathers , observe their rulings or defile yourselves with their idols .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	19	I am Adonai your God ; live by my laws , observe my rulings , and obey them ,
CJB	Ezekiel	20	21	“ ‘ But the children too rebelled against me . They did not live by my laws or observe my rulings , to obey them , which , if a person does , he will have life by them ; and they profaned my shabbats . Then I said I would pour out my fury on them and spend my anger on them in the desert .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	22	Nevertheless , I withdrew my hand and allowed concern for my own reputation to keep me from letting it be profaned in the sight of the nations who had seen when I brought them out .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	23	“ ‘ I also raised my hand and swore to them in the desert that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries ;
CJB	Ezekiel	20	24	because they hadn ’ t obeyed my rulings but had rejected my laws and profaned my shabbats , and their eyes had turned toward their fathers ’ idols .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	25	I also gave them laws which did them no good and rulings by which they did not live ;
CJB	Ezekiel	20	26	and I let them become defiled by their own gifts , in that they offered up their firstborn sons , so that I could fill them with revulsion , so that they would [ finally ] realize that I am Adonai. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	20	27	“ Therefore , human being , speak to the house of Isra ’ el ; tell them that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Moreover , your ancestors blasphemed me by breaking faith with me in still another way :
CJB	Ezekiel	20	28	for after I had brought them into the land , which I had raised my hand in pledge to give them , they noted all its high hills and leafy trees and offered there their sacrifices ; there they made offerings that provoked my anger , there they set out their sweet aromas , and there they poured out their drink offerings .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	29	When I asked them , “ This high place where you go , what is the meaning of it ? ” they gave it the name Bamah * which it retains to this day. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	20	30	“ So tell the house of Isra ’ el that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ You are defiling yourselves in the same way as your ancestors , following their abominations and fornicating with them ;
CJB	Ezekiel	20	31	and when offering your gifts , you make your children pass through the fire and defile yourselves with all your idols — to this day . So , am I supposed to allow you to consult me , house of Isra ’ el ? As I live , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ I swear that I won ’ t have you consult me ,
CJB	Ezekiel	20	32	and that what you have in mind when you say , “ We will be like the Goyim , like the families of the other countries , serving wood and stone , ” will certainly not happen .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	33	As I live , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ I swear that surely with a mighty hand , with a stretched-out arm and with poured-out fury I myself will be king over you .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	34	I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you were scattered , with a mighty hand , with a stretched-out arm and with poured-out fury ;
CJB	Ezekiel	20	35	then I will bring you into the desert of the peoples and judge you face to face .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	36	Just as I judged your ancestors in the desert of the land of Egypt , so will I judge you , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	37	‘ I will make you pass under the crook and bring you into the obligations of the covenant .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	38	I will rid you of the rebels who are in revolt against me — I will bring them out from the land where they are living , but they will not enter the land of Isra ’ el ; then you will know that I am Adonai. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	20	39	“ As for you , house of Isra ’ el , here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Go on serving your idols , every one of you ! But afterwards , [ I swear that ] you will listen to me , and you will no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and with your idols .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	40	For on my holy mountain , the high mountain of Isra ’ el , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ the whole house of Isra ’ el , all of them , will serve me in the land . I will accept them there , and there I will require your contributions , your best gifts and all your consecrated things .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	41	I will accept you with your sweet aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you were scattered ; and through you I will manifest my holiness in the sight of the nations .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	42	“ ‘ You will know that I am Adonai when I bring you into the land of Isra ’ el , into the country which I pledged , by raising my hand , to give to your ancestors .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	43	There you will remember your behavior and all the things you did by which you defiled yourselves , and you will loathe yourselves for all the evils you committed .
CJB	Ezekiel	20	44	You will know that I am Adonai when I have dealt with you in a manner that preserves my reputation , and not according to your evil ways and corrupt actions , house of Isra ’ el ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	21	21	) For the king of Bavel is standing at the fork in the road , where the two roads separate , about to use divination — he is shaking the arrows , consulting the household gods , examining the liver .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	2	) “ Human being , turn your face toward Yerushalayim , preach to the sanctuaries and prophesy to the land of Isra ’ el ;
CJB	Ezekiel	21	3	) tell the land of Isra ’ el that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ I am against you . I will draw my sword from its scabbard and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	4	) Since I am going to rid you of both righteous and evildoers , my sword will also go out of its scabbard against everyone , from the Negev to the north .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	5	) Everyone alive will know that I , Adonai , drew my sword from its scabbard ; it will not be sheathed again. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	21	6	) “ Therefore , human being , groan ! Groan bitterly , as if your heart would break , as they watch .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	1	) Then the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	21	7	) Then , when they ask you , ‘ Why are you groaning ? ’ you will answer , ‘ Because of the news , because it ’ s coming . All hearts will melt , all hands hang limp , all spirits faint and all knees turn to water ; here , it ’ s coming , it will happen , ’ says Adonai Elohim. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	21	8	) The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	21	9	) “ Human being , prophesy . Say that Adonai Elohim says to say this : ‘ A sword , a sword has been sharpened and polished ,
CJB	Ezekiel	21	10	) sharpened in order to slaughter and slaughter , polished to flash like lightning . But how can we rejoice ? My son rejects the rod and every other stick .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	11	) The sword was given to be polished , so that it could be wielded ; it was sharpened and polished to be placed in the slaughterer ’ s hand. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	21	12	) “ Shout and wail , human being , because it ’ s coming upon my people , upon all the leaders of Isra ’ el — they will be victims of the sword along with my people . Strike your thigh in remorse !
CJB	Ezekiel	21	13	) For a test is coming , and what if he rejects the rod again then ? He will cease to exist , ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	14	) “ Therefore , human being , prophesy and clap your hands together . Then the sword will strike twice , three times , the sword for victims , the sword for a great slaughter , coming from every direction .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	15	) So that their hearts will melt , and many will stumble and fall , I have posted the point of the sword at every one of their gates . See how it flashes , sharpened for the kill !
CJB	Ezekiel	21	16	) “ Sword ! Slash to the right ; destroy to the left , whichever way your edge is aimed !
CJB	Ezekiel	21	17	) I too will clap my hands together and satisfy my fury . I , Adonai , have spoken. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	21	18	) The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	21	19	) “ Now , human being , designate two roads for the sword of the king of Bavel to follow , both coming out of one country . Put up a signpost at the start of the road leading to the city .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	20	) Make a road , so that the sword can come to Rabbah of the people of ‘ Amon and to Y ’ hudah in fortified Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	22	) Into his right hand comes the lot for Yerushalayim , to set up battering rams , give the order for slaughter , raise a shout , set battering rams against the gates , build siege ramps and erect watchtowers .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	23	) The inhabitants will believe this is a false divination because of the oaths upon oaths [ that their false prophets have sworn to the contrary ] . But it will cause [ God ] to remember their guilt and thus insure their capture .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	24	) “ Therefore this is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Because you have caused your guilt to be remembered , with your misdeeds revealed and the sins in all your actions evident — since you have been remembered , you will be captured. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	21	25	) As for you , you wicked prince of Isra ’ el , due to be killed , whose day has come , at the time of final punishment ,
CJB	Ezekiel	21	26	) here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Remove the turban , take off the crown ! Everything is being changed . What was low will be raised up , and what was high will be brought down .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	27	) Ruin ! Ruin ! I will leave it a ruin such as there has never been , and it will stay that way until the rightful ruler comes , and I give it to him. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	21	28	) “ You , human being , prophesy ! Say that Adonai Elohim says this about the people of ‘ Amon and their insults : ‘ A sword , a sword , is drawn for slaughter , polished to the utmost , to flash like lightning —
CJB	Ezekiel	21	29	) while [ your prophets ] produce false visions for you , while they divine lies for you — to lay you out upon the necks of the wicked who are to be killed , whose day has come , at the time of final punishment .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	30	) Cause it to return to its scabbard ! I will judge you in the place where you were created , in the land of your origin .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	31	) I will pour my fury out on you , breathe on you with the fire of my rage , and hand you over to barbarous men highly skilled in destruction .
CJB	Ezekiel	21	32	) You will be fuel for the fire , your blood will flow through the land , you will be remembered no more ; for I , Adonai , have spoken . ’ ”

CJB	Ezekiel	22	2	“ Now , human being , are you prepared to judge ? Are you prepared to judge the city drenched in blood ? Then make her realize how disgusting all her practices are !
CJB	Ezekiel	22	3	Say that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ City that sheds blood within yourself , thus speeding your own doom , and that makes idols for yourself that defile you :
CJB	Ezekiel	22	4	you are guilty because of the blood you have shed , you are defiled by your idols that you have made . You have shortened your days , you have completed your years ; therefore I have made you an object of scorn for the nations and a laughingstock for every country .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	5	Those close by and those far off will taunt you , you who have such a defiled reputation and such great disorder .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	6	“ ‘ The leaders of Isra ’ el in you all use their power in order to shed blood .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	7	In you , they make light of fathers and mothers , they oppress foreigners , they wrong orphans and widows .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	8	You treat my holy things with contempt , you profane my shabbats .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	9	In you , people gossip to the point of inciting bloodshed ; in you are those who go to eat on the mountains ; in you , they commit lewd acts ;
CJB	Ezekiel	22	10	in you , they commit incest ; in you , they force themselves on women during their menstrual impurity .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	11	In you , one commits an abomination with his neighbor ’ s wife ; another commits some lewd act defiling his daughter-in-law ; still another humbles his sister , his own father ’ s daughter .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	12	In you , people take bribes to shed blood ; you demand and accept interest on loans ; in greed you make profits off your neighbors by extorting them ; and you have forgotten me , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	13	“ ‘ Therefore , I am clapping my hands together because of your ill-gotten gains and the blood shed in you .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	14	Can your courage last , can your strength continue during the days when I deal with you ? I , Adonai , have spoken it ; and I will do it .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	15	I will scatter you among the Goyim and disperse you throughout the countries ; thus I will remove your defilement from you ,
CJB	Ezekiel	22	16	and you will cause yourselves to be profaned in full view of the Goyim . Then you will know that I am Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	22	17	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	22	18	“ Human being , the house of Isra ’ el has become an alloy of base metals for me ; they are all copper , tin , iron and lead mixed together in the crucible , the dross left over from the silver .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	19	Therefore Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ Because you have all become dross , I will collect all of you inside Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	20	Then , just as they collect silver , copper , iron , lead and tin into a crucible and blow fire on it to melt it down ; so likewise I will collect you in my anger and fury , throw you in there , and melt you down .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	21	Yes , I will collect you and blow on you with the fire of my rage , and you will be melted down in it .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	23	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	22	24	“ Human being , tell her this : ‘ You are a land that is neither cleansed nor rained on in the day of fury .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	25	There is a conspiracy of prophets in it like a roaring lion tearing up the prey ; they have devoured people , seized wealth and valuables , and widowed many in it .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	26	Her cohanim have done violence to my Torah , profaned my holy things , made no difference between the holy and the common , not distinguished between unclean and clean , hidden their eyes from my shabbats , and profaned me among themselves .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	27	Her leaders in it are like wolves tearing up the prey to shed blood and destroy people , in order to benefit unjustly .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	28	Her prophets have “ plastered ” for them with whitewash , seeing false visions and divining lies for them , saying , “ Thus says Adonai Elohim , ” when Adonai has not spoken .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	29	The people of the land have extorted , robbed , wronged the poor and needy and unjustly oppressed foreigners .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	30	“ ‘ I sought for a man among them who could build a barricade or stand in the break to oppose me on behalf of the land , so that I would not destroy it ; but I found no one .
CJB	Ezekiel	22	31	Therefore I am pouring out my fury on them , consuming them with the fire of my rage , bringing their own ways on their own heads , ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	23	23	the men of Bavel and all the Kasdim , P ’ kod , Shoa and Koa , and with them all the men of Ashur , good-looking young men , all of them governors and rulers , commanders and officers , all on horseback .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	2	“ Human being ! There were two women , daughters of the same mother ,
CJB	Ezekiel	23	3	who were whores in Egypt — even as young girls they were whores . There they let their breasts be caressed , and there their virgin nipples were fondled .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	4	Their names were Oholah , the older one , and Oholivah , her sister . They belonged to me , and they gave birth to sons and daughters . As for their names , Shomron is Oholah , and Yerushalayim is Oholivah .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	5	“ Even when she belonged to me , Oholah prostituted herself ; she lusted after her lovers from Ashur — warriors
CJB	Ezekiel	23	6	dressed in blue , governors , rulers , all of them good-looking young men riding on horseback .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	7	She gave herself as a whore to them , all of them the elite of Ashur ; and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	8	She did not give up the whoring she had begun in Egypt , where men had sex with her , fondled her virgin nipples and flooded her with their fornication .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	9	“ So I handed her over to her lovers , the men of Ashur she lusted after .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	10	They exposed her private parts , took her sons and daughters , and put her to death with the sword ; so that she became notorious among women for the judgments executed against her .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	11	“ Her sister Oholivah saw this ; nevertheless she was worse than her sister in lusting and likewise in whoring .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	12	She lusted after the men from Ashur , governors and rulers , warriors dressed to perfection , skilled horsemen , all of them good-looking young men .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	13	I saw that she had defiled herself ; both sisters had gone down the same path .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	14	She prostituted herself more than ever ; because she saw wall-carvings of men , depicting the Kasdim in vermilion ,
CJB	Ezekiel	23	15	with sashes wrapped around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads , all of them looking like military men , the very image of men of Bavel born in the land of the Kasdim .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	16	The moment she saw them , she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in the land of the Kasdim ;
CJB	Ezekiel	23	17	and the men of Bavel climbed into her “ love bed ” and defiled her with their lust . She was defiled by them , and then filled with revulsion at them .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	18	Thus did she reveal her fornication and expose her private parts . When this happened , I was filled with revulsion at her , just as I had been filled with revulsion at her sister .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	19	Still she kept increasing her whoring , remembering the days when she was young , fornicating in the land of Egypt .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	20	Yes , she lusted after their male prostitutes , whose members are like those of donkeys and who ejaculate like stallions .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	21	You yearned for the lewdness of your girlhood , when the Egyptians used to fondle your nipples and caress your young breasts .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	22	“ Therefore , Oholivah , here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I will raise up your lovers against you , the ones who fill you with revulsion , and bring them against you from every side —
CJB	Ezekiel	23	24	They will advance on you armed with chariots , wagons and with an army drawn from many peoples ; they will array themselves against you from every side with breastplates , shields and helmets . I will give them the authority to judge , and they will judge you as they see fit .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	25	I will direct my jealousy against you , so that they will deal with you in fury — they will cut off your nose and ears , and what is left of you will die by the sword ; they will seize your sons and daughters , and those who remain of you will be consumed by the fire .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	26	They will strip you of your clothes and seize your fine jewels .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	27	Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your fornication brought from the land of Egypt , so that you will no longer raise your eyes toward them or remember Egypt any more. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	23	28	For this is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I am about to hand you over to those you hate , to those who fill you with revulsion ;
CJB	Ezekiel	23	29	and they will deal with you in hatred , seize everything you have worked for , and leave you naked and exposed — the full shame of your whoring will be exposed , your lewdness and your fornicating .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	30	These things will be done to you because you have gone fornicating with the Goyim , and because you are defiled with their idols .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	31	You walked down your sister ’ s path , so I will put her cup in your hand. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	23	32	Adonai Elohim says : ‘ You will drink from your sister ’ s cup , a cup both deep and wide , full right up to the brim with scorn and derision ,
CJB	Ezekiel	23	33	filling you with drunkenness and sorrow , a cup of horror and devastation — the cup of your sister Shomron .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	34	You will drink it , you will drain it , and then you will gnaw it to shreds and tear out your own breasts ! For I have spoken it ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	35	“ Therefore this is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Because you forgot me and flung me behind your back , you will bear the guilt of your lewdness and whoring. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	23	36	Then Adonai said to me , “ Human being , are you ready to judge Oholah and Oholivah ? Then confront them with their disgusting practices .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	37	For they committed adultery , and their hands are dripping with blood . They committed adultery with their idols ; and they offered their sons , whom they bore to me , for these idols to eat .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	38	Moreover , they have done this to me as well : they defiled my sanctuary on the same day , and they profaned my shabbats .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	39	For after killing their children for their idols , they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it ; this they did in my house .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	40	“ Worse still , you sent a messenger summoning men to come from a distance ; and they came . For them you washed yourself , painted your eyes , decked yourself with your finery ,
CJB	Ezekiel	23	41	and sat on a sumptuous bed , with a table arranged before it , on which you put my incense and my olive oil .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	42	The noise of a carefree crowd could be heard there ; many of the men were brought in drunk from the desert . They put bracelets on their hands and magnificent crowns on their heads .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	43	I thought , ‘ That woman ! She ’ s worn out from all her adulteries , but they still go to fornicate with her ! ’
CJB	Ezekiel	23	44	For every one went in to her ; just as men go in to a prostitute , so they went in to Oholah and Oholivah , those debauched women .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	45	Nevertheless , there are righteous men who will judge them as adulterers and murderers are supposed to be judged ; because they are adulterers , and blood is dripping from their hands .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	46	For here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Summon an assembly to punish them ; give them over to terror and plunder .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	47	Let the assembly stone them to death , dispatch them with their swords , kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses to the ground .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	48	“ ‘ Thus I will put an end to lewdness in the land , so that all women may be taught not to imitate your lewdness .
CJB	Ezekiel	23	49	You will receive the punishment your lewdness deserves , and you will pay the penalty for your idolatries . Then you will know that I am Adonai Elohim . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	24	24	Thus Yechezk ’ el will be a sign for you ; you will do just what he has done ; and when this happens , you will know that I am Adonai Elohim. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	24	2	“ Human being , write down today ’ s date ; because on this very day the king of Bavel has begun his attack on Yerushalayim .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	3	And tell this allegory to these rebels ; say that Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Put a pot on the fire ; put it there , pour water in it ;
CJB	Ezekiel	24	4	Put in it pieces of meat , all the best parts — the thigh , the shoulder ; fill it with the choicest cuts ,
CJB	Ezekiel	24	5	taken from the pick of the flock , and pile the bones underneath . Bring it to a rolling boil , till it ’ s all cooked , even the bones. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	24	6	“ Therefore Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Woe to the city drenched with blood , to the pot whose scum is in it , and whose scum has not been removed . Empty it piece by piece , without troubling to draw lots .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	7	For her blood is still in her ; she poured it on bare rock ; she did not pour it on the ground , to cover it with dust .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	8	So in order to rouse my fury and excite my vengeance , I have fixed her blood there on the bare rock , where it will not be covered. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	24	9	“ Therefore Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ Woe to the city drenched with blood ! I myself will make a huge bonfire ,
CJB	Ezekiel	24	10	heap on the wood , light it , cook the meat and add the spices — the bones can just be burned .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	11	Put the empty pot on the coals , heat it till its copper bottom glows , till its impurity melts inside it , and its scum is burned away .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	12	But the effort is in vain : its layers of scum will not leave it ; so into the fire with its scum !
CJB	Ezekiel	24	13	Because of your filthy lewdness , because you refused to be purified when I wanted to purify you ; now you will not be purified from your filth until I have satisfied my fury on you .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	14	“ ‘ I , Adonai , have spoken it , and it will happen . I will do it , I will not turn back , I will not refrain or spare or relent . They will judge you as your ways and deeds deserve , ’ says Adonai Elohim. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	24	15	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	24	16	“ Human being , with a single blow I am about to deprive you of the delight of your eyes . But you are not to lament , weep or let your tears run down .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	17	Sigh silently , don ’ t observe mourning for the dead , bind your turban on your head , put your sandals on your feet , don ’ t cover your upper lip , and don ’ t eat the food people prepare for mourners. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	24	18	I spoke to the people in the morning , and that evening my wife died . So I did the following morning as I had been ordered .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	19	The people asked me , “ Won ’ t you tell us what these actions of yours mean for us ? ”
CJB	Ezekiel	24	20	I answered them , “ The word of Adonai came to me , telling me
CJB	Ezekiel	24	21	to speak to the house of Isra ’ el and say that this is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I am about to profane my sanctuary , the pride of your strength , the delight of your eyes and your heart ’ s desire . Your sons and daughters whom you have left behind will die by the sword .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	22	But you are to do as I have done — not cover your upper lips , not eat the food people prepare for mourners ,
CJB	Ezekiel	24	23	put your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet , and neither observe mourning nor cry . Rather , because of your crimes you will pine away and groan to one another .
CJB	Ezekiel	24	25	“ As for you , human being , on the day when I take away from them their stronghold , their crowning joy , the delight of their eyes , their heart ’ s desire , their sons and daughters —
CJB	Ezekiel	24	26	on that day a fugitive will come and bring you the news ;
CJB	Ezekiel	24	27	and on that day your mouth will be opened for you to speak to the survivor and no longer be silent . In this way you will be a sign to them , and they will know that I am Adonai . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	25	25	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	25	2	“ Human being , turn your face toward the people of ‘ Amon and prophesy against them ;
CJB	Ezekiel	25	3	say to the people of ‘ Amon , ‘ Hear the word of Adonai Elohim . Adonai Elohim says , “ Because you gloated when my sanctuary was profaned , when the land of Isra ’ el was laid waste , and when the house of Y ’ hudah went into exile ;
CJB	Ezekiel	25	4	I will let the people from the east take possession of you . They will set up camps and build their homes among you ; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk .
CJB	Ezekiel	25	5	I will turn Rabbah into a camel pasture and ‘ Amon into a sheep-yard . Then you will know that I am Adonai. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	25	6	For here is what Adonai Elohim says : “ Because you clapped your hands and stamped your feet , full of malicious joy over the land of Isra ’ el ;
CJB	Ezekiel	25	7	I am going to stretch out my hand over you and deliver you as plunder to the nations ; I will cut you off from being a people and cause you to cease from being a nation ; I will destroy you . Then you will know that I am Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	25	8	“ Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Because Mo ’ av and Se ‘ ir say , “ The house of Y ’ hudah is like all the other nations , ”
CJB	Ezekiel	25	9	I will expose the flank of Mo ’ av , with all its cities — that is , all the cities on its frontier , the glory of the land , Beit-Yeshimot , Ba ‘ al-M ‘ on and Kiryatayim —
CJB	Ezekiel	25	10	together with the people of ‘ Amon , to the people from the east , whom I will let take possession of them . Thus the people of ‘ Amon will not be remembered as being one of the nations ;
CJB	Ezekiel	25	11	and I will execute judgments on Mo ’ av . Then they will know that I am Adonai. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	25	12	“ Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Because Edom has taken severe vengeance against the house of Y ’ hudah , incurring much guilt by its acts of vengeance against them ,
CJB	Ezekiel	25	13	therefore , ’ Adonai Elohim says , ‘ I will stretch my hand out over Edom and eliminate both its humans and its animals . I will make it a ruin ; from Teman to D ’ dan they will die by the sword .
CJB	Ezekiel	25	14	Moreover , I will lay my vengeance on Edom through my people Isra ’ el ; they will treat Edom in accordance with my anger and my fury ; and they will know my vengeance ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	25	15	“ Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Because the P ’ lishtim have acted out of vengeance , taking revenge and destroying with malice of heart , due to their long-standing hatred ;
CJB	Ezekiel	25	16	therefore , ’ Adonai Elohim says , ‘ I will stretch out my hand over the P ’ lishtim , eliminate the K ’ reti and destroy the rest of the seacoast peoples .
CJB	Ezekiel	25	17	I will execute great vengeance on them with furious punishments ; and they will know that I am Adonai when I lay my vengeance on them . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	26	26	On the first day of the month in the eleventh year , the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	26	2	“ Human being , since Tzor has said against Yerushalayim , ‘ Ha ! She is shattered , the gateway of the peoples . Now that she is ruined , her riches will be mine ’ ;
CJB	Ezekiel	26	3	therefore , Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Look , Tzor ! I am against you . Just as the sea churns up its waves , I will churn up many nations against you .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	4	They will destroy the walls of Tzor , they will demolish her towers . I will scrape its soil from her and reduce her to bare rock .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	5	With the sea all around her , she will be a place for drying fish nets and a plunder for the nations . I have spoken , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	6	‘ Her daughters on the mainland will be put to death with the sword ; then they will know that I am Adonai. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	26	7	“ For here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I will bring upon Tzor , from the north , N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel , king of kings , with horses , chariots , cavalry , and a great and powerful army .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	8	“ ‘ Your daughters on the mainland he will put to death with the sword . He will build siege-towers against you , he will build a ramp against you and raise a screen of shields against you .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	9	He will pound your walls with his battering-rams and break down your towers with his axes .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	10	His horses are so many that their dust will cover you . The thunder of cavalry , wagons and chariots will shake your walls , as he enters your gates , like men storming a city through a breach .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	11	With the hoofs of his horses he will trample your streets . He will put your people to the sword and pull to the ground your massive standing-stones .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	12	They will seize your wealth , loot your wares , break down your walls , destroy your fine houses ; then they will throw your stones and timber and even your dust into the sea .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	13	I will put an end to your singing , the sound of your lyres will be heard no more .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	14	I will reduce you to bare rock , you will be a place for drying fish nets , you will never be built again , for I , Adonai , have spoken , ’ says Adonai Elohim. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	26	15	To Tzor Adonai Elohim says : “ How the coastlands will shake at the sound of your fall , when the wounded groan , when the slaughter takes place in you !
CJB	Ezekiel	26	16	Then all the princes of the sea will step down from their thrones ; they will put aside their robes and strip off their embroidered garments . They will clothe themselves with trembling ; they will sit on the ground , trembling all the time , appalled at your condition .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	17	Then they will raise this lament for you : “ ‘ How you have been destroyed , you who were peopled from the seas , city so renowned , once so strong at sea , you and your inhabitants , who used to spread terror over all [ the mainland ’ s ] inhabitants !
CJB	Ezekiel	26	18	Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your downfall , and the islands in the sea are in shock at your end. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	26	19	“ For here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ When I make you a ruined city , like other uninhabited cities ; when I bring the deep sea over you , and its mighty waters cover you ;
CJB	Ezekiel	26	20	then I will bring you down with those who descend to the pit , to the people of long ago , and make you live in underworld places like those who were ruined long ago , with those who descend to the pit , so that you will be uninhabited when I give glory to the land of the living .
CJB	Ezekiel	26	21	I will make you horrible ; you will cease to exist . People will seek you but never more find you , ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	27	27	Your riches , your goods , your merchandise , your crew , your pilots , your ship-sealers , your traders , all your warriors aboard , and all the others in the ship with you will sink surrounded by the sea on the day of your shipwreck .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	2	“ You , human being , raise this lament for Tzor ;
CJB	Ezekiel	27	3	say to Tzor , located at the gateways to the sea , merchant for peoples to many coastlands , that Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Tzor , you have said , “ My beauty is perfect. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	27	4	Your borders are in the heart of the sea , your builders perfected your beauty .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	5	They used cypress logs from S ’ nir to fashion all your planking . They took cedars from the L ’ vanon to make masts for you .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	6	Out of oaks from Bashan they made your oars . Your deck they made of ivory inlaid in larch from the coasts of Kittim .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	7	Richly woven linen from Egypt was used for your sail , which was also your banner . Blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah was used to cover your deck-tent .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	8	The people of Tzidon and Arvad served as your oarsmen . Your own skilled men , Tzor , were there as your pilots .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	9	The leaders and craftsmen of G ’ val sealed the cracks between your boards . “ ‘ Every seagoing ship and its crew came to you to trade in your wares .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	10	Men from Paras , Lud and Put were [ mercenaries ] in your army ; hanging shield and helmet on you , they showed off your splendor .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	11	Men from Arvad and your own army were posted around on your walls . The Gamadim were in your towers ; they hung their shields all around your walls , making your beauty perfect .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	12	“ ‘ Tarshish did business with you because of the quantity and variety of your resources ; they exchanged silver , iron , tin and lead for your goods .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	13	Greece , Tuval and Meshekh traded with you , exchanging slaves and articles of bronze for your wares .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	14	The people of Togarmah traded for your merchandise with horses , horsemen and mules .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	15	The men of D ’ dan traded with you . Many coastlands were your customers , giving you ivory tusks and ebony in payment .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	16	Aram traded with you , because you were so wealthy ; for your goods they exchanged green feldspar , purple stuff , embroidery , fine linen , coral and rubies .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	17	Y ’ hudah and the land of Isra ’ el also traded with you , exchanging for your goods wheat from Minnit , millet , honey , olive oil and resin for healing .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	18	Because you were so wealthy , with such a variety of valuable merchandise , Dammesek traded wine from Helbon and white wool with you .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	19	V ’ dan and Yavan from Uzal traded ironwork , cassia and aromatic cane for your goods .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	20	D ’ dan traded with you for riding gear .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	21	Arabia and all the princes of K ’ dar were your customers ; for your goods they traded lambs , rams and goats .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	22	The traders of Sh ’ va and Ra ‘ mah exchanged the best quality spices , all kinds of precious stones and gold for your goods .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	23	The merchants of Haran , Kaneh and ‘ Eden , who traded also with Sh ’ va , Ashur and Kilmad ,
CJB	Ezekiel	27	24	brought you in exchange for your goods rich clothes , cloaks made of blue material and embroidery , and cedar-lined chests filled with multicolored clothing and bound with cords .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	25	“ Tarshish ” ships transported your imports and exports . “ ‘ So you were full , loaded down , surrounded by the sea .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	26	Your oarsmen brought you through heavy seas . But the east wind will break you surrounded by the sea .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	28	When they hear the cries of your pilots , the mainland coasts will tremble .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	29	The oarsmen , crew and pilots will disembark and stand on shore ,
CJB	Ezekiel	27	30	mourning aloud at your fate , crying bitterly , throwing dust on their heads , rolling in the ashes ,
CJB	Ezekiel	27	31	shaving their heads bald for you , wrapping themselves in sackcloth , with heartfelt bitterness weeping for you in bitter lamentation .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	32	Wailing , they will raise a lament for you ; this will be their lament for you : “ ‘ “ Who anywhere in the sea has ever been silenced like Tzor ?
CJB	Ezekiel	27	33	When your wares came forth from the seas , you satisfied many peoples ; with your vast wealth and variety of goods you enriched the kings of the earth .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	34	But now you have been wrecked by the waves , sunk in the watery depths ; your merchandise and all your people have gone down with you .
CJB	Ezekiel	27	35	All who live along the coasts are aghast at you ; their kings are horribly afraid , their faces are convulsed ;
CJB	Ezekiel	27	36	the merchants among the peoples are gasping at your fate ; you are an object of terror , and you will cease to exist . ” ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	28	28	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	28	2	“ Human being , tell the prince of Tzor that Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Because you are so proud and have said , “ I am a god ; I sit on the throne of God , surrounded by the sea ” ; yet you are a man , not God , even though you think that you think like God .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	3	Sure , you are wiser than Dani ’ el ! No secret can be hidden from you !
CJB	Ezekiel	28	4	By your wisdom and discernment you have acquired wealth , you have gathered gold and silver into your treasuries .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	5	By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth , and it is because of your wealth that you have become so proud .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	6	“ Therefore Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Because you think that you think like God ,
CJB	Ezekiel	28	7	I will bring foreigners against you , the most barbarous of the nations , to draw their swords against your fine wisdom and defile your splendor .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	8	They will lower you into the pit to die a violent death surrounded by the sea .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	9	Will you still say , “ I am God , ” to them who are about to kill you ? You are a man , you are not God , in the hands of those who defile you .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	10	You will die the deaths of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners . For I have spoken , ’ says Adonai Elohim. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	28	11	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	28	12	“ Human being , raise a lament for the king of Tzor , and tell him that Adonai Elohim says : ‘ You put the seal on perfection ; you were full of wisdom and perfect in beauty ;
CJB	Ezekiel	28	13	you were in ‘ Eden , the garden of God ; covered with all kinds of precious stones — carnelians , topaz , diamonds , beryl , onyx , jasper , sapphires , green feldspar , emeralds ; your pendants and jewels were made of gold , prepared the day you were created .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	14	You were a keruv , protecting a large region ; I placed you on God ’ s holy mountain . You walked back and forth among stones of fire .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	15	You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created , until unrighteousness was found in you .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	16	“ ‘ When your commerce grew , you became filled with violence ; and in this way you sinned . Therefore I have thrown you out , defiled , from the mountain of God ; I have destroyed you , protecting keruv , from among the stones of fire .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	17	Your heart grew proud because of your beauty , you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor . But I have thrown you on the ground ; before kings I have made you a spectacle .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	18	By your many crimes in dishonest trading , you have profaned your sanctuaries ; therefore I brought forth fire from within you , and it has devoured you ; I reduced you into ashes on the ground in the sight of all who can see you .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	19	All who know you among the peoples will be aghast at you . You are an object of terror , and you will cease to exist. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	28	20	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	28	21	“ Human being , turn your face toward Tzidon , and prophesy against it .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	22	Say that Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I am against you , Tzidon ; but I will be glorified in you . They will know that I am Adonai , once I execute judgments in her and show my holiness in her .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	23	For I will send plagues into her , and blood will flow in her streets ; attacked from all sides by the sword , the wounded will fall within her . Then they will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	24	“ ‘ The house of Isra ’ el will no longer have a briar pricking away at them , no longer will any of its contemptuous neighbors be a thorn to stab them . Then they will know that I am Adonai Elohim. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	28	25	“ Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Once I have gathered the house of Isra ’ el from the peoples among whom they are scattered , once I have shown my holiness in them as the Goyim watch , then they will live in their own land , which I gave to my servant Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Ezekiel	28	26	They will have security when they live there , building houses and planting vineyards ; yes , they will live in safety , once I have executed judgments against all their contemptuous neighbors . Then they will know that I am Adonai their God . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	29	29	On the twelfth day of the tenth month of the tenth year , the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	29	2	“ Human being , turn your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt ; prophesy against him and against all Egypt ;
CJB	Ezekiel	29	3	speak out ; and say that Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I am against you , Pharaoh king of Egypt , you big crocodile lying in the streams of the Nile ! You say , “ My Nile is mine ; I made it for myself. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	29	4	But I will put hooks in your jaws and make your Nile fish stick to your scales . Yes , I will bring you up from your Nile , with all your Nile fish sticking to your scales ,
CJB	Ezekiel	29	5	and leave you in the desert , you and all your Nile fish . You will fall in the open field and not be gathered or buried ; but I will give you as food to wild animals and birds .
CJB	Ezekiel	29	6	Then all who live in Egypt will know that I am Adonai , because they have been a support made of straw for the house of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	29	7	When they grasped you in hand , you splintered and threw all their shoulders out of joint ; when they leaned on you , you broke and made them all wrench their backs. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	29	8	“ Therefore Adonai Elohim says , ‘ I will bring the sword against you and eliminate both your people and your animals .
CJB	Ezekiel	29	9	The land of Egypt will become a desolate waste , and they will know that I am Adonai ; because he said , “ The Nile is mine ; I made it. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	29	10	So I am against you and your Nile ; and I will make the land of Egypt a totally desolate waste from Migdol to S ’ venah , all the way to the border of Ethiopia .
CJB	Ezekiel	29	11	No human foot will pass through it , and no animal foot will pass through it ; it will be uninhabited for forty years .
CJB	Ezekiel	29	12	Yes , I will make the land of Egypt desolate , even when compared with other desolate countries , likewise her cities in comparison with other ruined cities ; they will be desolate forty years . I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	29	13	“ For this is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered —
CJB	Ezekiel	29	14	I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and cause them to return to the land of their origin , Patros . But there they will be a humble kingdom ,
CJB	Ezekiel	29	15	the humblest of kingdoms . It will never again dominate other nations ; I will reduce them , so that they never again rule other nations .
CJB	Ezekiel	29	16	Moreover , they will no longer be a source of confidence for Isra ’ el to turn to ; rather , it will only bring to mind their guilt in having turned to them before . Then they will know that I am Adonai Elohim. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	29	17	On the first day of the first month of the twenty-seventh year , the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	29	18	“ Human being , N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel had his army mount a massive expedition against Tzor ; [ the loads of dirt they carried ] made every head bald and every shoulder raw ; yet neither he nor his army derived any benefit from Tzor out of this expedition against it .
CJB	Ezekiel	29	19	Therefore Adonai Elohim says , ‘ I will give the land of Egypt to N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel . He will carry off its riches , take its spoil and its prey ; and these will be the wages for his army .
CJB	Ezekiel	29	20	I am giving him the land of Egypt as his wages for which he worked , because they were working for me , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	29	21	‘ When that day comes I will cause power to return to the house of Isra ’ el , and I will enable you [ Yechezk ’ el ] to open your mouth among them . Then they will know that I am Adonai . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	30	30	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	30	2	“ Human being , prophesy ; say that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Wail , “ Oh no ! It ’ s today ! ”
CJB	Ezekiel	30	3	For the day is near , the Day of Adonai , a day of clouds , the time of the Goyim .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	4	The sword will come against Egypt , and Ethiopia will be in anguish , when the slain fall in Egypt , when they take away her wealth , and her foundations are torn down .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	5	Ethiopia , Put and Lud , all the mixed population and Kuv , and the people of allied lands will die by the sword with them. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	30	6	“ Adonai says this : ‘ Those supporting Egypt will fall ; its arrogant power will be brought down ; from Migdol to S ’ venah they will die by the sword , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	7	“ They will be desolate even when compared with other desolate countries , likewise her cities in comparison with other ruined cities .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	8	They will know that I am Adonai when I set fire to Egypt , and those supporting it are destroyed .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	9	When that day comes , I will send out messengers in ships to terrify the unsuspecting Ethiopians ; and anguish will overcome them on the day of Egypt . Yes , here it comes !
CJB	Ezekiel	30	10	“ Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I will destroy the hordes of Egypt through N ’ vukhadretzar king of Bavel .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	11	He and his people , the most barbarous of the nations , will be brought in to ravage the land . They will unsheathe their swords against Egypt and fill the land with corpses .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	12	I will dry up the streams of the Nile and sell the land to the wicked . Through the power of foreigners I will make the land and all that is in it desolate . I , Adonai , have spoken. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	30	13	“ Here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I will destroy the idols , make the false gods in Nof cease to exist . No longer will there be a prince from the land of Egypt ; I will put fear in the land of Egypt ,
CJB	Ezekiel	30	14	desolate Patros , set fire to Tzo ‘ an , execute judgements in No ,
CJB	Ezekiel	30	15	pour my fury on Seen the stronghold of Egypt , and destroy the hordes of No .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	16	Yes , I will set fire to Egypt ; Seen will writhe in anguish ; No will be torn apart ; enemies will attack Nof in broad daylight .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	17	The young men of On and Pi-Veset will die by the sword , while the cities themselves will go into captivity .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	18	At T ’ chafn ’ ches the day will grow dark when I break the yokes of Egypt there , and the pride she takes in her power ceases . A cloud will cover her , and her daughters will go into captivity .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	19	Thus will I execute judgments on Egypt . Then they will know that I am Adonai. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	30	20	On the seventh day of the first month of the eleventh year , the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	30	21	“ Human being , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; it has not been bound up with dressings and bandages , so that it can heal and become strong enough again to wield the sword .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	22	Therefore Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt . I will break his arms , both the sound one and the broken one , and I will make the sword fall from his hand .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	23	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	24	I will strengthen the arms of the king of Bavel and put my sword in his hand ; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh ; he will groan like a man mortally wounded .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	25	Yes , I will hold up the arms of the king of Bavel ; but the arms of Pharaoh will droop . They will know that I am Adonai when I put my sword in the hand of the king of Bavel , and he stretches it out over the land of Egypt .
CJB	Ezekiel	30	26	Yes , I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries ; and they will know that I am Adonai . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	31	31	On the first day of the third month of the eleventh year , the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	31	2	“ Human being , say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes : ‘ Whom are you like in your greatness ?
CJB	Ezekiel	31	3	Like Ashur , a cedar in the L ’ vanon . It had beautiful branches , dense foliage , its tall crown surrounded by leafy boughs .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	4	The water nourished it ; the deep made it grow , sending its rivers round the place where it was planted , sending its streams to all the trees in the fields .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	5	So it grew taller than any other tree , its branches grew in number and spread far and wide , for it had plenty of water to make them grow .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	6	In its boughs all the birds of the air had their nests , beneath its branches all the wild animals gave birth to their young , and all great nations lived in its shade .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	7	It was beautiful in its greatness and the length of its branches , because its roots went down to plenty of water .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	8	No cedar in God ’ s garden was like it , no cypress tree could compare with its boughs , no chestnut tree could rival its branches , no tree in God ’ s garden could match its beauty .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	9	I made it so beautiful , with its many branches ; all trees in ‘ Eden , God ’ s garden , envied it. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	31	10	“ Therefore here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ Because you are so tall , because he has lifted his crown above the leafy boughs , because he has grown so arrogant about his height ,
CJB	Ezekiel	31	11	I am handing him over to the mightiest of the nations , who will certainly deal with him as his wickedness deserves ; I reject him .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	12	Foreigners , the most barbarous of the nations , will destroy him and leave him lying where he is . His branches will lie fallen on the mountains and in the valleys , his boughs will lie broken in all the rivers of the land , and all the peoples of the earth will withdraw from his shade and leave him .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	13	All the birds will settle on his fallen trunk , and all the wild animals will be on his branches .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	14	This is to warn all the trees growing near water not to grow so tall , not to lift their crowns above the leafy boughs , and all that take up water not to reach up in their height . For they are all given over to death , to the depths of the underworld , along with human beings , with those who descend to the pit. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	31	15	“ Here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ On the day he descended to Sh ’ ol , I caused the abyss to mourn and cover itself for him ; I held back its rivers , so that its deep waters were stopped . I made the L ’ vanon mourn for him , and all the field trees withered because of him .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	16	At the sound of his fall I made the nations shake , when I hurled him down to Sh ’ ol with those who descend to the pit . All the trees of ‘ Eden , the pick of the best in the L ’ vanon , all that take up water , were consoled in the underworld .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	17	They descended with him to Sh ’ ol to those who were killed by the sword , to those who were his fighting arm , those among the nations who lived in his shade .
CJB	Ezekiel	31	18	Which of the trees of ‘ Eden was your equal in glory or size ? Yet you will be brought down to the underworld along with the trees of ‘ Eden . You will lie there among the uncircumcised , with those killed by the sword . This is Pharaoh and his hordes , ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	32	32	“ For I have put my terror in the land of the living , and he will lie among the uncircumcised , with those killed by the sword , Pharaoh and all his hordes , ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	2	“ Human being , raise a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt ; say to him , ‘ You compared yourself to a lion among the nations ; In fact , you are more like a crocodile in the lakes . You burst out of your streams , churn the water with your feet and foul their streams. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	32	3	“ So here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ With many nations assembled , I will spread my net over you , and they will haul you up in my dragnet .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	4	Then I will throw you on the shore , hurl you into an open field , make all the birds in the air settle on you and let the animals of the whole earth eat their fill of you .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	5	I will leave your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your rotting carcass .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	6	I will drench the land in which you swim with your blood , as far as the mountains ; the waterways will be full of you .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	7	When I extinguish you , I will cover the sky and make its stars black ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon will not give its light .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	8	All the shining lights in the sky I will darken above you ; I will spread darkness over your land , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	9	“ ‘ I will anger many peoples when I bring your destroyed ones in among the nations , into countries you have not known .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	10	I will make many peoples aghast at you ; their kings will shudder in horror over you when I brandish my sword before them . On the day of your downfall they will tremble continuously , each man in fear of his life. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	32	11	“ For Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ The sword of the king of Bavel will come against you .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	12	With the swords of the warriors I will cause your hordes to fall . They are all the most barbarous of the nations , and they will shatter the glory of Egypt — all its hordes will be destroyed .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	13	I will destroy all her cattle beside her plentiful waters . No human foot will trouble them again , nor the hoof of any animal .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	14	Then I will make their water clear and cause their streams to flow like oil , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	15	‘ When I make the land of Egypt a ruined waste , a land stripped of all that filled it ; when I strike all those who live there ; they will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	16	This is the lament that they will raise ; the daughters of the nations will use it to mourn ; they will chant it for Egypt and all its hordes , ’ says Adonai Elohim. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	32	17	On the fifteenth day of the month in the twelfth year , the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	32	18	“ Human being , wail for the hordes of Egypt ; send them with the daughters of mighty nations down to the underworld , with those who descend to the pit .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	19	Are you more beautiful than the others ? Go down , lie with the uncircumcised dead !
CJB	Ezekiel	32	20	They will fall among those killed by the sword ; she is given to the sword ; pull her down with her hordes .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	21	From the depths of Sh ’ ol the mightiest warriors will speak of him with those who helped him . They went down ; they lie still , the uncircumcised , killed by the sword .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	22	“ Ashur is there with her hordes ; their graves are all around them , all of them slain , killed by the sword .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	23	Their graves are in the deepest parts of the pit , her hordes are all around her grave , all of them slain , killed by the sword , those who terrorized the land of the living .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	24	“ ‘ Eilam is there , with her hordes around her grave , all of them slain , killed by the sword , descended uncircumcised to the underworld , those who terrorized the land of the living ; they bear their shame together with those who descended to the pit .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	25	They have given her a bed among the slain with her hordes ; her graves are all around them , all of them uncircumcised , killed by the sword , because they terrorized the land of the living ; they bear their shame with those who descended to the pit ; they are put among those who were slain .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	26	“ Meshekh and Tuval with her horde is there , her graves are all around them , all of them uncircumcised , killed by the sword , because they terrorized the land of the living .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	27	They do not lie with the fallen warriors of the uncircumcised who descended to Sh ’ ol with their weapons of war , their swords laid under their heads , and their crimes upon their bones ; because these warriors terrorized the land of the living .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	28	But you will lie broken among the uncircumcised , with those who were killed by the sword .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	29	“ There is Edom , her kings and all her princes , who , despite all their power , are laid with those who were killed by the sword , with the uncircumcised , with those who descended to the pit .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	30	“ There are all the princes of the north , all of them , and the Tzidoni , who descended with the slain , ashamed of all the terror they caused by their power ; they lie uncircumcised with those killed by the sword , bearing their shame with those who descended to the pit .
CJB	Ezekiel	32	31	“ All of these Pharaoh will see , and he will be consoled about his hordes , Pharaoh and all his army , slain by the sword , ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	33	So when all this comes true , then , at last , they will realize that a prophet has been there with them . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	33	2	“ Human being , speak to your people ; say to them , ‘ Suppose I bring the sword on a country , and the people of that country take one of their men and appoint him their watchman .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	3	Now if , upon seeing the sword coming against that country , he blows the shofar and warns the people ;
CJB	Ezekiel	33	4	then , if the sword comes and takes away someone who heard the sound of the shofar but paid no attention to it , the responsibility for that person ’ s death will be his own —
CJB	Ezekiel	33	5	he heard the shofar but paid no attention , so the responsibility for his death is his own ; whereas if he had paid attention , he would have saved his life .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	6	But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the shofar , so that the people are not warned ; and then the sword comes and takes any one of them , that one is indeed taken away in his guilt , but I will hold the watchman responsible for his death. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	33	7	“ Likewise you , human being — I have appointed you as watchman for the house of Isra ’ el . Therefore , when you hear the word from my mouth , warn them for me .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	8	When I tell the wicked person , ‘ Wicked person , you will certainly die ’ ; and you fail to speak and warn the wicked person to leave his way ; then that wicked person will die guilty ; and I will hold you responsible for his death .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	9	On the other hand , if you warn the wicked to turn from his way , and he doesn ’ t turn from his way ; then he will still die guilty , but you will have saved your own life .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	10	“ Therefore , you , human being , say to the house of Isra ’ el : ‘ You say , “ Our crimes and sins are weighing us down , we ’ re pining away because of them , how can we even stay alive ? ” ’
CJB	Ezekiel	33	11	Say to them , ‘ As I live , ’ swears Adonai Elohim , ‘ I take no pleasure in having the wicked person die , but in having the wicked person turn from his way and live . So repent ! Turn from your evil ways ! For why should you die , house of Isra ’ el ? ’
CJB	Ezekiel	33	12	“ Next , you , human being , say to your people : ‘ The righteousness of the righteous person will not save him , once he starts committing crimes ; and likewise , the wickedness of the wicked person will not cause him to fall , once he turns from his wickedness . No , the righteous person can not live by virtue of [ his former righteousness ] , once he starts sinning .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	13	So if , after I tell the righteous person that he will surely live , he begins trusting in his own [ former ] righteousness and starts committing crimes ; then none of his [ former ] righteous actions will be remembered ; on the contrary , he will die for the evil deeds he has committed .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	14	Likewise , if , after I tell the wicked person , “ You must die , ” he turns from his sin and does what is lawful and right —
CJB	Ezekiel	33	15	if the wicked person restores pledged property and returns what he stole , so that he lives by the laws that give life and does not commit evil deeds ; then he will live , he will not die .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	16	None of the sins he committed will be remembered against him ; he has done what is lawful and right ; he will surely live. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	33	17	“ Now your people say , ‘ Adonai ’ s way isn ’ t fair ! ’ But it is their way , theirs , that isn ’ t fair !
CJB	Ezekiel	33	18	When the righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits wickedness , he will die because of it .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	19	And when the wicked person turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right , he will live because of it .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	20	Yet you say , ‘ Adonai ’ s way isn ’ t fair ! ’ House of Isra ’ el , I will judge each of you according to his ways. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	33	21	In the twelfth year of our exile , on the fifth day of the tenth month , a fugitive from Yerushalayim came to me with the news , “ The city has been struck. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	33	22	Now the hand of Adonai had been on me that evening , before the fugitive arrived — he had opened my mouth prior to his coming to me in the morning , so my mouth was open , and I was no longer mute .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	23	Then the word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	33	24	“ Human being , those living in the desolate parts of the land of Isra ’ el are saying , ‘ Avraham was only one , and he inherited the land . But we are many , so [ how much more ] is the land given to us to inherit ! ’
CJB	Ezekiel	33	25	Therefore , tell them that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ You eat [ flesh ] with the blood , you raise your eyes to your idols , and you shed blood — and you still expect to possess the land ?
CJB	Ezekiel	33	26	You depend on your swords , you commit disgusting practices , and each of you defiles his neighbor ’ s wife — and you still expect to possess the land ? ’
CJB	Ezekiel	33	27	Tell them that Adonai Elohim swears , ‘ As I live , those living in the ruins will fall by the sword , those in the countryside I will give to the wild animals to eat , and those in the fortresses and caves will die of the plague .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	28	Moreover , I will utterly desolate the land ; it will cease taking pride in its power ; and the mountains of Isra ’ el will be so desolate that no one will pass through. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	33	29	Then they will know that I am Adonai , when I have made the land utterly desolate , because of all the disgusting practices they have committed .
CJB	Ezekiel	33	30	“ Now you , human being , your people are gathering and talking about you by the walls and in the doorways of houses . They ’ re saying to each other , each one telling his brother , ‘ Come , let ’ s go and hear the latest word coming from Adonai. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	33	31	So then they come to you , as people do , sit in front of you as my people , and hear your words ; but they don ’ t act on them . For with their mouths they flatter you , but their hearts are set on their own self-interest ;
CJB	Ezekiel	33	32	so for them you are like a love-song sung by someone with a nice voice who can play an instrument well — they hear your words , but they don ’ t act on them .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	34	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	34	2	“ Human being , prophesy against the shepherds of Isra ’ el . Prophesy ! Tell them , the shepherds , that Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ Woe to the shepherds of Isra ’ el who feed themselves ! Shouldn ’ t the shepherds feed the sheep ?
CJB	Ezekiel	34	3	You eat the choice meat , you clothe yourselves with the wool , and you slaughter the best of the herd ; but you don ’ t feed the sheep !
CJB	Ezekiel	34	4	You don ’ t strengthen the weak , heal the sick , bandage the broken , bring back the outcasts or seek the lost ; on the contrary , you tyrannize them with crushing force .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	5	So they were scattered , without a shepherd , and became food for every wild animal — they were scattered .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	6	My sheep wandered around aimlessly on every mountain and hill ; yes , my sheep were scattered all over the land , with no one to search for them or look after them .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	7	“ ‘ Therefore , shepherds , hear the word of Adonai :
CJB	Ezekiel	34	8	“ As I live , ” Adonai Elohim swears , “ because my sheep have become prey , my sheep have become food for every wild animal , since there was no shepherd , since my shepherds didn ’ t look for my sheep , and instead my shepherds fed themselves but not my sheep , ”
CJB	Ezekiel	34	9	therefore , shepherds , hear the word of Adonai !
CJB	Ezekiel	34	10	Adonai Elohim says , “ I am against the shepherds . I demand that they hand my sheep back to me . I will not allow them to feed the sheep , and they won ’ t feed themselves either . I will rescue my sheep from their mouths ; they will be food for them no longer. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	34	11	“ ‘ For here is what Adonai Elohim says : “ I am taking over ! I will search for my sheep and look after them , myself .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	12	Just as a shepherd looks after his flock when he finds himself among his scattered sheep , so I will look after my sheep . I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered when it was cloudy and dark .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	13	I will bring them back from those peoples , gather them from those countries and return them to their own land . Then I will let them feed on the mountains of Isra ’ el , by the streams and in all the livable places of the land .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	14	I will have them feed in good pastures ; their grazing ground will be on the high mountains of Isra ’ el . They will rest in good grazing grounds and feed in rich pastures on Isra ’ el ’ s mountains .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	15	Yes , I will pasture my sheep ; and I will let them rest ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	16	“ I will seek the lost , bring back the outcasts , bandage the broken , and strengthen the sick . But the fat and the strong I will destroy — I will feed them with judgment. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	34	17	“ ‘ As for you , my flock , ’ Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ I will judge between sheep and other sheep , between rams and billy-goats .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	18	Wasn ’ t it enough for you to feed on the best pasture and drink from the clearest water ? Did you have to trample the rest of the pasture and foul the remaining water with your feet ?
CJB	Ezekiel	34	19	So now my sheep eat what you have trampled with your feet and drink water fouled by your feet. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	34	20	Therefore here is what Adonai Elohim says to them : ‘ I will judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	21	Because you push them with your flanks and shoulders and butt all the weak ones with your horns , till you scatter them in every direction ;
CJB	Ezekiel	34	22	therefore I will save my flock ; they will no longer be prey ; and I will judge between sheep and other sheep .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	23	“ ‘ I will raise up one shepherd to be in charge of them , and he will let them feed — my servant David . He will pasture them and be their shepherd .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	24	I , Adonai , will be their God ; and my servant David will be prince among them . I , Adonai , have spoken .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	25	I will make a covenant of peace with them ; I will rid the land of wild animals ; and they will live securely in the desert and sleep in the forests .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	26	I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing , and I will cause the rain to fall when it should — there will be showers of blessing .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	27	The trees in the field will bear their fruit and the soil its produce , and they will be secure in their land . Then they will know that I am Adonai , when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the power of those who turned them into slaves .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	28	No longer will they be prey for the Goyim , nor will the wild animals devour them ; but they will live securely , with no one to make them afraid .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	29	I will make the productivity of their crops famous , and they will no longer be consumed by hunger in the land or bear the shame of the Goyim any more .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	30	They will know that I , Adonai their God , am with them , and that they , the house of Isra ’ el , are my people , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	34	31	‘ You , my sheep , the sheep in my pasture , are human beings ; and I am your God , ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	35	35	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	35	2	“ Human being , turn your face against Mount Se ‘ ir ; prophesy against it ,
CJB	Ezekiel	35	3	and say that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ I am against you , Mount Se ‘ ir . I will stretch out my hand against you and make you utterly desolate .
CJB	Ezekiel	35	4	I will make your cities ruins and make you an utter waste , and you will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	35	5	Because of your long-standing hatred , you put the people of Isra ’ el to the sword at their time of calamity , at the time of final iniquity .
CJB	Ezekiel	35	6	Therefore , as I live , ’ Adonai Elohim swears , ‘ I will prepare you for blood . Blood will pursue you . You intensely hate your own blood [ relatives ] ; therefore blood will pursue you .
CJB	Ezekiel	35	7	Yes , I will make Mount Se ‘ ir utterly desolate , cutting off from it anyone passing through or returning .
CJB	Ezekiel	35	8	I will fill his mountains with his slain ; in your hills and valleys and in all your ravines will fall those slain by the sword .
CJB	Ezekiel	35	9	I will turn you into perpetual ruins ; your cities will not return ; and you will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	35	10	“ ‘ Because you say , “ These two nations , these two countries , will be mine ; we will take possession of them , ” even though Adonai is there ;
CJB	Ezekiel	35	11	therefore , as I live , ’ swears Adonai Elohim , ‘ I will deal with you as your anger and envy arising from your hatred deserve ; and I will make myself known among them when I judge you .
CJB	Ezekiel	35	12	You will know that I , Adonai , have heard all your blasphemous talk against the mountains of Isra ’ el , such as , “ They are desolated , they are given to us to devour. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	35	13	Moreover , you have boasted against me with your mouths , speaking more and more against me — I have heard it. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	35	14	Here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ To the joy of all the land , I will desolate you .
CJB	Ezekiel	35	15	Since you rejoiced over possessing the house of Isra ’ el , because it was desolate , that is what I will do to you — you will be desolate , Mount Se ‘ ir and all Edom , all of it . Then they will know that I am Adonai . ’
CJB	Ezekiel	36	36	Then the nations around you that remain will know that I , Adonai , have rebuilt the ruins and replanted what was abandoned . I , Adonai , have spoken ; and I will do it. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	36	2	Adonai Elohim says : “ The enemy is boasting over you , ‘ Ha ! Even the ancient high places are ours now ! ’ ” ’
CJB	Ezekiel	36	3	Therefore prophesy , and say that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Because they desolated you and swallowed you up from every side , so that the other nations could take possession of you ; and now people are gossiping about you and slandering you ;
CJB	Ezekiel	36	4	therefore , mountains of Isra ’ el , hear the message of Adonai Elohim — this is what Adonai Elohim says to the mountains and hills , the streams and valleys , the desolate wastes and the abandoned cities , now preyed on and derided by the other surrounding nations —
CJB	Ezekiel	36	5	therefore this is what Adonai Elohim says : “ In the heat of my jealousy I speak against the other nations and all of Edom , since , rejoicing with all their heart , they have arrogated my land to themselves as a possession and , with utter contempt , seized it as prey. ” ’
CJB	Ezekiel	36	6	“ Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Isra ’ el , and say to the mountains , the hills , the streams and the valleys that Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ I speak in my jealousy and fury , because you have endured being shamed by the nations .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	7	Therefore thus says Adonai Elohim : “ I have raised my hand and sworn that the nations surrounding you will bear their shame .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	8	But you , mountains of Isra ’ el , you will sprout your branches and bear your fruit for my people Isra ’ el , who will soon return .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	9	I am here for you , and I will turn toward you ; then you will be tilled and sown ;
CJB	Ezekiel	36	10	and I will multiply your population , all the house of Isra ’ el , all of it . The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	11	I will multiply both the human and animal populations , they will increase and be productive ; and I will cause you to be inhabited as you were before — indeed , I will do you more good than before ; and you will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	12	I will cause people to walk on you , my people Isra ’ el ; they will possess you , and you will be their inheritance ; never again will you make them childless. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	36	13	Adonai Elohim says , “ Because they say to you , ‘ Land , you devour people and make your nations childless , ’
CJB	Ezekiel	36	14	therefore you will no longer devour people , and you will not make your nations childless any more , ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	15	“ I will not permit the nations to shame you , or the peoples to reproach you any longer ; and you will no more cause your nations to stumble , ” says Adonai Elohim. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	36	16	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	36	17	“ Human being , when the house of Isra ’ el lived in their own land , they defiled it by their manner of life and their actions ; their way before me was like the uncleanness of niddah .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	18	Therefore I poured out my fury on them , because of the blood they had shed in the land and because they defiled it with their idols .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	19	I scattered them among the nations and dispersed them throughout the countries ; I judged them in keeping with their manner of life and actions .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	20	When they came to the nations they were going to , they profaned my holy name ; so that people said of them , ‘ These are Adonai ’ s people , who have been exiled from his land. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	36	21	But I am concerned about my holy name , which the house of Isra ’ el is profaning among the nations where they have gone .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	22	“ Therefore tell the house of Isra ’ el that Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ I am not going to do this for your sake , house of Isra ’ el , but for the sake of my holy name , which you have been profaning among the nations where you went .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	23	I will set apart my great name to be regarded as holy , since it has been profaned in the nations — you profaned it among them . The nations will know that I am Adonai , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ when , before their eyes , I am set apart through you to be regarded as holy .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	24	For I will take you from among the nations , gather you from all the countries , and return you to your own soil .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	25	Then I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you will be clean ; I will cleanse you from all your uncleanness and from all your idols .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	26	I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit inside you ; I will take the stony heart out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	27	I will put my Spirit inside you and cause you to live by my laws , respect my rulings and obey them .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	28	You will live in the land I gave to your ancestors . You will be my people , and I will be your God .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	29	I will save you from all your uncleanliness . I will summon the grain and increase it , and not send famine against you .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	30	I will multiply the yield of fruit from the trees and increase production in the fields , so that you never again suffer the reproach of famine among the nations .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	31	Then you will remember your evil ways and your actions that were not good ; as you look at yourselves , you will loathe yourselves for your guilt and disgusting practices .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	32	Understand , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ that I am not doing this for your sake . Instead , be ashamed and dismayed for your ways , house of Isra ’ el. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	36	33	“ Adonai Elohim says , ‘ When the day comes for me to cleanse you from all your guilt , I will cause the cities to be inhabited and the ruins to be rebuilt .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	34	The land that was desolate will be tilled , whereas formerly it lay desolate for all passing by to see .
CJB	Ezekiel	36	35	Then they will say , “ The land that used to be desolate has become like Gan- ‘ Eden , and the cities formerly ruined , abandoned and wasted have been fortified and are inhabited ! ”
CJB	Ezekiel	36	37	“ Adonai Elohim says , ‘ In addition , I will let the house of Isra ’ el pray to me to do this for them : to increase their numbers like sheep —
CJB	Ezekiel	36	38	like flocks of sheep for sacrifices , like the flocks of sheep in Yerushalayim at its designated times , in this degree will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people . Then they will know that I am Adonai . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	37	37	With the hand of Adonai upon me , Adonai carried me out by his Spirit and set me down in the middle of the valley , and it was full of bones .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	2	He had me pass by all around them — there were so many bones lying in the valley , and they were so dry !
CJB	Ezekiel	37	3	He asked me , “ Human being , can these bones live ? ” I answered , “ Adonai Elohim ! Only you know that ! ”
CJB	Ezekiel	37	4	Then he said to me , “ Prophesy over these bones ! Say to them , ‘ Dry bones ! Hear what Adonai has to say !
CJB	Ezekiel	37	5	To these bones Adonai Elohim says , “ I will make breath enter you , and you will live .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	6	I will attach ligaments to you , make flesh grow on you , cover you with skin and put breath in you . You will live , and you will know that I am Adonai. ” ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	37	7	So I prophesied as ordered ; and while I was prophesying , there was a noise , a rattling sound ; it was the bones coming together , each bone in its proper place .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	8	As I watched , ligaments grew on them , flesh appeared and skin covered them ; but there was no breath in them .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	9	Next he said to me , “ Prophesy to the breath ! Prophesy , human being ! Say to the breath that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ Come from the four winds , breath ; and breathe on these slain , so that they can live. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	37	10	So I prophesied as ordered , and the breath came into them , and they were alive ! They stood up on their feet , a huge army !
CJB	Ezekiel	37	11	Then he said to me , “ Human being ! These bones are the whole house of Isra ’ el ; and they are saying , ‘ Our bones have dried up , our hope is gone , and we are completely cut off. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	37	12	Therefore prophesy ; say to them that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ My people ! I will open your graves and make you get up out of your graves , and I will bring you into the land of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	13	Then you will know that I am Adonai — when I have opened your graves and made you get up out of your graves , my people !
CJB	Ezekiel	37	14	I will put my Spirit in you ; and you will be alive . Then I will place you in your own land ; and you will know that I , Adonai , have spoken , and that I have done it , ’ says Adonai. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	37	15	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	37	16	“ You , human being , take one stick and write on it , ‘ For Y ’ hudah and those joined with him [ among ] the people of Isra ’ el. ’ Next , take another stick and write on it , ‘ For Yosef , the stick of Efrayim , and all the house of Isra ’ el who are joined with him. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	37	17	Finally , bring them together into a single stick , so that they become one in your hand .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	18	When your people ask you what all this means ,
CJB	Ezekiel	37	19	tell them that Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ I will take the stick of Yosef , which is in the hand of Efrayim , together with the tribes of Isra ’ el who are joined with him , and put them together with the stick of Y ’ hudah and make them a single stick , so that they become one in my hand. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	37	20	The sticks on which you write are to be in your hand as they watch .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	21	Then say to them that Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I will take the people of Isra ’ el from among the nations where they have gone and gather them from every side and bring them back to their own land .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	22	I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Isra ’ el ; and one king will be king for all of them . They will no longer be two nations , and they will never again be divided into two kingdoms .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	23	“ ‘ They will never again defile themselves with their idols , their detestable things , or any of their transgressions ; but I will save them from all the places where they have been living and sinning ; and I will cleanse them , so that they will be my people , and I will be their God .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	24	My servant David will be king over them , and all of them will have one shepherd ; they will live by my rulings and keep and observe my regulations .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	25	They will live in the land I gave to Ya ‘ akov my servant , where your ancestors lived ; they will live there — they , their children , and their grandchildren , forever ; and David my servant will be their leader forever .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	26	I will make a covenant of peace with them , an everlasting covenant . I will give to them , increase their numbers , and set my sanctuary among them forever .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	27	My home will be with them ; I will be their God , and they will be my people .
CJB	Ezekiel	37	28	The nations will know that I am Adonai , who sets Isra ’ el apart as holy , when my sanctuary is with them forever . ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	38	38	The word of Adonai came to me :
CJB	Ezekiel	38	2	“ Human being , turn your face toward Gog ( of the land of Magog ) , chief prince of Meshekh and Tuval ; and prophesy against him .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	3	Say that Adonai Elohim says , ‘ I am against you , Gog , chief prince of Meshekh and Tuval .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	4	I will turn you around , put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with all your army , horses and horsemen , all completely equipped , a great horde with breastplates and shields , all wielding swords .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	5	Paras , Ethiopia and Put are with them , all with breastplates and helmets ;
CJB	Ezekiel	38	6	Gomer with all its troops ; the house of Togarmah in the far reaches of the north , with all its troops — many peoples are with you .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	7	Prepare yourself , get ready , you and all your crowd gathered around you ; and take charge of them .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	8	After many days have passed , you will be mustered for service ; in later years you will invade the land which has been brought back from the sword , gathered out of many peoples , the mountains of Isra ’ el . They had been lying in ruins for a long time , but now Isra ’ el has been extracted from the peoples and all of them are living there securely .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	9	You will come up like a storm , you will be like a cloud covering the land — you and all your troops , and many other peoples with you. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	38	10	“ Adonai Elohim says : ‘ When that day comes , thoughts will well up in your mind , and you will devise a sinister scheme .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	11	You will say , “ I am going to invade this land of unwalled villages ; I will take by surprise these people who are at peace , living securely , all in places without walls , bars or gates .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	12	I will seize the spoil and take the plunder. ” You will attack the former ruins that are now inhabited and come against the people gathered from the nations , who have acquired livestock and other wealth and are living in the central parts of the land .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	13	Sh ’ va , D ’ dan and all the leading merchants of Tarshish will ask you , “ Have you come to seize spoil ? Have you assembled your hordes to loot ; to carry off silver , gold , livestock and other wealth ; to take much plunder ? ” ’
CJB	Ezekiel	38	14	“ Therefore , human being , prophesy ! Tell Gog that Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ Won ’ t you be aware of it when my people Isra ’ el are living in security ?
CJB	Ezekiel	38	15	You will choose just that time to come from your place in the far reaches of the north , you and many peoples with you , all of them on horseback , a huge horde , a mighty army ;
CJB	Ezekiel	38	16	and you will invade my people Isra ’ el like a cloud covering the land . This will be in the acharit-hayamim ; and I will bring you against my land , so that the Goyim will know me when , before their eyes , I am set apart as holy through you , Gog. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	38	17	“ Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I spoke of you long ago through my servants the prophets of Isra ’ el . Back then , they prophesied for many years that I would have you invade them .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	18	When that day comes , when Gog invades the land of Isra ’ el , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ my furious anger will boil up .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	19	In my jealousy , in my heated fury I speak : when that day comes there will be a great earthquake in the land of Isra ’ el ;
CJB	Ezekiel	38	20	so that the fish in the sea , the birds in the air , the wild beasts , all the reptiles creeping on the ground and every human being there in the land will tremble before me . Mountains will fall , cliffs crumble and every wall crash to the ground .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	21	I will summon a sword against him throughout all my mountains , ’ says Adonai Elohim ; ‘ every man will wield his sword against his brother .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	22	I will judge him with plague and with blood . I will cause torrential rain to fall on him , his troops and the many peoples with him , along with huge hailstones , fire and sulfur .
CJB	Ezekiel	38	23	I will show my greatness and holiness , making myself known in the sight of many nations ; then they will know that I am Adonai . ’
CJB	Ezekiel	39	39	“ So you , human being , prophesy against Gog ; say that Adonai Elohim says : ‘ I am against you , Gog , chief prince of Meshekh and Tuval .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	2	I will turn you around , lead you on and bring you from the far reaches of the north against the mountains of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	3	But then I will knock your bow out of your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	4	You will fall on the mountains of Isra ’ el , you , your troops and all the peoples with you ; I will give you to be eaten up by all kinds of birds of prey and by wild animals .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	5	You will fall in the open field , for I have spoken , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	6	“ ‘ I will also send fire against Magog and against those living securely in the coastlands ; then they will know that I am Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	7	I will make my holy name known among my people Isra ’ el ; I will not allow my holy name to be profaned any longer . Then the Goyim will know that I am Adonai , the Holy One in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	8	Yes , this is coming , and it will be done , ’ says Adonai Elohim ; ‘ this is the day about which I have spoken .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	9	“ ‘ Those living in Isra ’ el ’ s cities will go out and set fire to the weapons , to use as fuel — the shields , breastplates , bows , arrows , clubs and spears ; they will use them for fire seven years ;
CJB	Ezekiel	39	10	so that they will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut down any from the forests ; because they will use the weapons for fire . Thus they will plunder those who plundered them and rob those who robbed them , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	11	“ ‘ When that day comes , I will give Gog a place there in Isra ’ el for graves , the Travelers ’ Valley , east of the sea ; and it will block the travelers ’ passage . There they will bury Gog and all his horde , and they will rename it the Valley of Hamon-Gog [ horde of Gog ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	12	It will take the house of Isra ’ el seven months to bury them , in order to cleanse the land .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	13	Yes , all the people of the land will be burying them ; they will become famous for it . It will be a day for me to be glorified , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	14	‘ They will then pick men for the continual duty of going through the land and burying with the travelers the corpses still lying out on the ground , in order to cleanse it ; they will begin their search after the seven months .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	15	As they go through the land , if anyone sees a human bone , he will put a marker next to it until the gravediggers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-Gog .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	16	Moreover , “ Hamonah ” [ its horde ] will be the name of a city . Thus will they cleanse the land. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	39	17	“ As for you , human , Adonai Elohim says that you are to speak to all kinds of birds and to every wild animal as follows : ‘ Assemble yourselves and come , gather yourselves from all around for the sacrifice I am preparing for you , a great sacrifice on the mountains of Isra ’ el , where you can eat flesh and drink blood !
CJB	Ezekiel	39	18	You will eat the flesh of heroes and drink the blood of the earth ’ s princes — rams , lambs , goats and bulls , fattened in Bashan , all of them .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	19	You will eat fat till you are gorged and drink blood till you are drunk at the sacrifice I have prepared for you .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	20	At my table you will be satiated with horses , horsemen , heroes and every kind of warrior , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	21	“ ‘ Thus will I display my glory among the nations , so that all the nations will see my judgment when I execute it and my hand when I lay it on them .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	22	From that day on , the house of Isra ’ el will know that I am Adonai their God ;
CJB	Ezekiel	39	23	while the Goyim will know that the house of Isra ’ el went into exile because of their guilt , because they broke faith with me ; so that I hid my face from them and handed them over to their adversaries ; and they fell by the sword , all of them .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	24	Yes , I treated them as their uncleanness and crimes deserved ; and I hid my face from them. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	39	25	“ Therefore Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ Now I will restore the fortunes of Ya ‘ akov and have compassion on the entire house of Isra ’ el , and I will be jealous for my holy name .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	26	They will bear their shame and all their [ guilt from ] breaking faith with me , once they are living securely in their land , with no one to make them afraid .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	27	This will be after I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them out of their enemies ’ lands , thereby being consecrated through them in the sight of many nations .
CJB	Ezekiel	39	28	Then they will know that I am Adonai their God , since it was I who caused them to go into exile among the nations , and it was I who regathered them to their own land . I will leave none of them there any more ,
CJB	Ezekiel	39	29	and I will no longer hide my face from them , for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Isra ’ el , ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	40	40	On the outside , as one goes up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side of the entranceway to the gate were two tables .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	2	In visions God brought me into the land of Isra ’ el and put me down on a very high mountain ; on it , toward the south , it seemed that a city was being built .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	3	That is where he took me , and there in front of me was a man whose appearance was like bronze . He had a flax cord and a measuring rod in his hand , and he stood in the gateway .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	4	The man said to me , “ Human being , look with your eyes , hear with your ears , and pay attention to all the things I am showing you ; because the reason you were brought here is so that I could show them to you . Tell everything you see to the house of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	40	5	There was a wall surrounding the house . The man had in his hand a measuring rod six cubits long [ ten-and-a-half feet ] , each cubit [ twenty-one inches ] being a normal cubit [ eighteen inches ] plus a handbreadth [ three inches ] . He measured the wall ’ s width at ten-and-a-half feet and its height ten-and-a-half feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	6	He went to the east gate , climbed its steps and measured one of the gate ’ s doorposts at ten-and-a-half feet wide and the other one the same .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	7	There were guardrooms , each ten-and-a-half feet square ; the distance between the guardrooms was eight-and-three-quarters feet . The threshold of the gate adjoining the gate ’ s entranceway facing the house measured ten-and-a-half feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	8	He measured the gate ’ s entranceway facing the house at ten-and-a-half feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	9	Then he measured the gate ’ s entranceway itself , fourteen feet , and its supports , three-and-a-half feet ; the gate ’ s entranceway was on the side facing the house .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	10	There were three guardrooms on each side of the east gate , all the same size ; and on each side the supports [ between the guardrooms ] were also all the same size .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	11	He measured the width of the opening to the gateway at seventeen-and-a-half feet and the width of the passage through the gateway at twenty-two-and-three-quarters feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	12	There was a partition in front of the guardrooms [ on one side ] twenty-one inches [ wide ] and a partition on the other side twenty-one inches [ wide ] , with the guardrooms themselves being ten-and-a-half feet square .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	13	He measured [ inside ] the gate from the back wall of one guardroom to the back wall of the other a distance of forty-three-and-three-quarters feet , the openings [ to the guardrooms ] being opposite each other .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	14	He made the posts
CJB	Ezekiel	40	105	feet , likewise the posts of the other gates around the courtyard .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	15	The distance along the passage from the outer opening of the gateway to the far side of the entranceway at the inner end of the gateway was eighty-seven-and-a-half feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	16	There were narrow windows to the guardrooms and to their supports facing inward all along the gate ; also the vestibules had windows all around facing inward . On each side support were [ carvings of ] palm trees .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	17	Then he brought me into the outer courtyard . There I saw rooms and paved mosaic flooring made for the courtyard all around its perimeter , and thirty rooms facing the flooring .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	18	The flooring was alongside the gates and corresponded to the length of the gates [ from outside to inside ] , this lower flooring .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	19	He measured at
CJB	Ezekiel	40	175	feet wide — it was square . The altar was in front of the house .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	20	Next he measured the length and width of the outer courtyard gate that faced north .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	21	It had three guardrooms on each side , and its supports and vestibule were the same size as those at the first gate ; its length was eighty-seven-and-a-half feet and its width forty-three-and-three-quarters feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	22	Its windows , vestibule and palm trees were the same size as those at the east gate . Seven steps led up to it [ from the outside ] , while its vestibule was toward the inside .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	23	There were gates to the inner courtyard across from the gates to the north and east ; he measured
CJB	Ezekiel	40	24	He led me toward the south , and there I saw a gate that faced south . He measured its supports and vestibule ; they were the same size as the others .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	25	There were windows in it and all around its vestibule like the other windows ; the length was eighty-seven-and-a-half feet and the width forty-three-and-three-quarters feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	26	Seven steps led up to it [ from the outside ] , while its vestibule was toward the inside . It had palm trees , one on each side , on its supports .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	27	The inner courtyard had a gate on the south ; he measured from gate to gate toward the south
CJB	Ezekiel	40	28	He brought me to the inner courtyard through its south gate . He measured this south gate as being the same size ;
CJB	Ezekiel	40	29	its guardrooms , supports and vestibule were the same size ; it had windows and a vestibule surrounding it ; it was eighty-seven-and-a-half feet long and forty-three-and-three-quarters feet wide .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	30	There was a vestibule around it forty-three-and-three-quarters feet long and eight-and-three-quarters feet wide ;
CJB	Ezekiel	40	31	this vestibule faced the outer courtyard , palm trees were on its supports , and it had eight steps leading up to it .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	32	He brought me into the inner courtyard , went toward the east and measured that gate as being the same size ;
CJB	Ezekiel	40	33	its guardrooms , supports and vestibule were the same size ; it had windows and a vestibule surrounding it ; it was eighty-seven-and-a-half feet long and forty-three-and-three-quarters feet wide .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	34	Its vestibule faced the outer courtyard , palm trees were on its supports , both on the one side and on the other ; and it had eight steps leading up to it .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	35	He brought me over to the north gate and measured it as being the same size ;
CJB	Ezekiel	40	36	it had guardrooms , supports and a vestibule with windows all around ; the length was eighty-seven-and-a-half feet and the width forty-three-and-three-quarters feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	37	Its supports faced the outer courtyard ; palm trees were on its supports , both on the one side and on the other ; and it had eight steps leading up to it .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	38	There was a room with its entry by the supports at the gates where the burnt offerings were washed .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	39	In the entranceway to the gate were two tables on the one side and two on the other , on which to slaughter the burnt offerings , sin offerings and guilt offerings .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	41	So there were four tables on the one side and four on the other side , by the gate — eight tables on which to slaughter sacrifices .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	42	There were four tables of cut stone for the burnt offering , thirty-one-and-a-half inches square and twenty-one inches high , on which to lay the instruments for slaughtering the burnt offerings and other sacrifices .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	43	Hooks a handbreadth long were fastened all around the inside of the room ; the flesh of the offerings was to be placed on the tables .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	44	Outside the inner gate , in the inner courtyard , were rooms for the singers , one facing south alongside the north gate , and one facing north alongside the east gate .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	45	He said to me , “ This room facing south is for the cohanim in charge of the house ;
CJB	Ezekiel	40	46	while the room facing north is for the cohanim in charge of the altar ; these are the descendants of Tzadok , who are the descendants of Levi designated to approach Adonai and serve him. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	40	47	Then he measured the courtyard at
CJB	Ezekiel	40	48	He brought me to the vestibule of the house and measured at eight-and-three-quarters feet the thickness of the walls on either side of its entrance . On each side , these walls extended five-and-a-quarter feet from the side-walls of the vestibule .
CJB	Ezekiel	40	49	The length of the vestibule was thirty-five feet and the width nineteen-and-a-quarter feet ; steps led up to it . There were columns on each side of the entrance .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	41	He brought me to the sanctuary and measured at ten-and-a-half feet the thickness of the walls on either side of its entrance , which was [ also ] the thickness of [ the walls surrounding ] the “ tent ” [ that is , the sanctuary together with the Especially Holy Place ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	2	The width of the entrance was seventeen-and-a-half feet . The sides of the entrance were eight-and-three-quarters feet on the one side and the same on the other . He measured its length at seventy feet and its width at thirty-five feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	3	Next , he went farther in [ to the entranceway leading to the Especially Holy Place ] and measured at three-and-a-half feet [ the thickness of ] each entrance support . He measured at ten-and-a-half feet the total thickness of the walls on either side of the entrance ; and he measured at twelve-and-a-quarter feet the width of the entrance .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	4	[ Continuing into the inner room , ] he said to me , “ This is the Especially Holy Place. ” He measured its length at thirty-five feet and its width at thirty-five feet along the wall nearest the sanctuary .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	5	[ On his way out , ] he measured the thickness of the wall of the house at ten-and-a-half feet [ at ground level ] , and the width of all the side-rooms surrounding the house , seven feet [ at ground level ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	6	There were three floors of side-rooms , thirty on each floor ; and the wall around the house was terraced , so that the side-rooms rested on the terraces and were not supported on [ the vertical parts of ] the wall .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	7	The higher side-rooms surrounding the house were wider than the lower ones , as were the passageways next to the side-rooms on each floor ; thus the width of the side-rooms plus that of the passageways increased as one went up from floor to floor . The ascent from the lowest floor to the highest was [ by a ramp ] through the middle floor .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	8	I saw that the house had a raised pavement all around it which extended outward a full rod of ten-and-a-half feet from where the foundations of the side-rooms joined it .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	9	The outer wall of the side-rooms was eight-and-three-quarters feet thick [ at ground level ] , likewise the empty space left [ between ] the structure containing the side-rooms [ and the house itself also measured eight-and-three quarters feet wide ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	10	On all sides around the house itself was a space thirty-five feet wide between it and the [ block of ] rooms [ for the cohanim ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	11	The doors of the side-rooms opened toward an empty space , one door facing north and the other facing south ; the empty space was eight-and-three-quarters feet [ wide ] all around .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	12	The building on the west facing the separated yard had a [ n interior ] width of
CJB	Ezekiel	41	122	1/2 feet , a [ n interior ] length of
CJB	Ezekiel	41	157	1/2 feet and exterior walls eight-and-three-quarters feet thick all the way around .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	13	He measured the length of the house at
CJB	Ezekiel	41	175	feet . The sanctuary , the inner place and the vestibules [ leading from the house ] to the courtyard ,
CJB	Ezekiel	41	14	The distance along the facade of the house on the east through the separated yard [ s to the north and south ] was
CJB	Ezekiel	41	15	He measured the length of the building facing the separated yard behind [ the house ] , together with its galleries on both sides , at
CJB	Ezekiel	41	16	as well as the thresholds , narrow windows and galleries around these three , had wood panelling around them as far as the thresholds and from the ground up to the windows ; and the windows were covered .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	17	From the area above the entrance to the interior of the house , as well as outside , and on the entire wall all the way around , both inside and outside , was a pattern
CJB	Ezekiel	41	18	consisting of k ’ ruvim and palm trees , with a palm tree between every two k ’ ruvim . Every keruv had two faces ;
CJB	Ezekiel	41	19	so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on its one side and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on its other side — this was the pattern all the way around the house .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	20	The k ’ ruvim and palm trees ran from the ground to above the door , and likewise on the wall of the sanctuary .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	21	As for the sanctuary , the door-frames were squared , and the appearance of the [ Especially ] Holy Place was like the appearance [ I saw at the K ’ var River ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	22	The altar was of wood , five-and-a-quarter feet high and three-and-a-half feet long ; its length and walls were also of wood . He said to me , “ This is the table which is in the presence of Adonai. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	41	23	The sanctuary had two doors , and the [ Especially ] Holy Place
CJB	Ezekiel	41	24	had two doors . The doors had two swinging leaves each — two leaves for the one door and two for the other .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	25	On them , that is , on the doors of the sanctuary , were carved k ’ ruvim and palm trees like those on the walls ; and on the exterior facade of the outside entrance were thick beams of wood .
CJB	Ezekiel	41	26	There were narrow windows flanked by palm trees on both sides of the entrance ; the side-rooms of the house and the thick beams also [ had palm trees ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	42	Then he led me into the outer courtyard — the route went north — and brought me to the [ block of ] rooms opposite the separated yard and opposite the building to the north .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	2	The length of the front was
CJB	Ezekiel	42	175	feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	3	It was located between the inner courtyard , which was thirty-five feet wide , and the flooring of the outer courtyard . It had galleries , one above the other , on three floors .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	4	In front of the [ block of ] rooms was a walkway seventeen-and-a-half feet wide and a path twenty-one inches [ wide ] ; their doors faced north .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	5	The upper rooms were shorter , because the galleries took up some of their space , more than from the [ rooms on the ] lower and middle [ floors ] of the building .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	6	For the rooms were on three floors , and they didn ’ t have columns like those in the courtyards ; therefore space was taken away from the [ rooms on the ] lower and middle [ floors ] , in comparison with the ground .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	7	The length of the wall outside , next to the rooms , toward the outer courtyard in front of the rooms , was eighty-seven-and-a-half feet .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	8	For the length of the rooms toward the outer courtyard was eighty-seven-and-a-half feet , whereas [ the length of ] the side facing the sanctuary was
CJB	Ezekiel	42	9	Under these rooms was the entrance to the east side , leading in from the outer courtyard .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	10	In the width of the courtyard wall on the east , facing the separated yard and facing the building , there were rooms ,
CJB	Ezekiel	42	11	with a passageway in front of them , similar to the rooms on the north . They were the same length and width and had similarly made exits and entrances .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	12	By the entrances of the rooms on the south there was an entrance at the end of the passage , the passageway right in front of the wall , toward the eastern entrances .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	13	Then he said to me , “ The north and south [ blocks of ] rooms in front of the separated yard are the holy rooms where the cohanim who approach Adonai will eat the especially holy things . This is where they will put the especially holy things — the grain offerings , sin offerings and guilt offerings ; for the place is holy .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	14	When the cohanim come , they will not go out of the [ Especially ] Holy Place into the outer courtyard ; rather , they will leave [ in these rooms ] the clothes they use when ministering , because they are holy . They will put on other clothes and only then approach the areas permitted to the people. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	42	15	After he had finished measuring the inner house , he brought me out by way of the gate facing east and measured the whole area .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	16	He measured the east side with the measuring rod ; it was
CJB	Ezekiel	42	875	[ feet ] wide . Thus a division was made between what was holy and what was common .
CJB	Ezekiel	42	17	He measured the north side ; it was
CJB	Ezekiel	42	18	He measured the south side ; it was
CJB	Ezekiel	42	19	He turned to the west side and measured
CJB	Ezekiel	42	20	He measured its four sides ; it had a wall around it ; and it was
CJB	Ezekiel	43	43	After this , he brought me to the gate facing east .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	2	There I saw the glory of the God of Isra ’ el approaching from the east . His voice was like the sound of rushing water , and the earth shone with his glory .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	3	The vision seemed like the vision I had seen when I came to destroy the city ; also the visions were like the vision I had seen by the K ’ var River ; and I fell on my face .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	4	Adonai ’ s glory entered the house through the gate facing east .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	5	Next , a spirit took me up and brought me into the inner courtyard , and I saw Adonai ’ s glory fill the house .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	6	I heard someone speaking to me from the house , and a man was standing by me .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	7	He said , “ Human being , this is the place for my throne , the place for the soles of my feet , where I will live among the people of Isra ’ el forever . The house of Isra ’ el , both they and their kings , will never again defile my holy name by their prostitution , by [ burying ] the corpses of their kings [ on ] their high places ,
CJB	Ezekiel	43	8	or by placing their threshold next to my threshold and their door-frames next to my door-frames , with only a common wall between me and them . Yes , they defiled my holy name by the disgusting practices they committed ; which is why I destroyed them in my anger .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	9	So now , they should put their prostitution at a distance and the corpses of their kings far away from me ; then I will live among them forever .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	10	“ You , human being , describe this house to the house of Isra ’ el , so that they will be ashamed of their crimes . And let them measure accurately .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	11	If they become ashamed of all they have done , show them the elevation and plan of the house , its exits and entrances , all its details and decorations , and all its specifications , its design and its Torah . Sketch it for them to see , so that they can observe the entire design with its specifications , and carry them out .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	12	This is Torah for the house : the whole surrounding area on the mountaintop will be especially holy . This is Torah for the house. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	43	13	These are the measurements of the altar in cubits ( a cubit here is defined as a normal cubit [ eighteen inches ] plus a handbreadth [ three inches ] ) : the base , one cubit [ twenty-one inches ] deep and one cubit wide ; with the molding surrounding it at its rim about a hand-span [ nine inches ] in width . The height of the altar is thus :
CJB	Ezekiel	43	14	from the base on the ground to the lower ledge , three-and-a-half feet , with the width twenty-one inches ; from the lower ledge to the upper ledge , seven feet , with the width again twenty-one inches .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	15	The hearth measures seven feet [ high ] , with four horns on top of the hearth .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	16	The hearth is a square twenty-one feet on each of its four sides .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	17	The ledge measures a square twenty-four-and-a-half feet on each of its four sides ; the molding around it ten-and-a-half inches [ across ] ; and its base twenty-one inches [ larger than the rest , all the way ] around . Its steps face east .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	18	He said to me , “ Human being , Adonai Elohim says , ‘ These are the regulations for the altar when the time comes to construct it , offer burnt offerings on it and splash the blood against it :
CJB	Ezekiel	43	19	you are to give to the cohanim , who are L ’ vi ’ im descended from Tzadok and who approach to serve me , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ a young bull as a sin offering .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	20	You are to take its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar , on the four corners of the ledge and on the molding all the way around ; this is how you will purify it and make atonement for it .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	21	You are also to take the bull which is the sin offering and have it burned up at the designated place [ on the grounds ] of the house , outside the sanctuary .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	22	On the second day you are to offer a male goat without defect as a sin offering , and they are to purify the altar as they purified it with the bull .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	23	When you have finished purifying it , you are to offer a young bull without defect and a ram from the flock without defect .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	24	You are to present them before Adonai , and the cohanim will throw salt on them and offer them as a burnt offering to Adonai .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	25	Every day , for seven days , you are to prepare a goat as a sin offering ; they are also to prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock without defect .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	26	For seven days , they are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it ; in this way they are to consecrate it .
CJB	Ezekiel	43	27	When these days are over , then , on the eighth day and afterwards , the cohanim will present your burnt offerings on the altar and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , ’ says Adonai Elohim . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	44	44	Then he brought me back by way of the outer gate of the sanctuary , the one facing east ; and it was shut .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	2	Adonai said to me , “ This gate will remain shut ; it will not be opened , and no one will go through it ; because Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , has gone through it . Therefore , it is to be kept shut .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	3	Only the prince , since he is a prince , is to sit there to eat his meal before Adonai ; he is to enter through the vestibule of the gate and leave the same way. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	44	4	Then he brought me through the north gate to the front of the house . I looked , saw Adonai ’ s glory filling the house of Adonai , and fell on my face .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	5	Adonai said to me , “ Human being , pay attention ; see with your eyes and hear with your ears everything I tell you about all the regulations of Adonai ’ s house and about all its Torah ; pay attention to who can enter the house and who must be excluded from the sanctuary .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	6	You are to tell the rebels , the house of Isra ’ el , that this is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ House of Isra ’ el , enough of all your disgusting practices !
CJB	Ezekiel	44	7	You brought in foreigners , uncircumcised in both heart and flesh , to be in my sanctuary and profane it — yes , my house — when you offered my food , the fat and the blood ; thus in addition to all your disgusting practices , they broke my covenant .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	8	Instead of taking care of my holy things yourselves , you have put these people in charge of my sanctuary. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	44	9	Here is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ No foreigner , uncircumcised in both heart and flesh , is to enter my sanctuary — no foreigner living among the people of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	10	“ ‘ Rather , the L ’ vi ’ im , who went far away from me when Isra ’ el went astray , going astray after their idols — they will bear the consequences of their guilt ,
CJB	Ezekiel	44	11	but they are to serve in my sanctuary . They will have charge of the gates of the house and of serving in the house ; they will slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people ; and they will attend and serve them .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	12	Because they served them in the presence of their idols and became an occasion of sin for the house of Isra ’ el , I am raising my hand against them , ’ says Adonai Elohim , ‘ and they will bear the consequences of their guilt .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	13	They will not approach me to serve me in the office of cohen or approach any of the holy things or the especially holy things ; but they will bear their shame for the disgusting practices they committed .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	14	Yet I will put them in charge of the house and all its maintenance and everything to be done in it .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	15	“ ‘ However , the cohanim , who are L ’ vi ’ im and descendants of Tzadok , who took care of my sanctuary when the people of Isra ’ el went astray from me — they are the ones who will approach me and serve me ; it is they who will attend me and offer me the fat and the blood , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	16	‘ They will enter my sanctuary , approach my table to minister to me and perform my service .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	17	“ ‘ Once they enter the gates of the inner courtyard , they are to wear linen clothing ; they are not to wear any wool while serving at the gates of the inner courtyard or inside it .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	18	They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen underclothes on their bodies , and they are not to wear anything that makes them sweat .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	19	Before going out to the people in the outer courtyard , they are to remove the clothes in which they minister , lay them in the holy rooms , and put on other clothes ; so that they won ’ t transmit holiness to the people by means of their clothing .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	20	They are not to shave their heads or let their hair grow long , but must keep their hair carefully trimmed .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	21	No cohen is to drink wine when he enters the inner courtyard .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	22	They may not marry a widow or a divorcee but must marry virgins descended from the house of Isra ’ el or a widow whose deceased husband was a cohen .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	23	“ ‘ They are to teach my people the difference between holy and common and enable them to distinguish between clean and unclean .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	24	They are to be judges in controversies , and they are to render decisions in keeping with my rulings . At all my designated festivals they are to keep my laws and regulations , and they are to keep my shabbats holy .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	25	They are not to come to any dead person , because this would make them unclean ; however , for father , mother , son , daughter , brother or sister who has had no husband they may make themselves unclean .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	26	After a cohen has been purified , he is to wait seven days .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	27	Then , on the day he enters the sanctuary , when he goes into the inner courtyard to minister in the sanctuary , he is to offer his sin offering , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	28	“ ‘ Their inheritance is to be this : I myself am their inheritance . You are not to grant them any possession in Isra ’ el — I myself am their possession .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	29	They are to eat the grain offerings , sin offerings and guilt offerings ; and everything in Isra ’ el devoted [ to God ] will be theirs .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	30	The first of all the firstfruits of everything , and every voluntary contribution of everything , from all your offerings , will be for the cohanim . You are also to give the cohen the first of your dough , so that a blessing will rest on your house .
CJB	Ezekiel	44	31	The cohanim are not to eat anything , bird or animal , that dies naturally or is torn to death .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	45	“ ‘ When you divide the land by lot for inheritance , you are to set aside an offering for Adonai , a holy portion of the land . Its length is to be 25,000 [ cubits , that is , eight miles ] and its width 10,000 [ three miles ] ; this entire region is to be holy .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	2	Of this there is to be reserved for the holy place an area
CJB	Ezekiel	45	875	[ feet ] square , with eighty-seven-and-a-half feet for open land around it .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	3	Alongside this region you are to measure a length of eight [ miles ] and a width of three [ miles ] ; in it is to be the sanctuary , which will be especially holy .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	4	It is a holy portion of the land ; it is for the cohanim who serve in the sanctuary , who approach to minister to Adonai ; there will be a place for their houses and a place set aside for the sanctuary .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	5	A portion eight by three [ miles ] will be owned by the L ’ vi ’ im who serve in the house ; it will also have twenty [ gatekeepers ’ ] rooms .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	6	You are to give the city possession of an area , alongside the offering of the holy portion , one-and-a-half by eight [ miles ] ; it will be for the whole house of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	7	“ ‘ The prince is to have the territory on both sides of the holy offering and the city ’ s holding ; it will extend westward to the western border of the land and eastward to its eastern border ; and the length [ from the far side of one ] of its two parts [ to the far side of the other ] will be the same as the length of one of the [ tribal ] portions .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	8	His possession in Isra ’ el will be limited to this , and henceforth my princes will not wrong my people but will give the land to the house of Isra ’ el according to their tribes. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	45	9	Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ Princes of Isra ’ el , that should be enough for you ! Get rid of violence and looting , do what is right and just , and stop evicting my people from their land ! ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	10	“ ‘ You are to have honest balance-scales , an honest eifah [ a one-bushel dry-measure ] and an honest bat [ a five-gallon liquid-measure ] .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	11	The eifah and the bat are to contain the same volume — the bat is to contain one-tenth of a homer , and the eifah is to contain one-tenth of a homer ; the homer is to set the standard for measurement .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	12	Also the shekel is to be twenty gerahs ; your maneh will be the sum of a twenty-shekel piece , a twenty-five-shekel piece and a fifteen-shekel piece .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	13	“ ‘ This is the offering you are to make : one-sixth of a bushel from every ten bushels of wheat , and you are to give one-sixth of a bushel from every ten bushels of barley .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	14	The law for olive oil is to be half a gallon from every fifty gallons , which is the same as ten bats or one homer , since ten bats equal a homer .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	15	From the flock , take one sheep from every two hundred being pastured in Isra ’ el ; [ all these are to be used ] for grain offerings , burnt offerings and peace offerings , to make atonement for them , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	16	‘ All the people in the land are to present this offering to the prince in Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	17	The prince ’ s obligation will be to present the burnt offerings , grain offerings and drink offerings at the feasts , on Rosh-Hodesh , and on Shabbat — at all the designated times of the house of Isra ’ el . He is to prepare the sin offerings , grain offerings , burnt offerings and peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Isra ’ el. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	45	18	“ Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ On the first day of the first month you are to take a young bull without defect and purify the sanctuary .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	19	The cohen will take some of the blood from the sin offering and put it on the door-frames of the house , on the four corners of the altar ’ s ledge and on the supports of the gate of the inner courtyard .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	20	You are also to do this on the seventh day of the month for everyone who has sinned inadvertently or through ignorance . Thus you will make atonement for the house .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	21	“ ‘ On the fourteenth day of the first month you are to have the Pesach , a feast seven days long ; matzah will be eaten .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	22	On that day the prince will provide , for himself and for all the people of the land , a young bull as a sin offering .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	23	On the seven days of the feast he is to provide a burnt offering for Adonai , seven young bulls and seven rams without defect daily for the seven days , and a male goat daily as a sin offering .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	24	He is to provide as a grain offering a bushel [ of grain ] for a young bull and a bushel for a ram , and for each bushel [ of grain ] a gallon of olive oil .
CJB	Ezekiel	45	25	“ ‘ On the fifteenth day of the seventh month , during the feast [ of Sukkot ] he is to do the same thing for those seven days in regard to the sin offerings , burnt offerings , grain offerings and olive oil . ’
CJB	Ezekiel	46	46	“ This is what Adonai Elohim says : ‘ The east gate of the inner courtyard is to be shut on the six working days , but on Shabbat it is to be opened , and on Rosh-Hodesh it is to be opened .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	2	The prince is to enter by way of the outer vestibule of the gate and stand by the support of the gate . The cohanim are to prepare his burnt offering and peace offerings . Then he is to prostrate himself in worship at the threshold of the gate , after which he is to leave ; but the gate is not to be shut until evening .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	3	The people of the land are also to prostrate themselves in worship before Adonai at the entrance to that gate on Shabbat and on Rosh-Hodesh .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	4	“ ‘ The burnt offering the prince is to offer Adonai on Shabbat is to consist of six lambs without defect and a ram without defect .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	5	The grain offering is to be a bushel for the ram , while for the lambs it can be as much as he wants to give ; with a gallon of olive oil per eifah .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	6	On Rosh-Hodesh it is to be a young bull , six lambs and a ram , all without defect .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	7	He is to prepare a grain offering consisting of a bushel for the bull , a bushel for the ram , and for the lambs as his means allow ; with a gallon of olive oil per bushel .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	8	“ ‘ When the prince enters , he is to go in by way of the vestibule of the gate , and he is to leave the same way .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	9	But when the people of the land come before Adonai at the designated times , whoever comes in to worship by way of the north gate is to leave by way of the south gate , and whoever comes in by way of the south gate is to leave by way of the north gate ; he is not to go back out through the gate by which he entered but is to exit straight ahead of him .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	10	[ On these occasions , ] the prince is to be among them when they enter ; and when they leave , they are to leave together .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	11	“ ‘ At the festivals and at designated times , the grain offering is to be a bushel for a young bull and a bushel for a ram , while for the lambs it can be as much as he wants to give , with a gallon of olive oil per bushel .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	12	“ ‘ When the prince provides a voluntary offering , whether it is a burnt offering or peace offerings that he offers voluntarily to Adonai , someone is to open the east gate for him ; and he is to provide his burnt offering and peace offerings as he does on Shabbat . Then he will leave ; and after he leaves , the gate is to be shut .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	13	“ ‘ You are to provide a lamb in its first year that has no defect for a daily burnt offering to Adonai ; do this each morning .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	14	Also each morning , provide with it a grain offering , one-sixth of a bushel , and one-third of a gallon of olive oil to moisten the fine flour ; this is the ongoing grain offering for Adonai , by a permanent regulation .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	15	Thus they will offer a lamb , a grain offering and oil each morning as the ongoing burnt offering. ’
CJB	Ezekiel	46	16	“ Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ If the prince turns over part of his hereditary property to one of his sons , it is his inheritance ; it will belong to his sons ; it is their possession by inheritance .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	17	But if he gives part of his hereditary property to one of his slaves , it will be his until the year of freedom , at which time it will revert to the prince , so that the prince ’ s heritage will go to his sons .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	18	The prince is not to take over any of the people ’ s inheritance , thereby evicting them wrongfully from their property ; he is to give his sons an inheritance out of his own property , so that none of my people will be driven off their property. ’ ”
CJB	Ezekiel	46	19	Next , he brought me through the entry at the side of the gate into the holy rooms facing north that were for the cohanim . At their far west end I saw a place
CJB	Ezekiel	46	20	about which he said to me , “ This is the place where the cohanim will boil the guilt offerings and sin offerings and bake the grain offerings . In this way they won ’ t have to bring them into the outer courtyard and risk transmitting holiness to the people. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	46	21	He took me into the outer courtyard and had me pass by the four corners of the courtyard , and there in each corner of the courtyard was another courtyard —
CJB	Ezekiel	46	22	in the four corners of the courtyard were enclosed courtyards seventy feet long and fifty-two-and-a-half feet ; the four courtyards in the corners were the same size .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	23	There was a wall around each of the four , with open stoves all around the bases of the walls .
CJB	Ezekiel	46	24	He said to me , “ These are the stoves where those serving in the house will boil the people ’ s sacrifices . ”
CJB	Ezekiel	47	47	Then he brought me back to the entrance of the house , and I saw water flowing eastward from under the threshold of the house , for the house faced east . The water flowed down from under the right side of the house , south of the altar .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	2	Next he led me out through the north gate and took me around outside to the outer gate , by way of the east gate , where I saw water trickling from the south side .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	3	With a line in his hand the man went out toward the east and measured a thousand cubits [ one-third of a mile ] and had me wade across the stream ; the water came up to my ankles .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	4	He measured another thousand and had me wade through the water , which reached my knees . He measured another thousand and had me wade through water up to my waist .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	5	Finally he measured a thousand , and it was a river I couldn ’ t cross on foot , because the water was so deep one would have to swim across ; it was a river that could not be waded through .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	6	He asked me , “ Human being , have you seen this ? ” Then , guiding me , he got me back to the riverbank .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	7	After being returned , I saw on the bank of the river a great number of trees on the one side and on the other .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	8	He said to me , “ This water flows toward the eastern region and continues down to the ‘ Aravah . When it enters the sea , the sea of stagnant water , [ the Dead Sea , ] its water will become fresh .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	9	When this happens , swarms of all kinds of living creatures will be able to live in it wherever the streams flow ; so that there will be a vast number of fish ; for this water is flowing there , so that , wherever the river goes , everything will be restored and able to live .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	10	Then fishermen will stand on its shores spreading their nets all the way from ‘ Ein-Gedi to ‘ Ein- ‘ Eglayim . There will be as many kinds of fish there as in the Great Sea , [ the Mediterranean , ] a great variety .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	11	However , its mud flats and marshes will not become fresh but will remain salty .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	12	On both riverbanks will grow all kinds of trees for food ; their leaves will not dry up , nor will their fruit fail . There will be a different kind of fruit each month , because the water flows from the sanctuary , so that this fruit will be edible , and the leaves will have healing properties. ”
CJB	Ezekiel	47	13	“ Adonai Elohim says this : ‘ These are the borders of the land you are to distribute for inheritance by the twelve tribes of Isra ’ el , with Yosef receiving two portions .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	14	For inheritance you will each have equal shares . I swore to your ancestors that I would give them this land , and now it falls to you to inherit it .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	15	“ ‘ The borders of the land will be as follows : on the north , from the Great Sea through Hetlon to the entrance of Tz ’ dad ,
CJB	Ezekiel	47	16	Hamat , Berotah , Sibrayim ( which is between the border of Dammesek and the border of Hamat ) , Hatzer-Hatikhon ( which is toward the border of Havran ) .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	17	The border from the sea will be Hatzar- ‘ Einon ( at the border of Dammesek ) ; while on the north , northward , is the border of Hamat . This is the north side .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	18	“ ‘ On the east side , measure between Havran and Dammesek , Gil ‘ ad and the land of Isra ’ el by the Yarden , from the border to the eastern sea . This is the east side .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	19	“ ‘ On the side of the Negev toward the south it will be from Tamar as far as the waters of M ’ rivot-Kadesh , then to the Vadi [ of Egypt ] and on to the Great Sea . This is the south side toward the Negev .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	20	“ ‘ The west side will be the Great Sea , as far as across from the entrance to Hamat . This is the west side .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	21	“ ‘ This is the territory you are to divide among the tribes of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	22	You are to divide it by lot as an inheritance both to you and to the foreigners living among you who give birth to children living among you ; for you they are to be no different from the native-born among the people of Isra ’ el — they are to have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Ezekiel	47	23	You are to give the foreigner an inheritance in the territory of the tribe with whom he is living , ’ says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Ezekiel	48	48	“ ‘ Following is the list of tribes : “ ‘ This is Dan ’ s territory : from the north end , through Hetlon to the entrance of Hamat , Hatzar- ‘ Einan ( at the border of Dammesek ) , northward , next to Hamat ; and they will have their sides east and west .

CJB	Ezekiel	48	9	The offering you are to set aside for Adonai is to be eight [ miles ] long and three wide .
CJB	Ezekiel	48	10	This holy offering will be for the cohanim ; it will be eight [ miles ] in length along its north and south sides and three in width along its west and east sides ; Adonai ’ s sanctuary will be inside it .
CJB	Ezekiel	48	11	The portion set aside as holy will be for the cohanim who are descendants of Tzadok that remained faithful to my commission and did not go astray when the people of Isra ’ el and the L ’ vi ’ im went astray .

CJB	Daniel	1	1	In the third year of the reign of Y ’ hoyakim king of Y ’ hudah , N ’ vukhadnetzar king of Bavel came to Yerushalayim and laid siege to it ;
CJB	Daniel	1	2	and Adonai handed Y ’ hoyakim king of Y ’ hudah over to him , along with some of the articles from the house of God . He took them to the land of Shin ‘ ar , to the house of his god and placed the articles in the storehouse of his god .
CJB	Daniel	1	3	The king ordered Ashp ’ naz , the eunuch serving as his chief officer , to bring into the palace from the people of Isra ’ el some of royal or noble descent .
CJB	Daniel	1	4	They were to be boys without physical defect , handsome in appearance , versed in all kinds of wisdom , quick to learn , discerning , and having the capacity to serve in the king ’ s palace ; and he was to teach them the language and literature of the Kasdim .
CJB	Daniel	1	5	The king assigned them a daily portion of his own food and the wine he drank , and they were to be cared for in this way for three years . At the end of this time they were to become the king ’ s attendants .
CJB	Daniel	1	6	Among these , from the people of Y ’ hudah , were Dani ’ el , Hananyah , Misha ’ el and ‘ Azaryah .
CJB	Daniel	1	7	The chief officer gave them other names — to Dani ’ el he gave the name Belt ’ shatzar ; to Hananyah , Shadrakh ; to Misha ’ el , Meishakh ; and to ‘ Azaryah , ‘ Aved-N ’ go .
CJB	Daniel	1	8	But Dani ’ el resolved that he would not defile himself with the king ’ s food or the wine he drank , so he asked the chief officer to be excused from defiling himself .
CJB	Daniel	1	9	God caused the chief officer to be kind and sympathetic toward Dani ’ el ;
CJB	Daniel	1	10	however , the chief officer said to Dani ’ el , “ I ’ m afraid of my lord the king . After all , he has given you an allowance of food and drink ; so if he were to see you boys looking worse than the others your age , you would be putting my own head in danger from the king. ”
CJB	Daniel	1	11	Then Dani ’ el said to the guard whom the chief officer had put in charge of Dani ’ el , Hananyah , Misha ’ el and ‘ Azaryah ,
CJB	Daniel	1	12	“ Please ! Try an experiment on your servants — for ten days have them give us only vegetables to eat and water to drink .
CJB	Daniel	1	13	Then see how we look , and compare us with how the boys who eat the king ’ s food look ; and deal with your servants according to what you see. ”
CJB	Daniel	1	14	He agreed to do what they had asked and gave them a ten-day test .
CJB	Daniel	1	15	At the end of ten days they looked better and more robust than all the boys who were eating the king ’ s food .
CJB	Daniel	1	16	So the guard took away their food and the wine they were supposed to drink , and gave them vegetables .
CJB	Daniel	1	17	To these four boys God had given knowledge and skill in every aspect of learning and wisdom ; moreover , Dani ’ el could understand all kinds of visions and dreams .
CJB	Daniel	1	18	When the time the king had set for them to be presented came , the chief officer presented them to N ’ vukhadnetzar ;
CJB	Daniel	1	19	and when the king spoke with them , none was found among all of them to compare with Dani ’ el , Hananyah , Misha ’ el and ‘ Azaryah . So they entered the king ’ s service ;
CJB	Daniel	1	20	and in all matters requiring wisdom and understanding , whenever the king consulted them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and exorcists in his entire kingdom .
CJB	Daniel	1	21	So Dani ’ el remained there until the first year of King Koresh .
CJB	Daniel	2	2	So the king ordered the magicians , exorcists , sorcerers and astrologers summoned to interpret the king ’ s dreams to him . They came and stood in his presence .
CJB	Daniel	2	3	The king said to them , “ I had a dream which will keep troubling my spirit until I know what it means. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	4	The astrologers spoke to the king in Aramaic : “ May the king live forever ! Tell your servants the dream , and we will interpret it. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	5	The king answered the astrologers , “ Here is what I have decided : if you don ’ t tell me both the dream and its interpretation , you will be torn limb from limb and your houses reduced to rubble .
CJB	Daniel	2	6	But if you do state the dream and its interpretation , I will give you presents , rewards and great honor . Just tell me the dream and its interpretation. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	7	A second time they said , “ Let his majesty tell his servants the dream , and we will interpret it. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	8	The king replied , “ I see you ’ re only trying to gain time , because you see that I ’ ve decided
CJB	Daniel	2	9	that if you don ’ t tell me the dream , there is only one sentence passed on all of you . So you ’ ve conspired to mislead me with lies in the hope that time will change things . Now , just tell me the dream ! That will convince me that you will also be able to give me its correct interpretation. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	10	The astrologers answered the king , “ Your majesty , nobody in the world can do this ! Never has a king , no matter how great and powerful , asked such a thing of any magician or exorcist or astrologer .
CJB	Daniel	2	11	The king is asking a difficult thing ; nobody but the gods could tell this to your majesty , and they don ’ t live with mere mortals. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	12	At this the king flew into a rage and ordered all the sages of Bavel put to death .
CJB	Daniel	2	13	When the decree was published that the sages were to be slain , they sought Dani ’ el and his companions in order to have them put to death .
CJB	Daniel	2	14	Then , choosing his words carefully , Dani ’ el consulted Aryokh , captain of the royal guard , who had already gone out to kill the sages of Bavel .
CJB	Daniel	2	15	He said to Aryokh , “ Since you are the king ’ s official , let me ask : why has the king issued such a harsh decree ? ” Aryokh explained the matter to Dani ’ el .
CJB	Daniel	2	16	Then Dani ’ el went in and asked the king to give him time to tell the king the interpretation .
CJB	Daniel	2	17	Dani ’ el went home and made the matter known to Hananyah , Misha ’ el and ‘ Azaryah , his companions ;
CJB	Daniel	2	18	so that they could ask the God of heaven for mercy concerning this secret , and thus save Dani ’ el and his companions from dying along with the other sages of Bavel .
CJB	Daniel	2	19	Then the secret was revealed to Dani ’ el in a vision at night , and Dani ’ el blessed the God of heaven
CJB	Daniel	2	20	in these words : “ Blessed be the name of God from eternity past to eternity future ! For wisdom and power are his alone ;
CJB	Daniel	2	21	he brings the changes of seasons and times ; he installs and deposes kings ; he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those with discernment .
CJB	Daniel	2	22	He reveals deep and secret things ; he knows what lies in the darkness ; and light dwells with him .
CJB	Daniel	2	23	I thank and praise you , God of my ancestors , for giving me wisdom and power , and revealing to me what we wanted from you , for giving us the answer for the king. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	24	So Dani ’ el went to see Aryokh , whom the king had charged with destroying the sages of Bavel , and said to him , “ Don ’ t destroy the sages of Bavel ! Bring me before the king , and I will give the king the interpretation. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	25	Quickly Aryokh brought Dani ’ el before the king and told him , “ I have found one of the exiles of Y ’ hudah who will reveal the interpretation to his majesty. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	26	The king said to Dani ’ el ( who had been renamed Belt ’ shatzar ) , “ Can you tell me what I dreamt and what it means ? ”
CJB	Daniel	2	27	Dani ’ el answered the king , “ No sage , exorcist , magician or astrologer can tell his majesty the secret he has asked about .
CJB	Daniel	2	28	But there is a God in heaven who unlocks mysteries , and he has revealed to King N ’ vukhadnetzar what will happen in the acharit-hayamim . Here are your dream and the visions you had in your head when you were in bed .
CJB	Daniel	2	29	“ Your majesty , when you were in bed , you began thinking about what would take place in the future ; and he who reveals secrets has revealed to you what will happen .
CJB	Daniel	2	30	Yet this secret has not been revealed to me because I am wiser than anyone living , but so that the meaning can be made known to your majesty , and then you can understand the thoughts of your own mind .
CJB	Daniel	2	31	“ Your majesty had a vision of a statue , very large and extremely bright ; it stood in front of you and its appearance was terrifying .
CJB	Daniel	2	32	The head of the statue was of fine gold , its chest and arms of silver , its trunk and thighs of bronze ,
CJB	Daniel	2	33	its legs of iron , and its feet partly of iron and partly of clay .
CJB	Daniel	2	34	As you watched , a stone separated itself without any human hand , struck the statue on its feet made of iron and clay , and broke them in pieces .
CJB	Daniel	2	35	Then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver and the gold were all broken into pieces which became like the chaff on a threshing-floor in summer ; the wind blew them away without leaving a trace . But the stone which had struck the statue grew into a huge mountain that filled the whole earth .
CJB	Daniel	2	36	“ That is what you dreamt , and now we will give the king its interpretation .
CJB	Daniel	2	37	Your majesty , king of kings , to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom , the power , the strength and the glory ;
CJB	Daniel	2	38	so that wherever people , wild animals or birds in the air live , he has handed them over to you and enabled you to rule them all — you are the head of gold .
CJB	Daniel	2	39	But after you another kingdom will rise , inferior to you ; then a third kingdom , of bronze , which will rule the whole world .
CJB	Daniel	2	40	The fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron . Iron can break anything into pieces , pulverize it and crush it . So just as iron can crush anything , this kingdom will break the other kingdoms into pieces and crush them .
CJB	Daniel	2	41	Finally , you saw the feet and toes made partly of pottery clay and partly of iron ; this will be a divided kingdom ; yet it will have some of the firmness of iron , since you saw the iron mixed with clay from the ground .
CJB	Daniel	2	42	Just as the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay , this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle .
CJB	Daniel	2	43	You saw the iron mixed with clay ; that means that they will cement their alliances by intermarriages ; but they won ’ t stick together any more than iron blends with clay .
CJB	Daniel	2	44	“ In the days of those kings the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never be destroyed , and that kingdom will not pass into the hands of another people . It will break to pieces and consume all those kingdoms ; but it , itself , will stand forever —
CJB	Daniel	2	45	like the stone you saw , which , without human hands , separated itself from the mountain and broke to pieces the iron , the bronze , the clay , the silver and the gold . The great God has revealed to the king what will come about in the future . The dream is true , and its interpretation is reliable. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	46	Then King N ’ vukhadnetzar fell on his face and worshipped Dani ’ el ; he ordered that a grain offering and incense be offered to him .
CJB	Daniel	2	47	To Dani ’ el the king said , “ Your God is indeed the God of gods , the Lord of kings and a revealer of secrets , since you have been able to reveal this secret. ”
CJB	Daniel	2	48	The king promoted Dani ’ el to a high rank , gave him many rich gifts and made him governor of the entire province of Bavel and head of all the sages of Bavel .
CJB	Daniel	2	49	At Dani ’ el ’ s request , the king put Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go in charge of the affairs of the province of Bavel , while Dani ’ el remained in attendance on the king .
CJB	Daniel	3	3	The viceroys , prefects , governors , judges , treasurers , counselors , sheriffs and all the provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the statue which N ’ vukhadnetzar the king had set up . They stood in front of the statue that N ’ vukhadnetzar had set up ;
CJB	Daniel	3	2	Then N ’ vukhadnetzar the king summoned the viceroys , prefects , governors , judges , treasurers , counselors , sheriffs and all the provincial officials to assemble and come to the dedication of the statue which N ’ vukhadnetzar the king had set up .
CJB	Daniel	3	4	and a herald proclaimed , “ Peoples ! Nations ! Languages ! You are ordered
CJB	Daniel	3	5	that when you hear the sound of the horn , pipe , harp , zither , lute , bagpipe and the rest of the musical instruments , you fall down and worship the gold statue that N ’ vukhadnetzar the king has set up .
CJB	Daniel	3	6	Whoever does not fall down and worship is to be thrown immediately into a blazing hot furnace. ”
CJB	Daniel	3	7	Therefore , when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn , pipe , harp , zither , lute and the rest of the musical instruments , all the peoples , nations and languages fell down and worshipped the gold statue that N ’ vukhadnetzar the king had set up .
CJB	Daniel	3	8	But then some Kasdim approached and began denouncing the Jews .
CJB	Daniel	3	9	They said to N ’ vukhadnetzar the king , “ May the king live forever !
CJB	Daniel	3	10	Your majesty , you have ordered that everyone who hears sound of the horn , pipe , harp , zither , lute , bagpipe and the rest of the musical instruments is to fall down and worship the gold statue ;
CJB	Daniel	3	11	and that whoever does not fall down and worship is to be thrown into a blazing hot furnace .
CJB	Daniel	3	12	There are some Jews whom you have put in charge of the affairs of the province of Bavel , Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go ; and these men , your majesty , have paid no attention to you . They do not serve your gods , and they do not worship the gold statue you set up. ”
CJB	Daniel	3	13	In a raging fury N ’ vukhadnetzar ordered that Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go be brought . When the men had been brought before the king ,
CJB	Daniel	3	14	N ’ vukhadnetzar said to them , “ Shadrakh ! Meishakh ! ‘ Aved-N ’ go ! Is it true that you neither serve my gods nor worship the gold statue I set up ?
CJB	Daniel	3	15	All right , then . If you are prepared , when you hear the sound of the horn , pipe , harp , zither , lute , bagpipe and the rest of the musical instruments , to fall down and worship the gold statue , very well . But if you won ’ t worship , you will immediately be thrown into a blazing hot furnace — and what god will save you from my power then ? ”
CJB	Daniel	3	16	Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go answered the king , “ Your question doesn ’ t require an answer from us .
CJB	Daniel	3	17	Your majesty , if our God , whom we serve , is able to save us , he will save us from the blazing hot furnace and from your power .
CJB	Daniel	3	18	But even if he doesn ’ t , we want you to know , your majesty , that we will neither serve your gods nor worship the gold statue which you have set up. ”
CJB	Daniel	3	19	N ’ vukhadnetzar became so utterly enraged that his face was distorted with anger against Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go . He ordered the furnace made seven times hotter than usual .
CJB	Daniel	3	20	Then he ordered some of the strongest men in his army to tie up Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go and throw them into the blazing hot furnace .
CJB	Daniel	3	21	So these men were tied up in their cloaks , tunics , robes and other clothes , and thrown into the blazing hot furnace .
CJB	Daniel	3	22	The king ’ s order was so urgent and the furnace so overheated that the men carrying Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go were burned to death by the flames .
CJB	Daniel	3	23	These three men , Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go , fell , bound , into the blazing hot furnace .
CJB	Daniel	3	24	Suddenly N ’ vukhadnetzar sprang to his feet . Alarmed , he asked his advisers , “ Didn ’ t we throw three men , bound , into the flames ? ” They answered the king , “ Yes , of course , your majesty. ”
CJB	Daniel	3	25	But he exclaimed , “ Look ! I see four men , not tied up , walking around there in the flames , unhurt ; and the fourth looks like one of the gods ! ”
CJB	Daniel	3	26	N ’ vukhadnetzar approached the opening of the blazing hot furnace and said , “ Shadrakh ! Meishakh ! ‘ Aved-N ’ go ! You servants of El ‘ Elyon ! Come out , and come here ! ” Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go emerged from the flames .
CJB	Daniel	3	27	The viceroys , prefects , governors and royal advisers who were there saw that the fire had had no power on the bodies of these men — not even their hair was singed , their clothes looked the same , and they didn ’ t smell of fire .
CJB	Daniel	3	28	N ’ vukhadnetzar said , “ Blessed be the God of Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go ! He sent his angel to deliver his servants who trusted in him . They defied the royal order to the point of being willing to give up their bodies , in order not to serve or worship any god but their own God .
CJB	Daniel	3	29	Therefore I herewith decree that anyone , no matter from which people , nation or language , who says anything to insult the God of Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go is to be torn limb from limb , and his house is to be reduced to rubble ; because there is no other god who can save like this. ”
CJB	Daniel	3	30	Then the king gave Shadrakh , Meishakh and ‘ Aved-N ’ go higher rank in the province of Bavel .
CJB	Daniel	3	31	( 4:1 ) [ The following letter was sent out : ] “ From : N ’ vukhadnetzar the king “ To : All the peoples , nations and languages living throughout the earth : “ Shalom rav ! [ Abundant peace ! ]
CJB	Daniel	3	32	( 4:2 ) “ I am pleased to recount the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me .
CJB	Daniel	3	33	( 4:3 ) “ How great are his signs ! How powerful his wonders ! His kingdom lasts forever , and he rules all generations .

CJB	Daniel	4	35	) All who live on earth are counted as nothing . He does what he wishes with the army of heaven and with those living on earth . No one can hold back his hand or ask him , “ What are you doing ? ” ’
CJB	Daniel	4	36	) “ It was at that moment that my understanding came back to me ; and for the sake of the glory of my kingdom , my majesty and splendor also came back to me . My advisers and lords sought me out , I was re-established in my kingdom , and to my previous greatness even more was added .
CJB	Daniel	4	37	) So now I , N ’ vukhadnetzar , praise , exalt and honor the King of heaven : “ ‘ For all his works are truth , and his ways are just ; and he can humble those who walk in pride . ’ ”
CJB	Daniel	5	5	Suddenly , the fingers of a human hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the palace wall by the lampstand . When the king saw the palm of the hand that was writing ,
CJB	Daniel	5	2	While tasting the wine , Belshatzar ordered that the gold and silver vessels which his father N ’ vukhadnetzar had removed from the temple in Yerushalayim be brought ; so that the king , his lords , his wives and his concubines could drink from them .
CJB	Daniel	5	3	So they brought the gold vessels which had been removed from the sanctuary of the house of God in Yerushalayim ; and the king , his lords , his wives and his concubines drank from them .
CJB	Daniel	5	4	They drank their wine and praised their gods made of gold , silver , bronze , iron , wood and stone .
CJB	Daniel	5	6	the king ’ s face took on a different look . As frightening thoughts rose up within him , his hip joints gave way and his knees started knocking together .
CJB	Daniel	5	7	The king cried out to bring in the exorcists , astrologers and diviners . The king said to the sages of Bavel , “ Whoever can read this inscription and tell me what it means will be dressed in royal purple , wear a gold chain around his neck and be one of the three men ruling the kingdom. ”
CJB	Daniel	5	8	But although all the king ’ s sages came in , none could read the inscription or tell the king what it meant .
CJB	Daniel	5	9	Then King Belshatzar became terrified ; his face turned pale , and his lords were thrown into confusion .
CJB	Daniel	5	10	At this point the queen mother , because of what the king and his lords were saying , entered the banquet hall . The queen mother said , “ May the king live forever ! Don ’ t be scared by your thoughts or let your face be so pale .
CJB	Daniel	5	11	There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods . In the days of your father , he was found to have light , discernment and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods . King N ’ vukhadnetzar your father — the king , your father — made him chief of the magicians , exorcists , astrologers and diviners ;
CJB	Daniel	5	12	because he was found to have an extraordinary spirit , knowledge , discernment , and the ability to interpret dreams , unlock mysteries and solve knotty problems . He is called Dani ’ el , but the king gave him the name Belt ’ shatzar . Now have Dani ’ el summoned , and he will tell you what this means. ”
CJB	Daniel	5	13	Dani ’ el was brought into the king ’ s presence . The king said to Dani ’ el , “ Are you Dani ’ el , one of the exiles from Y ’ hudah whom the king my father brought out of Y ’ hudah ?
CJB	Daniel	5	14	I ’ ve heard about you that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that you have been found to have light , discernment and extraordinary wisdom .
CJB	Daniel	5	15	Now the sages , the exorcists , were brought in to me so that they could read this inscription and tell me what it means , but they couldn ’ t interpret it for me .
CJB	Daniel	5	16	However , I ’ ve heard that you can give interpretations and solve knotty problems . Now if you can read the inscription and tell me what it means , you will be dressed in royal purple , wear a gold chain around your neck and be one of the three men ruling the kingdom. ”
CJB	Daniel	5	17	Dani ’ el answered the king , “ Keep your gifts , and give your rewards to someone else . However , I will read the inscription to the king and tell him what it means .
CJB	Daniel	5	18	Your majesty , the Most High God gave N ’ vukhadnetzar your father the kingdom , as well as greatness , glory and majesty .
CJB	Daniel	5	19	Because of the greatness he gave him , all the peoples , nations and languages trembled with fear before him . Anyone he wanted to , he put to death ; anyone he wanted to , he kept alive ; anyone he wanted to , he advanced ; and anyone he wanted to , he humbled .
CJB	Daniel	5	20	But when he grew proud and his spirit became hard , he began treating people arrogantly , so he was deposed from his royal throne , and his glory was taken away from him .
CJB	Daniel	5	21	He was driven from human society , his heart was made like that of an animal , he lived with the wild donkeys , he was fed with grass like an ox , and his body was drenched with dew from the sky ; until he learned that the Most High God rules in the human kingdom and sets up over it whomever he pleases .
CJB	Daniel	5	22	But , Belshatzar , you , his son , have not humbled your heart , even though you knew all this .
CJB	Daniel	5	23	Instead , you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven by having them bring you the vessels from his house ; and you and your lords , your wives and your concubines drank wine from them ; then you offered praise to your gods of silver , gold , bronze , iron , wood and stone , which can ’ t see , hear or know anything . Meanwhile , God , who holds your very breath in his hands , and to whom belongs everything you do , you have not glorified .
CJB	Daniel	5	24	This is why he sent the hand to write this inscription ;
CJB	Daniel	5	25	and the inscription says , ‘ M ’ ne ! M ’ ne ! T ’ kel ufarsin. ’ [ a ]
CJB	Daniel	5	26	This is what it means : ‘ M ’ ne ! ’ — God has counted up your kingdom and brought it to an end .
CJB	Daniel	5	27	‘ T ’ kel ’ — you are weighed on the balance-scale and come up short .
CJB	Daniel	5	28	‘ P ’ res ’ — your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians. ”
CJB	Daniel	5	29	Then Belshatzar gave the order ; and they clothed Dani ’ el in royal purple , put a gold chain around his neck and proclaimed of him that he was to be one of the three men ruling the kingdom .
CJB	Daniel	5	30	That very night Belshatzar , the king of the Kasdim , was killed . Footnotes - Daniel 5:25 M ’ ne — a maneh was a coin ; Aramaic mena means “ to count. ” T ’ kel is Aramaic for shekel , a unit of weight ; Aramaic tekilta means “ you are weighed. ” P ’ res ( an Aramaic noun , plural parsin ) , is half a maneh ; p ’ ris means “ cut up , divided ” ; Paras is Persia . ( The “ f ” in ufarsin is the Aramaic letter peh , sometimes pronounced “ p ” and sometimes , “ f . ” )
CJB	Daniel	6	6	) So these chiefs and viceroys descended on the king and said to him , “ King Daryavesh , live forever !
CJB	Daniel	6	2	) with three chiefs over them , of whom Dani ’ el was one , so that these viceroys could be responsible to them and so that the king ’ s interests would be safeguarded .
CJB	Daniel	6	1	) Daryavesh decided to set over the kingdom
CJB	Daniel	6	120	viceroys to rule throughout the entire kingdom ,
CJB	Daniel	6	3	) But because an extraordinary spirit was in this Dani ’ el , he so distinguished himself above the other chiefs and the viceroys that the king considered putting him in charge of the whole kingdom .
CJB	Daniel	6	4	) The other chiefs and the viceroys tried to find a cause for complaint against Dani ’ el in regard to how he performed his governing duties , but they could find nothing to complain about , no fault ; on the contrary , because he was so faithful , not a single instance of negligence or faulty administration could be found .
CJB	Daniel	6	5	) Then these men said , “ We ’ re not going to find any cause for complaint against this Dani ’ el unless we can find something against him in regard to the law of his god. ”
CJB	Daniel	6	7	) All the chiefs of the kingdom , along with the prefects , viceroys , advisers and governors , have met and agreed that the king should issue a decree putting in force the following law : ‘ Whoever makes a request of any god or man during the next thirty days , except of you , your majesty , is to be thrown into the lion pit. ’
CJB	Daniel	6	8	) Now , your majesty , issue this decree over your signature , so that it can not be revoked , as required by the law of the Medes and Persians , which is itself irrevocable. ”
CJB	Daniel	6	9	) So King Daryavesh signed the document , and the decree became law .
CJB	Daniel	6	10	) On learning that the document had been signed , Dani ’ el went home . The windows of his upstairs room were open in the direction of Yerushalayim ; and there he kneeled down three times a day and prayed , giving thanks before his God , just as he had been doing before .
CJB	Daniel	6	11	) Then these men descended on Dani ’ el and found him making requests and pleading before his God .
CJB	Daniel	6	12	) So they went to remind the king of his royal decree : “ Didn ’ t you sign a law prohibiting anyone from making requests of any god or man within thirty days , except yourself , your majesty , on pain of being thrown into the lion pit ? ” The king answered , “ Yes , that is true , as required by the law of the Medes and Persians , which is itself irrevocable. ”
CJB	Daniel	6	13	) They replied to the king , “ That Dani ’ el , one of the exiles from Y ’ hudah , respects neither you , your majesty , nor the decree you signed ; instead , he continues praying three times a day. ”
CJB	Daniel	6	14	) When the king heard this report , he was very upset . He determined to save Dani ’ el and worked until sunset to find a way to rescue him .
CJB	Daniel	6	15	) But these men descended on the king and said to him , “ Remember , your majesty , that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or edict , once issued by the king , can be revoked. ”
CJB	Daniel	6	16	) So the king gave the order , and they brought Dani ’ el and threw him into the lion pit . The king said to Dani ’ el , “ Your God , whom you are always serving , will save you. ”
CJB	Daniel	6	17	) A stone was brought to block the opening of the pit , and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords , so that nothing concerning Dani ’ el could be changed .
CJB	Daniel	6	18	) Then the king returned to his palace . He spent the night fasting and refusing to be entertained , as sleep eluded him .
CJB	Daniel	6	19	) Early in the morning , the king got up and hurried to the lion pit .
CJB	Daniel	6	20	) On approaching the pit where Dani ’ el was , the king cried in a pained voice to Dani ’ el , “ Dani ’ el , servant of the living God ! Has your God , whom you are always serving , been able to save you from the lions ? ”
CJB	Daniel	6	21	) Then Dani ’ el answered the king , “ May the king live forever !
CJB	Daniel	6	22	) My God sent his angel to shut the lions ’ mouths , so they haven ’ t hurt me . This is because before him I was found innocent ; and also I have done no harm to you , your majesty. ”
CJB	Daniel	6	23	) The king was overjoyed and ordered Dani ’ el taken up from the pit . So Dani ’ el was taken up from the pit , and he was found to be completely unharmed , because he had trusted in his God .
CJB	Daniel	6	24	) Then the king gave an order , and they brought those men who had accused Dani ’ el , and they threw them into the lion pit — them , their children and their wives — and before they even reached the bottom of the pit , the lions had them in their control and broke all their bones to pieces .
CJB	Daniel	6	25	) King Daryavesh wrote all the peoples , nations and languages living anywhere on earth : “ Shalom rav ! [ Abundant peace ! ]
CJB	Daniel	6	26	) “ I herewith issue a decree that everywhere in my kingdom , people are to tremble and be in awe of the God of Dani ’ el . “ For he is the living God ; he endures forever . His kingdom will never be destroyed ; his rulership will last till the end .
CJB	Daniel	6	27	) He saves , rescues , does signs and wonders both in heaven and on earth . He delivered Dani ’ el from the power of the lions. ”
CJB	Daniel	6	28	) So this Dani ’ el prospered during the reign of Daryavesh , and also during the reign of Koresh the Persian .
CJB	Daniel	6	29	(
CJB	Daniel	7	7	After this , I looked in the night visions ; and there before me was a fourth animal , dreadful , horrible , extremely strong , and with great iron teeth . It devoured , crushed and stamped its feet on what was left . It was different from all the animals that had gone before it , and it had ten horns .
CJB	Daniel	7	2	“ I had a vision at night ; I saw there before me the four winds of the sky breaking out over the great sea ,
CJB	Daniel	7	3	and four huge animals came up out of the sea , each different from the others .
CJB	Daniel	7	4	The first was like a lion , but it had eagle ’ s wings . As I watched , its wings were plucked off , and it was lifted off the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man , and a human heart was given to it .
CJB	Daniel	7	5	Then there was another animal , a second one , like a bear . It raised itself up on one side , and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth . It was told , ‘ Get up , and gorge yourself with flesh ! ’
CJB	Daniel	7	6	After this , I looked ; and there was another one , like a leopard with four bird ’ s wings on its sides . The animal also had four heads , and it was given power to rule .
CJB	Daniel	7	8	“ While I was considering the horns , another horn sprang up among them , a little one , before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots . In this horn were eyes like human eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly .
CJB	Daniel	7	9	“ As I watched , thrones were set in place ; and the Ancient One took his seat . His clothing was white as snow , the hair on his head was like pure wool . His throne was fiery flames , with wheels of burning fire .
CJB	Daniel	7	10	A stream of fire flowed from his presence ; thousands and thousands ministered to him , millions and millions stood before him . Then the court was convened , and the books were opened .
CJB	Daniel	7	11	“ I kept watching . Then , because of the arrogant words which the horn was speaking , I watched as the animal was killed ; its body was destroyed ; and it was given over to be burned up completely .
CJB	Daniel	7	12	As for the other animals , their rulership was taken away ; but their lives were prolonged for a time and a season .
CJB	Daniel	7	13	“ I kept watching the night visions , when I saw , coming with the clouds of heaven , someone like a son of man . He approached the Ancient One and was led into his presence .
CJB	Daniel	7	14	To him was given rulership , glory and a kingdom , so that all peoples , nations and languages should serve him . His rulership is an eternal rulership that will not pass away ; and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed .
CJB	Daniel	7	15	“ As for me , Dani ’ el , my spirit deep within me was troubled ; the visions in my head frightened me .
CJB	Daniel	7	16	I approached one of those standing by and asked him what all this really meant . He said that he would make me understand how to interpret these things .
CJB	Daniel	7	17	‘ These four huge animals are four kingdoms that will arise on earth .
CJB	Daniel	7	18	But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever , yes , forever and ever. ’
CJB	Daniel	7	19	“ Then I wanted to know what the fourth beast meant , the one that was different from all the others , so very terrifying , with iron teeth and bronze nails , which devoured , crushed and stamped its feet on what was left ;
CJB	Daniel	7	20	and what the ten horns on its head meant ; and the other horn which sprang up and before which three fell , the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly and seemed greater than the others .
CJB	Daniel	7	21	I watched , and that horn made war with the holy ones and was winning ,
CJB	Daniel	7	22	until the Ancient One came , judgment was given in favor of the holy ones of the Most High , and the time came for the holy ones to take over the kingdom .
CJB	Daniel	7	23	This is what he said : ‘ The fourth animal will be a fourth kingdom on earth . It will be different from the other kingdoms ; it will devour the whole earth , trample it down and crush it .
CJB	Daniel	7	24	As for the ten horns , out of this kingdom ten kings will arise ; and yet another will arise after them . Now he will be different from the earlier ones , and he will put down three kings .
CJB	Daniel	7	25	He will speak words against the Most High and try to exhaust the holy ones of the Most High . He will attempt to alter the seasons and the law ; and [ the holy ones ] will be handed over to him for a time , times and half a time .
CJB	Daniel	7	26	But when the court goes into session , he will be stripped of his rulership , which will be consumed and completely destroyed .
CJB	Daniel	7	27	Then the kingdom , the rulership and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High . Their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all rulers will serve and obey them. ’ ”
CJB	Daniel	7	28	This is the end of the account . As for me , Dani ’ el , my thoughts frightened me so much that I turned pale ; but I kept the matter to myself .
CJB	Daniel	8	8	The male goat then became extremely strong ; but when it was strong , the big horn was broken ; and in its place arose what appeared to be four horns in the directions of the four winds of heaven .
CJB	Daniel	8	2	I looked into the vision ; and as I looked , I found myself in Shushan the capital , in the province of ‘ Eilam . I looked into the vision , and I was by the Ulai canal .
CJB	Daniel	8	3	I looked up ; and as I watched , there in front of the stream stood a ram with two horns . The horns were long , but one was longer than the other , and the longer one came up later [ than the other ] .
CJB	Daniel	8	4	I saw the ram pushing to the west , north and south ; and no animals could stand up against it ; nor was there anyone that could rescue from its power . So it did as it pleased and became very strong .
CJB	Daniel	8	5	I was beginning to understand , when a male goat came from the west , passing over the whole earth without touching the ground . The goat had a prominent horn between its eyes .
CJB	Daniel	8	6	It approached the ram with the two horns , which I had seen standing in front of the river , and charged it with savage force .
CJB	Daniel	8	7	I watched as it advanced on the ram , filled with rage against it , and struck the ram , breaking its two horns . The ram was powerless to stand against it . It threw the ram to the ground and trampled it down , and there was no one that could rescue it from the goat ’ s power .
CJB	Daniel	8	9	Out of one of them came a little horn which grew extremely big in the directions of the south and east , and in the direction of the Glory .
CJB	Daniel	8	10	It grew so great that it reached the army of heaven ; it hurled some of the army and the stars to the ground and trampled on them .
CJB	Daniel	8	11	Yes , it even considered itself as great as the prince of the army ; the regular burnt offering was taken away from him , and the place of his sanctuary was thrown down .
CJB	Daniel	8	12	Through sin , the army was put in its power , along with the regular burnt offering . It flung truth on the ground as it acted and prospered .
CJB	Daniel	8	13	Then I heard a holy one speaking , and another holy one said to the speaker , “ How long will the events of the vision last , this vision concerning the regular offering and the transgression which is so appalling , that allows the sanctuary and the army to be trampled underfoot ? ”
CJB	Daniel	8	14	The first said to me , “ Two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings , after which the sanctuary will be restored to its rightful state. ”
CJB	Daniel	8	15	After I , Dani ’ el , had seen the vision and was trying to understand it , suddenly there stood in front of me someone who appeared to be a man .
CJB	Daniel	8	16	I heard a human voice calling from between the banks of the Ulai , “ Gavri ’ el , make this man understand the vision ! ”
CJB	Daniel	8	17	He came up to where I was standing , and his approach so terrified me that I fell on my face . But he said to me , “ Human being ! Understand that the vision refers to the time of the end. ”
CJB	Daniel	8	18	As he was speaking with me , I fell into a deep sleep , with my face toward the ground ; but he touched me , set me on my feet ,
CJB	Daniel	8	19	and said , “ I am going to explain to you what will happen at the end of the period of fury , because [ the vision ] has to do with the time at the end .
CJB	Daniel	8	20	You saw a ram with two horns which are the kings of Media and Persia .
CJB	Daniel	8	21	The shaggy male goat is the king of Greece , and the prominent horn between its eyes is the first king .
CJB	Daniel	8	22	As for the horn that broke and the four which rose up in its place , four kingdoms will arise out of this nation , but not with the power the first king had .
CJB	Daniel	8	23	In the latter part of their reign , when the evildoers have become as evil as possible , there will arise an arrogant king skilled in intrigue .
CJB	Daniel	8	24	His power will be great , but not with the power the first king had . He will be amazingly destructive , he will succeed in whatever he does , and he will destroy the mighty and the holy ones .
CJB	Daniel	8	25	He will succeed through craftiness and deceit , become swelled with pride , and destroy many people just when they feel the most secure . He will even challenge the prince of princes ; but , without human intervention , he will be broken .
CJB	Daniel	8	26	The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true ; but you are to keep the vision secret , because it is about days in the distant future. ”
CJB	Daniel	8	27	I , Dani ’ el , grew weak and was ill for some days . Then I got up and took care of the king ’ s affairs ; but I was appalled at the vision and still couldn ’ t understand it .
CJB	Daniel	9	9	It is for Adonai our God to show compassion and forgiveness , because we rebelled against him .
CJB	Daniel	9	2	in the first year of his reign , I , Dani ’ el , was reading the Scriptures and thinking about the number of years which Adonai had told Yirmeyah the prophet would be the period of Yerushalayim ’ s desolation , seventy years .
CJB	Daniel	9	3	I turned to Adonai , God , to seek an answer , pleading with him in prayer , with fasting , sackcloth and ashes .
CJB	Daniel	9	4	I prayed to Adonai my God and made this confession : “ Please , Adonai , great and fearsome God , who keeps his covenant and extends grace to those who love him and observe his mitzvot !
CJB	Daniel	9	5	We have sinned , done wrong , acted wickedly , rebelled and turned away from your mitzvot and rulings .
CJB	Daniel	9	6	We have not listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our leaders , our ancestors and to all the people of the land .
CJB	Daniel	9	7	“ To you , Adonai , belongs righteousness ; but to us today belongs shame — to us , the men of Y ’ hudah , the inhabitants of Yerushalayim and all Isra ’ el , including those nearby and those far away , throughout all the countries where you have driven them ; because they broke faith with you .
CJB	Daniel	9	8	Yes , Adonai , shame falls on us , our kings , our leaders and our ancestors ; because we sinned against you .
CJB	Daniel	9	10	We didn ’ t listen to the voice of Adonai our God , so that we could live by his laws , which he presented to us through his servants the prophets .
CJB	Daniel	9	11	Yes , all Isra ’ el flouted your Torah and turned away , unwilling to listen to your voice . Therefore the curse and oath written in the Torah of Moshe the servant of God was poured out on us , because we sinned against him .
CJB	Daniel	9	12	He carried out the threats he spoke against us and against our judges who judged us , by bringing upon us disaster so great that under all of heaven , nothing has been done like what has been done to Yerushalayim .
CJB	Daniel	9	13	As written in the Torah of Moshe , this whole disaster came upon us . Yet we did not appease Adonai our God by renouncing our wrongdoing and discerning your truth .
CJB	Daniel	9	14	So Adonai watched for the right moment to bring this disaster upon us , for Adonai our God was just in everything he did , yet we didn ’ t listen when he spoke .
CJB	Daniel	9	15	“ Now , Adonai our God , who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand , thereby winning renown for yourself , as is the case today — we sinned , we acted wickedly .
CJB	Daniel	9	16	Adonai , in keeping with all your justice , please allow your anger and fury to be turned away from your city Yerushalayim , your holy mountain ; because it is due to our sins and the wrongdoings of our ancestors that Yerushalayim and your people have become objects of scorn among everyone around us .
CJB	Daniel	9	17	Therefore , our God , listen to the prayer and pleadings of your servant ; and cause your face to shine on your desolated sanctuary , for your own sake .
CJB	Daniel	9	18	My God , turn your ear , and hear ; open your eyes and see how desolated we are , as well as the city which bears your name . For we plead with you not because of our own righteousness , but because of your compassion .
CJB	Daniel	9	19	Adonai , hear ! Adonai , forgive ! Adonai , pay attention , and don ’ t delay action — for your own sake , my God , because your city and your people bear your name ! ”
CJB	Daniel	9	20	While I was speaking , praying , confessing my own sin and the sin of my people Isra ’ el , and pleading before Adonai my God for the holy mountain of my God —
CJB	Daniel	9	21	yes , while I was speaking in prayer , the man Gavri ’ el , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , swooped down on me in full flight at about the time of the evening sacrifice ,
CJB	Daniel	9	22	and explained things to me . He said , “ I have come now , Dani ’ el , to enable you to understand this vision clearly .
CJB	Daniel	9	23	At the beginning of your prayers , an answer was given ; and I have come to say what it is ; because you are greatly loved . Therefore look into this answer , and understand the vision .
CJB	Daniel	9	24	“ Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and for your holy city for putting an end to the transgression , for making an end of sin , for forgiving iniquity , for bringing in everlasting justice , for setting the seal on vision and prophet , and for anointing the Especially Holy Place .
CJB	Daniel	9	25	Know , therefore , and discern that seven weeks [ of years ] will elapse between the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Yerushalayim until an anointed prince comes . It will remain built for sixty-two weeks [ of years ] , with open spaces and moats ; but these will be troubled times .
CJB	Daniel	9	26	Then , after the sixty-two weeks , Mashiach will be cut off and have nothing . The people of a prince yet to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary , but his end will come with a flood , and desolations are decreed until the war is over .
CJB	Daniel	9	27	He will make a strong covenant with leaders for one week [ of years ] . For half of the week he will put a stop to the sacrifice and the grain offering . On the wing of detestable things the desolator will come and continue until the already decreed destruction is poured out on the desolator . ”
CJB	Daniel	10	10	Then a hand touched me and raised me , tottering , to my hands and knees .
CJB	Daniel	10	2	At that time I , Dani ’ el , had been mourning for three whole weeks .
CJB	Daniel	10	3	I hadn ’ t eaten any food that satisfied me — neither meat nor wine had entered my mouth , and I didn ’ t anoint myself once , until three full weeks had passed .
CJB	Daniel	10	4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month , I was on the bank of the great river , the Tigris ,
CJB	Daniel	10	5	when I looked up , and there before me was a man dressed in linen wearing a belt made of fine Ufaz gold .
CJB	Daniel	10	6	His body was like beryl , his face looked like lightning and his eyes like fiery torches ; his arms and feet were the color of burnished bronze ; and when he spoke , it sounded like the roar of a crowd .
CJB	Daniel	10	7	Only I , Dani ’ el , saw the vision ; the men who were with me did not see the vision ; however , a great trembling fell over them ; so that they rushed to hide themselves .
CJB	Daniel	10	8	Thus I was left alone ; and when I saw this great vision , there was no strength left in me — my face , normally pleasant-looking , became disfigured ; and I had no strength .
CJB	Daniel	10	9	I heard his voice speaking ; and when I heard him speaking , I fell down in a faint , with my face to the ground .
CJB	Daniel	10	11	He said to me , “ Dani ’ el , you are a greatly loved man . Now pay attention to the words I am saying to you , and stand upright ; for it is to you that I have been sent now. ” After he had said this to me , I stood up , trembling .
CJB	Daniel	10	12	Then he said to me , “ Don ’ t be afraid , Dani ’ el ; because since the first day that you determined to understand and to humble yourself before your God , your words have been heard ; and I have come because of what you said .
CJB	Daniel	10	13	The prince of the kingdom of Persia prevented me from coming for twenty-one days ; but Mikha ’ el , one of the chief princes , came to assist me ; so that I was no longer needed there with the kings of Persia .
CJB	Daniel	10	14	So I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the acharit-hayamim ; for there is still another vision which will relate to those days. ”
CJB	Daniel	10	15	After he had said these things to me , I looked down at the ground and couldn ’ t speak .
CJB	Daniel	10	16	Then someone who looked like a human being touched my lips , after which I could open my mouth and speak ; I said to the one standing in front of me , “ My lord , it is because of the vision that I am seized with such anguish ; I don ’ t have any strength .
CJB	Daniel	10	17	For how can this servant of my lord speak with my lord , when my strength and breath have failed me ? ”
CJB	Daniel	10	18	Then , again someone who looked human touched me and revived me .
CJB	Daniel	10	19	He said , “ You man so greatly loved , don ’ t be afraid . Shalom to you ; and be strong , yes , truly strong. ” His speaking to me strengthened me , and I said , “ My lord , keep speaking ; because you ’ ve given me strength. ”
CJB	Daniel	10	20	Then he said , “ Do you know why I came to you ? Although now I must return to fight the prince of Persia ; and when I leave , the prince of Greece will come ;
CJB	Daniel	10	21	nevertheless , I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth . There is no one standing with me against them except Mikha ’ el your prince ;
CJB	Daniel	11	11	The king of the south , enraged , will set out to do battle with the king of the north , who , in turn , will muster a large army ; but this army will be defeated by his enemy
CJB	Daniel	11	2	What I am going to tell you now is true . “ Three kings will arise in Persia , followed by a fourth , who will be far wealthier than all of them ; and when he has grown strong by means of his wealth , he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece .
CJB	Daniel	11	3	“ Then a powerful king will appear who will rule a vast kingdom and do whatever he pleases .
CJB	Daniel	11	4	But once he appears , his kingdom will be broken up and divided to the four winds of heaven . It won ’ t be inherited by his descendants , and it won ’ t be ruled with the power he had , because his kingship will be uprooted and will pass to others than his own posterity .
CJB	Daniel	11	5	“ The king in the south will be strong , and one of his princes will gain power over him and have dominion ; his domain will be a great dominion .
CJB	Daniel	11	6	After a number of years they will form an alliance . The daughter of the king of the south will approach the king of the north to make an agreement , but she won ’ t retain her power ; and he and his power won ’ t last either . Rather , she will be surrendered , along with her attendants , her father and the one who supported her during those times .
CJB	Daniel	11	7	But another branch from the same roots as hers will appear in her father ’ s place . He will attack the army of the king of the north , enter his fortress and succeed in conquering them .
CJB	Daniel	11	8	He will also carry off as booty to Egypt their gods , their cast metal images and their valuable gold and silver vessels . Then for some years , he will refrain from attacking the king of the north .
CJB	Daniel	11	9	“ Afterwards , the king of the north will invade the kingdom of the king of the south , but he will retire to his own land .
CJB	Daniel	11	10	His sons will rouse themselves to muster a large and powerful army , which will advance like a flood passing through . In another campaign , it will march on the enemy stronghold .
CJB	Daniel	11	12	and carried off . The conqueror will grow proud as he slaughters tens of thousands , yet he will not prevail .
CJB	Daniel	11	13	Rather , the king of the north will again muster an army , larger than the first one , at the end of this period , after a number of years ; it will be a large , well-supplied army .
CJB	Daniel	11	14	Those will be times in which many will resist the king of the south ; and the more violent ones among your own people will rebel in order to fulfill their vision ; but they will fail .
CJB	Daniel	11	15	“ Then the king of the north will come , set up siege-works and capture a fortified city ; the forces of the south will be insufficient defense , even his elite troops will not be strong enough to resist .
CJB	Daniel	11	16	The invader will do as he pleases ; no one will be able to withstand him . So he will establish himself in the Land of Glory , and he will have the power to destroy it .
CJB	Daniel	11	17	He will determinedly advance with the full force of his kingdom , but he will make an agreement with the king of the south and give him a daughter in marriage . His object will be to destroy him , but the agreement will not last or work out in his favor .
CJB	Daniel	11	18	Next , he will put his attention on the coastlands and islands and capture many , but an army commander will put a stop to his outrages and cause his outrages to come back upon him .
CJB	Daniel	11	19	After this , he will put his attention on the strongholds in his own land ; but he will stumble , fall and not be seen again .
CJB	Daniel	11	20	“ In his place will arise one who will send a tax collector through the Glorious Kingdom ; but within a few days , he will be broken , though neither in anger nor in battle .
CJB	Daniel	11	21	“ There will arise in his place a despicable man not entitled to inherit the majesty of the kingdom , but he will come without warning and gain the kingdom by intrigue .
CJB	Daniel	11	22	Large armies will be broken and swept away before him , as well as the prince of the covenant .
CJB	Daniel	11	23	Alliances will be made with him , but he will undermine them by deceit . Then , although he will have but a small following , he will emerge and become strong .
CJB	Daniel	11	24	Without warning , he will assail the most powerful men in each province and do things his predecessors never did , either recently or in the distant past ; he will reward them with plunder , spoil and wealth while devising plots against their strongholds , but only for a time .
CJB	Daniel	11	25	“ He will summon his power and courage against the king of the south with a great army , and the king of the south will fight back with a very large and powerful army ; but he will not succeed , because of plots devised against him .
CJB	Daniel	11	26	Yes , those who shared his food will destroy him ; his army will be swept away ; and many will fall in the slaughter .
CJB	Daniel	11	27	These two kings , bent on mischief , will sit at the same table , speaking lies to each other ; but none of this will succeed ; because the appointed end will not have come yet .
CJB	Daniel	11	28	Then the king of the north will return to his own land with great wealth ; with his heart set against the holy covenant , he will take action and then return home .
CJB	Daniel	11	29	“ At the time designated , he will come back to the south . But this time , things will turn out differently than before ;
CJB	Daniel	11	30	because ships from Kittim will come against him , so that his courage will fail him . Then , in retreat , he will take furious action against the holy covenant , again showing favor to those who abandon the holy covenant .
CJB	Daniel	11	31	Armed forces will come at his order and profane the sanctuary and fortress . They will abolish the daily burnt offering and set up the abomination that causes desolation .
CJB	Daniel	11	32	Those who act wickedly against the covenant he will corrupt with his blandishments , but the people who know their God will stand firm and prevail .
CJB	Daniel	11	33	Those among the people who have discernment will cause the rest of the people to understand what is happening ; nevertheless , for a while they will fall victim to sword , fire , exile and pillage .
CJB	Daniel	11	34	When they stumble , they will receive a little help , although many who join them will be insincere .
CJB	Daniel	11	35	Even some of those with discernment will stumble , so that some of them will be refined , purified and cleansed for an end yet to come at the designated time .
CJB	Daniel	11	36	“ The king will do as he pleases . He will exalt himself and consider himself greater than any god , and he will utter monstrous blasphemies against the God of gods . He will prosper only until the period of wrath is over , for what has been determined must take place .
CJB	Daniel	11	37	He will show no respect for the gods his ancestors worshipped , or for the god women worship — he won ’ t show respect for any god , because he will consider himself greater than all of them .
CJB	Daniel	11	38	But instead , he will honor the god of strongholds ; with gold , silver , precious stones and other costly things he will honor a god unknown to his ancestors .
CJB	Daniel	11	39	He will deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god . He will confer honor on those he acknowledges , causing them to rule over many and distributing land as a reward .
CJB	Daniel	11	40	“ When the time for the end comes , the king of the south will push at him ; while the king of the north will attack him like a whirlwind , with chariots , cavalry and a large navy . He will invade countries , overrun them and move on .
CJB	Daniel	11	41	He will also enter the Land of Glory , and many [ countries ] will come to grief , but these will be saved from his power — Edom , Mo ’ av and the people of ‘ Amon .
CJB	Daniel	11	42	He will reach out his hand to seize other countries too . The land of Egypt will not escape —
CJB	Daniel	11	43	he will control the treasures of gold and silver , as well as everything else in Egypt of value . Put and Ethiopia will be subject to him .
CJB	Daniel	11	44	However , news from the east and north will frighten him , so that he moves out in great fury to ruin and completely do away with many .
CJB	Daniel	11	45	Finally , when he pitches the tents of his palace between the seas and the mountain of the holy Glory , he will come to his end , with no one to help him .
CJB	Daniel	12	12	How blessed will be anyone who waits and arrives at the 1,335 days .
CJB	Daniel	12	2	Many of those sleeping in the dust of the earth will awaken , some to everlasting life and some to everlasting shame and abhorrence .
CJB	Daniel	12	3	But those who can discern will shine like the brightness of heaven ’ s dome , and those who turn many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever .
CJB	Daniel	12	4	“ But you , Dani ’ el , keep these words secret , and seal up the book until the time of the end . Many will rush here and there as knowledge increases. ”
CJB	Daniel	12	5	Then I , Dani ’ el , looked ; and I saw in front of me two others , one on this bank of the river and the other on its other bank .
CJB	Daniel	12	6	One of them asked the man dressed in linen who was above the water of the river , “ How long will these wonders last ? ”
CJB	Daniel	12	7	The man dressed in linen who was above the water of the river raised his right and left hands toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a time , times and a half , and that it will be when the the power of the holy people is no longer being shattered that all these things will end .
CJB	Daniel	12	8	I heard this , but I couldn ’ t understand what it meant ; so I asked , “ Lord , what will be the outcome of all this ? ”
CJB	Daniel	12	9	But he said , “ Go your way , Dani ’ el ; for these words are to remain secret and sealed until the time of the end .
CJB	Daniel	12	10	Many will purify , cleanse and refine themselves ; but the wicked will keep on acting wickedly , and none of the wicked will understand . But those with discernment will understand .
CJB	Daniel	12	11	From the time the regular burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that causes desolation is set up , there will be 1,290 days .
CJB	Daniel	12	13	But you , go your way until the end comes . Then you will rest and rise for your reward , at the end of days . ”
CJB	Hosea	1	1	This is the word of Adonai that came to Hoshea the son of Be ’ eri during the reigns of ‘ Uziyah , Yotam , Achaz and Y ’ chizkiyah , kings of Y ’ hudah , and during the reign of Yarov ‘ am the son of Yo ’ ash , king of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Hosea	1	2	Adonai ’ s opening words in speaking to Hoshea were to instruct Hoshea , “ Go , marry a whore , and have children with this whore ; for the land is engaged in flagrant whoring , whoring away from Adonai. ”
CJB	Hosea	1	3	So he went and married Gomer the daughter of Divlayim , and she conceived and bore him a son .
CJB	Hosea	1	4	Adonai said to him , “ Call him Yizre ‘ el , because in only a short time I will punish the house of Yehu for having shed blood at Yizre ‘ el ; I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Hosea	1	5	When that day comes , I will break the bow of Isra ’ el in the Yizre ‘ el Valley. ”
CJB	Hosea	1	6	She conceived again and bore a daughter . Adonai said to him , “ Name her Lo-Ruchamah [ unpitied ] , for I will no longer have pity on the house of Isra ’ el . By no means will I forgive them .
CJB	Hosea	1	7	But I will pity the house of Y ’ hudah ; I will save them not by bow , sword , battle , horses or cavalry , but by Adonai their God. ”
CJB	Hosea	1	8	After weaning Lo-Ruchamah , she conceived and bore a son .
CJB	Hosea	1	9	Adonai said , “ Name him Lo- ‘ Ammi [ not-my-people ] , because you are not my people , and I will not be your [ God ] .
CJB	Hosea	2	2	) Rebuke your mother , rebuke her ; for she isn ’ t my wife , and I ’ m not her husband . She must remove her whoring from her face , and her adulteries from between her breasts .
CJB	Hosea	2	3	) Otherwise , I will strip her naked and place her as she was the day she was born , make her like a desert , place her like a dry land and kill her with thirst .
CJB	Hosea	2	1	) “ Say to your brothers , ‘ Ammi [ My People ] ! ’ and to your sisters , ‘ Ruchamah [ Pitied ] ! ’
CJB	Hosea	2	4	) I will have no pity on her children , for they are children of whoring —
CJB	Hosea	2	5	) their mother prostituted herself , she who conceived them behaved shamelessly ; she said , ‘ I will pursue my lovers , who give me my food and water , wool , flax , olive oil and wine. ’
CJB	Hosea	2	6	) Therefore , I will block her way with thorns and put up a hedge so she can ’ t find her paths .
CJB	Hosea	2	7	) She will pursue her lovers but not catch them . She will seek them but won ’ t find them . Then she will say , ‘ I will go and return to my first husband ; because things were better for me then than they are now. ’
CJB	Hosea	2	8	) For she doesn ’ t know it was I who gave her the grain , the wine and the oil ; I who increased her silver and gold , which they used for Ba ‘ al .
CJB	Hosea	2	9	) So I will take back my grain at harvest-time and my wine in its season ; I will snatch away my wool and flax , given to cover her naked body .
CJB	Hosea	2	10	) Now I will uncover her shame , while her lovers watch ; and no one will save her from me .
CJB	Hosea	2	11	) I will end her happiness , her festivals , Rosh-Hodesh , and shabbats , and all her designated times .
CJB	Hosea	2	12	) I will ravage her vines and fig trees , of which she says , ‘ These are my wages that my lovers have given me. ’ But I will turn them into a forest , and wild animals will eat them .
CJB	Hosea	2	13	) I will punish her for offering incense on the feast days of the ba ‘ alim , when she decked herself with her earrings and jewels , pursuing her lovers and forgetting me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Hosea	2	14	) “ But now I am going to woo her — I will bring her out to the desert and I will speak to her heart .
CJB	Hosea	2	15	) I will give her her vineyards from there and the Akhor Valley as a gateway to hope . She will respond there as she did when young , as she did when she came up from Egypt .
CJB	Hosea	2	16	) “ On that day , ” says Adonai “ you will call me Ishi [ My Husband ] ; you will no longer call me Ba ‘ ali [ My Master ] .
CJB	Hosea	2	17	) For I will remove the names of the ba ‘ alim from her mouth ; they will never again be mentioned by name .
CJB	Hosea	2	18	) When that day comes , I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals , the birds in the air and the creeping things of the earth . I will break bow and sword , sweep battle from the land , and make them lie down securely .
CJB	Hosea	2	19	) I will betroth you to me forever ; yes , I will betroth you to me in righteousness , in justice , in grace and in compassion ;
CJB	Hosea	2	20	) I will betroth you to me in faithfulness , and you will know Adonai .
CJB	Hosea	2	21	) When that day comes , I will answer , ” says Adonai “ I will answer the sky , and it will answer the earth ;
CJB	Hosea	2	22	) the earth will answer the corn , wine and oil , and they will answer Yizre ‘ el [ God will sow ] .
CJB	Hosea	2	23	) I will sow her for me in the land . I will have pity on Lo-Ruchamah [ Unpitied ] ; I will say to Lo- ‘ Ammi [ Not-My-People ] , ‘ You are my people ’ ; and they will say , ‘ You are my God . ’ ”
CJB	Hosea	2	24	(
CJB	Hosea	2	25	(
CJB	Hosea	3	3	Then I told her , “ You are to remain in seclusion for a long time and be mine . You are not to be a prostitute , and you are not to be with any other man ; and I won ’ t come in to have sex with you either. ”
CJB	Hosea	3	2	So I bought her back for myself with fifteen pieces of silver and eight bushels of barley .
CJB	Hosea	3	4	For the people of Isra ’ el are going to be in seclusion for a long time without a king , prince , sacrifice , standing-stone , ritual vest or household gods .
CJB	Hosea	3	5	Afterwards , the people of Isra ’ el will repent and seek Adonai their God and David their king ; they will come trembling to Adonai and his goodness in the acharit-hayamim .
CJB	Hosea	4	4	But no one should quarrel or rebuke , because your people are having to quarrel with the cohen .
CJB	Hosea	4	2	only swearing and lying , killing and stealing and committing adultery ! They break all bounds , with one blood crime following another .
CJB	Hosea	4	3	Therefore the land mourns , and everyone living there languishes , wild animals too , and the birds in the air ; even the fish in the sea are removed .
CJB	Hosea	4	5	Therefore you will stumble by day , and the prophet will stumble with you at night . “ I will destroy your mother .
CJB	Hosea	4	6	My people are destroyed for want of knowledge . Because you rejected knowledge , I will also reject you as cohen for me . Because you forgot the Torah of your God , I will also forget your children .
CJB	Hosea	4	7	The more they increased in number , the more they sinned against me . I will change their glory into shame .
CJB	Hosea	4	8	They feed on the sin of my people and are greedy for their crimes .
CJB	Hosea	4	9	But the cohen will fare no better than the people ; I will punish him for his ways and pay him back for his deeds .
CJB	Hosea	4	10	They will eat but not have enough and consort with whores but have no children , because they stopped listening to Adonai .
CJB	Hosea	4	11	Whoring and wine , both old and new , take away my people ’ s wits .
CJB	Hosea	4	12	My people consult their piece of wood , their diviner ’ s wand speaks to them ; for the spirit of whoring makes them err , they go off whoring , deserting their God .
CJB	Hosea	4	13	They sacrifice on the mountain peaks and offer incense on the hills under oaks , poplars and pistachio trees ; because they give good shade . Therefore your daughters behave like whores , And your daughters-in-law commit adultery .
CJB	Hosea	4	14	I won ’ t punish your daughters when they act like whores , or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery ; because the men are themselves going off with whores and sacrificing with prostitutes . Yes , a people without understanding will come to ruin. ”
CJB	Hosea	4	15	If you , Isra ’ el , prostitute yourself , still Y ’ hudah has no need to incur such guilt . Don ’ t go to Gilgal or up to Beit-Aven , and don ’ t swear , “ As Adonai lives. ”
CJB	Hosea	4	16	For Isra ’ el is stubborn as a stubborn cow ; will Adonai now feed them like a lamb in a big pasture ?
CJB	Hosea	4	17	Efrayim is joined to idols ; let him alone !
CJB	Hosea	4	18	When they finish carousing , they start their whoring ; their rulers deeply love dishonor .
CJB	Hosea	4	19	The wind will carry them off in its wings and their sacrifices bring them nothing but shame .
CJB	Hosea	5	5	Isra ’ el ’ s arrogance will testify in his face ; Isra ’ el and Efrayim will stumble in their crimes ; Y ’ hudah too will stumble with them .
CJB	Hosea	5	2	The rebels have deepened their slaughter , and I am rejected by all of them .
CJB	Hosea	5	3	“ I know Efrayim ; Isra ’ el is not hidden from me ; for now , Efrayim , you are a whore ; Isra ’ el is defiled. ”
CJB	Hosea	5	4	Their deeds will not allow them to return to their God , for the spirit of whoring is in them , and they don ’ t know Adonai .
CJB	Hosea	5	6	With their flocks and herds they will go in search of Adonai . But they won ’ t find him ; he has withdrawn from them .
CJB	Hosea	5	7	They have betrayed Adonai , by fathering foreign children . Now within the month the invaders will devour their lands .
CJB	Hosea	5	8	“ Blow the shofar in Giv ‘ ah , a trumpet at Ramah ; sound an alarm at Beit-Aven : ‘ Behind you , Binyamin ! ’
CJB	Hosea	5	9	Efrayim will be laid waste when the day for punishment comes ; I am announcing to the tribes of Isra ’ el what will surely happen .
CJB	Hosea	5	10	The leaders of Y ’ hudah are like men who move boundary stones ; I will pour my fury out upon them like water .
CJB	Hosea	5	11	Efrayim is oppressed , crushed by the judgment , because he deliberately sought out futility .
CJB	Hosea	5	12	Therefore I am like a moth to Efrayim and like rottenness to the house of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Hosea	5	13	When Efrayim saw his sickness and Y ’ hudah his wound , Efrayim went to Ashur and sent envoys to a warring king ; but he can ’ t heal you or cure your wound .
CJB	Hosea	5	14	For to Efrayim I will be like a lion , and like a young lion to the house of Y ’ hudah — I will tear them up and go away ; I will carry them off , and no one will rescue .
CJB	Hosea	5	15	I will go and return to my place , till they admit their guilt and search for me , seeking me eagerly in their distress . ”
CJB	Hosea	6	6	For what I desire is mercy , not sacrifices , knowledge of God more than burnt offerings .
CJB	Hosea	6	2	After two days , he will revive us ; on the third day , he will raise us up ; and we will live in his presence .
CJB	Hosea	6	3	Let us know , let us strive to know Adonai . That he will come is as certain as morning ; he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rains that water the earth .
CJB	Hosea	6	4	“ Efrayim , what should I do to you ? Y ’ hudah , what should I do to you ? For your ‘ faithful love ’ is like a morning cloud , like dew that disappears quickly .
CJB	Hosea	6	5	This is why I have cut them to pieces by the prophets , slaughtered them with the words from my mouth — the judgment on you shines out like light .
CJB	Hosea	6	7	“ But they , just like men , have broken the covenant , they have been faithless in dealing with me .
CJB	Hosea	6	8	Gil ‘ ad is a city of criminals , covered with bloody footprints ;
CJB	Hosea	6	9	just as bands of robbers wait to ambush someone , so does a gang of cohanim . They commit murder on the road to Sh ’ khem ! Their conduct is an outrage !
CJB	Hosea	6	10	In the house of Isra ’ el I have seen a horrible thing ; whoring is found there in Efrayim , Isra ’ el is defiled .
CJB	Hosea	6	11	For you , too , Y ’ hudah , a harvest will come ! “ When I restore the fortunes of my people ,
CJB	Hosea	7	7	They are all as hot as an oven , and they devour their judges . All their kings have fallen ; not one of them calls out to me .
CJB	Hosea	7	2	They never say to themselves that I remember all their evil . Now their own deeds surround them ; they are right in front of me .
CJB	Hosea	7	3	They make the king glad with their wickedness , and the leaders with their lies .
CJB	Hosea	7	4	They are all adulterers , like an oven heated by the baker , who doesn ’ t stoke the fire from kneading time till the dough has risen .
CJB	Hosea	7	5	“ On their king ’ s special day the leaders inflame him with wine , and he joins hands with scorners ,
CJB	Hosea	7	6	who ready themselves like an oven while they wait for their chance . Their baker sleeps through the night ; then in the morning it bursts into flame .
CJB	Hosea	7	8	“ Efrayim mixes himself with the peoples , Efrayim has become a half-baked cake .
CJB	Hosea	7	9	Foreigners have eaten up his strength , but he doesn ’ t know it ; yes , gray hairs appear on him here and there , but he doesn ’ t know it .
CJB	Hosea	7	10	The pride of Isra ’ el testifies in his face , but in spite of all this they haven ’ t returned to Adonai their God or sought him .
CJB	Hosea	7	11	Efrayim behaves like a silly , foolish dove — going to Egypt , then to Ashur for help .
CJB	Hosea	7	12	Even as they go , I will spread my net over them ; I will bring them down like birds from the sky ; I will discipline them , as their assembly was told .
CJB	Hosea	7	13	Woe to them ! for they have strayed from me . Destruction to them ! for they have wronged me . Am I supposed to redeem them , when they have spoken lies against me ?
CJB	Hosea	7	14	They have not cried out to me from their hearts , even though they wail on their beds . They assemble themselves for grain and wine , yet turn away from me .
CJB	Hosea	7	15	It was I who trained and strengthened their arms , yet they plot evil against me .
CJB	Hosea	7	16	They return , but not upward ; they are like an unreliable bow . Their leaders will die by the sword because of their angry talk . They will become a laughingstock in the land of Egypt .
CJB	Hosea	8	8	Isra ’ el is swallowed up ; now they are among the Goyim like a vessel nobody wants .
CJB	Hosea	8	2	Will they cry out to me , ‘ We are Isra ’ el , God , we know you ’ ?
CJB	Hosea	8	3	Isra ’ el has thrown away what is good ; the enemy will pursue him .
CJB	Hosea	8	4	They make kings , but without my authority ; they appoint leaders , but without my knowledge . With their silver and gold they make themselves idols , but these can lead only to their own destruction .
CJB	Hosea	8	5	Your calf , Shomron , has been thrown away ; my fury burns against them . How long will it be until they are able to make themselves clean ?
CJB	Hosea	8	6	Here is what Isra ’ el produces : a craftsman makes something — it ’ s a non-god ; the calf of Shomron will be broken to pieces .
CJB	Hosea	8	7	For they sow the wind , so they will reap the whirlwind . The standing grain has no ears , so it will yield no flour ; and if it does yield any , foreigners will swallow it up .
CJB	Hosea	8	9	For they have gone up to Ashur ; like a wild donkey , alone by itself , Efrayim has bargained for lovers .
CJB	Hosea	8	10	But even if they bargain among the Goyim , now I will round them up . Soon they will start to feel the burden of these kings and leaders .
CJB	Hosea	8	11	For Efrayim keeps building altars for sin ; yes , altars are sinful for him .
CJB	Hosea	8	12	I write him so many things from my Torah , yet he considers them foreign .
CJB	Hosea	8	13	They offer me sacrifices of flesh and eat them , but Adonai does not accept them . Now he will recall their crimes and punish their sins — they will return to Egypt .
CJB	Hosea	8	14	For Isra ’ el forgot his maker and built palaces ; and Y ’ hudah made more fortified cities ; but I will send fire on his cities , and it will consume their strongholds . ”
CJB	Hosea	9	9	They have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of Giv ‘ ah . He will remember their guilt , and he will punish their sins .
CJB	Hosea	9	2	Threshing-floor and winepress won ’ t feed them , and new wine will disappoint her .
CJB	Hosea	9	3	They won ’ t remain in the land of Adonai ; instead , Efrayim will return to Egypt , and they will eat unclean food in Ashur .
CJB	Hosea	9	4	They will not pour out wine offerings to Adonai ; they will not be pleasing to him . Their sacrifices will be for them like mourners ’ food — everyone eating it will be polluted . For their food will be merely to satisfy their appetite ; it will not come into the house of Adonai .
CJB	Hosea	9	5	What will you do at a designated time , on a day which is a festival for Adonai ?
CJB	Hosea	9	6	For suppose they escape the destruction — Egypt will round them up , Memphis will bury them . And their precious treasures of silver ? Nettles will possess them , thorns will be in their tents .
CJB	Hosea	9	7	The days of punishment have come , the days of retribution are here , and Isra ’ el knows it . [ Yet they cry , ] “ The prophet is a fool , the man of the spirit has gone crazy ! ” Because your iniquity is so great , the hostility [ against you ] is great .
CJB	Hosea	9	8	The watchman of Efrayim is with my God , but a prophet has a fowler ’ s snare set on all his paths and hostility even in the house of his God .
CJB	Hosea	9	10	“ When I found Isra ’ el , it was like finding grapes in the desert ; when I saw your ancestors , it was like seeing a fig tree ’ s first figs in its first season . But as soon as they came to Ba ‘ al-P ‘ or , they dedicated themselves to something shameful ; they became as loathsome as the thing they loved .
CJB	Hosea	9	11	The glory of Efrayim will fly away like a bird — no birth , no pregnancy , no conception .
CJB	Hosea	9	12	Even if they raise their children , I will destroy them till none is left — and woe to them when I leave them , too ! ”
CJB	Hosea	9	13	Efrayim , as I see it , is like Tzor , planted in a pleasant place ; but Efrayim will bring out his children to the slaughterer .
CJB	Hosea	9	14	Adonai , give them — what will you give ? Give them wombs that miscarry and dried-up breasts !
CJB	Hosea	9	15	“ All their wickedness was already there in Gilgal ; that ’ s where I came to hate them . Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will expel them from my house , I will love them no more ; all their leaders are rebels .
CJB	Hosea	9	16	Efrayim has been struck down , their root has been dried up , they will bear no fruit . Even if they do give birth , I will kill their cherished offspring. ”
CJB	Hosea	9	17	My God will cast them aside , because they wouldn ’ t listen to him , and they will become wanderers among the Goyim .
CJB	Hosea	10	10	When I wish to , I will discipline them ; and the peoples will be gathered against them to discipline them for their two crimes. ”
CJB	Hosea	10	2	Their heart is divided ; now they will bear their guilt . He will break down their altars and destroy their standing-stones .
CJB	Hosea	10	3	For now they will say , “ We have no king , because we didn ’ t fear Adonai — and what could a king do for us , anyway ? ”
CJB	Hosea	10	4	They mouth words , swearing falsely , making treaties . Thus judgment spreads like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field .
CJB	Hosea	10	5	The inhabitants of Shomron are frightened of the calf-gods of Beit-Aven . Its people mourn over it ; its priests tremble over it , over its glory , which has left it .
CJB	Hosea	10	6	It will be carried to Ashur as a present for a warring king . Efrayim will be put to shame , and Isra ’ el be ashamed of his own advice .
CJB	Hosea	10	7	Shomron ’ s king will perish like foam on the surface of the water .
CJB	Hosea	10	8	Destruction will come to the high places of Aven , that is , to the sin of Isra ’ el . Thorns and thistles will grow over their altars ; and they will say to the mountains , “ Cover us ! ” and to the hills , “ Fall on us ! ”
CJB	Hosea	10	9	“ Since the days of Giv ‘ ah you have sinned , Isra ’ el . There they took their stand . For these arrogant people at Giv ‘ ah , war was insufficient punishment .
CJB	Hosea	10	11	Efrayim is a well-taught cow — it loves to tread the grain , and I have spared her fair neck . But I will put Efrayim in harness , Y ’ hudah will have to plow , Ya ‘ akov will harrow his own land .
CJB	Hosea	10	12	If you sow righteousness for yourselves , you will reap according to grace . Break up unused ground for yourselves , because it is time to seek Adonai , till he comes and rains down righteousness upon you .
CJB	Hosea	10	13	You have plowed wickedness , reaped iniquity and eaten the fruit of lies . Because you trusted in your own way , in your large numbers of warriors ,
CJB	Hosea	10	14	turmoil will erupt among your peoples , and all your fortresses will be destroyed ; just as Shalman destroyed Beit-Arbel on the day of battle , when mothers were dashed to pieces right along with their children .
CJB	Hosea	10	15	Thus will be done to you , Beit-El , because of your great wickedness ; at dawn the king of Isra ’ el will be completely cut off .
CJB	Hosea	11	11	They will tremble like a bird as they come from Egypt , like a dove as they come from the land of Ashur ; and I will resettle them in their own houses , says Adonai .
CJB	Hosea	11	2	But the more [ the prophets ] called them , the farther they went from them . They sacrificed to the ba ‘ alim and offered incense to idols .
CJB	Hosea	11	3	“ Yet it was I who taught Efrayim to walk ; I took them by their arms . But they did not know that it was I who was healing them ,
CJB	Hosea	11	4	who was guiding them on through human means with reins made of love . With them I was like someone removing the yoke from their jaws , and I bent down to feed them .
CJB	Hosea	11	5	He will not return to the land of Egypt , but Ashur will be his king , because they refused to repent .
CJB	Hosea	11	6	The sword will fall on his cities , destroying the bars of his gates , because they follow their own advice .
CJB	Hosea	11	7	My people are hanging in suspense about returning to me ; and though they call them upwards , nobody makes a move .
CJB	Hosea	11	8	Efrayim , how can I give you up , or surrender you , Isra ’ el ? How could I treat you like Admah or make you like Tzvoyim ? My heart recoils at the idea , as compassion warms within me .
CJB	Hosea	11	9	I will not give vent to the fierceness of my rage , I will not return to destroy Efrayim ; for I am God , not a human being , the Holy One among you ; so I will not come in fury .
CJB	Hosea	11	10	They will go after Adonai , who will roar like a lion ; for he will roar , and the children will come trembling from the west .
CJB	Hosea	12	12	) Ya ‘ akov fled to the land of Aram . There Isra ’ el slaved to win a wife ; for a wife he tended sheep .
CJB	Hosea	12	2	) Adonai also has a grievance against Y ’ hudah ; he will punish Ya ‘ akov according to his ways and pay him back for his misdeeds .
CJB	Hosea	12	1	) Efrayim is chasing the wind , pursuing the wind from the east . All day he piles up lies and desolation — they make a covenant with Ashur , while sending olive oil to Egypt .
CJB	Hosea	12	3	) In the womb he took his brother by the heel ; in the strength of his manhood he fought with God .
CJB	Hosea	12	4	) Yes , he fought with an angel and won ; he wept and pleaded with him . Then at Beit-El he found him , and there he would [ later ] speak with us —
CJB	Hosea	12	5	) Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot ; Adonai is his name !
CJB	Hosea	12	6	) So you , return to your God ; hold fast to grace and justice ; and always put your hope in your God .
CJB	Hosea	12	7	) “ A huckster keeps false scales , and he loves to cheat .
CJB	Hosea	12	8	) Efrayim says , ‘ I have gotten so rich ! I have made me a fortune ! And in all my profits no one will find anything wrong or sinful. ’
CJB	Hosea	12	9	) “ But I am Adonai your God , from the land of Egypt . Again I will make you live in tents , as in the days of the established festival .
CJB	Hosea	12	10	) I have spoken to the prophets ; it was I who gave vision after vision ; through the prophets I gave examples to show what it would all be like .
CJB	Hosea	12	11	) Is Gil ‘ ad given to iniquity ? Yes , they have become worthless . In Gilgal they sacrifice to bulls ; therefore their altars are like piles of stones in a plowed field. ”
CJB	Hosea	12	13	) By a prophet Adonai brought Isra ’ el up from Egypt , and by a prophet he was protected .
CJB	Hosea	12	14	) Efrayim has given bitter provocation , so the penalty for his bloodshed will be thrown down on him , and his Lord will repay him for his insult .
CJB	Hosea	12	15	(
CJB	Hosea	13	13	The pain of being born will come to him ; but he is an unwise son . The time has come ; and he shouldn ’ t delay , there at the mouth of the womb .
CJB	Hosea	13	2	So now they keep adding sin to sin , casting images from their silver ; idols they invent for themselves , all of them the work of craftsmen . ‘ Sacrifice to them , ’ they say . Men give kisses to calves !
CJB	Hosea	13	3	Therefore they will be like a morning cloud , like the dew that disappears early , like chaff blown by wind from the threshing-floor , or like smoke that goes out the window .
CJB	Hosea	13	4	Still , I am Adonai your God , from the land of Egypt ; and you don ’ t know any God but me or , other than me , any Savior .
CJB	Hosea	13	5	I knew you in the desert , in a land of terrible drought .
CJB	Hosea	13	6	When they were fed , they were satisfied ; when satisfied , they became proud . Therefore they forgot me .
CJB	Hosea	13	7	So now I have become like a lion to them ; like a leopard I will lurk by the road ;
CJB	Hosea	13	8	I will meet them like a bear whose cubs have been taken away . I will tear their hearts from their bodies . I will devour them there like a lion , like a wild animal ripping them up .
CJB	Hosea	13	9	It is your destruction , Isra ’ el , although your help is in me .
CJB	Hosea	13	10	So now , where is your king , to save you in all your cities ? Where are your judges , of whom you said , ‘ Give me a king and leaders ’ ?
CJB	Hosea	13	11	I gave you a king in my anger ; and in my fury I took him away .
CJB	Hosea	13	12	“ Efrayim ’ s guilt has been wrapped up , his sin is stored away .
CJB	Hosea	13	14	Should I ransom them from the power of Sh ’ ol ? Should I redeem them from death ? Where are your plagues , death ; where is your destruction , Sh ’ ol ? My eyes are closed to compassion .
CJB	Hosea	13	15	For though he flourishes among the reeds , an east wind will come , a wind from Adonai , blowing up from the desert . Then his water source will dry up , then his spring will fail — it will plunder his treasury , removing every precious thing . ”
CJB	Hosea	14	14	( 13:16 ) Shomron will bear her guilt , for she has rebelled against her God . They will fall by the sword , their little ones will be dashed to pieces and their pregnant women ripped open .
CJB	Hosea	14	2	) Take words with you , and return to Adonai ; say to him , “ Forgive all guilt , and accept what is good ; we will pay instead of bulls [ the offerings of ] our lips .
CJB	Hosea	14	1	) Return , Isra ’ el , to Adonai your God , for your guilt has made you stumble .
CJB	Hosea	14	3	) Ashur will not save us , we will not ride on horses , and we will no longer call what we made with our hands our gods . For it is only in you that the fatherless can find mercy. ”
CJB	Hosea	14	4	) “ I will heal their disloyalty , I will love them freely ; for my anger has turned from him .
CJB	Hosea	14	5	) I will be like dew to Isra ’ el ; he will blossom like a lily and strike roots like the L ’ vanon .
CJB	Hosea	14	6	) His branches will spread out , his beauty be like an olive tree and his fragrance like the L ’ vanon .
CJB	Hosea	14	7	) Again they will live in his shade and raise grain ; they will blossom like a vine , and its aroma will be like the wine of the L ’ vanon .
CJB	Hosea	14	8	) Efrayim [ will say ] , ‘ What have I to do any more with idols ? ’ And I , I answer and affirm him ; I am like a fresh , green cypress tree ; your fruitfulness comes from me. ”
CJB	Hosea	14	9	) Let the wise understand these things , and let the discerning know them . For the ways of Adonai are straight , And the righteous walk in them , but in them sinners stumble .
CJB	Hosea	14	10	(
CJB	Joel	1	1	The word of Adonai that came to Yo ’ el the son of P ’ tu ’ el :
CJB	Joel	1	2	“ Hear this , you leaders ! Listen , all who live in the land ! Has anything like this ever happened in your days , or in your ancestors ’ days ?
CJB	Joel	1	3	Tell your children about it , and have them tell it to theirs , and have them tell the next generation .
CJB	Joel	1	4	What the cutter-worms left , the locusts ate ; what the locusts left , the grasshoppers ate ; what the grasshoppers left , the shearer-worms ate .
CJB	Joel	1	5	Wake up , drunkards , and weep ! wail , all you who drink wine , because the juice of the grape will be withheld from your mouth .
CJB	Joel	1	6	For a mighty and numberless nation has invaded my land . His teeth are lion ’ s teeth ; his fangs are those of a lioness .
CJB	Joel	1	7	He has reduced my vines to waste , my fig trees to splinters — he plucked them bare , stripped their bark and left their branches white. ”
CJB	Joel	1	8	Lament like a virgin wearing sackcloth for the husband of her youth !
CJB	Joel	1	9	Grain offering and drink offering are cut off from the house of Adonai . The cohanim are mourning , those who are serving Adonai .
CJB	Joel	1	10	The fields are ruined , the ground is grieving ; for the grain is ruined , the new wine dried up , and the olive oil is wretched .
CJB	Joel	1	11	Despair , you farmers ; lament , vinedressers , over the wheat and the barley — the harvest from the fields is lost .
CJB	Joel	1	12	The vines have withered , the fig trees wilted , also the pomegranate , date-palm and apple tree — all the trees in the fields have withered , and the people ’ s joy has withered away .
CJB	Joel	1	13	Cohanim , put on sackcloth , and weep ! Wail , you who serve at the altar ! Come , lie in sackcloth all night long , you who serve my God ! For the grain offering and drink offering are withheld from the house of your God .
CJB	Joel	1	14	Proclaim a holy fast , call for a solemn assembly , gather the leaders and all who live in the land to the house of Adonai your God , and cry out to Adonai ,
CJB	Joel	1	15	“ Oh no ! The Day ! The Day of Adonai is upon us ! As destruction from Shaddai it is coming !
CJB	Joel	1	16	The food is cut off before our very eyes , also joy and gladness from the house of our God .
CJB	Joel	1	17	The seed-grain is rotting in its furrows ; the granaries are deserted , the barns in ruins ; because the grain has withered .
CJB	Joel	1	18	How the animals groan ! The herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture . The flocks of sheep bear the punishment , too .
CJB	Joel	1	19	Adonai , I cry out to you ! For the fire has consumed the pastures in the desert , and the flame set ablaze all the trees in the fields .
CJB	Joel	1	20	Even the wild animals come to you , panting , because the streambeds have dried up , and fire has consumed the pastures in the desert . ”
CJB	Joel	2	2	a day of darkness and gloom , a day of clouds and thick fog ; a great and mighty horde is spreading like blackness over the mountains . There has never been anything like it , nor will there ever be again , not even after the years of many generations .
CJB	Joel	2	3	Ahead of them a fire devours , behind them a flame consumes ; ahead the land is like Gan- ‘ Eden , behind them a desert waste . From them there is no escape .
CJB	Joel	2	4	They look like horses , and like cavalry they charge .
CJB	Joel	2	5	With a rumble like that of chariots they leap over the mountaintops , like crackling flames devouring stubble , like a mighty horde in battle array .
CJB	Joel	2	6	At their presence the peoples writhe in anguish , every face is drained of color .
CJB	Joel	2	7	Like warriors they charge , they scale the wall like soldiers . Each one keeps to his own course , without getting in the other ’ s way .
CJB	Joel	2	8	They don ’ t jostle each other , but stay on their own paths ; they burst through defenses unharmed , without even breaking rank .
CJB	Joel	2	9	They rush into the city , they run along the wall , they climb up into the houses , entering like a thief through the windows .
CJB	Joel	2	10	At their advance the earth quakes , and the sky shakes , the sun and moon turn black , and the stars stop shining .
CJB	Joel	2	11	Adonai shouts orders to his forces — his army is immense , mighty , and it does what he says . For great is the Day of Adonai , fearsome , terrifying ! Who can endure it ?
CJB	Joel	2	12	“ Yet even now , ” says Adonai , “ turn to me with all your heart , with fasting , weeping and lamenting. ”
CJB	Joel	2	13	Tear your heart , not your garments ; and turn to Adonai your God . For he is merciful and compassionate , slow to anger , rich in grace , and willing to change his mind about disaster .
CJB	Joel	2	14	Who knows ? He may turn , change his mind and leave a blessing behind him , [ enough for ] grain offerings and drink offerings to present to Adonai your God .
CJB	Joel	2	15	“ Blow the shofar in Tziyon ! Proclaim a holy fast , call for a solemn assembly. ”
CJB	Joel	2	16	Gather the people ; consecrate the congregation ; assemble the leaders ; gather the children , even infants sucking at the breast ; let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride the bridal chamber .
CJB	Joel	2	17	Let the cohanim , who serve Adonai , stand weeping between the vestibule and the altar . Let them say , “ Spare your people , Adonai ! Don ’ t expose your heritage to mockery , or make them a byward among the Goyim . Why should the peoples say , ‘ Where is their God ? ’ ”
CJB	Joel	2	18	Then Adonai will become jealous for his land and have pity on his people .
CJB	Joel	2	19	Here is how Adonai will answer his people : “ I will send you grain , wine and olive oil , enough to satisfy you ; and no longer will I make you a mockery among the Goyim .
CJB	Joel	2	20	No , I will take the northerner away , far away from you , and drive him to a land that is waste and barren ; with his vanguard toward the eastern sea and his rearguard toward the western sea , his stench and his rottenness will rise , because he has done great things. ”
CJB	Joel	2	21	Don ’ t fear , O soil ; be glad ! rejoice ! for Adonai has done great things .
CJB	Joel	2	22	Don ’ t be afraid , wild animals ; for the desert pastures are green , the trees are putting out their fruit , the fig tree and vine are giving full yield .
CJB	Joel	2	23	Be glad , people of Tziyon ! rejoice in Adonai your God ! For he is giving you the right amount of rain in the fall , he makes the rain come down for you , the fall and spring rains — this is what he does first .
CJB	Joel	2	24	Then the floors will be full of grain and the vats overflow with wine and olive oil .
CJB	Joel	2	25	“ I will restore to you the years that the locusts ate , the grasshoppers , shearer-worms and cutter-worms , my great army that I sent against you .
CJB	Joel	2	26	You will eat until you are satisfied and will praise the name of Adonai your God , who has done with you such wonders . Then my people will never again be shamed .
CJB	Joel	2	27	You will know that I am with Isra ’ el and that I am Adonai your God , and that there is no other . Then my people will never again be shamed .
CJB	Joel	3	3	( 2:30 ) I will show wonders in the sky and on earth — blood , fire and columns of smoke .
CJB	Joel	3	2	( 2:29 ) and also on male and female slaves in those days I will pour out my Spirit .
CJB	Joel	3	4	( 2:31 ) The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the coming of the great and terrible Day of Adonai. ”
CJB	Joel	3	5	( 2:32 ) At that time , whoever calls on the name of Adonai will be saved . For in Mount Tziyon and Yerushalayim there will be those who escape , as Adonai has promised ; among the survivors will be those whom Adonai has called .

CJB	Amos	1	1	The words of ‘ Amos , one of the sheep owners in T ’ koa , which he saw concerning Isra ’ el in the days of ‘ Uziyah king of Y ’ hudah and Yarov ‘ am the son of Yo ’ ash , king of Isra ’ el , two years before the earthquake ;
CJB	Amos	1	2	he said : Adonai is roaring from Tziyon thundering from Yerushalayim ; the shepherds ’ pastures will mourn , and Mount Karmel ’ s summit will wither .
CJB	Amos	1	3	Here is what Adonai says : “ For Dammesek ’ s three crimes , no , four — I will not reverse it — because they threshed Gil ‘ ad with an iron-spiked threshing-sledge ;
CJB	Amos	1	4	I will send fire to the house of Haza ’ el , and it will consume the palaces of Ben-Hadad .
CJB	Amos	1	5	I will break the bars of Dammesek ’ s gates . I will cut off the inhabitants from Bik ‘ at-Aven , and him who holds the scepter from Beit- ‘ Eden . Then the people of Aram will go into exile in Kir , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	1	6	Here is what Adonai says : “ For ‘ Azah ’ s three crimes , no , four — I will not reverse it — because they exiled a whole population and handed them over to Edom ;
CJB	Amos	1	7	I will send fire to the wall of ‘ Azah , and it will consume its palaces .
CJB	Amos	1	8	I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod , and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon . I will turn my hand against ‘ Ekron , and the rest of the P ’ lishtim will perish , ” says Adonai , God .
CJB	Amos	1	9	Here is what Adonai says : “ For Tzor ’ s three crimes , no , four — I will not reverse it — because they exiled a whole population to Edom and did not remember the covenant with kinsmen ;
CJB	Amos	1	10	I will send fire to the wall of Tzor , and it will consume its palaces. ”
CJB	Amos	1	11	Here is what Adonai says : “ For Edom ’ s three crimes , no , four — I will not reverse it — because with sword he pursued his kinsman and threw aside all pity , constantly nursing his anger , forever fomenting his fury ;
CJB	Amos	1	12	I will send fire on Teman , and it will consume the palaces of Botzrah. ”
CJB	Amos	1	13	Here is what Adonai says : “ For the people of ‘ Amon ’ s three crimes , no , four — I will not reverse it — because they ripped apart pregnant women just to expand their territory ,
CJB	Amos	1	14	I will set fire to the wall of Rabbah , and it will consume its palaces amid shouts on the day of battle , amid a storm on the day of the whirlwind .
CJB	Amos	1	15	Their king will go into exile , he and his princes together , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	2	2	I will send fire on Mo ’ av , and it will consume the palaces of K ’ riot . Mo ’ av will die with turmoil and shouting , along with the sound of the shofar .
CJB	Amos	2	3	I will cut off the judge from among them and kill all his princes with him , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	2	4	Here is what Adonai says : “ For Y ’ hudah ’ s three crimes , no , four — I will not reverse it — because they rejected Adonai ’ s Torah and haven ’ t observed his laws , and their lies caused them to fall into error and live the way their ancestors did ;
CJB	Amos	2	5	I will send fire on Y ’ hudah , and it will consume the palaces of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Amos	2	6	Here is what Adonai says : “ For Isra ’ el ’ s three crimes , no , four — I will not reverse it — because they sell the upright for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes ,
CJB	Amos	2	7	grinding the heads of the poor in the dust and pushing the lowly out of the way ; father and son sleep with the same girl , profaning my holy name ;
CJB	Amos	2	8	lying down beside any altar on clothes taken in pledge ; drinking wine in the house of their God bought with fines they imposed .
CJB	Amos	2	9	“ I destroyed the Emori before them ; though tall as cedars and strong as oaks , I destroyed their fruit above and their root below .
CJB	Amos	2	10	More than that , I brought you up from Egypt , led you forty years in the desert , so that you could have the Emori ’ s land .
CJB	Amos	2	11	I raised up some of your sons to be prophets , other young men of yours to be n ’ zirim . People of Isra ’ el ! Isn ’ t that true ? ” asks Adonai .
CJB	Amos	2	12	But you gave the n ’ zirim wine to drink and ordered the prophets , ‘ Don ’ t prophesy ! ’
CJB	Amos	2	13	“ Enough ! I will make all this crush you , just as a cart overloaded with grain crushes what ’ s under it .
CJB	Amos	2	14	Even the swift won ’ t be able to flee ; the strong won ’ t be able to use their strength , the warriors won ’ t save themselves .
CJB	Amos	2	15	Archers won ’ t be able to stand , the fastest runners won ’ t save themselves , those on horses won ’ t save themselves .
CJB	Amos	2	16	On that day even the bravest warriors will throw off their weapons and flee , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	3	3	Do two people travel together without having so agreed ?
CJB	Amos	3	2	“ Of all the families on earth , only you have I intimately known . This is why I will punish you for all your crimes. ”
CJB	Amos	3	4	Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey ? Does a young lion growl in his lair if it has caught nothing ?
CJB	Amos	3	5	Does a bird get caught in a trap on the ground if it hasn ’ t been baited ? Does a trap spring up from the ground when it has taken nothing ?
CJB	Amos	3	6	When the shofar is blown in the city , don ’ t the people tremble ? Can disaster befall a city without Adonai ’ s having done it ?
CJB	Amos	3	7	Adonai , God , does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets .
CJB	Amos	3	8	The lion has roared . Who will not fear ? Adonai , God , has spoken . Who will not prophesy ?
CJB	Amos	3	9	“ Proclaim it on the palaces in Ashdod and on the palaces in the land of Egypt ; say : ‘ Assemble yourselves on the hills of Shomron ! See what great tumult is seething within it , how much oppression is being done there. ’
CJB	Amos	3	10	For they don ’ t know how to do right , ” says Adonai . “ They store up violence and robbery in their palaces. ”
CJB	Amos	3	11	Therefore , here is what Adonai Elohim says : “ An enemy will surround the land . He will strip you of your strength , and plunder your palaces. ”
CJB	Amos	3	12	This is what Adonai says :
CJB	Amos	3	13	“ As a shepherd rescues from the mouth of a lion a couple of leg bones or a piece of an ear ; so the people of Isra ’ el in Shomron will be rescued , huddled under cushions in the corners of their beds . “ Hear , and testify against the house of Ya ‘ akov , ” says Adonai Elohim Elohei-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Amos	3	14	“ For when I punish Isra ’ el ’ s crimes , I will also punish the altars of Beit-El . The horns of the altar will be cut off , and they will fall to the ground .
CJB	Amos	3	15	I will tear down winter houses as well as summer houses ; houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed ; the mansions will be no more , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	4	4	“ Come to Beit-El , and commit crimes ; to Gilgal , and commit more crimes ! Bring your sacrifices in the morning and your tithes after three days ;
CJB	Amos	4	2	Adonai Elohim has sworn by his holiness that your time is surely coming . “ You will be dragged away with hooks , the last of you with fishhooks .
CJB	Amos	4	3	You will leave through breaks in the wall , each woman right behind the next , and be sent off to Harmonah , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	4	5	burn leavened bread as a thank offering ; brag in public about your voluntary offerings ; because that ’ s what you love to do , Isra ’ el ! ” says Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Amos	4	6	“ I made your teeth clean of food in all your cities , left you nothing to eat in all your villages ; still you haven ’ t returned to me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	4	7	“ I withheld the rain from you three months before the harvest . I made it rain on one city and not on another — one field had rain , while another with no rain dried up ;
CJB	Amos	4	8	from two or three cities they would stagger to one city for water to drink , but there wasn ’ t enough ; still you haven ’ t returned to me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	4	9	“ I struck your crops with hot winds and blight , your many gardens and vineyards ; the cutter-worms devoured your fig and olive trees ; still you haven ’ t returned to me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	4	10	“ I sent a plague on you like that of Egypt , put your young men to death with the sword ; let your horses be captured ; and filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps ; still you haven ’ t returned to me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	4	11	“ I overthrew some of you , as when God overthrew S ’ dom and ‘ Amora ; you were like a burning stick snatched from the fire ; still you haven ’ t returned to me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	4	12	“ This is why I will deal with you in this way , Isra ’ el ; and because I will deal with you in this way , prepare to meet your God , Isra ’ el —
CJB	Amos	4	13	him who forms mountains and creates wind , who declares to humankind his thoughts , who turns the morning to darkness and strides on the heights of the earth — Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot is his name . ”
CJB	Amos	5	5	but don ’ t seek Beit-El , or enter Gilgal or pass on into Be ’ er-Sheva ; for Gilgal will certainly go into exile , and Beit-El will come to nothing. ”
CJB	Amos	5	2	The virgin of Isra ’ el has fallen ; she will not rise again . She lies abandoned on her own soil with no one to lift her up .
CJB	Amos	5	3	For thus says Adonai Elohim : “ The city from which a thousand marched will be left with a hundred , and the one from which a hundred marched will be left with ten from the house of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Amos	5	4	For here is what Adonai says to the house of Isra ’ el : “ If you seek me , you will survive ;
CJB	Amos	5	6	If you seek Adonai , you will survive . Otherwise , he will break out against the house of Yosef like fire , devouring Beit-El , with no one to quench the flames .
CJB	Amos	5	7	You who turn justice to bitter wormwood and throw righteousness to the ground !
CJB	Amos	5	8	He who made the Pleiades and Orion , who brings deathlike shadows over the morning , who darkens the day into night , who calls for the water in the sea and with it floods the earth — Adonai is his name —
CJB	Amos	5	9	he flashes destruction on the strong , so that destruction overcomes the fortress .
CJB	Amos	5	10	They hate anyone promoting justice at the city gate , they detest anyone who speaks the truth .
CJB	Amos	5	11	Therefore , because you trample on the poor and extort from them levies of grain ; although you have built houses of cut stone , you will not live in them ; and though you have planted pleasant vineyards , you will not drink their wine .
CJB	Amos	5	12	For I know how numerous are your crimes and how outrageous your sins — bullying the innocent , extorting ransoms pushing the poor aside at the gate .
CJB	Amos	5	13	At times like these a prudent person stays silent , for it is an evil time .
CJB	Amos	5	14	Seek good and not evil , so that you will survive . Then Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot will be with you , as you say he is .
CJB	Amos	5	15	Hate evil , love good , and uphold justice at the gate . Maybe Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot will take pity on the survivors of Yosef .
CJB	Amos	5	16	Therefore thus says Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot , Adonai : “ In all public squares there will be lamentation , in all the streets they will cry , ‘ Oh , no ! ’ They will summon farmers to mourn and professional mourners to wail .
CJB	Amos	5	17	There will be wailing in every vineyard , for I will pass through among you , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	5	18	Woe to you who want the Day of Adonai ! Why do you want it , this Day of Adonai ? It is darkness , not light ;
CJB	Amos	5	19	as if someone were to run from a lion , just to be met by a bear ; as if he entered a house , put his hand on the wall , just to be bitten by a snake .
CJB	Amos	5	20	Won ’ t the Day of Adonai be darkness , not light , completely dark , with no brightness at all ?
CJB	Amos	5	21	“ I hate , I utterly loathe your festivals ; I take no pleasure in your solemn assemblies .
CJB	Amos	5	22	If you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings , I will not accept them ; nor will I consider the peace offerings of your stall-fed cattle .
CJB	Amos	5	23	Spare me the noise of your songs ! I don ’ t want to hear the strumming of your lutes !
CJB	Amos	5	24	Instead , let justice well up like water , and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream .
CJB	Amos	5	25	Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings in the desert forty years , house of Isra ’ el ?
CJB	Amos	5	26	No , but now you will bear Sikkut as your king and Kiyun , your images , the star of your god , which you made for yourselves ;
CJB	Amos	5	27	as I exile you beyond Dammesek , ” says Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot — that is his name .
CJB	Amos	6	6	You drink wine by the bowlful and anoint yourselves with the finest oils , but feel no grief at the ruin of Yosef .
CJB	Amos	6	2	Travel to Kalneh and see ; from there go on to Hamat the great ; then go down to Gat of the P ’ lishtim . Are you better than these kingdoms ? Is their territory larger than yours ?
CJB	Amos	6	3	You put off all thought of the evil day but hasten the reign of violence .
CJB	Amos	6	4	You lie on beds of ivory and lounge sprawled out on your couches , dining on meat from lambs in the flock and from calves fattened in stalls .
CJB	Amos	6	5	You make up wild songs at your parties , playing the lute and inventing other instruments — [ imagining that you ’ re ] like David !
CJB	Amos	6	7	Therefore now they will be the first to go into exile with those being exiled , and the revelry of those who lounged , sprawling , will pass away .
CJB	Amos	6	8	“ Adonai Elohim swears by himself , ” says Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot , “ I detest that Ya ‘ akov is so proud , and I hate his palaces . I will hand over the city , along with everything in it. ”
CJB	Amos	6	9	When that day comes , if ten men remain in one house , they will die .
CJB	Amos	6	10	And if a [ dead ] man ’ s uncle , coming to bring the corpse out of the house and burn it , finds a survivor hidden in the inmost recesses of the house and asks , “ Is anyone else there with you ? ” — then , when he receives the answer , “ No , ” he will say , “ Don ’ t say any more , because we mustn ’ t mention the name of Adonai. ”
CJB	Amos	6	11	For when Adonai gives the order , great houses will be shattered and small houses reduced to rubble .
CJB	Amos	6	12	Do horses run on rock ? Does one plow there with oxen ? Yet you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into bitter wormwood .
CJB	Amos	6	13	You take pleasure in worthless things . You think your power comes from your own strength .
CJB	Amos	6	14	“ But I will raise up a nation against you , house of Isra ’ el , ” says Adonai Elohei-Tzva ’ ot , “ and they will oppress you from the entrance of Hamat to the Vadi of the ‘ Aravah . ”
CJB	Amos	7	7	Then he showed me this : Adonai was standing by a wall made with a plumbline , and he had a plumbline in his hand .
CJB	Amos	7	2	While they were finishing up eating all the vegetation in the land , I said , “ Adonai Elohim , forgive — please ! How will tiny Ya ‘ akov survive ? ”
CJB	Amos	7	3	So Adonai changed his mind about this . “ It won ’ t happen , ” Adonai said .
CJB	Amos	7	4	Next Adonai Elohim showed me this : Adonai Elohim was summoning a blazing fire to consume the great abyss , and it would have devoured the land too .
CJB	Amos	7	5	But I said , “ Adonai Elohim , stop — please ! How will tiny Ya ‘ akov survive ? ”
CJB	Amos	7	6	Adonai changed his mind about it . “ This too won ’ t happen , ” said Adonai Elohim .
CJB	Amos	7	8	Adonai asked me , “ ‘ Amos , what do you see ? ” I answered , “ A plumbline. ” Then Adonai said , “ I am going to put a plumbline in among my people Isra ’ el ; I will never again overlook their offenses .
CJB	Amos	7	9	The high places of Yitz ’ chak will be desolate , Isra ’ el ’ s sanctuaries will be destroyed , and I will attack the house of Yarov ‘ am with the sword. ”
CJB	Amos	7	10	Then Amatzyah the priest of Beit-El sent this message to Yarov ‘ am king of Isra ’ el , “ ‘ Amos is conspiring against you there among the people of Isra ’ el , and the land can ’ t bear all that he ’ s saying .
CJB	Amos	7	11	For ‘ Amos says : ‘ Yarov ‘ am will die by the sword , and Isra ’ el will be led away from their land into exile. ’ ”
CJB	Amos	7	12	Amatzyah also said to ‘ Amos , “ Go away , seer ! Go back to the land of Y ’ hudah ! Earn your living there ; and prophesy there ;
CJB	Amos	7	13	but don ’ t prophesy any more at Beit-El ; for this is the king ’ s sanctuary , a royal temple. ”
CJB	Amos	7	14	‘ Amos gave this answer to Amatzyah : “ I am not trained as a prophet , and I ’ m not one of the guild prophets — I own sheep and grow figs .
CJB	Amos	7	15	But Adonai took me away from following the flock , and Adonai said to me , ‘ Go , prophesy to my people Isra ’ el. ’
CJB	Amos	7	16	So now , hear what Adonai says : ‘ You say , “ Don ’ t prophesy against Isra ’ el , don ’ t lecture the people of Yitz ’ chak. ” ’
CJB	Amos	7	17	Therefore Adonai says this : ‘ Your wife will become a whore in the city , your sons and daughters will die by the sword , your land will be parcelled out with a measuring line , you yourself will die in an unclean land , and Isra ’ el will certainly be exiled from their land . ’ ”
CJB	Amos	8	8	Won ’ t the land tremble for this , and everyone mourn , who lives in the land ? It will all rise , just like the Nile , be in turmoil and subside , like the Nile in Egypt .
CJB	Amos	8	2	He asked , “ ‘ Amos , what do you see ? ” I answered , “ A basket of summer [ a ] fruit. ” Then Adonai said to me , “ The end [ b ] has come for my people , I will never again overlook their offenses .
CJB	Amos	8	3	When that time comes , the songs in the temple will be wailings , ” says Adonai Elohim . “ There will be many dead bodies ; everywhere silence will reign. ”
CJB	Amos	8	4	Listen , you who swallow the needy and destroy the poor of the land !
CJB	Amos	8	5	You say , “ When will Rosh-Hodesh be over , so we can market our grain ? and Shabbat , so we can sell wheat ? ” You measure the grain in a small eifah , but the silver in heavy shekels , fixing the scales , so that you can cheat ,
CJB	Amos	8	6	buying the needy for money and the poor for a pair of shoes , and sweeping up the refuse of the wheat to sell ! ”
CJB	Amos	8	7	Adonai swears by Ya ‘ akov ’ s pride , “ I will forget none of their deeds , ever .
CJB	Amos	8	9	“ When that time comes , ” says Adonai Elohim , “ I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight .
CJB	Amos	8	10	I will turn your festivals into mourning and all your songs into wailing ; I will make you all put sackcloth around your waists and shave your heads bald in grief . I will make it like mourning for an only son and its end like a bitter day .
CJB	Amos	8	11	“ The time is coming , ” says Adonai Elohim , “ when I will send famine over the land , not a famine of bread or a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of Adonai .
CJB	Amos	8	12	People will stagger from sea to sea and from north to east , running back and forth , seeking the word of Adonai ; but they will not find it .
CJB	Amos	8	13	When that time comes , young women and men will faint from thirst .
CJB	Amos	8	14	Those who swear by the sin of Shomron , who say , ‘ As your god , Dan , lives , ’ and , ‘ As the way of Be ’ er-Sheva lives ’ — they will fall and never get up again . ”
CJB	Amos	9	9	“ For when I give the order , I will shake the house of Isra ’ el , there among all the Goyim , as one shakes with a sieve , letting no grain fall to the ground .
CJB	Amos	9	2	If they dig down to Sh ’ ol , my hand will haul them out ; if they climb up to heaven , I will bring them down .
CJB	Amos	9	3	If they hide themselves on the top of the Karmel , I will search them out and capture them there ; If they hide from me at the bottom of the sea , I will order the serpent to bite them there .
CJB	Amos	9	4	If their enemies herd them into exile , I will order the sword to kill them there . I will fix my gaze on them for harm and not for good. ”
CJB	Amos	9	5	For Adonai Elohim-Tzva ’ ot is the one who can melt the earth with his touch , and make all who live on it mourn . It will all rise , just like the Nile , and then subside , like the Nile in Egypt .
CJB	Amos	9	6	He builds his upper rooms in heaven and establishes his sky-vault over the earth . He summons the waters of the sea and pours them out over the earth . Adonai is his name .
CJB	Amos	9	7	“ People of Isra ’ el , are you any different from the Ethiopians to me ? ” asks Adonai . “ True , I brought Isra ’ el up from Egypt , but I also brought the P ’ lishtim from Kaftor , and Aram from Kir .
CJB	Amos	9	8	Look , the eyes of Adonai Elohim are on the sinful kingdom . I will wipe it off the face of the earth , yet I will not completely destroy the house of Ya ‘ akov , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Amos	9	10	All the sinners among my people who say , ‘ Disaster will never overtake us or confront us , ’ will die by the sword .
CJB	Amos	9	11	“ When that day comes , I will raise up the fallen sukkah of David . I will close up its gaps , raise up its ruins and rebuild it as it used to be ,
CJB	Amos	9	12	so that Isra ’ el can possess what is left of Edom and of all the nations bearing my name , ” says Adonai , who is doing this .
CJB	Amos	9	13	“ The days will come , ” says Adonai , “ when the plowman will overtake the reaper and the one treading grapes the one sowing seed . Sweet wine will drip down the mountains , and all the hills will flow with it .
CJB	Amos	9	14	I will restore the fortunes of my people Isra ’ el ; they will rebuild and inhabit the ruined cities ; they will plant vineyards and drink their wine , cultivate gardens and eat their fruit .
CJB	Amos	9	15	I will plant them on their own soil , no more to be uprooted from their land , which I gave them , ” says Adonai your God .
CJB	Obadiah	1	1	This is the vision of ‘ Ovadyah . Here is what Adonai Elohim says about Edom . As a messenger was being sent among the nations saying , “ Come on , let ’ s attack her , ” we heard a message from Adonai :
CJB	Obadiah	1	2	“ I am making you the least of all nations , you will be beneath contempt .
CJB	Obadiah	1	3	Your proud heart has deceived you , you whose homes are caves in the cliffs , who live on the heights and say to yourselves , ‘ Who can bring me down to the ground ? ’
CJB	Obadiah	1	4	If you make your nest as high as an eagle ’ s , even if you place it among the stars , I will bring you down from there. ” says Adonai .
CJB	Obadiah	1	5	If thieves were to come to you , or if robbers by night ( Oh , how destroyed you are ! ) , wouldn ’ t they stop when they ’ d stolen enough ? If grape-pickers came to you , Wouldn ’ t they leave some grapes for gleaning ?
CJB	Obadiah	1	6	But see how ‘ Esav has been looted , their secret treasures searched out !
CJB	Obadiah	1	7	Your allies went with you only to the border , those at peace with you deceived and defeated you , those who ate your food set a trap for you , and you couldn ’ t discern it .
CJB	Obadiah	1	8	“ When that Day comes , ” says Adonai , “ won ’ t I destroy all the wise men of Edom and leave no discernment on Mount ‘ Esav ?
CJB	Obadiah	1	9	Your warriors , Teman , will be so distraught that everyone on Mount ‘ Esav will be slaughtered .
CJB	Obadiah	1	10	For the violence done to your kinsman Ya ‘ akov , shame will cover you ; and you will be forever cut off .
CJB	Obadiah	1	11	On that day you stood aside , while strangers carried off his treasure , and foreigners entered his gates to cast lots for Yerushalayim — you were no different from them .
CJB	Obadiah	1	12	You shouldn ’ t have gloated over your kinsman on their day of disaster or rejoiced over the people of Y ’ hudah on their day of destruction . You shouldn ’ t have spoken arrogantly on a day of trouble
CJB	Obadiah	1	13	or entered the gate of my people on their day of calamity — no , you shouldn ’ t have gloated over their suffering on their day of calamity or laid hands on their treasure on their day of calamity .
CJB	Obadiah	1	14	You shouldn ’ t have stood at the crossroads to cut down their fugitives or handed over their survivors on a day of trouble. ”
CJB	Obadiah	1	15	For the Day of Adonai is near for all nations ; as you did , it will be done to you ; your dealings will come back on your own head .
CJB	Obadiah	1	16	For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain , so will all the nations drink in turn ; yes , they will drink and gulp it down and be as if they had never existed .
CJB	Obadiah	1	17	But on Mount Tziyon there will be a holy remnant who will escape , and the house of Ya ‘ akov will repossess their rightful inheritance .
CJB	Obadiah	1	18	The house of Ya ‘ akov will be a fire and the house of Yosef a flame , setting aflame and consuming the stubble which is the house of ‘ Esav . None of the house of ‘ Esav will remain , for Adonai has spoken .
CJB	Obadiah	1	19	Those in the Negev will repossess the mountain of ‘ Esav , and those in the Sh ’ felah the land of the P ’ lishtim ; they will repossess the field of Efrayim and the field of Shomron , and Binyamin will occupy Gil ‘ ad .
CJB	Obadiah	1	20	Those from this army of the people of Isra ’ el exiled among the Kena ‘ anim as far away as Tzarfat , and the exiles from Yerushalayim in S ’ farad , will repossess the cities in the Negev .
CJB	Obadiah	1	21	Then the victorious will ascend Mount Tziyon to rule over Mount ‘ Esav , but the kingship will belong to Adonai .
CJB	Jonah	1	1	The word of Adonai came to Yonah the son of Amitai :
CJB	Jonah	1	2	“ Set out for the great city of Ninveh , and proclaim to it that their wickedness has come to my attention. ”
CJB	Jonah	1	3	But Yonah , in order to get away from Adonai , prepared to escape to Tarshish . He went down to Yafo , found a ship headed for Tarshish , paid the fare and went aboard , intending to travel with them to Tarshish and get away from Adonai .
CJB	Jonah	1	4	However , Adonai let loose over the sea a violent wind , which created such stormy conditions that the ship threatened to break to pieces .
CJB	Jonah	1	5	The sailors were frightened , and each cried out to his god . They threw the cargo overboard to make the ship easier for them to control . Meanwhile , Yonah had gone down below into the hold , where he lay , fast asleep .
CJB	Jonah	1	6	The ship ’ s captain found him and said to him , “ What do you mean by sleeping ? Get up ! Call on your god ! Maybe the god will remember us , and we won ’ t die. ”
CJB	Jonah	1	7	Then they said to each other , “ Come , let ’ s draw lots to find out who is to blame for this calamity. ” They drew lots , and Yonah was singled out .
CJB	Jonah	1	8	They said to him , “ Tell us now , why has this calamity come upon us ? What work do you do ? Where are you from ? What is your country ? Which is your people ? ”
CJB	Jonah	1	9	He answered them , “ I am a Hebrew ; and I fear Adonai , the God of heaven , who made both the sea and the dry land. ”
CJB	Jonah	1	10	At this the men grew very afraid and said to him , “ What is this that you have done ? ” For the men knew he was trying to get away from Adonai , since he had told them .
CJB	Jonah	1	11	They asked him , “ What should we do to you , so that the sea will be calm for us ? ” — for the sea was getting rougher all the time .
CJB	Jonah	1	12	“ Pick me up , ” he told them , “ and throw me into the sea . Then the sea will be calm for you ; because I know it ’ s my fault that this terrible storm has come over you. ”
CJB	Jonah	1	13	Nevertheless , the men rowed hard , trying to reach the shore . But they couldn ’ t , because the sea kept growing wilder against them .
CJB	Jonah	1	14	Finally they cried to Adonai , “ Please , Adonai , please ! Don ’ t let us perish for causing the death of this man , and don ’ t hold us to account for shedding innocent blood ; because you , Adonai , have done what you saw fit. ”
CJB	Jonah	1	15	Then they picked up Yonah and threw him into the sea , and the sea stopped raging .
CJB	Jonah	1	16	Seized with great fear of Adonai , they offered a sacrifice to Adonai and made vows .
CJB	Jonah	2	2	) he said , “ Out of my distress I called to Adonai , and he answered me ; from the belly of Sh ’ ol I cried , and you heard my voice .
CJB	Jonah	2	1	) From the belly of the fish Yonah prayed to Adonai his God ;
CJB	Jonah	2	3	) For you threw me into the deep , into the heart of the seas ; and the flood enveloped me ; all your surging waves passed over me .
CJB	Jonah	2	4	) I thought , ‘ I have been banished from your sight. ’ But I will again look at your holy temple .
CJB	Jonah	2	5	) The water surrounded me , threatened my life ; the deep closed over me , seaweed twined around my head .
CJB	Jonah	2	6	) I was going down to the bottoms of the mountains , to a land whose bars would close me in forever ; but you brought me up alive from the pit , Adonai , my God !
CJB	Jonah	2	7	) As my life was ebbing away , I remembered Adonai ; and my prayer came in to you , into your holy temple .
CJB	Jonah	2	8	) “ Those who worship vain idols give up their source of mercy ;
CJB	Jonah	2	9	) but I , speaking my thanks aloud , will sacrifice to you ; what I have vowed , I will pay . Salvation comes from Adonai ! ”
CJB	Jonah	2	10	) Then Adonai spoke to the fish , and it vomited Yonah out onto dry land .
CJB	Jonah	2	11	(
CJB	Jonah	3	3	So Yonah set out and went to Ninveh , as Adonai had said . Now Ninveh was such a large city that it took three days just to cross it .
CJB	Jonah	3	2	“ Set out for the great city of Ninveh , and proclaim to it the message I will give you. ”
CJB	Jonah	3	4	Yonah began his entry into the city and had finished only his first day of proclaiming , ‘ In forty days Ninveh will be overthrown , ’
CJB	Jonah	3	5	when the people of Ninveh believed God . They proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them to the least .
CJB	Jonah	3	6	When the news reached the king of Ninveh , he got up from his throne , took off his robe , put on sackcloth and sat in ashes .
CJB	Jonah	3	7	He then had this proclamation made throughout Ninveh : “ By decree of the king and his nobles , no person or animal , herd or flock , is to put anything in his mouth ; they are neither to eat nor drink water .
CJB	Jonah	3	8	They must be covered with sackcloth , both people and animals ; and they are to cry out to God with all their might — let each of them turn from his evil way and from the violence they practice .
CJB	Jonah	3	9	Who knows ? Maybe God will change his mind , relent and turn from his fierce anger ; and then we won ’ t perish. ”
CJB	Jonah	3	10	When God saw by their deeds that they had turned from their evil way , he relented and did not bring on them the punishment he had threatened .
CJB	Jonah	4	4	Adonai asked , “ Is it right for you to be so angry ? ”
CJB	Jonah	4	2	He prayed to Adonai , “ Now , Adonai , didn ’ t I say this would happen , when I was still in my own country ? That ’ s why I tried to get away to Tarshish ahead of time ! I knew you were a God who is merciful and compassionate , slow to anger and rich in grace , and that you relent from inflicting punishment .
CJB	Jonah	4	3	Therefore , Adonai , please , just take my life away from me ; it ’ s better for me to be dead than alive ! ”
CJB	Jonah	4	5	Yonah left the city and found a place east of the city , where he made himself a shelter and sat down under it , in its shade , to see what would happen to the city .
CJB	Jonah	4	6	Adonai , God , prepared a castor-bean plant and made it grow up over Yonah to shade his head and relieve his discomfort . So Yonah was delighted with the castor-bean plant .
CJB	Jonah	4	7	But at dawn the next day God prepared a worm , which attacked the castor-bean plant , so that it dried up .
CJB	Jonah	4	8	Then , when the sun rose , God prepared a scorching east wind ; and the sun beat down on Yonah ’ s head so hard that he grew faint and begged that he could die , saying , “ I would be better off dead than alive. ”
CJB	Jonah	4	9	God asked Yonah , “ Is it right for you to be so angry about the castor-bean plant ? ” He answered , “ Yes , it ’ s right for me to be so angry that I could die ! ”
CJB	Jonah	4	10	Adonai said , “ You ’ re concerned over the castor-bean plant , which cost you no effort ; you didn ’ t make it grow ; it came up in a night and perished in a night .
CJB	Jonah	4	11	So shouldn ’ t I be concerned about the great city of Ninveh , in which there are more than 120,000 people who don ’ t know their right hand from their left — not to mention all the animals ? ”
CJB	Micah	1	1	This is the word of Adonai that came to Mikhah the Morashti during the days of Yotam , Achaz and Y ’ chizkiyah , kings of Y ’ hudah , which he saw concerning Shomron and Yerushalayim :
CJB	Micah	1	2	Listen , peoples , all of you ! Pay attention , earth , and everything in it ! Adonai Elohim will witness against you , Adonai , from his holy temple .
CJB	Micah	1	3	For — look ! — Adonai is coming out of his place , coming down to tread on the high places of the land .
CJB	Micah	1	4	Beneath him the mountains will melt , the valleys split open like wax before fire , like water poured down a steep slope .
CJB	Micah	1	5	All this is because of the crime of Ya ‘ akov and the sins of the house of Isra ’ el . What is the crime of Ya ‘ akov ? Isn ’ t it Shomron ? And what are the high places of Y ’ hudah ? Aren ’ t they Yerushalayim ?
CJB	Micah	1	6	“ So I will make Shomron a heap in the countryside , a place for planting vineyards ; I will pour her stones down into the valley , laying bare her foundations .
CJB	Micah	1	7	All her carved images will be smashed to pieces , all she earned consumed by fire ; and I will reduce her idols to rubble . She amassed them from a whore ’ s wages , and as a whore ’ s wages they will be spent again. ”
CJB	Micah	1	8	This is why I howl and wail , why I go barefoot and stripped , why I howl like the jackals and mourn like the ostriches .
CJB	Micah	1	9	For her wound can not be healed , and now it is coming to Y ’ hudah as well ; it reaches even to the gate of my people , to Yerushalayim itself .
CJB	Micah	1	10	Don ’ t tell about it in Gat , don ’ t shed any tears . At Beit-L ‘ afrah [ house of dust ] roll yourself in the dust .
CJB	Micah	1	11	Inhabitants of Shafir , pass on your way in nakedness and shame . The inhabitants of Tza ’ anan have not left yet . The wailing of Beit-Ha ’ etzel will remove from you their support .
CJB	Micah	1	12	The inhabitants of Marot have no hope of anything good ; for Adonai has sent down disaster to the very gate of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Micah	1	13	Harness the chariots to the fastest horses , inhabitants of Lakhish ; she was the beginning of sin for the daughter of Tziyon ; for the crimes of Isra ’ el are traceable to you .
CJB	Micah	1	14	Therefore you must bestow parting gifts upon Moreshet-Gat . The houses of Akhziv will disappoint the kings of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Micah	1	15	Inhabitants of Mareshah , I have yet to bring you the one who will [ invade and ] possess you . The glory of Isra ’ el will come to ‘ Adulam .
CJB	Micah	1	16	Shave the hair from your head as you mourn for the children who were your delight ; make yourselves as bald as vultures , for they have gone from you into exile .
CJB	Micah	2	2	They covet fields and seize them ; they take over houses as well , doing violence to both owner and house , to people and their inherited land .
CJB	Micah	2	3	Therefore this is what Adonai says : “ Against this family I am planning an evil from which you will not withdraw your necks ; nor will you walk with your heads held high , for it will be an evil time. ”
CJB	Micah	2	4	On that day they will take up a dirge for you ; sadly lamenting , they will wail , “ We are completely ruined ! Our people ’ s land has changed hands . Our fields are taken away from us ; instead of restoring them , he parcels them out. ”
CJB	Micah	2	5	Therefore , you will have no one in the assembly of Adonai to stretch out a measuring line and restore the land assigned by lot .
CJB	Micah	2	6	“ Don ’ t preach ! ” — thus they preach ! “ They shouldn ’ t preach about these things . Shame will not overtake us ” —
CJB	Micah	2	7	is this what the house of Ya ‘ akov says ? Adonai has not grown impatient , and these things are not his doings . “ Rather , my words do only good to anyone living uprightly .
CJB	Micah	2	8	But lately my people behave like an enemy , stripping both cloaks and tunics from travelers who thought they were secure , so that they become like war refugees .
CJB	Micah	2	9	You throw my people ’ s women out of the homes they love . You deprive their children of my glory forever .
CJB	Micah	2	10	Get up and go ! You can ’ t stay here ! Because [ the land ] is now unclean , it will destroy you with a grievous destruction. ”
CJB	Micah	2	11	If a man who walks in wind and falsehood tells this lie : “ I will preach to you of [ how good it is to drink ] wine and strong liquor ” — this people will accept him as their preacher !
CJB	Micah	2	12	“ I will assemble all of you , Ya ‘ akov ; I will gather the remnant of Isra ’ el , I will put them together like sheep in a pen , like a herd in its pasture — it will hum with the sounds of people. ”
CJB	Micah	2	13	The one breaking through went up before them ; they broke through , passed the gate and went out . Their king passed on before them ; Adonai was leading them .
CJB	Micah	3	3	you eat the flesh of my people , skin them alive , break their bones ; yes , they chop them in pieces , like flesh in a caldron , like meat in a pot. ’ ”
CJB	Micah	3	2	Yet you hate what is good and love what is bad . You strip off their skin from them and their flesh from their bones ,
CJB	Micah	3	4	Then they will call to Adonai , but he will not answer them ; when that time comes , he will hide his face from them , because their deeds were so wicked .
CJB	Micah	3	5	Here is what Adonai says in regard to the prophets who cause my people to go astray , who cry , “ Peace ” as soon as they are given food to eat but prepare war against anyone who fails to put something in their mouths :
CJB	Micah	3	6	“ Therefore you will have night , not vision , darkness and not divination ; the sun will go down on the prophets , over them the day will be black. ”
CJB	Micah	3	7	The seers will be put to shame , the diviners will be disgraced . They will have to cover their mouths , because there will be no answer from God .
CJB	Micah	3	8	On the other hand , I am full of power by the Spirit of Adonai , full of justice and full of might , to declare to Ya ‘ akov his crime , to Isra ’ el his sin .
CJB	Micah	3	9	Hear this , please , leaders of the house of Ya ‘ akov , rulers of the house of Isra ’ el , you who abhor what is just and pervert anything that is right ,
CJB	Micah	3	10	who build up Tziyon with blood and Yerushalayim with wickedness .
CJB	Micah	3	11	Her leaders sell verdicts for bribes , her cohanim teach for a price , her prophets divine for money — yet they claim to rely on Adonai ! “ Isn ’ t Adonai here with us ? ” they say . “ No evil can come upon us. ”
CJB	Micah	3	12	Therefore , because of you , Tziyon will be plowed under like a field , Yerushalayim will become heaps of ruins , and the mountain of the house like a forested height .
CJB	Micah	4	4	Instead , each person will sit under his vine and fig tree , with no one to upset him , for the mouth of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot has spoken .
CJB	Micah	4	2	Many Gentiles will go and say , “ Come , let ’ s go up to the mountain of Adonai , to the house of the God of Ya ‘ akov ! He will teach us about his ways , and we will walk in his paths. ” For out of Tziyon will go forth Torah , the word of Adonai from Yerushalayim .
CJB	Micah	4	3	He will judge between many peoples and arbitrate for many nations far away . Then they will hammer their swords into plow-blades and their spears into pruning-knives ; nations will not raise swords at each other , and they will no longer learn war .
CJB	Micah	4	5	For all the peoples will walk , each in the name of its god ; but we will walk in the name of Adonai our God forever and ever .
CJB	Micah	4	6	“ When that day comes , ” says Adonai , “ I will assemble the lame and gather those who were dispersed , along with those I afflicted .
CJB	Micah	4	7	I will make the lame a remnant and those who were driven off a strong nation. ” Adonai will rule them on Mount Tziyon from that time forth and forever .
CJB	Micah	4	8	You , tower of the flock , hill of the daughter of Tziyon , to you your former sovereignty will return , the royal power of the daughter of Yerushalayim .
CJB	Micah	4	9	Why are you now crying out ? Don ’ t you have a king ? Has your counselor been destroyed , that you are seized with pain like a woman in labor ?
CJB	Micah	4	10	Be in pain ! Work to give birth like a woman in labor , daughter of Tziyon ! For now you will go out of the city and live in the wilds till you reach Bavel . There you will be rescued ; there Adonai will redeem you from the power of your enemies .
CJB	Micah	4	11	Now many nations have gathered against you ; they say , “ Let her be defiled , let ’ s gloat over Tziyon. ”
CJB	Micah	4	12	But they don ’ t know the thoughts of Adonai , they don ’ t understand his plan ; for he has gathered them like sheaves on the threshing-floor .
CJB	Micah	4	13	Get up ! Start threshing , daughter of Tziyon ! “ For I will make your horns like iron and your hoofs like bronze. ” You will crush many peoples and devote their plunder to Adonai , their wealth to the Lord of all the earth .
CJB	Micah	4	14	( 5:1 ) Now gather yourself in troops , you who are accustomed to being in troops ; they have laid siege to us . They are striking the judge of Isra ’ el on the cheek with a stick .

CJB	Micah	6	2	Listen , mountains , to Adonai ’ s case ; also you enduring rocks that support the earth ! Adonai has a case against his people ; he wants to argue it out with Isra ’ el :
CJB	Micah	6	3	“ My people , what have I done to you ? How have I wearied you ? Answer me !
CJB	Micah	6	4	I brought you up from the land of Egypt . I redeemed you from a life of slavery . I sent Moshe , Aharon and Miryam to lead you .
CJB	Micah	6	5	My people , just remember what Balak the king of Mo ’ av had planned , what Bil ‘ am the son of B ‘ or answered him , [ and what happened ] between Sheetim and Gilgal — so that you will understand the saving deeds of Adonai. ”
CJB	Micah	6	7	Would Adonai take delight in thousands of rams with ten thousand rivers of olive oil ? Could I give my firstborn to pay for my crimes , the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ? ”
CJB	Micah	6	8	Human being , you have already been told what is good , what Adonai demands of you — no more than to act justly , love grace and walk in purity with your God .
CJB	Micah	6	9	The voice of Adonai ! He calls to the city — and it is wisdom to fear your name — “ Listen to the rod and to him who commissioned it .
CJB	Micah	6	10	Are there still ill-gotten gains in the house of the wicked ? still the detestable short eifah-measure ?
CJB	Micah	6	11	Should I declare innocent wicked scales and a bag of fraudulent weights ?
CJB	Micah	6	12	The rich men there are full of violence , the inhabitants tell lies , with tongues of deceit in their mouths .
CJB	Micah	6	13	“ Therefore , I am starting to strike you down , to destroy you because of your sins .
CJB	Micah	6	14	You will eat but not be satisfied , with hunger gnawing inside you . You will conceive but not give birth ; if you do give birth , I will give him to the sword .
CJB	Micah	6	15	You will sow but will not reap , you will press olives but not rub yourself with oil , likewise you will press grapes but not drink the wine .
CJB	Micah	6	16	For you keep the regulations of ‘ Omri and all the practices of the house of Ach ’ av , modeling yourselves on their advice . Therefore I will make you an object of horror , the inhabitants of this city a cause for contempt ; you will suffer the insults aimed at my people . ”
CJB	Micah	7	7	But as for me , I will look to Adonai , I will wait for the God of my salvation ; my God will hear me .
CJB	Micah	7	2	The godly have been destroyed from the land , there is no one upright among humankind . They all lie in wait for blood , each hunts his brother with a net .
CJB	Micah	7	3	Their hands do evil well . The prince makes his request , the judge grants it for a price , and the great man expresses his evil desires — thus they weave it together .
CJB	Micah	7	4	The best of them is a briar , the most upright worse than a thorn hedge . The time of your watchmen — of your punishment — has come ; now they will be confused .
CJB	Micah	7	5	Don ’ t trust in your neighbor ; don ’ t put confidence in a close friend ; shut the gates of your mouth even from [ your wife ] , lying there with you in bed .
CJB	Micah	7	6	For a son insults his father , a daughter rises against her mother , daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law — a person ’ s enemies are the members of his own household .
CJB	Micah	7	8	Enemies of mine , don ’ t gloat over me ! Although I have fallen , I will rise ; though I live in the dark , Adonai is my light .
CJB	Micah	7	9	I will endure Adonai ’ s rage , because I sinned against him ; until he pleads my cause and judges in my favor . Then he will bring me out to the light , and I will see his justice .
CJB	Micah	7	10	My enemies will see it too , and shame will cover those who said to me , “ Where is Adonai your God ? ” I will gloat over them , as they are trampled underfoot like mud in the streets .
CJB	Micah	7	11	That will be the day for rebuilding your walls , a day for expanding your territory ,
CJB	Micah	7	12	a day when [ your ] people will come [ back ] to you from Ashur and from the cities of Egypt , from Egypt and from as far as the Euphrates River , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
CJB	Micah	7	13	The earth will be desolate for those living in it , as a result of their deeds .
CJB	Micah	7	14	Shepherd your people with your staff , the flock that belongs to you , who live alone , like a forest in the middle of a fertile pasture . Let them feed in Bashan and Gil ‘ ad , as they did in days of old .
CJB	Micah	7	15	“ As in the days when you came out of Egypt , I will show them wonders. ”
CJB	Micah	7	16	The nations will see and be put to shame , in spite of all their power . They will cover their mouths with their hands , and their ears will be deafened .
CJB	Micah	7	17	They will lick the dust like snakes ; they will emerge from their fortresses trembling like reptiles that crawl about on the earth ; they will come with fear to Adonai our God , afraid because of you .
CJB	Micah	7	18	Who is a God like you , pardoning the sin and overlooking the crimes of the remnant of his heritage ? He does not retain his anger forever , because he delights in grace .
CJB	Micah	7	19	He will again have compassion on us , he will subdue our iniquities . You will throw all their sins into the depths of the sea .
CJB	Micah	7	20	You will show truth to Ya ‘ akov and grace to Avraham , as you have sworn to our ancestors since days of long ago .
CJB	Nahum	1	1	This is a prophecy about Ninveh , the book of the vision of Nachum the Elkoshi :
CJB	Nahum	1	2	Adonai is a jealous and vengeful God . Adonai avenges ; he knows how to be angry . Adonai takes vengeance on his foes and stores up wrath for his enemies .
CJB	Nahum	1	3	Adonai is slow to anger , but great in power ; and he does not leave the guilty unpunished . Adonai ’ s path is in the whirlwind and storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
CJB	Nahum	1	4	He rebukes the sea and leaves it dry , he dries up all the rivers . Bashan and the Karmel languish ; the flower of the L ’ vanon withers .
CJB	Nahum	1	5	The mountains quake before him , and the hills dissolve ; the earth collapses in his presence , the world and everyone living in it .
CJB	Nahum	1	6	Who can withstand his fury ? Who can endure his fierce anger ? His wrath is poured out like fire , the rocks broken to pieces before him .
CJB	Nahum	1	7	Adonai is good , a stronghold in time of trouble ; he takes care of those who take refuge in him .
CJB	Nahum	1	8	But with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of [ Ninveh ’ s ] place , and darkness will pursue his enemies .
CJB	Nahum	1	9	What are you planning against Adonai ? He is making an end [ of it ] ; trouble will not arise a second time .
CJB	Nahum	1	10	For like men drunk with liquor , they will be burned up like tangled thorns , like straw completely dry .
CJB	Nahum	1	11	Out of you , [ Ninveh , ] he came , one who plots evil against Adonai , who counsels wickedness .
CJB	Nahum	1	12	Here is what Adonai says : “ Though they be many and strong , they will be cut down , they will pass ; and though I have made you suffer , I will make you suffer no more .
CJB	Nahum	1	13	Now I will break his yoke from your necks and snap the chains that bind you .
CJB	Nahum	1	14	Adonai gave this order concerning you : you will have no descendants to bear your name ; from the house of your god I will cut off carved image and cast metal image ; I will prepare your grave , because you are worthless . ”
CJB	Nahum	2	2	) For Adonai is restoring the pride of Ya ‘ akov , along with the pride of Isra ’ el ; because plunderers have plundered them and ravaged their vines .
CJB	Nahum	2	1	) A destroyer has risen in front of your face ; guard the ramparts , keep watch on the road , brace yourselves , marshall all your strength .
CJB	Nahum	2	3	) The shields of [ Ninveh ’ s ] warriors are [ dyed ] red ; the soldiers are wearing scarlet . The steel of the chariots flashes like fire as they prepare for battle . The cypress [ spears ] are poisoned .
CJB	Nahum	2	4	) The chariots rush madly about in the streets , jostling each other in the open places ; their appearance is like torches , they run here and there like lightning .
CJB	Nahum	2	5	) [ The king of Ninveh ] assigns his officers ; they stumble as they march ; they hurry to its wall and set up shields to protect the battering ram .
CJB	Nahum	2	6	) The gates of the rivers are opened , and the palace melts away .
CJB	Nahum	2	7	) Its mistress is stripped and carried away ; her handmaids moan , they sound like doves , as they beat their breasts .
CJB	Nahum	2	8	) Ninveh is like a pool whose water ebbs away . “ Stop ! Stop ! ” But none of it goes back .
CJB	Nahum	2	9	) Plunder the silver ! Plunder the gold ! There is no end to the treasure , weighed down with precious things .
CJB	Nahum	2	10	) She is void , vacant ; she is made bare . Hearts are melting , knees are knocking ; every stomach is churning , every face is drained of color .
CJB	Nahum	2	11	) What has become of the lion ’ s den , the cave where the young lions fed , where lion and lioness walked with their cubs , and no one made them afraid ?
CJB	Nahum	2	12	) The lion would tear up food for his cubs and strangle prey for his lionesses ; he used to fill his caves with prey , his lairs with torn flesh .
CJB	Nahum	2	13	) “ I am against you , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . “ Her chariots I will send up in smoke , the sword will consume your lion cubs , I will destroy your prey from the earth , and your envoys ’ voices will be heard no more . ”
CJB	Nahum	2	14	(
CJB	Nahum	3	3	cavalry charging , swords flashing , spears glittering — and hosts of slain , heaps of bodies ; there is no end to the corpses ; they stumble over their corpses .
CJB	Nahum	3	2	The crack of the whip ! The rattle of wheels ! Galloping horses , jolting chariots ,
CJB	Nahum	3	4	“ Because of the continual whoring of this whore , this alluring mistress of sorcery , who sells nations with her whoring and families with her sorcery ;
CJB	Nahum	3	5	I am against you , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . “ I will uncover your skirts on your face ; I will show the nations your private parts and the kingdoms your shame .
CJB	Nahum	3	6	I will pelt you with disgusting filth , disgrace you and make a spectacle of you .
CJB	Nahum	3	7	Then all who see you will recoil from you ; they will say , ‘ Ninveh is destroyed ! ’ Who will mourn for her ? Where can I find people to comfort you ? ”
CJB	Nahum	3	8	Are you any better than No-Amon , located among the streams of the Nile , with water all around her , the flood her wall of defense ?
CJB	Nahum	3	9	Ethiopia and Egypt gave her boundless strength , Put and Luvim were there to help you .
CJB	Nahum	3	10	Still she went captive into exile , her infants torn to pieces at every streetcorner . Lots were drawn for her nobles , and all her great men were bound in chains .
CJB	Nahum	3	11	You too , [ Ninveh , ] will be drunk ; your senses completely overcome . You too will seek a refuge from the enemy .
CJB	Nahum	3	12	All your fortifications will be like fig trees with early ripening figs ; the moment they are shaken , they fall into the mouth of the eater .
CJB	Nahum	3	13	Look at your troops ! They behave like women ! Your country ’ s gates are wide open to your foes ; fire has consumed their bars .
CJB	Nahum	3	14	Draw water for the siege ! Strengthen your fortifications ! Go down in the clay , tread the mortar , Take hold of the mold for bricks !
CJB	Nahum	3	15	There the fire will burn you up ; and the sword will cut you down ; it will devour you like grasshoppers . Make yourselves as many as grasshoppers , Make yourselves as many as locusts !
CJB	Nahum	3	16	You had more merchants than stars in the sky . The locust sheds its skin and flies away .
CJB	Nahum	3	17	Your guards are like grasshoppers , your marshals like swarms of locusts , which settle on the walls on a cold day , but when the sun rises they fly away ; they vanish to no one knows where .
CJB	Nahum	3	18	Your shepherds are slumbering , king of Ashur . Your leaders are asleep . Your people are scattered all over the mountains , with no one to round them up .
CJB	Nahum	3	19	Your wound can not be healed . Your injury is fatal . Everyone hearing the news about you claps his hands in joy over you . For who has not been overwhelmed by your relentless cruelty ?
CJB	Habakkuk	1	1	This is the prophecy which Havakuk the prophet saw :
CJB	Habakkuk	1	2	Adonai , how long must I cry without your hearing ? “ Violence ! ” I cry to you , but you don ’ t save .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	3	Why do you make me see wrongdoing , why do you permit oppression ? Pillage and cruelty confront me , so that strife and discord prevail .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	4	Therefore Torah is not followed ; justice never gets rendered , because the wicked fence in the righteous . This is why justice comes out perverted .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	5	“ Look around among the nations ! What you see will completely astound you ! For what is going to be done in your days you will not believe , even when you are told .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	6	I am raising up the Kasdim , that bitter and impetuous nation , who march far and wide over the earth to seize homes that are not their own .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	7	Fearsome and dreadful they are ; their rules and strength come from themselves .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	8	Their horses are swifter than leopards , fiercer than wolves at night . Their cavalry gallop in from afar , flying like vultures rushing to feed .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	9	All of them come for violence , their faces set eagerly forward , scooping up captives like sand .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	10	They scoff at kings ; princes they deride . They laugh at any fortress ; they pile up earth and take it .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	11	Then they sweep on like the wind , but they become guilty , because they make their strength their god. ”
CJB	Habakkuk	1	12	Adonai , haven ’ t you existed forever ? My God , my holy one , we will not die . Adonai , you appointed them to execute judgment . Rock , you commissioned them to correct us .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	13	Your eyes are too pure to see evil , you can not countenance oppression . So why do you countenance traitors ? Why are you silent when evil people swallow up those more righteous than they ?
CJB	Habakkuk	1	14	You make people like fish in the sea , like reptiles that have no ruler .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	15	The evil haul them all up with their hooks , catch them in their fish net , or gather them in their dragnet . Then they rejoice and make merry ,
CJB	Habakkuk	1	16	offering sacrifices to their fishnet and burning incense to their dragnet ; because through them they live in luxury , with plenty of food to eat .
CJB	Habakkuk	1	17	Should they , therefore , keep emptying their nets ? Should they keep slaughtering the nations without pity ?
CJB	Habakkuk	2	2	Then Adonai answered me ; he said , “ Write down the vision clearly on tablets , so that even a runner can read it .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	3	For the vision is meant for its appointed time ; it speaks of the end , and it does not lie . It may take a while , but wait for it ; it will surely come , it will not delay .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	4	“ Look at the proud : he is inwardly not upright ; but the righteous will attain life through trusting faithfulness .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	5	Truly , wine is treacherous ; the arrogant will not live at peace but keeps expanding his desires like Sh ’ ol ; like death , he can never be satisfied ; he keeps collecting all the nations for himself , rallying to himself all the peoples .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	6	Won ’ t all these take up taunting him and say about him , in mocking riddles , ‘ Woe to him who amasses other people ’ s wealth ! — how long must it go on ? — and to him who adds to himself the weight of goods taken in pledge !
CJB	Habakkuk	2	7	Won ’ t your own creditors suddenly stand , won ’ t those who make you tremble wake up ? You will become their spoil .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	8	Because you plundered many nations , all the rest of the peoples will plunder you ; because of the bloodshed and violence done to the land , the city and all who live there .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	9	“ ‘ Woe to him who seeks unjust gain for his household , putting his nest on the heights , in order to be safe from the reach of harm .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	10	By scheming to destroy many peoples , you have brought shame to your house and forfeited your life .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	11	For the very stones will cry out from the wall , and a beam in the framework will answer them .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	12	“ ‘ Woe to him who builds a city with blood and founds a town on injustice ,
CJB	Habakkuk	2	13	so that people toil for what will be burned up , and nations exhaust themselves to no purpose . Isn ’ t all this from Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ?
CJB	Habakkuk	2	14	For the earth will be as full of the knowledge of Adonai ’ s glory as water covering the sea .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	15	“ ‘ Woe to him who has his neighbor drink , adds his own poison and makes him drunk , in order to see him naked .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	16	You are filled with shame , not glory . You , drink too , and stagger ! The cup of Adonai ’ s right hand will be turned against you ; your shame will exceed your glory .
CJB	Habakkuk	2	17	For the violence done to the L ’ vanon will overwhelm you , and the destruction of the wild animals will terrify you ; because of the bloodshed and violence done to the land , the city and all who live there. ’ ”
CJB	Habakkuk	2	18	What good is an idol , once its maker has shaped it , a cast metal image and a teacher of lies , that its maker puts his trust in it , and goes on making non-gods , unable to talk ?
CJB	Habakkuk	2	19	Woe to him who tells a piece of wood , “ Wake up ! ” or a speechless stone , “ Rouse yourself ! ” Can this thing teach ? Why , it ’ s covered with gold and silver , without the slightest breath in it !
CJB	Habakkuk	2	20	But Adonai is in his holy temple ; let all the earth be silent before him .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	3	God comes from Teman , the Holy One from Mount Pa ’ ran . ( Selah ) His splendor covers the sky , and his praise fills the earth .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	2	Adonai , I have heard the report about you . Adonai , I am awed by your deeds . Bring your work to life in our own age , make it known in our own time ; but in anger , remember compassion .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	4	His brightness is like the sun , rays come forth from his hand — that is where his power is concealed .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	5	Before him goes pestilence , and close behind , the plague .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	6	When he stands up , the earth shakes ; when he looks , the nations tremble , the eternal mountains are smashed to pieces , the ancient hills sink down ; the ancient paths are his .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	7	I saw trouble in the tents of Kushan and the tent hangings shaking in the land of Midyan .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	8	Adonai , is it against the rivers , against the rivers that your anger is inflamed ? Is your fury directed at the sea ? Is that why you ride on your horses , and drive your chariots to victory ?
CJB	Habakkuk	3	9	You brandish your naked bow and order it filled with arrows . ( Selah ) You split the earth with rivers .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	10	The mountains see you and tremble ; a torrent of water streams by ; the deep thunders forth , as it raises enormous waves .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	11	The sun and moon stand still in the sky at the light of your arrows speeding by , at the gleam of your glittering spear .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	12	In fury you stride across the land , in anger you trample the nations .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	13	You come out to save your people , to save your anointed one ; you crush the head of the house of the wicked , uncovering its foundation all the way to the neck .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	14	With their own rods you pierce the head of their warriors , who come like a whirlwind to scatter us , who rejoice at the prospect of devouring the poor in secret .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	15	You tread down the sea with your horses , churning up the mighty waters .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	16	When I heard , my whole body trembled , my lips shook at the sound ; weakness overcame my limbs , my legs gave way beneath me . But I wait calmly for the day of trouble , when it comes upon our assailants .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	17	For even if the fig tree doesn ’ t blossom , and no fruit is on the vines , even if the olive tree fails to produce , and the fields yield no food at all , even if the sheep vanish from the sheep pen , and there are no cows in the stalls ;
CJB	Habakkuk	3	18	still , I will rejoice in Adonai , I will take joy in the God of my salvation .
CJB	Habakkuk	3	19	Elohim Adonai is my strength ! He makes me swift and sure-footed as a deer and enables me to stride over my high places . For the leader . With my stringed instruments .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	1	This is the word of Adonai that came to Tz ’ fanyah the son of Kushi , the son of G ’ dalyah , the son of Amaryah , the son of Hizkiyah , during the reign of Yoshiyahu the son of Amon , king of Y ’ hudah :
CJB	Zephaniah	1	2	“ I will completely sweep away everything off the face of the land , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	3	“ I will sweep away humans and animals , the birds in the air and the fish in the sea , also the wicked and what makes them stumble ; I will wipe humanity off the land , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	4	“ I will stretch out my hand over Y ’ hudah and all those living in Yerushalayim . I will wipe every remnant of Ba ‘ al from this place , the idol-serving priests and even their names ,
CJB	Zephaniah	1	5	those worshipping heaven ’ s army on the roofs , also those who worship and swear by Adonai but swear by Malkam as well ,
CJB	Zephaniah	1	6	those who turned away from following Adonai , and those who haven ’ t sought Adonai or consulted him at all. ”
CJB	Zephaniah	1	7	Keep silent before Adonai Elohim , for the Day of Adonai is near . Adonai has prepared a sacrifice ; he has set apart those he invited .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	8	When the time comes for Adonai ’ s sacrifice — “ I will punish the leaders and the sons of the king , also those who dress in foreign clothes .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	9	On the same day I will also punish all who jump over the threshold to fill the house of their master with violence and deceit .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	10	Also on that day , ” says Adonai , “ a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate , wailing from the city ’ s Second Quarter and a loud crash from the hills .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	11	Wail , you who live down in the hollow , because all the merchants are destroyed , all who trade with silver are ruined .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	12	When that time comes , I will search Yerushalayim with lamps and punish those who are [ smug and thick , like wine ] left too long on its dregs , who say to themselves , ‘ Adonai will do nothing — neither good nor bad. ’
CJB	Zephaniah	1	13	For this , their wealth will be plundered ; and their houses will be destroyed . Yes , they will build houses but not live in them ; they will plant vineyards but not drink the wine. ”
CJB	Zephaniah	1	14	The great Day of Adonai is near , near and coming very quickly ; Hear the sound of the Day of Adonai ! When it ’ s here , even a warrior will cry bitterly .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	15	That Day is a Day of fury , a Day of trouble and distress , a Day of waste and desolation , a Day of darkness and gloom , a Day of clouds and thick fog ,
CJB	Zephaniah	1	16	a Day of the shofar and battle-cry against the fortified cities and against the high towers [ on the city walls ] .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	17	“ I will bring such distress on people that they will grope their way like the blind , because they have sinned against Adonai . Their blood will be poured out like dust and their bowels like dung .
CJB	Zephaniah	1	18	Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them . On the day of Adonai ’ s fury , the whole land will be destroyed in the fire of his jealousy . For he will make an end , a horrible end , of all those living in the land . ”
CJB	Zephaniah	2	2	before the decree takes effect , and the day comes when one passes like chaff ; before Adonai ’ s fierce anger comes on you , before the day of Adonai ’ s anger comes on you .
CJB	Zephaniah	2	3	Seek Adonai , all you humble in the land , you who exercise his justice ; seek righteousness , seek humility — you might be hidden on the day of Adonai ’ s anger .
CJB	Zephaniah	2	4	For ‘ Azah will be abandoned , Ashkelon will be desolate , they will evacuate Ashdod at noon , and ‘ Ekron will be uprooted .
CJB	Zephaniah	2	5	Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast , the nation of the K ’ reti ! The word of Adonai is against you , Kena ‘ an , land of the P ’ lishtim : “ I will destroy you ; no one will be left. ”
CJB	Zephaniah	2	6	The seacoast will be reduced to pastures , meadows for shepherds , pens for sheep ;
CJB	Zephaniah	2	7	and the coast will belong to the remnant of the house of Y ’ hudah . They will pasture their flocks there and in the evening lie down in the houses of Ashkelon . For Adonai their God will remember them and restore their fortunes .
CJB	Zephaniah	2	8	“ I have heard the insults of Mo ’ av and the taunts of the people of ‘ Amon , how they reviled my people and boasted of expanding their territory .
CJB	Zephaniah	2	9	Therefore , as I live , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , the God of Isra ’ el , “ Mo ’ av will become like S ’ dom and the people of ‘ Amon like ‘ Amora , a land covered with nettles and salt pits , desolate forever . The remnant of my people will plunder them , the survivors in my nation will inherit them. ”
CJB	Zephaniah	2	10	This is what they will earn for their pride , for having reviled and boasted against the people of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Zephaniah	2	11	Adonai will be fearsome against them , for he will make all the earth ’ s gods waste away . Then all the coasts and islands of the nations will worship him , each from its place .
CJB	Zephaniah	2	12	“ You too , Ethiopians , will be put to death by my sword. ”
CJB	Zephaniah	2	13	He will stretch out his hand against the north ; he will destroy Ashur ; he will make Ninveh desolate , as dry as the desert .
CJB	Zephaniah	2	14	Herds will lie down in it , and all kinds of wild animals too — jackdaws and owls will roost on her columns , voices screeching in the windows , desolation on the doorsteps , for its cedarwork is stripped bare .
CJB	Zephaniah	2	15	This is the city , once so joyful , whose people felt themselves secure , who used to say to herself , “ I am [ the greatest ] ! I have no rival. ” What a ruin she has become — a place for wild animals to lie down ! Everyone passing by her hisses and shakes his fist !
CJB	Zephaniah	3	3	Her leaders there with her are roaring lions , her judges desert wolves , who don ’ t leave even a bone for tomorrow .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	2	She wouldn ’ t listen to the voice , wouldn ’ t receive correction ; she didn ’ t trust in Adonai , didn ’ t draw close to her God .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	4	Her prophets are reckless , treacherous men ; her cohanim profane the holy and do violence to Torah .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	5	Adonai , who is righteous , is there among them ; he never does anything wrong . Every morning he renders his judgment , every morning , without fail ; yet the wrongdoer knows no shame .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	6	“ I have cut off nations , their battlements are ruined ; I have made their streets ruins , no one walks in them . Their cities are destroyed , abandoned , unpeopled .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	7	I said , ‘ Surely now you will fear me , you will receive correction ’ ; so that her place will not be cut off by all the punishments I brought on her . But no , they only grew all the more eager to be corrupt in all that they do .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	8	Therefore , wait for me , ” says Adonai , “ for the day when I rise to witness against you , when I decide to assemble nations , to gather kingdoms together , to pour on them my indignation , all my furious anger ; for all the earth will be consumed in the fire of my passion .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	9	For then I will change the peoples , so that they will have pure lips , to call on the name of Adonai , all of them , and serve him with one accord .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	10	Even from beyond Ethiopia ’ s rivers they will bring those who petition me , the daughter of my dispersed as my offering .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	11	When that day comes , you will not be ashamed of everything you have done , committing wrongs against me ; for then I will remove from among you those of you who take joy in arrogance ; you will no longer be full of pride on my holy mountain .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	12	I will leave among you a poor and afflicted people , who will find their refuge in the name of Adonai. ”
CJB	Zephaniah	3	13	The remnant of Isra ’ el will not do wrong , nor will they speak lies , nor will there be found in their mouths a tongue given over to deceit ; for they will be able to graze and lie down , with no one to disturb them .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	14	Sing , daughter of Tziyon ! Shout , Isra ’ el ! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart , daughter of Yerushalayim !
CJB	Zephaniah	3	15	Adonai has removed the judgments against you , he has expelled your enemy ; the king of Isra ’ el , Adonai , is right there with you . You no longer need to fear that anything bad will happen .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	16	On that day , it will be said to Yerushalayim , “ Do not fear , Tziyon ! don ’ t let your hands droop down .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	17	Adonai your God is right there with you , as a mighty savior . He will rejoice over you and be glad , he will be silent in his love , he will shout over you with joy. ”
CJB	Zephaniah	3	18	“ I will gather those of yours who grieve over the appointed feasts and bear the burden of reproach [ because they can not keep them ] .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	19	When that time comes , I will deal with all those who oppress you . I will save her who is lame , gather her who was driven away , and make them whose shame spread over the earth the object of praise and renown .
CJB	Zephaniah	3	20	When that time comes , I will bring you in ; when that time comes , I will gather you and make you the object of fame and praise among all the peoples of the earth — when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Haggai	1	1	In the second year of Daryavesh the king , on the first day of the sixth month , the following word of Adonai came through Hagai the prophet to Z ’ rubavel the son of Sh ’ alti ’ el , governor of Y ’ hudah , and to Y ’ hoshua the son of Y ’ hotzadak , the cohen hagadol :
CJB	Haggai	1	2	“ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ This people is saying that now isn ’ t the time — the time hasn ’ t yet arrived for Adonai ’ s house to be rebuilt. ’ ”
CJB	Haggai	1	3	Then this word of Adonai came through Hagai the prophet :
CJB	Haggai	1	4	“ So is now the time for you to be living in your own paneled houses , while this house lies in ruins ?
CJB	Haggai	1	5	Therefore here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ Think about your life !
CJB	Haggai	1	6	You sow much but bring in little ; you eat but aren ’ t satisfied ; you drink but never have enough ; you clothe yourselves , but no one is warm ; and he who works for a living earns wages that are put in a bag full of holes. ’ ”
CJB	Haggai	1	7	“ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ Think about your life !
CJB	Haggai	1	8	Go up into the hills , get wood , and rebuild the house . I will be pleased with that , and then I will be glorified , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Haggai	1	9	‘ You looked for much , but it came to little ; and when you brought it home , I blew it away . Why ? ’ asks Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . ‘ Because my house lies in ruins , while every one of you runs to take care of his own house .
CJB	Haggai	1	10	This is why the sky above you has withheld the dew , so that there is none , and the land withholds its yield .
CJB	Haggai	1	11	In fact , I called for a drought on the land and on the hills , on the grain , the wine and the olive oil , on what the ground brings up , on men , animals and on all that hands produce. ’ ”
CJB	Haggai	1	12	Then Z ’ rubavel the son of Sh ’ alti ’ el and Y ’ hoshua the son of Y ’ hotzadak , the cohen hagadol , with all the rest of the people , paid attention to what Adonai their God had said and to the words of Hagai the prophet ; since Adonai their God had sent him ; and the people were filled with fear in the presence of Adonai .
CJB	Haggai	1	13	Hagai the messenger of Adonai conveyed this message of Adonai to the people : “ ‘ I am with you , ’ says Adonai. ”
CJB	Haggai	1	14	Adonai roused the spirit of Z ’ rubavel the son of Sh ’ alti ’ el , governor of Y ’ hudah , and the spirit of Y ’ hoshua the son of Y ’ hotzadak , the cohen hagadol , and the spirits of all the rest of the people ; so that they came and began to work on the house of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot their God .
CJB	Haggai	1	15	This was on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month of the second year of Daryavesh the king .
CJB	Haggai	2	2	“ Speak now to Z ’ rubavel the son of Sh ’ alti ’ el , governor of Y ’ hudah , and to Y ’ hoshua the son of Y ’ hotzadak , the cohen hagadol , and to the rest of the people ; say this to them :
CJB	Haggai	2	3	‘ “ Who among you is left that saw this house in its former glory ? And how does it look to you now ? It seems like nothing to you , doesn ’ t it ?
CJB	Haggai	2	4	Nevertheless , Z ’ rubavel , take courage now , ” says Adonai ; “ and take courage , Y ’ hoshua the son of Y ’ hotzadak , the cohen hagadol ; and take courage , all you people of the land , ” says Adonai ; “ and get to work ! For I am with you , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Haggai	2	5	“ This is in keeping with the word that I promised in a covenant with you when you came out of Egypt , and my Spirit remains with you , so don ’ t be afraid ! ”
CJB	Haggai	2	6	For this is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : “ It won ’ t be long before one more time I will shake the heavens and the earth , the sea and the dry land ;
CJB	Haggai	2	7	and I will shake all the nations , so that the treasures of all the nations will flow in ; and I will fill this house with glory , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Haggai	2	8	“ The silver is mine , and the gold is mine , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Haggai	2	9	“ The glory of this new house will surpass that of the old , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ and in this place I will grant shalom , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot. ’ ”
CJB	Haggai	2	10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the second year of Daryavesh , this word of Adonai came through Hagai the prophet :
CJB	Haggai	2	11	“ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ Ask the cohanim what the Torah says about this :
CJB	Haggai	2	12	if someone carries meat that has been set aside as holy in a fold of his cloak ; and then he lets his cloak touch bread , stew , wine , olive oil or any other food ; does that food become holy too ? ’ ” The cohanim answered , “ No. ”
CJB	Haggai	2	13	Then Hagai asked , “ If someone who is unclean from having had contact with a corpse touches any of these [ food items ] , will they become unclean ? ” The cohanim answered , “ They become unclean. ”
CJB	Haggai	2	14	Hagai then said , “ ‘ That is the condition of this people , that is the condition of this nation before me , ’ says Adonai , ‘ and that is the condition of everything their hands produce ; so that anything they offer there is unclean .
CJB	Haggai	2	15	Now , please , from this day on , keep this in mind : before you began laying stones on each other to rebuild the temple of Adonai ,
CJB	Haggai	2	16	throughout that whole time , when someone approached a twenty-measure pile [ of grain ] , he found only ten ; and when he came to the winepress to draw out fifty measures , there were only twenty .
CJB	Haggai	2	17	I struck you with blasting winds , mildew and hail on everything your hands produced ; but you still wouldn ’ t return to me , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Haggai	2	18	‘ So please keep this in mind , from this day on , from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month , from the day the foundation of Adonai ’ s temple was laid , consider this :
CJB	Haggai	2	19	there ’ s no longer any seed in the barn , is there ? and the vine , fig tree , pomegranate tree and olive tree have produced nothing yet , right ? However , from this day on , I will bless you. ’ ”
CJB	Haggai	2	20	The word of Adonai came a second time to Hagai on the twenty-fourth day of the month , as follows :
CJB	Haggai	2	21	“ Tell Z ’ rubavel , governor of Y ’ hudah , ‘ I will shake the heavens and the earth ,
CJB	Haggai	2	22	I will overturn the thrones of kingdoms , I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations , and I will overturn the chariots and the people riding in them ; the horses and their riders will fall , each by the sword of his brother .
CJB	Haggai	2	23	When that day comes , ’ says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , ‘ I will take you , Z ’ rubavel , my servant , the son of Sh ’ alti ’ el , ’ says Adonai , ‘ and wear you like a signet ring ; for I have chosen you , ’ says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . ”
CJB	Zechariah	1	1	In the eighth month of the second year of Daryavesh , the following message from Adonai came to Z ’ kharyah the son of Berekhyah , the son of ‘ Iddo , the prophet :
CJB	Zechariah	1	2	“ Adonai was extremely angry with your ancestors .
CJB	Zechariah	1	3	Therefore , tell them that Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says this : ‘ “ Return to me , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ and I will return to you , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Zechariah	1	4	“ Don ’ t be like your ancestors . The earlier prophets proclaimed to them , ‘ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says to turn back now from your evil ways and deeds ’ ; but they didn ’ t listen or pay attention to me , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Zechariah	1	5	“ Your ancestors , where are they ? And the prophets , do they live forever ?
CJB	Zechariah	1	6	But my words and my laws , which I ordered my servants the prophets , overtook your ancestors , didn ’ t they ? Then they turned and said , ‘ Adonai has dealt with us according to our ways and deeds , just as he intended to do. ’ ” ’ ”
CJB	Zechariah	1	7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month , the month of Sh ’ vat , in the second year of Daryavesh , this message from Adonai came to Z ’ kharyah the son of Berekhyah , the son of ‘ Iddo , the prophet :
CJB	Zechariah	1	8	It was night , and I saw there before me a man riding on a russet-colored horse . He stood among the myrtle bushes in the valley ; and behind him were other horses , russet , chestnut-colored and white .
CJB	Zechariah	1	9	I asked , “ What are these , my Lord ? ” The angel speaking with me said to me , “ I will show you what these are. ”
CJB	Zechariah	1	10	The man standing among the myrtles said , “ These are those whom Adonai has sent to wander throughout the earth. ”
CJB	Zechariah	1	11	Then they themselves answered the angel of Adonai standing among the myrtles , “ We have been wandering throughout the earth , and the whole world is quiet and at peace. ”
CJB	Zechariah	1	12	The angel of Adonai said , “ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , how long will you keep withholding mercy from Yerushalayim and the cities of Y ’ hudah ? You ’ ve been angry with them for the past seventy years ! ”
CJB	Zechariah	1	13	Adonai replied with kind and comforting words to the angel who was speaking with me .
CJB	Zechariah	1	14	The angel speaking with me then said to me , “ Here is what Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : ‘ I am extremely jealous on behalf of Yerushalayim and Tziyon ;
CJB	Zechariah	1	15	and [ to the same degree ] I am extremely angry with the nations that are so self-satisfied ; because I was only a little angry [ at Yerushalayim and Tziyon ] , but they made the suffering worse. ’
CJB	Zechariah	1	16	Therefore Adonai says , ‘ I will return to Yerushalayim with merciful deeds . My house will be rebuilt there , ’ says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ; ‘ yes , a measuring line will be stretched out over Yerushalayim. ’
CJB	Zechariah	1	17	In addition , proclaim that Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ My cities will again overflow with prosperity. ’ Adonai will again comfort Tziyon , and he will again make Yerushalayim the city of his choice . ”
CJB	Zechariah	2	2	) I asked , “ Where are you going ? ” He said to me , “ To measure Yerushalayim , to determine its width and length. ”
CJB	Zechariah	2	3	) Here the angel who was speaking to me went forward , and another angel went out , met him
CJB	Zechariah	2	4	) and said to him , “ Run and tell this young man , ‘ Yerushalayim will be inhabited without walls , because there will be so many people and animals ;
CJB	Zechariah	2	5	) “ for , ” says Adonai , “ I will be for her a wall of fire surrounding her ; and I will be the glory within her .
CJB	Zechariah	2	1	) I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand .
CJB	Zechariah	2	6	) Up ! ” says Adonai , “ Move ! Flee the land of the north ! For I scattered you like the four winds of the sky , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Zechariah	2	7	) “ Move , Tziyon ! You who are living with the daughter of Bavel , escape ! ”
CJB	Zechariah	2	8	) For Adonai-Tzva ’ ot has sent me on a glorious mission to the nations that plundered you , and this is what he says : “ Anyone who injures you injures the very pupil of my eye .
CJB	Zechariah	2	9	) But I will shake my hand over them , and they will be plundered by those who were formerly their slaves. ” Then you will know that Adonai-Tzva ’ ot sent me .
CJB	Zechariah	2	10	) “ Sing , daughter of Tziyon ; rejoice ! For , here , I am coming ; and I will live among you , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Zechariah	2	11	) When that time comes , many nations will join themselves to Adonai . “ They will be my people , and I will live among you. ” Then you will know that it was Adonai-Tzva ’ ot who sent me to you .
CJB	Zechariah	2	12	) Adonai will take possession of Y ’ hudah as his portion in the holy land , and he will again make Yerushalayim his choice .
CJB	Zechariah	2	13	) Be silent , all humanity , before Adonai ; for he has been roused from his holy dwelling . ’ ”

CJB	Zechariah	2	17	(
CJB	Zechariah	3	3	Y ’ hoshua was clothed in garments covered with dung ; and he was standing before the angel ,
CJB	Zechariah	3	2	Adonai said to the Accuser , “ May Adonai rebuke you , Accuser ! Indeed , may Adonai , who has made Yerushalayim his choice , rebuke you ! Isn ’ t this man a burning stick snatched from the fire ? ”
CJB	Zechariah	3	4	who said to those standing in front of him , “ Take those filthy garments off of him. ” Then to him he said , “ See , I am taking your guilt away . I will clothe you in fine robes. ”
CJB	Zechariah	3	5	I said , “ They should put a clean turban on his head. ” So they put a clean turban on his head and gave him fine robes to wear , while the angel of Adonai stood by .
CJB	Zechariah	3	6	Then the angel of Adonai gave Y ’ hoshua this warning :
CJB	Zechariah	3	7	“ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says this : ‘ If you will walk in my ways , obey my commission , judge my house and guard my courtyards ; then I will give you free access among these who are standing here .
CJB	Zechariah	3	8	Listen , cohen gadol Y ’ hoshua , both you and your colleagues seated here before you , because these men are a sign that I am going to bring my servant Tzemach [ Sprout ] .
CJB	Zechariah	3	9	For look at the stone I have put in front of Y ’ hoshua : on one stone are seven eyes ; I will engrave what is to be written on it , ’ says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ; ‘ and I will remove the guilt of this land in one day .
CJB	Zechariah	3	10	When that time comes , ’ says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , ‘ you will all invite each other to join you under your vines and fig trees. ’ ” Footnotes - Zechariah 3:1 Hebrew : Satan
CJB	Zechariah	4	4	I then asked the angel speaking with me , “ What are these , my Lord ? ” The angel speaking with me said ,
CJB	Zechariah	4	2	and asked me , “ What do you see ? ” I answered , “ I ’ ve been looking at a menorah ; it ’ s all of gold , with a bowl at its top , seven lamps on it , and seven tubes leading to the lamps at its top .
CJB	Zechariah	4	3	Next to it are two olive trees , one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left. ”
CJB	Zechariah	4	5	“ Don ’ t you know what these are ? ” I said , “ No , my Lord. ”
CJB	Zechariah	4	6	Then he answered me , “ This is the word of Adonai to Z ’ rubavel : ‘ Not by force , and not by power , but by my Spirit , ’ says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Zechariah	4	7	‘ What are you , you big mountain ? Before Z ’ rubavel you will become a plain ; and he will put the capstone in place , as everyone shouts , “ It ’ s beautiful ! Beautiful ! ” ’
CJB	Zechariah	4	8	This message from Adonai came to me :
CJB	Zechariah	4	9	‘ The hands of Z ’ rubavel have laid the foundation of this house , and his hands will also finish it. ’ Then you will know that Adonai-Tzva ’ ot sent me to you .
CJB	Zechariah	4	10	For even someone who doesn ’ t think much of a day when such minor events take place will rejoice at seeing the plumbline in the hand of Z ’ rubavel . So these seven are the eyes of Adonai that range about over all the earth. ”
CJB	Zechariah	4	11	I replied by asking him , “ What are those two olive trees on the right and left sides of the menorah ? ”
CJB	Zechariah	4	12	Then I asked the question again : “ What are those two olive branches discharging gold [ -colored oil ] through the two gold spouts ? ”
CJB	Zechariah	4	13	He replied , “ Don ’ t you know what they are ? ” I answered , “ No , my Lord. ”
CJB	Zechariah	4	14	He said , “ Those are the two who have been anointed with oil ; they are standing with the Lord of all the land . ”
CJB	Zechariah	5	5	Then the angel speaking with me went forward and said to me , “ Now raise your eyes , and see what this thing is , passing by. ”
CJB	Zechariah	5	2	He said to me , “ What do you see ? ” I replied , “ I see a flying scroll thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide .
CJB	Zechariah	5	3	Then he said to me , “ This is the curse that goes out over the face of all the land ; for [ according to what is written ] on one side , everyone who steals will be swept away ; and [ according to what is written ] on the other side , everyone who swears will be swept away .
CJB	Zechariah	5	4	‘ I will release it , ’ says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , ‘ and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name ; it will stay there inside the house and consume it completely , even its timbers and stones. ’ ”
CJB	Zechariah	5	6	I asked , “ What is it ? ” He said , “ This is the eifah-measure [ a one-bushel dry-measure ] passing by. ” Then he added , “ This is their eye in all the land. ”
CJB	Zechariah	5	7	Next I saw a lead disc lifted up to reveal a woman sitting in the eifah .
CJB	Zechariah	5	8	He said , “ This is Evil. ” He threw her down into the eifah and pressed the lead weight over its opening .
CJB	Zechariah	5	9	I raised my eyes and saw two women coming with the wind in their wings ; for they had wings like those of a stork . They lifted the eifah up between the earth and the sky .
CJB	Zechariah	5	10	I asked the angel speaking with me , “ Where are they taking the eifah ? ”
CJB	Zechariah	5	11	He answered me , “ To build it a shrine in the land of Shin ‘ ar . When it ’ s ready , [ the eifah ] will be set down there on its base . ”
CJB	Zechariah	6	6	The one with the black horses is going out toward the land in the north , the white [ horses ] have gone out after them , and the spotted have gone out toward the land in the south. ”
CJB	Zechariah	6	2	The first chariot had red horses ; the second chariot , black horses ;
CJB	Zechariah	6	3	the third chariot , white horses ; and the fourth chariot , spotted gray horses .
CJB	Zechariah	6	4	I asked the angel speaking with me , “ What are these , my Lord ? ”
CJB	Zechariah	6	5	The angel answered me , “ These are the four winds of the sky that go out , after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the land .
CJB	Zechariah	6	7	Then the gray ones went out and were seeking to go and wander throughout the whole earth , when he said , “ Wander throughout the whole earth ” ; and they did wander throughout the whole earth .
CJB	Zechariah	6	8	Then he called out to me and said , “ Look ! The ones going to the land in the north have given my Spirit rest in the north country. ”
CJB	Zechariah	6	9	This message from Adonai came to me :
CJB	Zechariah	6	10	“ Take [ gifts ] from the exiles of Heldai , Toviyah , and Y ’ da ‘ yah , who have arrived from Bavel ; then you , go to the house of Yoshiyah the son of Tz ’ fanyah .
CJB	Zechariah	6	11	Take silver and gold ; make crowns ; put one on the head of Y ’ hoshua the son of Y ’ hotzadak , the cohen hagadol ;
CJB	Zechariah	6	12	and tell him , ‘ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says : “ There is coming a man whose name is Tzemach [ Sprout ] . He will sprout up from his place and rebuild the temple of Adonai .
CJB	Zechariah	6	13	Yes , he will rebuild the temple of Adonai ; and he will take up royal splendor , sitting and ruling from his throne . There will be a cohen before his throne ; and they will accept each other ’ s advice in complete harmony .
CJB	Zechariah	6	14	The other crowns will be for Helem , Toviyah , Y ’ da ‘ yah and Hen the son of Tz ’ fanyah ; then [ they are to be kept ] as a memorial in the temple of Adonai .
CJB	Zechariah	6	15	Those who are now far away will come and help rebuild the temple of Adonai. ” Then you will know that it is Adonai-Tzva ’ ot who sent me to you . And it will all come about , provided you heed carefully what Adonai your God says . ’ ”
CJB	Zechariah	7	7	Isn ’ t this just what Adonai proclaimed through the earlier prophets , when Yerushalayim was inhabited and prosperous , as were the cities around her ; and the Negev and the Sh ’ felah were inhabited ? ’ ”
CJB	Zechariah	7	2	He sent Sar ’ etzer and Regem-Melekh with his men to Beit-El in order to ask Adonai ’ s favor ,
CJB	Zechariah	7	3	as they inquired of the cohanim of the house of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot and the prophets , “ Should we go into mourning and abstain from pleasure during the fifth month , as we have been doing for all these years ? ”
CJB	Zechariah	7	4	It was then that this message came to me from Adonai-Tzva ’ ot :
CJB	Zechariah	7	5	“ Speak to all the people of the land and to the cohanim . Tell them , ‘ When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months throughout these seventy years , were you really fasting for me ? Was it for me ?
CJB	Zechariah	7	6	Rather , when you eat and drink , it ’ s just to please yourselves , isn ’ t it ?
CJB	Zechariah	7	8	Then this message from Adonai came to Z ’ kharyah :
CJB	Zechariah	7	9	“ In the past Adonai-Tzva ’ ot said , ‘ Administer true justice . Let everyone show mercy and compassion to his brother .
CJB	Zechariah	7	10	Don ’ t oppress widows , orphans , foreigners or poor people . Don ’ t plot evil against each other. ’
CJB	Zechariah	7	11	But they wouldn ’ t listen , they stubbornly turned their shoulder away and stopped up their ears , so that they wouldn ’ t have to hear it .
CJB	Zechariah	7	12	Yes , they made their hearts as hard as a diamond , so that they wouldn ’ t hear the Torah and the messages that Adonai-Tzva ’ ot had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets . This is why great anger came from Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ;
CJB	Zechariah	7	13	and it came about that just as they hadn ’ t listened when he called , so Adonai-Tzva ’ ot said , ‘ I won ’ t listen when they call ;
CJB	Zechariah	7	14	but with the power of a whirlwind I will disperse them among all the nations which they have not known. ’ Thus the land was left desolate after them , so that no one came or went . They had turned a pleasant land into a desert . ”
CJB	Zechariah	8	8	I will bring them back , and they will live in Yerushalayim . They will be my people ; and I will be their God , with faithfulness and justice. ’
CJB	Zechariah	8	2	“ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ I am extremely jealous on Tziyon ’ s behalf , and I am jealous for her with great fury. ’
CJB	Zechariah	8	3	Adonai says , ‘ I am returning to Tziyon , and I will live in Yerushalayim . Then Yerushalayim will be called Truth City , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ’ s Mountain , the Mountain of the Holy One .
CJB	Zechariah	8	4	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ Old men and old women will once again sit in the open places of Yerushalayim , each one with his cane in his hand , because of their great age .
CJB	Zechariah	8	5	The city ’ s open places will also be full of boys and girls playing there. ’
CJB	Zechariah	8	6	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ This may seem amazing to the survivors in those days , but must it also seem amazing to me ? ’ says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Zechariah	8	7	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ I will save my people from lands east and west ;
CJB	Zechariah	8	9	“ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ Take courage , you who are hearing only now , in these days , these words spoken by the prophets when the foundation was being laid for rebuilding the temple , the house of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Zechariah	8	10	For prior to that time , there were wages neither for people nor for animals ; moreover , it was unsafe for anyone to go out or come in , because of the enemy ; for I set all people each against the other .
CJB	Zechariah	8	11	But from now on , I will not treat the remnant of this people as I did before , ’ says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Zechariah	8	12	‘ Now they will sow in peace , the vine will give its fruit , the ground will produce its yield , the sky will give its dew , and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things .
CJB	Zechariah	8	13	House of Y ’ hudah and house of Isra ’ el , just as you were formerly a curse among the nations , so now I will save you ; and you will be a blessing . Don ’ t be afraid , but take courage ! ’
CJB	Zechariah	8	14	“ For Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ Just as I resolved to do you harm when your forefathers provoked me , ’ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ and I did not relent ;
CJB	Zechariah	8	15	so now , I resolve to do good to Yerushalayim and to the house of Y ’ hudah . Don ’ t be afraid !
CJB	Zechariah	8	16	These are the things you are to do : speak the truth to each other ; in your courts , administer justice that is true and conducive to peace ;
CJB	Zechariah	8	17	don ’ t plot harm against each other ; and don ’ t love perjury ; for all these are things I hate , ’ says Adonai. ”
CJB	Zechariah	8	18	This word of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot came to me :
CJB	Zechariah	8	19	“ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ The fast days of the fourth , fifth , seventh and tenth months are to become times of joy , gladness and cheer for the house of Y ’ hudah . Therefore , love truth and peace. ’
CJB	Zechariah	8	20	“ Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ In the future , peoples and inhabitants of many cities will come ;
CJB	Zechariah	8	21	the inhabitants of one city will travel to another and say , “ We must go to ask Adonai ’ s favor and consult Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . I ’ ll go too. ”
CJB	Zechariah	8	22	Yes , many peoples and powerful nations will come to consult Adonai-Tzva ’ ot in Yerushalayim and to ask Adonai ’ s favor. ’
CJB	Zechariah	8	23	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot says , ‘ When that time comes , ten men will take hold — speaking all the languages of the nations — will grab hold of the cloak of a Jew and say , “ We want to go with you , because we have heard that God is with you . ” ’ ”
CJB	Zechariah	9	9	Rejoice with all your heart , daughter of Tziyon ! Shout out loud , daughter of Yerushalayim ! Look ! Your king is coming to you . He is righteous , and he is victorious . Yet he is humble — he ’ s riding on a donkey , yes , on a lowly donkey ’ s colt .
CJB	Zechariah	9	2	also Hamat at its border , Tzor and Tzidon , for she is very wise .
CJB	Zechariah	9	3	Tzor built herself a fortified tower , heaping up silver as if it were dust and fine gold as if it were mud in the streets .
CJB	Zechariah	9	4	But Adonai will dispossess her and break her power at sea , while the city itself will be destroyed by fire .
CJB	Zechariah	9	5	On seeing this , Ashkelon will be terrified ; ‘ Azah too will writhe in pain ; likewise ‘ Ekron , as her hopes are dashed . “ The king will vanish from ‘ Azah , Ashkelon will be without people ,
CJB	Zechariah	9	6	and a mixed people will live in Ashdod , as I destroy the pride of the P ’ lishtim .
CJB	Zechariah	9	7	I will end their eating meat with its blood still in it , snatching the disgusting things from between their teeth. ” But the surviving remnant will belong to our God ; it will be like a clan in Y ’ hudah ; and ‘ Ekron will be like a Y ’ vusi .
CJB	Zechariah	9	8	“ Then I will guard my house against armies , so that none will march through or return . No oppressor will ever again overrun them , for now I am watching with my own eyes .
CJB	Zechariah	9	10	I will banish chariots from Efrayim and war-horses from Yerushalayim. ” The warrior ’ s bow will be banished , and he will proclaim peace to the nations . He will rule from sea to sea , and from the [ Euphrates ] River to the ends of the earth .
CJB	Zechariah	9	11	“ Also you , by the blood of your covenant , I release your prisoners from [ the dungeon , ] the cistern that has no water in it .
CJB	Zechariah	9	12	Return to the stronghold , you prisoners with hope ! This day I declare to you that I will grant you double reparation .
CJB	Zechariah	9	13	For I have bent Y ’ hudah as my bow and made Efrayim its arrow . I will rouse your sons , Tziyon , and make you like a warrior ’ s sword against your sons , Greece. ”
CJB	Zechariah	9	14	Adonai will appear over them , and his arrow will flash like lightning . Adonai Elohim will blow the shofar and go out in the whirlwinds of the south .
CJB	Zechariah	9	15	Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will defend them ; they will devour and trample the sling-stones . They will drink and roar as if they had drunk wine ; they will be filled , like basins and like the corners of the altar .
CJB	Zechariah	9	16	On that day Adonai their God will save them as the flock of his people ; for they will be like gems in a crown , sparkling over his countryside .
CJB	Zechariah	9	17	What wealth is theirs , what beauty ! Grain will make the young men thrive , and new wine the young women .
CJB	Zechariah	10	10	I will bring them back from the land of Egypt and gather them out of Ashur . I will bring them into Gil ‘ ad and the L ’ vanon , until there is no more room for them .
CJB	Zechariah	10	2	For the household gods talk nonsense , the diviners have seen a lie ; their dreams convey delusions , and the comfort they offer is in vain . Therefore they go their way like sheep in distress from lack of a shepherd .
CJB	Zechariah	10	3	“ My anger burns against the shepherds , and I will vent it on the leaders of the flock. ” For Adonai-Tzva ’ ot will care for his flock , the people of Y ’ hudah ; he will make them like his royal war-horse .
CJB	Zechariah	10	4	From them come cornerstone and tent peg , from them the bow for battle , from them all the rulers together .
CJB	Zechariah	10	5	They will be like warriors trampling the mud of the streets in battle . They will fight , because Adonai is with them ; they will rout even those on horseback .
CJB	Zechariah	10	6	“ I will strengthen the house of Y ’ hudah and save the house of Yosef . I will bring them back in my compassion for them ; they will be as if I hadn ’ t driven them out ; for I am Adonai their God , and I will answer them .
CJB	Zechariah	10	7	Efrayim ’ s men will be like warriors ; their hearts will be cheered as if from wine . Their children will see it and rejoice , their hearts will be glad in Adonai .
CJB	Zechariah	10	8	“ I will whistle for them and gather them , because I have redeemed them ; they will be as numerous as they were before ;
CJB	Zechariah	10	9	and I will sow them among the peoples . In distant lands they will remember me ; they will rear their children and then return .
CJB	Zechariah	10	11	“ Trouble will pass over the sea and stir up waves in the sea ; all the depths of the Nile will be dried up , the pride of Ashur will be brought down , and the scepter of Egypt will leave .
CJB	Zechariah	10	12	But I will strengthen [ Isra ’ el ] in Adonai ; they will travel here and there in his name , ” says Adonai .
CJB	Zechariah	11	11	On that day when it was broken , the most miserable of the sheep who paid attention to me knew that this was indeed a message from Adonai .
CJB	Zechariah	11	2	Wail , cypress , because the cedar has fallen , those splendid trees are ruined . Wail , oaks of Bashan , because the thick forest has been felled .
CJB	Zechariah	11	3	Listen to the wail of the shepherds , because their glory is spoiled . Listen to the roaring of young lions , because the Yarden ’ s thickets are plundered .
CJB	Zechariah	11	4	Adonai my God says this : “ Shepherd the flock for slaughter .
CJB	Zechariah	11	5	Their buyers kill them and go unpunished ; while those who sell them say , ‘ Barukh Adonai ! Now I ’ m rich ! ’ Even their own shepherds show them no pity .
CJB	Zechariah	11	6	I will no longer show pity to the inhabitants of the land , ” says Adonai . “ No , I will hand every one of them over to the power of a neighbor and to the power of his king ; they will crush the land ; and I won ’ t rescue them from their power. ”
CJB	Zechariah	11	7	So I shepherded the flock for slaughter , truly the most miserable of the sheep ; and I took two staffs for myself . I called the one No ‘ am [ pleasantness ] , the other I called Hovalim [ bound together ] , and I shepherded the flock .
CJB	Zechariah	11	8	“ In a single month I got rid of three shepherds , because I grew impatient with them ; and besides , they detested me .
CJB	Zechariah	11	9	I said , ‘ I ’ m not going to shepherd you . Whichever one is going to die , let it die ; whichever is going to be destroyed , let it be destroyed ; and the rest can all devour each other. ’ ”
CJB	Zechariah	11	10	I took my staff No ‘ am and snapped it in two , “ in order to break my covenant , which I made with all the peoples. ”
CJB	Zechariah	11	12	I said to them , “ If it seems good to you , give me my wages ; if not , don ’ t. ” So they weighed out my wages , thirty silver [ shekels , that is , twelve ounces ] .
CJB	Zechariah	11	13	Concerning that “ princely sum ” at which they valued me , Adonai said , “ Throw it into the treasury ! ” So I took the thirty silver [ shekels ] and threw them into the treasury in the house of Adonai .
CJB	Zechariah	11	14	Then I snapped in two my other staff Hovalim [ bound together ] , in order to break up the brotherhood between Y ’ hudah and Isra ’ el .
CJB	Zechariah	11	15	Adonai said to me , “ This time , take the equipment of a worthless shepherd .
CJB	Zechariah	11	16	For I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who won ’ t bother about the ones who have been destroyed , won ’ t seek out the young , won ’ t heal the broken and won ’ t feed those standing still ; on the contrary , he will eat the meat of the fat ones and break their hoofs in pieces .
CJB	Zechariah	11	17	“ Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the sheep ! May a sword strike his arm and his right eye . May his arm be completely withered and his right eye totally blinded . ”
CJB	Zechariah	12	12	Then the land will mourn , each family by itself — the family of the house of David by itself , and their wives by themselves ; the family of the house of Natan by itself , and their wives by themselves ;
CJB	Zechariah	12	2	“ I will make Yerushalayim a cup that will stagger the surrounding peoples . Even Y ’ hudah will be caught up in the siege against Yerushalayim .
CJB	Zechariah	12	3	When that day comes , I will make Yerushalayim a heavy stone for all the peoples . All who try to lift it will hurt themselves , and all the earth ’ s nations will be massed against her .
CJB	Zechariah	12	4	When that day comes , ” says Adonai , “ I will strike all the horses with panic and their riders with madness ; I will keep watch over Y ’ hudah , but I will strike blind all the horses of the peoples .
CJB	Zechariah	12	5	The leaders of Y ’ hudah will say to themselves , ‘ Those living in Yerushalayim are my strength through Adonai-Tzva ’ ot their God. ’
CJB	Zechariah	12	6	When that day comes , I will make the leaders of Y ’ hudah like a blazing fire pan in a pile of wood , like a fiery torch among sheaves of grain ; they will devour all the surrounding peoples , on the right and on the left . Yerushalayim will be inhabited in her own place , Yerushalayim .
CJB	Zechariah	12	7	Adonai will save the tents of Y ’ hudah first , so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of those living in Yerushalayim will not appear greater than that of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Zechariah	12	8	When that day comes , Adonai will defend those living in Yerushalayim . On that day , even someone who stumbles will be like David ; and the house of David will be like God , like the angel of Adonai before them .
CJB	Zechariah	12	9	“ When that day comes , I will seek to destroy all nations attacking Yerushalayim ;
CJB	Zechariah	12	10	and I will pour out on the house of David and on those living in Yerushalayim a spirit of grace and prayer ; and they will look to me , whom they pierced. ” They will mourn for him as one mourns for an only son ; they will be in bitterness on his behalf like the bitterness for a firstborn son .
CJB	Zechariah	12	11	When that day comes , there will be great mourning in Yerushalayim , mourning like that for Hadad-Rimmon in the Megiddo Valley .
CJB	Zechariah	12	13	the family of the house of Levi by itself , and their wives by themselves ; the family of the Shim ‘ i by itself , and their wives by themselves ;
CJB	Zechariah	12	14	all the remaining families , each by itself , and their wives by themselves .
CJB	Zechariah	13	13	When that day comes , a spring will be opened up for the house of David and the people living in Yerushalayim to cleanse them from sin and impurity .
CJB	Zechariah	13	2	“ When that day comes , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ I will cut off the very names of the idols from the land , so that no one even remembers them any more . I will also expel the [ false ] prophets and the spirit of uncleanness from the land ;
CJB	Zechariah	13	3	so that if anyone continues to prophesy , his own father and mother who brought him into the world will tell him , ‘ You can not continue to live , because you are speaking lies in the name of Adonai ’ ; then his own father and mother who brought him into the world will stab him to death .
CJB	Zechariah	13	4	When that day comes , each one of the prophets will be shamed by his vision when he prophesies . He will stop wearing a hair cloak to deceive people ;
CJB	Zechariah	13	5	and instead , he will say , ‘ I ’ m no prophet , I just work the soil ; since my youth I ’ ve only wanted to be an ordinary man. ’
CJB	Zechariah	13	6	If someone asks him , ‘ Then what are these gashes between your shoulders ? ’ he will answer , ‘ I got hurt at my friends ’ house. ’
CJB	Zechariah	13	7	“ Awake , sword , against my shepherd , against the man who is close to me , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . “ Strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered ; I will turn my hand against the young ones .
CJB	Zechariah	13	8	In time , throughout that land , ” says Adonai , “ two-thirds of those in it will be destroyed — they will die , but one-third will remain .
CJB	Zechariah	13	9	That third part I will bring through the fire ; I will refine them as silver is refined , I will test them as gold is tested . They will call on my name , and I will answer them . I will say , ‘ This is my people ’ and they will say , ‘ Adonai is my God . ’ ”
CJB	Zechariah	14	14	Y ’ hudah too will fight against Yerushalayim ; and the wealth of all the nations will be assembled — gold , silver and clothing in great abundance .
CJB	Zechariah	14	2	“ For I will gather all the nations against Yerushalayim for war . The city will be taken , the houses will be rifled , the women will be raped , and half the city will go into exile ; but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. ”
CJB	Zechariah	14	3	Then Adonai will go out and fight against those nations , fighting as on a day of battle .
CJB	Zechariah	14	4	On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives , which lies to the east of Yerushalayim ; and the Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west , to make a huge valley . Half of the mountain will move toward the north , and half of it toward the south .
CJB	Zechariah	14	5	You will flee to the valley in the mountains , for the valley in the mountains will reach to Atzel . You will flee , just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of ‘ Uziyah king of Y ’ hudah . Then Adonai my God will come to you with all the holy ones .
CJB	Zechariah	14	6	On that day , there will be neither bright light nor thick darkness ;
CJB	Zechariah	14	7	and one day , known to Adonai , will be neither day nor night , although by evening there will be light .
CJB	Zechariah	14	8	On that day , fresh water will flow out from Yerushalayim , half toward the eastern sea and half toward the western sea , both summer and winter .
CJB	Zechariah	14	9	Then Adonai will be king over the whole world . On that day Adonai will be the only one , and his name will be the only name .
CJB	Zechariah	14	10	All the land will be made like the ‘ Aravah , from Geva to Rimmon in the Negev . Yerushalayim will be raised up and inhabited where she is , from Binyamin ’ s Gate to the place where the earlier gate stood , and on to the Corner Gate , and from the Tower of Hanan ’ el to the king ’ s winepresses .
CJB	Zechariah	14	11	People will live there , the curse will be broken , and Yerushalayim will live in safety .
CJB	Zechariah	14	12	Adonai will strike all the peoples who made war against Yerushalayim with a plague in which their flesh rots away while they are standing on their feet , their eyes rot away in their sockets , and their tongues rot away in their mouths .
CJB	Zechariah	14	13	When that day comes , there will be among them great panic , sent by Adonai , so that everyone lays hands on his neighbor , who in turn attacks him .
CJB	Zechariah	14	15	A plague like this plague will also affect the horses , mules , camels , donkeys and all the other animals in those camps .
CJB	Zechariah	14	16	Finally , everyone remaining from all the nations that came to attack Yerushalayim will go up every year to worship the king , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , and to keep the festival of Sukkot .
CJB	Zechariah	14	17	If any of the families of the earth does not go up to Yerushalayim to worship the king , Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , no rain will fall on them .
CJB	Zechariah	14	18	If the family of Egypt doesn ’ t go up , if they refuse to come , they will have no [ annual ] overflow [ from the Nile ] ; moreover , there will be the plague with which Adonai will strike the nations that don ’ t go up to keep the festival of Sukkot .
CJB	Zechariah	14	19	This will be Egypt ’ s punishment and the punishment of all the nations that don ’ t go up to keep the festival of Sukkot .
CJB	Zechariah	14	20	When that day comes , this will be written on the bells worn by the horses : “ Consecrated to Adonai ” ; and the cooking pots in the house of Adonai will be [ as holy ] as the sprinkling bowls before the altar .
CJB	Zechariah	14	21	Yes , every cooking pot in Yerushalayim and Y ’ hudah will be consecrated to Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . Everyone who offers sacrifices will come , take them and use them to stew the meat . When that day comes , there will no longer be merchants in the house of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	1	1	A prophecy , the word of Adonai to Isra ’ el through Mal ’ akhi :
CJB	Malachi	1	2	“ I love you , ” says Adonai . But you ask , “ How do you show us your love ? ” Adonai answers , “ ‘ Esav was Ya ‘ akov ’ s brother . Yet I loved Ya ‘ akov
CJB	Malachi	1	3	but hated ‘ Esav . I made his mountains desolate and gave his territory to desert jackals. ”
CJB	Malachi	1	4	Edom says , “ We are beaten down now , but we will come back and rebuild the ruins. ” Adonai-Tzva ’ ot answers , “ They can build , but I will demolish . They will be called the Land of Wickedness , the people with whom Adonai is permanently angry .
CJB	Malachi	1	5	You will see it and say , ‘ Adonai is great , even beyond the borders of Isra ’ el. ’ ”
CJB	Malachi	1	6	“ A son honors his father and a servant his master . But if I ’ m a father , where is the honor due me ? and if I ’ m a master , where is the respect due me ? — says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot to you cohanim who despise my name . You ask , ‘ How are we despising your name ? ’
CJB	Malachi	1	7	By offering polluted food on my altar ! Now you ask , ‘ How are we polluting you ? ’ By saying that the table of Adonai doesn ’ t deserve respect ;
CJB	Malachi	1	8	so that there ’ s nothing wrong with offering a blind animal as a sacrifice , nothing wrong with offering an animal that ’ s lame or sick . Try offering such an animal to your governor , and see if he will be pleased with you ! Would he even receive you ? ” asks Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	1	9	So if you pray now that God will show us favor , what your actions have accomplished is that Adonai-Tzva ’ ot asks , “ Will he receive any of you ?
CJB	Malachi	1	10	Why doesn ’ t even one of you shut the doors and thus stop this useless lighting of fires on my altar ? I take no pleasure in you , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ and I will not receive an offering from you .
CJB	Malachi	1	11	For from farthest east to farthest west my name is great among the nations . Offerings are presented to my name everywhere , pure gifts ; for my name is great among the nations , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	1	12	“ But you profane it by saying that the table of Adonai is polluted , so that the fruit and food offered deserve contempt .
CJB	Malachi	1	13	You also say , ‘ It ’ s all so tiresome ! ’ and sniff scornfully at it , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . “ Then you bring animals that were taken by violence , or they are lame or sick . This is the sort of offering you bring . Am I supposed to accept this from you ? ” asks Adonai .
CJB	Malachi	1	14	“ Moreover , cursed is the deceiver who has a male animal in his flock that is damaged , but vows and sacrifices to Adonai anyway . For I am a great king , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ and my name is respected among the nations .
CJB	Malachi	2	2	If you won ’ t listen , if you won ’ t pay attention to honoring my name , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ then I will send the curse on you ; I will turn your blessings into curses . Yes , I will curse them , because you pay no attention .
CJB	Malachi	2	3	I will reject your seed ; I will throw dung in your faces , the dung from your festival offerings ; and you will be carted off with it .
CJB	Malachi	2	4	Then you will know that I sent you this command to affirm my covenant with Levi , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	2	5	“ My covenant with him was one of life and peace , and I gave him these things . It was also one of fear , and he feared me ; he was in awe of my name .
CJB	Malachi	2	6	The true Torah was in his mouth , and no dishonesty was found on his lips ; he walked with me in peace and uprightness and turned many away from sin .
CJB	Malachi	2	7	A cohen ’ s lips should safeguard knowledge , and people should seek Torah from his mouth , because he is the messenger of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	2	8	But you turned away from the path , you caused many to fail in the Torah , you corrupted the covenant of Levi , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	2	9	“ Therefore I have in turn made you contemptible and vile before all the people , because you did not keep my ways but were partial in applying the Torah. ”
CJB	Malachi	2	10	Don ’ t we all have the same father ? Didn ’ t one God create us all ? Then why do we break faith with each other , profaning the covenant of our ancestors ?
CJB	Malachi	2	11	Y ’ hudah has broken faith ; an abomination has been committed in Isra ’ el and Yerushalayim . For Y ’ hudah has profaned the sanctuary of Adonai , which he loves , by marrying the daughter of a foreign god .
CJB	Malachi	2	12	If a man does this and presents an offering to Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , may Adonai cut him off from the tents of Ya ‘ akov , whether initiator or follower .
CJB	Malachi	2	13	Here is something else you do : you cover Adonai ’ s altar with tears , with weeping and with sighing , because he no longer looks at the offering or receives your gift with favor .
CJB	Malachi	2	14	Nevertheless , you ask , “ Why is this ? ” Because Adonai is witness between you and the wife of your youth that you have broken faith with her , though she is your companion , your wife by covenant .
CJB	Malachi	2	15	And hasn ’ t he made [ them ] one [ flesh ] in order to have spiritual blood-relatives ? For what the one [ flesh ] seeks is a seed from God . Therefore , take heed to your spirit , and don ’ t break faith with the wife of your youth .
CJB	Malachi	2	16	“ For I hate divorce , ” says Adonai the God of Isra ’ el , “ and him who covers his clothing with violence , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . Therefore take heed to your spirit , and don ’ t break faith .
CJB	Malachi	2	17	You have wearied Adonai with your words . Yet you ask , “ How have we wearied him ? ” By saying that anyone who does wrong is good from Adonai ’ s perspective , and that he is delighted with them ; or by asking , “ Where is the God of justice ? ”
CJB	Malachi	3	3	He will sit , testing and purifying the silver ; he will purify the sons of Levi , refining them like gold and silver , so that they can bring offerings to Adonai uprightly .
CJB	Malachi	3	2	But who can endure the day when he comes ? Who can stand when he appears ? For he will be like a refiner ’ s fire , like the soapmaker ’ s lye .
CJB	Malachi	3	4	Then the offering of Y ’ hudah and Yerushalayim will be pleasing to Adonai , as it was in the days of old , as in years gone by .
CJB	Malachi	3	5	“ Then I will approach you for judgment ; and I will be quick to witness against sorcerers , adulterers and perjurers ; against those who take advantage of wage-earners , widows and orphans ; against those who rob the foreigner of his rights and don ’ t fear me , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	3	6	“ But because I , Adonai , do not change , you sons of Ya ‘ akov will not be destroyed .
CJB	Malachi	3	7	Since the days of your forefathers you have turned from my laws and have not kept them . Return to me , and I will return to you , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . “ But you ask , ‘ In respect to what are we supposed to return ? ’
CJB	Malachi	3	8	Can a person rob God ? Yet you rob me . But you ask , ‘ How have we robbed you ? ’ In tenths and voluntary contributions .
CJB	Malachi	3	9	A curse is on you , on your whole nation , because you rob me .
CJB	Malachi	3	10	Bring the whole tenth into the storehouse , so that there will be food in my house , and put me to the test , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot . “ See if I won ’ t open for you the floodgates of heaven and pour out for you a blessing far beyond your needs .
CJB	Malachi	3	11	For your sakes I will forbid the devourer to destroy the yield from your soil ; and your vine will not lose its fruit before harvest-time , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	3	12	“ All nations will call you happy , for you will be a land of delights , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	3	13	“ You have spoken strongly against me , ” says Adonai . “ Yet you say , ‘ How have we spoken against you ? ’
CJB	Malachi	3	14	By saying , ‘ There is no point in serving God . What good is it to obey his orders or to walk about as mourners before Adonai-Tzva ’ ot ?
CJB	Malachi	3	15	We consider the arrogant happy ; also evildoers prosper ; they put God to the test ; nevertheless , they escape. ’ ”
CJB	Malachi	3	16	Then those who feared Adonai spoke together ; and Adonai listened and heard . A record book was written in his presence for those who feared Adonai and had respect for his name .
CJB	Malachi	3	17	“ They will be mine , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ on the day when I compose my own special treasure . I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him .
CJB	Malachi	3	18	Then once again you will see the difference between the righteous and the wicked , between the person who serves God and one that doesn ’ t serve him .
CJB	Malachi	3	19	( 4:1 ) For the day is coming , burning like a furnace , when all the proud and evildoers will be stubble ; the day that is coming will set them ablaze , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot , “ and leave them neither root nor branch .
CJB	Malachi	3	20	( 4:2 ) But to you who fear my name , the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings ; and you will break out leaping , like calves released from the stall .
CJB	Malachi	3	21	( 4:3 ) You will trample the wicked , they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I take action , ” says Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Malachi	3	22	( 4:4 ) “ Remember the Torah of Moshe my servant , which I enjoined on him at Horev , laws and rulings for all Isra ’ el .
CJB	Malachi	3	23	( 4:5 ) Look , I will send to you Eliyahu the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible Day of Adonai .
CJB	Malachi	3	24	( 4:6 ) He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers ; otherwise I will come and strike the land with complete destruction. ” [ Look , I will send to you Eliyahu the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible Day of Adonai . ]
