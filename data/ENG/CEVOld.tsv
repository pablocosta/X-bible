CEV	Genesis	1	1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . [ a ]
CEV	Genesis	1	2	The earth was barren , with no form of life ; [ b ] it was under a roaring ocean covered with darkness . But the Spirit of God [ c ] was moving over the water . The First Day
CEV	Genesis	1	3	( A ) God said , “ I command light to shine ! ” And light started shining .
CEV	Genesis	1	4	God looked at the light and saw that it was good . He separated light from darkness
CEV	Genesis	1	5	and named the light “ Day ” and the darkness “ Night. ” Evening came , then morning—that was the first day . [ d ] The Second Day
CEV	Genesis	1	6	( B ) God said , “ I command a dome to separate the water above it from the water below it. ”
CEV	Genesis	1	7	And that 's what happened . God made the dome
CEV	Genesis	1	8	and named it “ Sky. ” Evening came , then morning—that was the second day . The Third Day
CEV	Genesis	1	9	God said , “ I command the water under the sky to come together in one place , so there will be dry ground. ” And that 's what happened .
CEV	Genesis	1	10	God named the dry ground “ Land , ” and he named the water “ Ocean. ” God looked at what he had done and saw that it was good .
CEV	Genesis	1	11	God said , “ I command the earth to produce all kinds of plants , including fruit trees and grain. ” And that 's what happened .
CEV	Genesis	1	12	The earth produced all kinds of vegetation . God looked at what he had done , and it was good .
CEV	Genesis	1	13	Evening came , then morning—that was the third day . The Fourth Day
CEV	Genesis	1	14	God said , “ I command lights to appear in the sky and to separate day from night and to show the time for seasons , special days , and years .
CEV	Genesis	1	15	I command them to shine on the earth. ” And that 's what happened .
CEV	Genesis	1	16	God made two powerful lights , the brighter one to rule the day and the other [ e ] to rule the night . He also made the stars .
CEV	Genesis	1	17	Then God put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth ,
CEV	Genesis	1	18	to rule day and night , and to separate light from darkness . God looked at what he had done , and it was good .
CEV	Genesis	1	19	Evening came , then morning—that was the fourth day . The Fifth Day
CEV	Genesis	1	20	God said , “ I command the ocean to be full of living creatures , and I command birds to fly above the earth. ”
CEV	Genesis	1	21	So God made the giant sea monsters and all the living creatures that swim in the ocean . He also made every kind of bird . God looked at what he had done , and it was good .
CEV	Genesis	1	22	Then he gave the living creatures his blessing—he told the ocean creatures to increase and live everywhere in the ocean and the birds to increase everywhere on earth .
CEV	Genesis	1	23	Evening came , then morning—that was the fifth day . The Sixth Day
CEV	Genesis	1	24	God said , “ I command the earth to give life to all kinds of tame animals , wild animals , and reptiles. ” And that 's what happened .
CEV	Genesis	1	25	God made every one of them . Then he looked at what he had done , and it was good .
CEV	Genesis	1	26	( C ) God said , “ Now we will make humans , and they will be like us . We will let them rule the fish , the birds , and all other living creatures. ”
CEV	Genesis	1	27	( D ) ( E ) So God created humans to be like himself ; he made men and women .
CEV	Genesis	1	28	God gave them his blessing and said : Have a lot of children ! Fill the earth with people and bring it under your control . Rule over the fish in the ocean , the birds in the sky , and every animal on the earth .
CEV	Genesis	1	29	I have provided all kinds of fruit and grain for you to eat .
CEV	Genesis	1	30	And I have given the green plants as food for everything else that breathes , including animals , both wild and tame , and birds . And so it was .
CEV	Genesis	1	31	God looked at what he had done . All of it was very good ! Evening came , then morning—that was the sixth day .

CEV	Genesis	2	2	( A ) ( B ) By the seventh day God had finished his work , and so he rested .
CEV	Genesis	2	3	God blessed the seventh day and made it special , because on that day he rested from his work .
CEV	Genesis	2	4	That 's how God created the heavens and the earth . The Garden of Eden When the Lord God made the heavens and the earth ,
CEV	Genesis	2	5	no grass or plants were growing anywhere . God had not yet sent any rain , and there was no one to work the land .
CEV	Genesis	2	6	But streams [ a ] came up from the ground and watered the earth .
CEV	Genesis	2	7	( C ) The Lord God took some soil from the ground and made a man . [ b ] God breathed life into the man , and the man started breathing .
CEV	Genesis	2	8	The Lord made a garden in a place called Eden , which was in the east , and he put the man there .
CEV	Genesis	2	9	( D ) The Lord God filled the garden with all kinds of beautiful trees and fruit trees . Two other trees were in the middle of the garden . One of these gave life—the other gave the wisdom to know the difference between right and wrong .
CEV	Genesis	2	10	From Eden a river flowed out to water the garden , then it divided into four rivers .
CEV	Genesis	2	11	The first one is the Pishon River that flows through the land of Havilah ,
CEV	Genesis	2	12	where pure gold , rare perfumes , and precious stones are found .
CEV	Genesis	2	13	The second is the Gihon River that winds through Ethiopia . [ c ]
CEV	Genesis	2	14	The Tigris River that flows east of Assyria is the third , and the fourth is the Euphrates River .
CEV	Genesis	2	15	The Lord God put the man in the Garden of Eden to take care of it and to look after it .
CEV	Genesis	2	16	But the Lord told him , “ You may eat fruit from any tree in the garden ,
CEV	Genesis	2	17	except the one that has the power to let you know the difference between right and wrong . If you eat any fruit from that tree , you will die before the day is over ! ”
CEV	Genesis	2	18	The Lord God said , “ It is n't good for the man to live alone . I will make a suitable partner for him. ” 19-20 So the Lord took some soil and made animals and birds . He brought them to the man to see what names he would give each of them . Then the man named the tame animals and the birds and the wild animals . That 's how they got their names . None of these was the right kind of partner for the man .
CEV	Genesis	2	21	So the Lord God made him fall into a deep sleep , and he took out one of the man 's ribs . Then after closing the man 's side ,
CEV	Genesis	2	22	the Lord made a woman out of the rib . The Lord God brought her to the man ,
CEV	Genesis	2	23	and the man exclaimed , “ Here is someone like me ! She is part of my body , my own flesh and bones . She came from me , a man . So I will name her Woman ! ” [ d ]
CEV	Genesis	2	24	( E ) That 's why a man will leave his own father and mother . He marries a woman , and the two of them become like one person .
CEV	Genesis	2	25	Although the man and his wife were both naked , they were not ashamed . Footnotes - 2.6 streams : Or “ mist. ” - 2.7 man : In Hebrew “ man ” comes from the same word as “ ground. ” - 2.13 Ethiopia : The Hebrew text has “ Cush , ” which was a region south of Egypt that included parts of the present countries of Ethiopia and Sudan . - 2.23 a man … Woman : In Hebrew the words “ man ” and “ woman ” are similar .

CEV	Genesis	3	3	except the one in the middle . He told us not to eat fruit from that tree or even to touch it . If we do , we will die. ”
CEV	Genesis	3	2	The woman answered , “ God said we could eat fruit from any tree in the garden ,
CEV	Genesis	3	4	“ No , you wo n't ! ” the snake replied .
CEV	Genesis	3	5	“ God understands what will happen on the day you eat fruit from that tree . You will see what you have done , and you will know the difference between right and wrong , just as God does. ”
CEV	Genesis	3	6	The woman stared at the fruit . It looked beautiful and tasty . She wanted the wisdom that it would give her , and she ate some of the fruit . Her husband was there with her , so she gave some to him , and he ate it too .
CEV	Genesis	3	7	At once they saw what they had done , and they realized they were naked . Then they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves .
CEV	Genesis	3	8	Late in the afternoon , when the breeze began to blow , the man and woman heard the Lord God walking in the garden . So they hid behind some trees . Sin Brings a Curse
CEV	Genesis	3	9	The Lord God called out to the man and asked , “ Where are you ? ”
CEV	Genesis	3	10	The man answered , “ I was naked , and when I heard you walking through the garden , I was frightened and hid ! ”
CEV	Genesis	3	11	“ How did you know you were naked ? ” God asked . “ Did you eat any fruit from that tree in the middle of the garden ? ”
CEV	Genesis	3	12	“ It was the woman you put here with me , ” the man said . “ She gave me some of the fruit , and I ate it. ”
CEV	Genesis	3	13	( B ) The Lord God then asked the woman , “ What have you done ? ” “ The snake tricked me , ” she answered , “ and I ate some of that fruit. ”
CEV	Genesis	3	14	So the Lord God said to the snake : “ Because of what you have done , you will be the only animal to suffer this curse— For as long as you live , you will crawl on your stomach and eat dirt .
CEV	Genesis	3	15	( C ) You and this woman will hate each other ; your descendants and hers will always be enemies . One of hers will strike you on the head , and you will strike him on the heel. ”
CEV	Genesis	3	16	Then the Lord God said to the woman , “ You will suffer terribly when you give birth . But you will still desire your husband , and he will rule over you. ”
CEV	Genesis	3	17	( D ) The Lord said to the man , “ You listened to your wife and ate the fruit I told you not to eat . And so , the ground will be under a curse because of what you did . As long as you live , you will have to struggle to grow enough food .
CEV	Genesis	3	18	Your food will be plants , but the ground will produce thorns and thistles .
CEV	Genesis	3	19	You will sweat all your life to earn a living ; you were made out of soil , and you will once again turn into soil. ”
CEV	Genesis	3	20	The man Adam [ a ] named his wife Eve [ b ] because she would become the mother of all who live .
CEV	Genesis	3	21	Then the Lord God made clothes out of animal skins for the man and his wife .
CEV	Genesis	3	22	( E ) The Lord said , “ They now know the difference between right and wrong , just as we do . But they must not be allowed to eat fruit from the tree that lets them live forever. ”
CEV	Genesis	3	23	So the Lord God sent them out of the Garden of Eden , where they would have to work the ground from which the man had been made .
CEV	Genesis	3	24	Then God put winged creatures at the entrance to the garden and a flaming , flashing sword to guard the way to the life-giving tree . Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	4	4	( A ) and Abel also gave an offering to the Lord . He killed the first-born lamb from one of his sheep and gave the Lord the best parts of it . The Lord was pleased with Abel and his offering ,
CEV	Genesis	4	2	Later she had another son and named him Abel . Abel became a sheep farmer , but Cain farmed the land .
CEV	Genesis	4	3	One day , Cain gave part of his harvest to the Lord ,
CEV	Genesis	4	5	but not with Cain and his offering . This made Cain so angry that he could not hide his feelings .
CEV	Genesis	4	6	The Lord said to Cain : What 's wrong with you ? Why do you look so angry ?
CEV	Genesis	4	7	If you had done the right thing , you would be smiling . [ c ] But you did the wrong thing , and now sin is waiting to attack you like a lion . Sin wants to destroy you , but do n't let it !
CEV	Genesis	4	8	( B ) Cain said to his brother Abel , “ Let 's go for a walk. ” [ d ] And when they were out in a field , Cain attacked and killed him .
CEV	Genesis	4	9	Afterwards the Lord asked Cain , “ Where is Abel ? ” “ How should I know ? ” he answered . “ Am I supposed to look after my brother ? ”
CEV	Genesis	4	10	( C ) Then the Lord said : Why have you done this terrible thing ? You killed your own brother , and his blood flowed onto the ground . Now his blood is calling out for me to punish you .
CEV	Genesis	4	11	And so , I 'll put you under a curse . Because you killed Abel and made his blood run out on the ground , you will never be able to farm it again .
CEV	Genesis	4	12	When you try to farm the land , it wo n't produce anything for you . From now on , you 'll be without a home , and you 'll spend the rest of your life wandering from place to place .
CEV	Genesis	4	13	“ This punishment is too hard ! ” Cain said .
CEV	Genesis	4	14	“ You 're making me leave my home and live far from you . [ e ] I will have to wander about without a home , and just anyone could kill me. ”
CEV	Genesis	4	15	“ No ! ” [ f ] the Lord answered . “ Anyone who kills you will be punished seven times worse than I am punishing you. ” So the Lord put a mark on Cain to warn everyone not to kill him .
CEV	Genesis	4	16	But Cain had to go far from the Lord and live in the Land of Wandering , [ g ] which is east of Eden . More and More People
CEV	Genesis	4	17	Later , Cain and his wife had a son named Enoch . At the time Cain was building a town , and so he named it Enoch after his son .
CEV	Genesis	4	18	Then Enoch had a son named Irad , who had a son named Mehujael , who had a son named Methushael , who had a son named Lamech .
CEV	Genesis	4	19	Lamech married Adah , then Zillah . 20-21 Lamech and Adah had two sons , Jabal and Jubal . Their son Jabal was the first to live in tents and raise sheep and goats . Jubal was the first to play harps and flutes .
CEV	Genesis	4	22	Lamech and Zillah had a son named Tubal Cain who made tools out of bronze and iron . They also had a daughter , whose name was Naamah .
CEV	Genesis	4	23	One day , Lamech said to his two wives , “ A young man wounded me , and I killed him .
CEV	Genesis	4	24	Anyone who tries to get even with me will be punished ten times more than anyone who tries to get even with Cain. ”
CEV	Genesis	4	25	Adam and his wife had another son . They named him Seth , because they said , “ God has given [ h ] us a son to take the place of Abel , who was killed by his brother Cain. ”
CEV	Genesis	4	26	Later , Seth had a son and named him Enosh . About this time people started worshiping the Lord .

CEV	Genesis	13	5	Lot , who was traveling with him , also had sheep , goats , and cattle , as well as his own family and slaves . 6-7 At this time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were still living in the same area , and so there was n't enough pastureland left for Abram and Lot with all of their animals . Besides this , the men who took care of Abram 's animals and the ones who took care of Lot 's animals started quarreling .
CEV	Genesis	13	8	Abram said to Lot , “ We are close relatives . We should n't argue , and our men should n't be fighting one another .
CEV	Genesis	13	9	There is plenty of land for you to choose from . Let 's separate . If you go north , I 'll go south ; if you go south , I 'll go north. ”
CEV	Genesis	13	10	( A ) This happened before the Lord had destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . And when Lot looked around , he saw there was plenty of water in the Jordan Valley . All the way to Zoar the valley was as green as the garden of the Lord or the land of Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	13	11	So Lot chose the whole Jordan Valley for himself , and as he started out toward the east , he and Abram separated .
CEV	Genesis	13	12	Abram stayed in the land of Canaan . But Lot settled near the cities of the valley and put up his tents not far from Sodom ,

CEV	Genesis	13	15	( B ) I will give you and your family all the land you can see . It will be theirs forever !
CEV	Genesis	13	16	I will give you more descendants than there are specks of dust on the earth , and someday it will be easier to count those specks of dust than to count your descendants .
CEV	Genesis	13	17	Now walk back and forth across the land , because I am going to give it to you .

CEV	Genesis	14	7	They went back to the city of Enmishpat , better known as Kadesh . Then they captured all the land that belonged to the Amalekites , and they defeated the Amorites who were living in Hazazon-Tamar . 8-9 At Siddim Valley , the armies of the kings of Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , Zeboiim , and Bela fought the armies of King Chedorlaomer of Elam , King Tidal of Goiim , King Amraphel of Babylonia , and King Arioch of Ellasar . The valley
CEV	Genesis	14	10	was full of tar pits , and when the troops from Sodom and Gomorrah started running away , some of them fell into the pits . Others escaped to the hill country .
CEV	Genesis	14	11	Their enemies took everything of value from Sodom and Gomorrah , including their food supplies .
CEV	Genesis	14	12	They also captured Abram 's nephew Lot , who lived in Sodom . They took him and his possessions and then left .

CEV	Genesis	14	18	( A ) King Melchizedek of Salem was a priest of God Most High . He brought out some bread and wine
CEV	Genesis	14	19	and said to Abram : “ I bless you in the name of God Most High , Creator of heaven and earth .
CEV	Genesis	14	20	All praise belongs to God Most High for helping you defeat your enemies. ” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything .
CEV	Genesis	14	21	The king of Sodom said to Abram , “ All I want are my people . You can keep everything else. ”
CEV	Genesis	14	22	Abram answered : The Lord God Most High made the heavens and the earth . And I have promised him

CEV	Genesis	17	19	But God answered : No ! You and Sarah will have a son . His name will be Isaac , [ c ] and I will make an everlasting promise to him and his descendants .

CEV	Genesis	18	2	( A ) Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby . He quickly ran to meet them , bowed with his face to the ground ,
CEV	Genesis	18	3	and said , “ Please come to my home where I can serve you .
CEV	Genesis	18	4	I 'll have some water brought , so you can wash your feet , then you can rest under a tree .
CEV	Genesis	18	5	Let me get you some food to give you strength before you leave . I would be honored to serve you. ” “ Thank you very much , ” they answered . “ We accept your offer. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	6	Abraham went quickly to his tent and said to Sarah , “ Hurry ! Get a large sack of flour and make some bread. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	7	After saying this , he rushed off to his herd of cattle and picked out one of the best calves , which his servant quickly prepared .
CEV	Genesis	18	8	He then served his guests some yogurt and milk together with the meat . While they were eating , he stood near them under the tree ,
CEV	Genesis	18	9	and they asked , “ Where 's your wife Sarah ? ” “ She is right there in the tent , ” Abraham answered .
CEV	Genesis	18	10	good people , ” the Lord told him , “ I still wo n't destroy the city. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	11	Abraham and Sarah were very old , and Sarah was well past the age for having children .
CEV	Genesis	18	12	( C ) So she laughed and said to herself , “ Now that I am worn out and my husband is old , will I really know such happiness ? ” [ a ]
CEV	Genesis	18	13	The Lord asked Abraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh ? Does she doubt that she can have a child in her old age ?
CEV	Genesis	18	14	( D ) I am the Lord ! There is nothing too difficult for me . I 'll come back next year at the time I promised , and Sarah will already have a son. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	15	Sarah was so frightened that she lied and said , “ I did n't laugh. ” “ Yes , you did ! ” he answered . Abraham Prays for Sodom
CEV	Genesis	18	16	When the three men got ready to leave , they looked down toward Sodom , and Abraham walked part of the way with them .
CEV	Genesis	18	17	The Lord said to himself , “ I should tell Abraham what I am going to do ,
CEV	Genesis	18	19	I have chosen him to teach his family to obey me forever and to do what is right and fair . If they do , I will give Abraham many descendants , just as I promised. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	20	? ” “ Because of them , I wo n't destroy the city , ” was the Lord 's answer .
CEV	Genesis	18	21	Now I am going down to see for myself if those people really are that bad . If they are n't , I would like to know. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	22	The men turned and started toward Sodom . But the Lord stayed with Abraham .
CEV	Genesis	18	23	And Abraham asked him , “ Lord , when you destroy the evil people , are you also going to destroy those who are good ?
CEV	Genesis	18	24	Would n't you spare the city if there are only
CEV	Genesis	18	50	good people in Sodom , I will save the city to keep them from being killed. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	25	You surely would n't let them be killed when you destroy the evil ones . You are the judge of all the earth , and you do what is right. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	26	The Lord replied , “ If I find
CEV	Genesis	18	27	Abraham answered , “ I am nothing more than the dust of the earth . Please forgive me , Lord , for daring to speak to you like this .
CEV	Genesis	18	28	But suppose there are only
CEV	Genesis	18	45	good people , ” the Lord replied , “ I wo n't destroy the city. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	29	“ Suppose there are just
CEV	Genesis	18	40	good people ? ” Abraham asked . “ Even for them , ” the Lord replied , “ I wo n't destroy the city. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	30	, ” the Lord replied , “ I still wo n't destroy it. ”
CEV	Genesis	18	31	Then Abraham said , “ I do n't have any right to ask you , Lord , but what would you do if you find only
CEV	Genesis	18	32	Finally , Abraham said , “ Please do n't get angry , Lord , if I speak just once more . Suppose you find only

CEV	Genesis	19	19	That evening , while Lot was sitting near the city gate , [ a ] the two angels [ b ] arrived in Sodom . When Lot saw them , he got up , bowed down low ,
CEV	Genesis	19	2	and said , “ Gentlemen , I am your servant . Please come to my home . You can wash your feet , spend the night , and be on your way in the morning. ” They told him , “ No , we 'll spend the night in the city square. ”
CEV	Genesis	19	3	But Lot kept insisting , until they finally agreed and went home with him . He quickly baked some bread , [ c ] cooked a meal , and they ate .
CEV	Genesis	19	4	Before Lot and his guests could go to bed , every man in Sodom , young and old , came and stood outside his house
CEV	Genesis	19	5	( A ) and started shouting , “ Where are your visitors ? Send them out , so we can have sex with them ! ”
CEV	Genesis	19	6	Lot went outside and shut the door behind him .
CEV	Genesis	19	7	Then he said , “ Friends , please do n't do such a terrible thing !
CEV	Genesis	19	8	I have two daughters who have never had sex . I 'll bring them out , and you can do what you want with them . But do n't harm these men . They are guests in my home. ”
CEV	Genesis	19	9	“ Do n't get in our way , ” the crowd answered . “ You 're a foreigner . What right do you have to order us around ? We 'll do worse things to you than we 're going to do to them. ” The crowd kept arguing with Lot . Finally , they rushed toward the door to break it down .
CEV	Genesis	19	10	But the two angels in the house reached out and pulled Lot safely inside .
CEV	Genesis	19	11	( B ) Then they struck blind everyone in the crowd , and none of them could even find the door . 12-13 The two angels said to Lot , “ The Lord has heard many terrible things about the people of Sodom , and he has sent us here to destroy the city . Take your family and leave . Take every relative you have in the city , as well as the men your daughters are going to marry. ”
CEV	Genesis	19	14	Lot went to the men who were engaged to his daughters and said , “ Hurry up and get out of here ! The Lord is going to destroy this city. ” But they thought he was joking , and they laughed at him .
CEV	Genesis	19	15	Early the next morning the two angels tried to make Lot hurry and leave . They said , “ Take your wife and your two daughters and get away from here as fast as you can ! If you do n't , every one of you will be killed when the Lord destroys the city. ”
CEV	Genesis	19	16	( C ) At first , Lot just stood there . But the Lord wanted to save him . So the angels took Lot , his wife , and his two daughters by the hand and led them out of the city .
CEV	Genesis	19	17	When they were outside , one of the angels said , “ Run for your lives ! Do n't even look back . And do n't stop in the valley . Run to the hills , where you 'll be safe. ” 18-19 Lot answered , “ You have done us a great favor , sir . You have saved our lives , but please do n't make us go to the hills . That 's too far away . The city will be destroyed before we can get there , and we will be killed when it happens .
CEV	Genesis	19	20	There 's a town near here . It 's only a small place , but my family and I will be safe , if you let us go there. ”
CEV	Genesis	19	21	“ All right , go there , ” he answered . “ I wo n't destroy that town .
CEV	Genesis	19	22	Hurry ! Run ! I ca n't do anything until you are safely there. ” The town was later called Zoar [ d ] because Lot had said it was small . Sodom and Gomorrah Are Destroyed
CEV	Genesis	19	23	The sun was coming up as Lot reached the town of Zoar ,
CEV	Genesis	19	24	( D ) and the Lord sent burning sulfur down like rain on Sodom and Gomorrah .
CEV	Genesis	19	25	He destroyed those cities and everyone who lived in them , as well as their land and the trees and grass that grew there .
CEV	Genesis	19	26	( E ) On the way , Lot 's wife looked back and was turned into a block of salt .
CEV	Genesis	19	27	That same morning Abraham got up and went to the place where he had stood and spoken with the Lord .
CEV	Genesis	19	28	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw smoke rising from all over the land—it was like a flaming furnace .
CEV	Genesis	19	29	When God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot lived , he remembered his promise to Abraham and saved Lot from the terrible destruction . Moab and Ammon
CEV	Genesis	19	30	Lot was afraid to stay on in Zoar . So he took his two daughters and moved to a cave in the hill country .
CEV	Genesis	19	31	One day his older daughter said to her sister , “ Our father is old , and there are no men anywhere for us to marry .
CEV	Genesis	19	32	Let 's get our father drunk ! Then we can sleep with him and have children. ”
CEV	Genesis	19	33	That night they got their father drunk , and the older daughter got in bed with him , but he was too drunk even to know she was there .
CEV	Genesis	19	34	The next day the older daughter said to her sister , “ I slept with my father last night . We 'll get him drunk again tonight , so you can sleep with him , and we can each have a child. ”
CEV	Genesis	19	35	That night they got their father drunk , and this time the younger sister slept with him . But once again he was too drunk even to know she was there .
CEV	Genesis	19	36	That 's how Lot 's two daughters had children .
CEV	Genesis	19	37	The older daughter named her son Moab , [ e ] and he is the ancestor of the Moabites .
CEV	Genesis	19	38	The younger daughter named her son Benammi , [ f ] and he is the ancestor of the Ammonites .

CEV	Genesis	20	20	Abraham moved to the Southern Desert , where he settled between Kadesh and Shur . Later he went to Gerar , and while there
CEV	Genesis	20	2	( A ) he told everyone that his wife Sarah was his sister . So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him .
CEV	Genesis	20	3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream and said , “ You have taken a married woman into your home , and for this you will die ! ” 4-5 Abimelech said to the Lord , “ Do n't kill me ! I have n't slept with Sarah . Did n't they say they were brother and sister ? I am completely innocent. ”
CEV	Genesis	20	6	Then God continued : I know you are innocent . That 's why I kept you from sleeping with Sarah and doing anything wrong .
CEV	Genesis	20	7	Her husband is a prophet . Let her go back to him , and his prayers will save you from death . But if you do n't return her , you and all your people will die .
CEV	Genesis	20	8	Early the next morning Abimelech sent for his officials , and when he told them what had happened , they were frightened .
CEV	Genesis	20	9	Abimelech then called in Abraham and said : Look what you 've done to us ! What have I ever done to you ? Why did you make me and my nation guilty of such a terrible sin ?
CEV	Genesis	20	10	What were you thinking when you did this ?
CEV	Genesis	20	11	Abraham answered : I did it because I did n't think any of you respected God , and I was sure that someone would kill me to get my wife .
CEV	Genesis	20	12	Besides , she is my half sister . We have the same father , but different mothers .
CEV	Genesis	20	13	When God made us leave my father 's home and start wandering , I told her , “ If you really love me , then tell everyone that I am your brother. ”
CEV	Genesis	20	14	After Abimelech had given Abraham some sheep , cattle , and slaves , he sent Sarah back
CEV	Genesis	20	15	and told Abraham he could settle anywhere in his country .
CEV	Genesis	20	16	Then he said to Sarah , “ I have given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver as proof to everyone that you have done nothing wrong. ” [ a ] 17-18 Meanwhile , God had kept Abimelech 's wife and slaves from having children . But Abraham prayed , and God let them start having children again . Footnotes - 20.16 as proof … wrong : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text . Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	21	21	The Lord was good to Sarah and kept his promise .
CEV	Genesis	21	2	( A ) Although Abraham was very old , Sarah had a son exactly at the time God had said .
CEV	Genesis	21	3	Abraham named his son Isaac ,
CEV	Genesis	21	4	( B ) and when the boy was eight days old , Abraham circumcised him , just as God had commanded .
CEV	Genesis	21	5	Abraham was
CEV	Genesis	21	100	years old when Isaac was born ,
CEV	Genesis	21	6	and Sarah said , “ God has made me laugh . [ a ] And now everyone will laugh with me .
CEV	Genesis	21	7	Who would have dared to tell Abraham that someday I would have a child ? But in his old age , I have given him a son. ”
CEV	Genesis	21	8	The time came when Sarah no longer had to nurse Isaac , [ b ] and on that day Abraham gave a big feast . Hagar and Ishmael Are Sent Away 9-10 ( C ) One day , Sarah noticed Hagar 's son Ishmael [ c ] playing , [ d ] and she said to Abraham , “ Get rid of that Egyptian slave woman and her son ! I do n't want him to inherit anything . It should all go to my son. ” [ e ]
CEV	Genesis	21	11	Abraham was worried about Ishmael .
CEV	Genesis	21	12	( D ) But God said , “ Abraham , do n't worry about your slave woman and the boy . Just do what Sarah tells you . Isaac will inherit your family name ,
CEV	Genesis	21	13	but the son of the slave woman is also your son , and I will make his descendants into a great nation. ”
CEV	Genesis	21	14	Early the next morning Abraham gave Hagar an animal skin full of water and some bread . Then he put the boy on her shoulder and sent them away . They wandered around in the desert near Beersheba ,
CEV	Genesis	21	15	and after they had run out of water , Hagar put her son under a bush .
CEV	Genesis	21	16	Then she sat down a long way off , because she could not bear to watch him die . And she cried bitterly .
CEV	Genesis	21	17	When God heard the boy crying , the angel of God called out to Hagar from heaven and said , “ Hagar , why are you worried ? Do n't be afraid . I have heard your son crying .
CEV	Genesis	21	18	Help him up and hold his hand , because I will make him the father of a great nation. ”
CEV	Genesis	21	19	Then God let her see a well . So she went to the well and filled the skin with water , then gave some to her son . 20-21 God blessed Ishmael , and as the boy grew older , he became an expert at hunting with his bow and arrows . He lived in the Paran Desert , and his mother chose an Egyptian woman for him to marry . A Peace Treaty
CEV	Genesis	21	22	( E ) About this time Abimelech and his army commander Phicol said to Abraham , “ God blesses everything you do !
CEV	Genesis	21	23	Now I want you to promise in the name of God that you will always be loyal to me and my descendants , just as I have always been loyal to you in this land where you have lived as a foreigner. ”
CEV	Genesis	21	24	And so , Abraham promised he would .
CEV	Genesis	21	25	One day , Abraham told Abimelech , “ Some of your servants have taken over one of my wells. ”
CEV	Genesis	21	26	“ This is the first I 've heard about it , ” Abimelech replied . “ Why have n't you said something before ? I do n't have any idea who did it. ”
CEV	Genesis	21	27	Abraham gave Abimelech some sheep and cattle , then the two men made a peace treaty .
CEV	Genesis	21	28	Abraham separated seven female lambs from his flock of sheep ,
CEV	Genesis	21	29	and Abimelech asked , “ Why have you done this ? ”
CEV	Genesis	21	30	Abraham replied , “ I want you to accept these seven lambs as proof that I dug this well. ”
CEV	Genesis	21	31	So they called the place Beersheba , [ f ] because they made a treaty there .
CEV	Genesis	21	32	When the treaty was completed , Abimelech and his army commander Phicol went back to the land of the Philistines .
CEV	Genesis	21	33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree [ g ] in Beersheba and worshiped the eternal Lord God .
CEV	Genesis	21	34	Then Abraham lived a long time as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines .

CEV	Genesis	22	22	( A ) Some years later God decided to test Abraham , so he spoke to him . Abraham answered , “ Here I am , Lord. ”
CEV	Genesis	22	2	( B ) The Lord said , “ Go get Isaac , your only son , the one you dearly love ! Take him to the land of Moriah , and I will show you a mountain where you must sacrifice him to me on the fires of an altar. ”
CEV	Genesis	22	3	So Abraham got up early the next morning and chopped wood for the fire . He put a saddle on his donkey and set out with Isaac and two servants for the place where God had told him to go .
CEV	Genesis	22	4	Three days later Abraham looked off in the distance and saw the place .
CEV	Genesis	22	5	He told his servants , “ Stay here with the donkey , while my son and I go over there to worship . We will come back. ”
CEV	Genesis	22	6	Abraham put the wood on Isaac 's shoulder , but he carried the hot coals and the knife . As the two of them walked along , 7-8 Isaac said , “ Father , we have the coals and the wood , but where is the lamb for the sacrifice ? ” “ My son , ” Abraham answered , “ God will provide the lamb. ” The two of them walked on , and
CEV	Genesis	22	9	( C ) when they reached the place that God had told him about , Abraham built an altar and placed the wood on it . Next , he tied up his son and put him on the wood .
CEV	Genesis	22	10	( D ) He then took the knife and got ready to kill his son .
CEV	Genesis	22	11	But the Lord 's angel shouted from heaven , “ Abraham ! Abraham ! ” “ Here I am ! ” he answered .
CEV	Genesis	22	12	“ Do n't hurt the boy or harm him in any way ! ” the angel said . “ Now I know that you truly obey God , because you were willing to offer him your only son. ”
CEV	Genesis	22	13	Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in the bushes . So he took the ram and sacrificed it instead of his son .
CEV	Genesis	22	14	Abraham named that place “ The Lord Will Provide. ” And even now people say , “ On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided. ” [ a ]
CEV	Genesis	22	15	The Lord 's angel called out from heaven a second time :
CEV	Genesis	22	16	( E ) You were willing to offer your only son to the Lord , and so he makes you this solemn promise ,
CEV	Genesis	22	17	( F ) “ I will bless you and give you such a large family , that someday your descendants will be more numerous than the stars in the sky or the grains of sand along the seashore . They will defeat their enemies and take over the cities where their enemies live .
CEV	Genesis	22	18	( G ) You have obeyed me , and so you and your descendants will be a blessing to all nations on earth. ”
CEV	Genesis	22	19	Abraham and Isaac went back to the servants who had come with him , and they returned to Abraham 's home in Beersheba . The Children of Nahor 20-23 Abraham 's brother Nahor had married Milcah , and Abraham was later told that they had eight sons . Uz was their first-born ; Buz was next , and then there was Kemuel the father of Aram ; their other five sons were : Chesed , Hazo , Pildash , Jidlaph , and Bethuel the father of Rebekah .
CEV	Genesis	22	24	Nahor also had another wife . [ b ] Her name was Reumah , and she had four sons : Tebah , Gaham , Tahash , and Maacah . Footnotes Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	23	23	1-2 When Sarah was
CEV	Genesis	23	127	years old , she died in Kiriath-Arba , better known as Hebron , in the land of Canaan . After Abraham had mourned for her ,
CEV	Genesis	23	3	he went to the Hittites and said ,
CEV	Genesis	23	4	( A ) “ I live as a foreigner in your land , and I do n't own any property where I can bury my wife . Please let me buy a piece of land. ” 5-6 “ Sir , ” they answered , “ you are an important man . Choose the best place to bury your wife . None of us would refuse you a resting place for your dead. ”
CEV	Genesis	23	7	Abraham bowed down
CEV	Genesis	23	8	and replied , “ If you are willing to let me bury my wife here , please ask Zohar 's son Ephron
CEV	Genesis	23	9	to sell me Machpelah Cave at the end of his field . I 'll pay what it 's worth , and all of you can be witnesses. ”
CEV	Genesis	23	10	Ephron was sitting there near the city gate , when Abraham made this request , and he answered ,
CEV	Genesis	23	11	“ Sir , the whole field , including the cave , is yours . With my own people as witnesses , I freely give it to you as a burial place for your dead. ”
CEV	Genesis	23	12	Once again , Abraham bowed down
CEV	Genesis	23	13	and said to Ephron , “ In front of these witnesses , I offer you the full price , so I can bury my wife . Please accept my offer. ” 14-15 “ But sir , ” the man replied , “ the property is worth only
CEV	Genesis	23	400	pieces of silver in front of everyone at the city gate . That 's how Abraham came to own Ephron 's property east of Mamre , [ a ] which included the field with all of its trees , as well as Machpelah Cave at the end of the field .
CEV	Genesis	23	19	So Abraham buried his wife Sarah in Machpelah Cave that was in the field

CEV	Genesis	24	24	She answered , “ My father is Bethuel , the son of Nahor and Milcah .
CEV	Genesis	24	2	One day , Abraham called in his most trusted servant and said to him , “ Solemnly promise me
CEV	Genesis	24	3	in the name of the Lord , who rules heaven and earth , that you wo n't choose a wife for my son Isaac from the people here in the land of Canaan .
CEV	Genesis	24	4	Instead , go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for him from among my relatives. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	5	But the servant asked , “ What if the young woman I choose refuses to leave home and come here with me ? Should I send Isaac there to look for a wife ? ”
CEV	Genesis	24	6	“ No ! ” Abraham answered . “ Do n't ever do that , no matter what .
CEV	Genesis	24	7	The Lord who rules heaven brought me here from the land where I was born and promised that he would give this land to my descendants forever . When you go back there , the Lord will send his angel ahead of you to help you find a wife for my son .
CEV	Genesis	24	8	If the woman refuses to come along , you do n't have to keep this promise . But do n't ever take my son back there. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	9	So the servant gave Abraham his word that he would do everything he had been told to do .
CEV	Genesis	24	10	Soon after that , the servant loaded ten of Abraham 's camels with valuable gifts . Then he set out for the city in northern Syria , [ a ] where Abraham 's brother Nahor lived .
CEV	Genesis	24	11	When he got there , he let the camels rest near the well outside the city . It was late afternoon , the time when the women came out for water .
CEV	Genesis	24	12	The servant prayed : You , Lord , are the God my master Abraham worships . Please keep your promise to him and let me find a wife for Isaac today .
CEV	Genesis	24	13	The young women of the city will soon come to this well for water ,
CEV	Genesis	24	14	and I 'll ask one of them for a drink . If she gives me a drink and then offers to get some water for my camels , I 'll know she is the one you have chosen and that you have kept your promise to my master . 15-16 While he was still praying , a beautiful unmarried young woman came by with a water jar on her shoulder . She was Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel , the son of Abraham 's brother Nahor and his wife Milcah . Rebekah walked past Abraham 's servant , then went over to the well , and filled her water jar . When she started back ,
CEV	Genesis	24	17	Abraham 's servant ran to her and said , “ Please let me have a drink of water. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	18	“ I 'll be glad to , ” she answered . Then she quickly took the jar from her shoulder and held it while he drank . 19-20 After he had finished , she said , “ Now I 'll give your camels all the water they want. ” She quickly poured out water for them , and she kept going back for more , until his camels had drunk all they wanted .
CEV	Genesis	24	21	Abraham 's servant did not say a word , but he watched everything Rebekah did , because he wanted to know for certain if this was the woman the Lord had chosen .
CEV	Genesis	24	22	The servant had brought along an expensive gold ring and two large gold bracelets . When Rebekah had finished bringing the water , he gave her the ring for her nose [ b ] and the bracelets for her arms .
CEV	Genesis	24	23	Then he said , “ Please tell me who your father is . Does he have room in his house for me and my men to spend the night ? ”
CEV	Genesis	24	25	We have a place where you and your men can stay , and we also have enough straw and feed for your camels. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	26	Then the servant bowed his head and prayed ,
CEV	Genesis	24	27	“ I thank you , Lord God of my master Abraham ! You have led me to his relatives and kept your promise to him. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	28	Rebekah ran straight home and told her family everything . 29-30 Her brother Laban heard her tell what the servant had said , and he saw the ring and the bracelets she was wearing . So Laban ran out to Abraham 's servant , who was standing by his camels at the well .
CEV	Genesis	24	31	Then Laban said , “ The Lord has brought you safely here . Come home with me . There 's no need for you to keep on standing outside . I have a room ready for you in our house , and there 's also a place for your camels. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	32	Abraham 's servant went home with Laban , where Laban 's servants unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed . Then they brought water into the house , so Abraham 's servant and his men could wash their feet .
CEV	Genesis	24	33	After that , they brought in food . But the servant said , “ Before I eat , I must tell you why I have come. ” “ Go ahead and tell us , ” Laban answered .
CEV	Genesis	24	34	The servant explained : I am Abraham 's servant .
CEV	Genesis	24	35	The Lord has been good to my master and has made him very rich . He has given him many sheep , goats , cattle , camels , and donkeys , as well as a lot of silver and gold , and many slaves .
CEV	Genesis	24	36	Sarah , my master 's wife , did n't have any children until she was very old . Then she had a son , and my master has given him everything .
CEV	Genesis	24	37	I solemnly promised my master that I would do what he said . And he told me , “ Do n't choose a wife for my son from the women in this land of Canaan .
CEV	Genesis	24	38	Instead , go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for my son from among my relatives. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	39	I asked my master , “ What if the young woman refuses to come with me ? ”
CEV	Genesis	24	40	My master answered , “ I have always obeyed the Lord , and he will send his angel to help you find my son a wife from among my own relatives .
CEV	Genesis	24	41	But if they refuse to let her come back with you , then you are freed from your promise. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	42	When I came to the well today , I silently prayed , “ You , Lord , are the God my master Abraham worships , so please lead me to a wife for his son
CEV	Genesis	24	43	while I am here at the well . When a young woman comes out to get water , I 'll ask her to give me a drink .
CEV	Genesis	24	44	If she gives me a drink and offers to get some water for my camels , I 'll know she is the one you have chosen. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	45	Even before I had finished praying , Rebekah came by with a water jar on her shoulder . When she had filled the jar , I asked her for a drink .
CEV	Genesis	24	46	She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and said , “ Have a drink . Then I 'll get water for your camels. ” So I drank , and after that she got some water for my camels .
CEV	Genesis	24	47	I asked her who her father was , and she answered , “ My father is Bethuel the son of Nahor and Milcah. ” At once I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms .
CEV	Genesis	24	48	Then I bowed my head and gave thanks to the God my master Abraham worships . The Lord had led me straight to my master 's relatives , and I had found a wife for his son .
CEV	Genesis	24	49	Now please tell me if you are willing to do the right thing for my master . Will you treat him fairly , or do I have to look for another young woman ?
CEV	Genesis	24	50	Laban and Bethuel answered , “ The Lord has done this . We have no choice in the matter .
CEV	Genesis	24	51	Take Rebekah with you ; she can marry your master 's son , just as the Lord has said. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	52	Abraham 's servant bowed down and thanked the Lord .
CEV	Genesis	24	53	Then he gave clothing , as well as silver and gold jewelry , to Rebekah . He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and her mother .
CEV	Genesis	24	54	Abraham 's servant and the men with him ate and drank , then spent the night there . The next morning they got up , and the servant told Rebekah 's mother and brother , “ I would like to go back to my master now. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	55	“ Let Rebekah stay with us for a week or ten days , ” they answered . “ Then she may go. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	56	But he said , “ Do n't make me stay any longer . The Lord has already helped me find a wife for my master 's son . Now let us return. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	57	They answered , “ Let 's ask Rebekah what she wants to do. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	58	They called her and asked , “ Are you willing to leave with this man at once ? ” “ Yes , ” she answered .
CEV	Genesis	24	59	So they agreed to let Rebekah and an old family servant woman [ c ] leave immediately with Abraham 's servant and his men .
CEV	Genesis	24	60	They gave Rebekah their blessing and said , “ We pray that God will give you many children and grandchildren and that he will help them defeat their enemies. ”
CEV	Genesis	24	61	Afterwards , Rebekah and the young women who were to travel with her prepared to leave . Then they got on camels and left with Abraham 's servant and his men .
CEV	Genesis	24	62	At that time Isaac was living in the southern part of Canaan near a place called “ The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me. ” [ d ] 63-65 One evening he was walking [ e ] out in the fields , when suddenly he saw a group of people approaching on camels . So he started toward them . Rebekah saw him coming ; she got down from her camel , and asked , “ Who is that man ? ” “ He is my master Isaac , ” the servant answered . Then Rebekah covered her face with her veil . [ f ]
CEV	Genesis	24	66	The servant told Isaac everything that had happened .
CEV	Genesis	24	67	Isaac took Rebekah into the tent [ g ] where his mother had lived before she died , and Rebekah became his wife . He loved her and was comforted over the loss of his mother .

CEV	Genesis	25	22	Before Rebekah gave birth , she knew she was going to have twins , because she could feel them inside her , fighting each other . She thought , “ Why is this happening to me ? ” Finally , she asked the Lord why her twins were fighting ,
CEV	Genesis	25	23	( B ) and he told her : “ Your two sons will become two separate nations . [ f ] The younger of the two will be stronger , and the older son will be his servant. ”

CEV	Genesis	26	26	( C ) Meanwhile , Abimelech had left Gerar and was taking his advisor Ahuzzath and his army commander Phicol to see Isaac .
CEV	Genesis	26	2	because the Lord had appeared to Isaac and said : Isaac , stay away from Egypt ! I will show you where I want you to go .
CEV	Genesis	26	3	( A ) You will live there as a foreigner , but I will be with you and bless you . I will keep my promise to your father Abraham by giving this land to you and your descendants .
CEV	Genesis	26	4	I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky , and I will give your descendants all of this land . They will be a blessing to every nation on earth , [ a ]
CEV	Genesis	26	5	because Abraham did everything I told him to do .
CEV	Genesis	26	6	Isaac moved to Gerar
CEV	Genesis	26	7	( B ) with his beautiful wife Rebekah . He was afraid that someone might kill him to get her , and so he told everyone that Rebekah was his sister .
CEV	Genesis	26	8	After Isaac had been there a long time , King Abimelech looked out a window and saw Isaac hugging and kissing Rebekah .
CEV	Genesis	26	9	Abimelech called him in and said , “ Rebekah must be your wife ! Why did you say she is your sister ? ” “ Because I thought someone would kill me , ” Isaac answered .
CEV	Genesis	26	10	“ Do n't you know what you 've done ? ” Abimelech exclaimed . “ If someone had slept with her , you would have made our whole nation guilty ! ”
CEV	Genesis	26	11	Then Abimelech warned his people that anyone who even touched Isaac or Rebekah would be put to death .
CEV	Genesis	26	12	Isaac planted grain and had a good harvest that same year . The Lord blessed him ,
CEV	Genesis	26	13	and Isaac was so successful that he became very rich .
CEV	Genesis	26	14	In fact , the Philistines were jealous of the large number of sheep , goats , and slaves that Isaac owned ,
CEV	Genesis	26	15	and they stopped up the wells that Abraham 's servants had dug before his death .
CEV	Genesis	26	16	Finally , Abimelech said , “ Isaac , I want you to leave our country . You have become too powerful to stay here. ”
CEV	Genesis	26	17	Isaac left and settled in Gerar Valley ,
CEV	Genesis	26	18	where he cleaned out those wells that the Philistines had stopped up . Isaac also gave each of the wells the same name [ b ] that Abraham had given to them .
CEV	Genesis	26	19	While his servants were digging in the valley , they found a spring-fed well .
CEV	Genesis	26	20	But the shepherds of Gerar Valley quarreled with Isaac 's shepherds and claimed the water belonged to them . So this well was named “ Quarrel , ” because they had quarreled with Isaac .
CEV	Genesis	26	21	Isaac 's servants dug another well , and the shepherds also quarreled about it . So that well was named “ Jealous. ”
CEV	Genesis	26	22	Finally , they dug one more well . There was no quarreling this time , and the well was named “ Lots of Room , ” because the Lord had given them room and would make them very successful .
CEV	Genesis	26	23	Isaac went on to Beersheba ,
CEV	Genesis	26	24	where the Lord appeared to him that night and told him , “ Do n't be afraid ! I am the God who was worshiped by your father Abraham , my servant . I will be with you and bless you , and because of Abraham I will give you many descendants. ”
CEV	Genesis	26	25	Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the Lord . Then he set up camp , and his servants started digging a well .
CEV	Genesis	26	27	When they arrived , Isaac asked , “ Why are you here ? Did n't you send me away because you hated me ? ”
CEV	Genesis	26	28	They answered , “ We now know for certain that the Lord is with you , and we have decided there needs to be a peace treaty between you and us . So let 's make a solemn agreement
CEV	Genesis	26	29	not to harm each other . Remember , we have never hurt you , and when we sent you away , we let you go in peace . The Lord has truly blessed you. ”
CEV	Genesis	26	30	Isaac gave a big feast for them , and everyone ate and drank .
CEV	Genesis	26	31	Early the next morning Isaac and the others made a solemn agreement , then he let them go in peace .
CEV	Genesis	26	32	Later that same day Isaac 's servants came and said , “ We 've struck water ! ”
CEV	Genesis	26	33	So Isaac named the well Shibah , [ c ] and the town is still called Beersheba . [ d ] Esau 's Foreign Wives
CEV	Genesis	26	34	When Esau was
CEV	Genesis	26	40	years old , he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite .

CEV	Genesis	27	27	( A ) While Jacob was kissing him , Isaac caught the smell of his clothes and said : “ The smell of my son is like a field the Lord has blessed .
CEV	Genesis	27	2	Isaac replied , “ I am old and might die at any time .
CEV	Genesis	27	3	So go hunting with your bow and arrows and kill a wild animal .
CEV	Genesis	27	4	Cook some of that tasty food that I love so much and bring it to me . I want to eat it once more and give you my blessing before I die. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	5	Rebekah had been listening , and as soon as Esau left to go hunting ,
CEV	Genesis	27	6	she said to Jacob , “ I heard your father tell Esau
CEV	Genesis	27	7	to kill a wild animal and cook some tasty food for him before he dies . Your father said this because he wants to bless your brother with the Lord as his witness .
CEV	Genesis	27	8	Now , my son , listen carefully to what I want you to do .
CEV	Genesis	27	9	Go and kill two of your best young goats and bring them to me . I 'll cook the tasty food that your father loves so much .
CEV	Genesis	27	10	Then you can take it to him , so he can eat it and give you his blessing before he dies. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	11	“ My brother Esau is a hairy man , ” Jacob reminded her . “ And I am not .
CEV	Genesis	27	12	If my father touches me and realizes I am trying to trick him , he will put a curse on me instead of giving me a blessing. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	13	Rebekah insisted , “ Let his curse fall on me ! Just do what I say and bring me the meat. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	14	So Jacob brought the meat to his mother , and she cooked the tasty food that his father liked .
CEV	Genesis	27	15	Then she took Esau 's best clothes and put them on Jacob .
CEV	Genesis	27	16	She also covered the smooth part of his hands and neck with goatskins
CEV	Genesis	27	17	and gave him some bread and the tasty food she had cooked .
CEV	Genesis	27	18	Jacob went to his father and said , “ Father , here I am. ” “ Which one of my sons are you ? ” his father asked .
CEV	Genesis	27	19	Jacob replied , “ I am Esau , your first-born , and I have done what you told me . Please sit up and eat the meat I have brought . Then you can give me your blessing. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	20	Isaac asked , “ My son , how did you find an animal so quickly ? ” “ The Lord your God was kind to me , ” Jacob answered .
CEV	Genesis	27	21	“ My son , ” Isaac said , “ come closer , where I can touch you and find out if you really are Esau. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	22	Jacob went closer . His father touched him and said , “ You sound like Jacob , but your hands feel hairy like Esau's. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	23	And so Isaac blessed Jacob , thinking he was Esau .
CEV	Genesis	27	24	Isaac asked , “ Are you really my son Esau ? ” “ Yes , I am , ” Jacob answered .
CEV	Genesis	27	25	So Isaac told him , “ Serve me the wild meat , and I can give you my blessing. ” Jacob gave him some meat , and he ate it . He also gave him some wine , and he drank it .
CEV	Genesis	27	26	Then Isaac said , “ Son , come over here and kiss me. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	28	God will bless you , my son , with dew from heaven and with fertile fields , rich with grain and grapes .
CEV	Genesis	27	29	( B ) Nations will be your servants and bow down to you . You will rule over your brothers , and they will kneel at your feet . Anyone who curses you will be cursed ; anyone who blesses you will be blessed. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	30	Right after Isaac had given Jacob his blessing and Jacob had gone , Esau came back from hunting .
CEV	Genesis	27	31	He cooked the tasty food , brought it to his father , and said , “ Father , please sit up and eat the meat I have brought you , so you can give me your blessing. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	32	“ Who are you ? ” Isaac asked . “ I am Esau , your first-born son. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	33	Isaac started trembling and said , “ Then who brought me some wild meat right before you came in ? I ate it and gave him a blessing that can not be taken back. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	34	Esau cried out in great distress , “ Father , give me a blessing too ! ”
CEV	Genesis	27	35	Isaac answered , “ Your brother tricked me and stole your blessing. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	36	( C ) Esau replied , “ My brother deserves the name Jacob , [ a ] because he has already cheated me twice . The first time he cheated me out of my rights as the first-born son , and now he has cheated me out of my blessing. ” Then Esau asked his father , “ Do n't you have any blessing left for me ? ”
CEV	Genesis	27	37	“ My son , ” Isaac answered , “ I have made Jacob the ruler over you and your brothers , and all of you will be his servants . I have also promised him all the grain and grapes that he needs . There 's nothing left that I can do for you. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	38	( D ) “ Father , ” Esau asked , “ do n't you have more than one blessing ? You can surely give me a blessing too ! ” Then Esau started crying again .
CEV	Genesis	27	39	( E ) So his father said : “ Your home will be far from that fertile land , where dew comes down from the heavens .
CEV	Genesis	27	40	( F ) You will live by the power of your sword and be your brother 's slave . But when you decide to be free , you will break loose. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	41	Esau hated his brother Jacob because he had stolen the blessing that was supposed to be his . So he said to himself , “ Just as soon as my father dies , I 'll kill Jacob. ”
CEV	Genesis	27	42	( G ) When Rebekah found out what Esau planned to do , she sent for Jacob and told him , “ Son , your brother Esau is just waiting for a chance to kill you .
CEV	Genesis	27	43	Now listen carefully and do what I say . Go to the home of my brother Laban in Haran
CEV	Genesis	27	44	and stay with him for a while . When Esau stops being angry
CEV	Genesis	27	45	and forgets what you have done to him , I 'll send for you to come home . Why should I lose both of my sons on the same day ? ” [ b ]
CEV	Genesis	27	46	Rebekah later told Isaac , “ Those Hittite wives of Esau are making my life miserable ! If Jacob marries a Hittite woman , I 'd be better off dead. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	29	6	“ How is he ? ” Jacob asked . “ He 's fine , ” they answered . “ And here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep. ”
CEV	Genesis	29	7	Jacob told them , “ Look , the sun is still high up in the sky , and it 's too early to bring in the rest of the flocks . Water your sheep and take them back to the pasture. ”
CEV	Genesis	29	8	But they replied , “ We ca n't do that until they all get here , and the rock has been rolled away from the well. ”
CEV	Genesis	29	9	While Jacob was still talking with the men , his cousin Rachel came up with her father 's sheep .
CEV	Genesis	29	10	When Jacob saw her and his uncle 's sheep , he rolled the rock away and watered the sheep .
CEV	Genesis	29	11	He then kissed Rachel and started crying because he was so happy .
CEV	Genesis	29	12	He told her that he was the son of her aunt Rebekah , and she ran and told her father about him .
CEV	Genesis	29	13	As soon as Laban heard the news , he ran out to meet Jacob . He hugged and kissed him and brought him to his home , where Jacob told him everything that had happened .
CEV	Genesis	29	14	Laban said , “ You are my nephew , and you are like one of my own family. ” Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel After Jacob had been there for a month ,
CEV	Genesis	29	15	Laban said to him , “ You should n't have to work without pay , just because you are a relative of mine . What do you want me to give you ? ” 16-17 Laban had two daughters . Leah was older than Rachel , but her eyes did n't sparkle , [ a ] while Rachel was beautiful and had a good figure .
CEV	Genesis	29	18	Since Jacob was in love with Rachel , he answered , “ If you will let me marry Rachel , I 'll work seven years for you. ”
CEV	Genesis	29	19	Laban replied , “ It 's better for me to let you marry Rachel than for someone else to have her . So stay and work for me. ”
CEV	Genesis	29	20	Jacob worked seven years for Laban , but the time seemed like only a few days , because he loved Rachel so much .
CEV	Genesis	29	21	Jacob said to Laban , “ The time is up , and I want to marry Rachel now ! ”
CEV	Genesis	29	22	So Laban gave a big feast and invited all their neighbors .
CEV	Genesis	29	23	But that evening he brought Leah to Jacob , who married her and spent the night with her .
CEV	Genesis	29	24	Laban also gave Zilpah to Leah as her servant woman .
CEV	Genesis	29	25	The next morning Jacob found out that he had married Leah , and he asked Laban , “ Why did you do this to me ? Did n't I work to get Rachel ? Why did you trick me ? ”
CEV	Genesis	29	26	Laban replied , “ In our country the older daughter must get married first .
CEV	Genesis	29	27	After you spend this week [ b ] with Leah , you may also marry Rachel . But you will have to work for me another seven years. ” 28-30 At the end of the week of celebration , Laban let Jacob marry Rachel , and he gave her his servant woman Bilhah . Jacob loved Rachel more than he did Leah , but he had to work another seven years for Laban .
CEV	Genesis	29	31	The Lord knew that Jacob loved Rachel more than he did Leah , and so he gave children to Leah , but not to Rachel .
CEV	Genesis	29	32	Leah gave birth to a son and named him Reuben . [ c ] Then she said , “ The Lord has taken away my sorrow . Now my husband will love me more than he does Rachel. ”
CEV	Genesis	29	33	She had a second son and named him Simeon , [ d ] because she said , “ The Lord has heard that my husband does n't love me. ”
CEV	Genesis	29	34	When Leah 's third son was born , she said , “ Now my husband will hold me close. ” So this son was named Levi . [ e ]
CEV	Genesis	29	35	She had one more son and named him Judah , [ f ] because she said , “ I 'll praise the Lord ! ” Footnotes - 29.16,17 but her eyes did n't sparkle : Or “ and her eyes sparkled. ” - 29.27 this week : The wedding feast lasted for seven days ( see Judges 14.12,17 ) . - 29.32 Reuben : In Hebrew “ Reuben ” means , “ Look , a son ! ” - 29.33 Simeon : In Hebrew “ Simeon ” sounds like “ someone who hears. ” - 29.34 hold me close … Levi : In Hebrew “ Levi ” sounds like “ hold ( someone ) close. ” - 29.35 Judah : In Hebrew “ Judah ” sounds like “ praise. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	30	30	You did n't have much before I came , but the Lord has blessed everything I have ever done for you . Now it 's time for me to start looking out for my own family .
CEV	Genesis	30	2	But Jacob became upset with Rachel and answered , “ Do n't blame me ! I 'm not God. ”
CEV	Genesis	30	3	“ Here , take my servant Bilhah , ” Rachel told him . “ Have children by her , and I 'll let them be born on my knees to show that they are mine. ”
CEV	Genesis	30	4	Then Rachel let Jacob marry Bilhah ,
CEV	Genesis	30	5	and they had a son .
CEV	Genesis	30	6	Rachel named him Dan , [ a ] because she said , “ God has answered my prayers . He judged in my favor and has given me a son. ”
CEV	Genesis	30	7	When Bilhah and Jacob had a second son ,
CEV	Genesis	30	8	Rachel said , “ I 've struggled hard with my sister , and I 've won ! ” So she named the boy Naphtali . [ b ]
CEV	Genesis	30	9	When Leah realized she could not have any more children , she let Jacob marry her servant Zilpah ,
CEV	Genesis	30	10	and they had a son .
CEV	Genesis	30	11	“ I 'm really lucky , ” Leah said , and she named the boy Gad . [ c ]
CEV	Genesis	30	12	When they had another son ,
CEV	Genesis	30	13	Leah exclaimed , “ I 'm happy now , and all the women will say how happy I am. ” So she named him Asher . [ d ] Love Flowers
CEV	Genesis	30	14	During the time of the wheat harvest , Reuben found some love flowers [ e ] and took them to his mother Leah . Rachel asked Leah for some of them ,
CEV	Genesis	30	15	but Leah said , “ It 's bad enough that you stole my husband ! Now you want my son 's love flowers too. ” “ All right , ” Rachel answered . “ Let me have the flowers , and you can sleep with Jacob tonight. ”
CEV	Genesis	30	16	That evening when Jacob came in from the fields , Leah told him , “ You 're sleeping with me tonight . I hired you with my son 's love flowers. ” They slept together that night ,
CEV	Genesis	30	17	and God answered Leah 's prayers by giving her a fifth son .
CEV	Genesis	30	18	Leah shouted , “ God has rewarded me for letting Jacob marry my servant , ” and she named the boy Issachar . [ f ]
CEV	Genesis	30	19	When Leah had another son ,
CEV	Genesis	30	20	she exclaimed , “ God has given me a wonderful gift , and my husband will praise me for giving him six sons. ” So she named the boy Zebulun . [ g ]
CEV	Genesis	30	21	Later , Leah had a daughter and named her Dinah . 22-23 Finally , God remembered Rachel—he answered her prayer by giving her a son . “ God has taken away my disgrace , ” she said .
CEV	Genesis	30	24	“ I 'll name the boy Joseph , [ h ] and I 'll pray that the Lord will give me another son. ” Jacob and Laban
CEV	Genesis	30	25	After Joseph was born , Jacob said to Laban , “ Release me from our agreement [ i ] and let me return to my own country .
CEV	Genesis	30	26	You know how hard I 've worked for you , so let me take my wives and children and leave. ” 27-28 But Laban told him , “ If you really are my friend , stay on , and I 'll pay whatever you ask . I 'm sure [ j ] the Lord has blessed me because of you. ”
CEV	Genesis	30	29	Jacob answered : You 've seen how hard I 've worked for you , and you know how your flocks and herds have grown under my care .
CEV	Genesis	30	31	“ How much do you want me to pay you ? ” Laban asked . Then Jacob told him : I do n't want you to pay me anything . Just do one thing , and I 'll take care of your sheep and goats .
CEV	Genesis	30	32	Let me go through your flocks and herds and take the sheep and goats that are either spotted or speckled [ k ] and the black lambs . That 's all you need to give me .
CEV	Genesis	30	33	In the future you can easily find out if I 've been honest . Just look and see if my animals are either spotted or speckled , or if the lambs are black . If they are n't , they 've been stolen from you .
CEV	Genesis	30	34	“ I agree to that , ” was Laban 's response .
CEV	Genesis	30	35	Before the end of the day , Laban had separated his spotted and speckled animals and the black lambs from the others and had put his sons in charge of them .
CEV	Genesis	30	36	Then Laban made Jacob keep the rest of the sheep and goats at a distance of three days ' journey .
CEV	Genesis	30	37	Jacob cut branches from some poplar trees and from some almond and evergreen trees . He peeled off part of the bark and made the branches look spotted and speckled .
CEV	Genesis	30	38	Then he put the branches where the sheep and goats would see them [ l ] while they were drinking from the water trough . The goats mated there
CEV	Genesis	30	39	in front of the branches , and their young were spotted and speckled .
CEV	Genesis	30	40	Some of the sheep that Jacob was keeping for Laban were already spotted . And when the others were ready to mate , he made sure that they faced in the direction of the spotted and black ones . In this way , Jacob built up a flock of sheep for himself and did not put them with the other sheep .
CEV	Genesis	30	41	When the stronger sheep were mating near the drinking place , Jacob made sure that the spotted branches were there .
CEV	Genesis	30	42	But he would not put out the branches when the weaker animals were mating . So Jacob got all of the healthy animals , and Laban got what was left .

CEV	Genesis	31	31	Jacob answered , “ I left secretly because I was afraid you would take your daughters from me by force .
CEV	Genesis	31	2	Jacob also noticed that Laban was not as friendly as he had been before .
CEV	Genesis	31	3	One day the Lord said , “ Jacob , go back to your relatives in the land of your ancestors , and I will be with you. ”
CEV	Genesis	31	4	Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to meet him in the pasture where he kept his sheep ,
CEV	Genesis	31	5	and he told them : Your father is n't as friendly with me as he used to be , but the God my ancestors worshiped has been on my side .
CEV	Genesis	31	6	years to buy your sheep and goats . During that time you kept changing my wages .
CEV	Genesis	31	7	and that he keeps cheating me by changing my wages time after time . But God has protected me .
CEV	Genesis	31	8	When your father said the speckled sheep would be my wages , all of them were speckled . And when he said the spotted ones would be mine , all of them were spotted .
CEV	Genesis	31	9	That 's how God has taken sheep and goats from your father and given them to me .
CEV	Genesis	31	10	Once , when the flocks were mating , I dreamed that all the rams were either spotted or speckled .
CEV	Genesis	31	11	Then God 's angel called me by name . I answered ,
CEV	Genesis	31	12	and he said , “ Notice that all the rams are either spotted or speckled . I know everything Laban is doing to you ,
CEV	Genesis	31	13	( A ) and I am the God you worshiped at Bethel , [ a ] when you poured olive oil on a rock and made a promise to me . Leave here at once and return to the land where you were born. ”

CEV	Genesis	31	15	He treats us like foreigners and has even cheated us out of the bride price [ b ] that should have been ours .
CEV	Genesis	31	16	So do whatever God tells you to do . Even the property God took from our father and gave to you really belongs to us and our children .
CEV	Genesis	31	17	Then Jacob , his wives , and his children got on camels and left
CEV	Genesis	31	18	northern Syria [ c ] for the home of his father Isaac in Canaan . Jacob took along all his flocks , herds , and other property .

CEV	Genesis	31	21	When Jacob crossed the Euphrates River and headed for the hill country of Gilead , he took with him everything he owned . Laban Catches Up with Jacob
CEV	Genesis	31	22	Three days later Laban found out that Jacob had gone .
CEV	Genesis	31	23	So he took some of his relatives along and chased after Jacob for seven days , before catching up with him in the hill country of Gilead .
CEV	Genesis	31	24	But God appeared to Laban in a dream that night and warned , “ Do n't say a word to Jacob . Do n't make a threat or a promise. ”
CEV	Genesis	31	25	Jacob had set up camp in the hill country of Gilead , when Laban and his relatives came and set up camp in another part of the hill country . Laban went to Jacob
CEV	Genesis	31	26	and said : Look what you 've done ! You 've tricked me and run off with my daughters like a kidnapper .
CEV	Genesis	31	27	Why did you sneak away without telling me ? I would have given you a going-away party with singing and with music on tambourines and harps .
CEV	Genesis	31	28	You did n't even give me a chance to kiss my own grandchildren and daughters goodbye . That was really foolish .
CEV	Genesis	31	29	I could easily hurt you , but the God your father worshiped has warned me not to make any threats or promises .
CEV	Genesis	31	30	I can understand why you were eager to return to your father , but why did you have to steal my idols ?
CEV	Genesis	31	32	If you find that any one of us has taken your idols , I 'll have that person killed . Let your relatives be witnesses . Show me what belongs to you , and you can take it back. ” Jacob did not realize that Rachel had stolen the household idols .
CEV	Genesis	31	33	Laban searched the tents of Jacob , Leah , and the two servant women , [ f ] but did not find the idols . Then he went to Rachel 's tent .
CEV	Genesis	31	34	She had already hidden them in the cushion she used as a saddle and was sitting on it . Laban searched everywhere and did not find them .
CEV	Genesis	31	35	Rachel said , “ Father , please do n't be angry with me for not getting up ; I 'm having my period. ” Laban kept on searching , but still did not find the idols .
CEV	Genesis	31	36	Jacob became very angry and said to Laban : What have I done wrong ? Have I committed some crime ? Is that why you hunted me down ?
CEV	Genesis	31	37	After searching through everything I have , did you find anything of yours ? If so , put it here , where your relatives and mine can see it . Then we can decide what to do .
CEV	Genesis	31	38	In all the
CEV	Genesis	31	39	If a wild animal killed one of your sheep or goats , I paid for it myself . In fact , you demanded the full price , whether the animal was killed during the day or at night . [ g ]
CEV	Genesis	31	40	I sweated every day , and I could n't sleep at night because of the cold .
CEV	Genesis	31	41	I had to work
CEV	Genesis	31	42	If the fearsome God [ h ] worshiped by Abraham and my father Isaac had not been on my side , you would have sent me away without a thing . But God saw my hard work , and he knew the trouble I was in , so he helped me . Then last night he told you how wrong you were . Jacob and Laban Make an Agreement
CEV	Genesis	31	43	Laban said to Jacob , “ Leah and Rachel are my daughters , and their children belong to me . All these sheep you are taking are really mine too . In fact , everything you have belongs to me . But there is nothing I can do to keep my daughters and their children .
CEV	Genesis	31	44	So I am ready to make an agreement with you , and we will pile up some large rocks here to remind us of the agreement. ”
CEV	Genesis	31	45	After Jacob had set up a large rock ,
CEV	Genesis	31	46	he told his men to get some more rocks and pile them up next to it . Then Jacob and Laban ate a meal together beside the rocks .
CEV	Genesis	31	47	Laban named the pile of rocks Jegar Sahadutha . [ i ] But Jacob named it Galeed . [ j ]
CEV	Genesis	31	48	Laban said to Jacob , “ This pile of rocks will remind us of our agreement. ” That 's why the place was named Galeed .
CEV	Genesis	31	49	Laban also said , “ This pile of rocks means that the Lord will watch us both while we are apart from each other. ” So the place was also named Mizpah . [ k ]
CEV	Genesis	31	50	Then Laban said : If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women , I may not know about it , but remember , God is watching us ! 51-52 Both this pile of rocks and this large rock have been set up between us as a reminder . I must never go past them to attack you , and you must never come past them to attack me .
CEV	Genesis	31	53	My father Nahor , your grandfather Abraham , and their ancestors all worshiped the same God , and he will make sure that we each keep the agreement . Then Jacob made a promise in the name of the fearsome God [ l ] his father Isaac had worshiped .
CEV	Genesis	31	54	Jacob killed an animal and offered it as a sacrifice there on the mountain , and he invited his men to eat with him . After the meal they spent the night on the mountain .
CEV	Genesis	31	55	Early the next morning , Laban kissed his daughters and his grandchildren goodbye , then he left to go back home .

CEV	Genesis	32	2	When Jacob saw them , he said , “ This is God 's camp. ” So he named the place Mahanaim . [ a ]
CEV	Genesis	32	3	Jacob sent messengers on ahead to Esau , who lived in the land of Seir , also known as Edom .
CEV	Genesis	32	4	Jacob told them to say to Esau , “ Master , I am your servant ! I have lived with Laban all this time ,
CEV	Genesis	32	5	and now I own cattle , donkeys , and sheep , as well as many slaves . Master , I am sending these messengers in the hope that you will be kind to me. ”
CEV	Genesis	32	6	When the messengers returned , they told Jacob , “ We went to your brother Esau , and now he is heading this way with
CEV	Genesis	32	400	men. ”
CEV	Genesis	32	7	Jacob was so frightened that he divided his people , sheep , cattle , and camels into two groups .
CEV	Genesis	32	8	He thought , “ If Esau attacks one group , perhaps the other can escape. ”
CEV	Genesis	32	9	Then Jacob prayed : You , Lord , are the God who was worshiped by my grandfather Abraham and by my father Isaac . You told me to return home to my family , and you promised to be with me and make me successful .
CEV	Genesis	32	10	males .
CEV	Genesis	32	11	Please rescue me from my brother . I am afraid he will come and attack not only me , but my wives and children as well .
CEV	Genesis	32	12	( A ) But you have promised that I would be a success and that someday it will be as hard to count my descendants as it is to count the grains of sand along the seashore .
CEV	Genesis	32	13	After Jacob had spent the night there , he chose some animals as gifts for Esau : 14-15
CEV	Genesis	32	200	female sheep and
CEV	Genesis	32	20	And Jacob told them to be sure to say that he was right behind them . Jacob hoped the gifts would make Esau friendly , so Esau would be glad to see him when they met .
CEV	Genesis	32	30	Jacob said , “ I have seen God face to face , and I am still alive. ” So he named the place Peniel . [ c ]
CEV	Genesis	32	40	cows and
CEV	Genesis	32	16	Jacob put servants in charge of each herd and told them , “ Go ahead of me and keep a space between each herd. ”
CEV	Genesis	32	17	Then he said to the servant in charge of the first herd , “ When Esau meets you , he will ask whose servant you are . He will want to know where you are going and who owns those animals in front of you .
CEV	Genesis	32	18	So tell him , ‘ They belong to your servant Jacob , who is coming this way . He is sending them as a gift to his master Esau. ’ ”
CEV	Genesis	32	19	Jacob also told the men in charge of the second and third herds and those who followed to say the same thing when they met Esau .
CEV	Genesis	32	21	Jacob 's men took the gifts on ahead of him , but he spent the night in camp . Jacob 's Name Is Changed to Israel 22-23 ( B ) Jacob got up in the middle of the night and took his wives , his eleven children , and everything he owned across to the other side of the Jabbok River for safety .
CEV	Genesis	32	24	( C ) Afterwards , Jacob went back and spent the rest of the night alone . A man came and fought with Jacob until just before daybreak .
CEV	Genesis	32	25	When the man saw that he could not win , he struck Jacob on the hip and threw it out of joint .
CEV	Genesis	32	26	They kept on wrestling until the man said , “ Let go of me ! It 's almost daylight. ” “ You ca n't go until you bless me , ” Jacob replied .
CEV	Genesis	32	27	Then the man asked , “ What is your name ? ” “ Jacob , ” he answered .
CEV	Genesis	32	28	( D ) The man said , “ From now on , your name will no longer be Jacob . You will be called Israel , [ b ] because you have wrestled with God and with men , and you have won. ”
CEV	Genesis	32	29	( E ) Jacob said , “ Now tell me your name. ” “ Do n't you know who I am ? ” he asked . And he blessed Jacob .

CEV	Genesis	33	33	Later that day Jacob met Esau coming with his
CEV	Genesis	33	400	men . So Jacob told his children to walk with their mothers .
CEV	Genesis	33	2	The two servant women , Zilpah and Bilhah , together with their children went first , followed by Leah and her children , then by Rachel and Joseph .
CEV	Genesis	33	3	Jacob himself walked in front of them all , bowing to the ground seven times as he came near his brother .
CEV	Genesis	33	4	But Esau ran toward Jacob and hugged and kissed him . Then the two brothers started crying .
CEV	Genesis	33	5	When Esau noticed the women and children he asked , “ Whose children are these ? ” Jacob answered , “ These are the children the Lord has been kind enough to give to me , your servant. ”
CEV	Genesis	33	6	Then the two servant women and their children came and bowed down to Esau .
CEV	Genesis	33	7	Next , Leah and her children came and bowed down ; finally , Joseph and Rachel also came and bowed down .
CEV	Genesis	33	8	Esau asked Jacob , “ Why did you send those herds I met along the road ? ” “ Master , ” Jacob answered , “ I sent them so you would be friendly to me. ”
CEV	Genesis	33	9	“ But , brother , I already have plenty , ” Esau replied . “ Keep them for yourself. ”
CEV	Genesis	33	10	“ No ! ” Jacob said . “ Please accept them as a sign of your friendship for me . When you welcomed me and I saw your face , it was like seeing the face of God .
CEV	Genesis	33	11	Please accept these as gifts I brought to you . God has been good to me , and I have everything I need. ” Jacob kept insisting until Esau agreed .
CEV	Genesis	33	12	“ Let 's get ready to travel , ” Esau said . “ I 'll go along with you. ”
CEV	Genesis	33	13	But Jacob answered , “ Master , you know traveling is hard on children , and I have to look after the sheep and goats that are nursing their young . If my animals travel too much in one day , they will all die .
CEV	Genesis	33	14	Why do n't you go on ahead and let me travel along slowly with the children , the herds , and the flocks . We can meet again in the country of Edom. ”
CEV	Genesis	33	15	Esau replied , “ Let me leave some of my men with you. ” “ You do n't have to do that , ” Jacob answered . “ I am happy , simply knowing that you are friendly to me. ”
CEV	Genesis	33	16	So Esau left for Edom .
CEV	Genesis	33	17	But Jacob went to Succoth , [ a ] where he built a house for himself and set up shelters for his animals . That 's why the place is called Succoth . Jacob Arrives at Shechem
CEV	Genesis	33	18	After leaving northern Syria , [ b ] Jacob arrived safely at Shechem in Canaan and set up camp outside the city .
CEV	Genesis	33	19	( A ) The land where he camped was owned by the descendants of Hamor , the father of Shechem . So Jacob paid them

CEV	Genesis	34	2	She was seen by Hamor 's son Shechem , the leader of the Hivites , and he grabbed her and raped her .
CEV	Genesis	34	3	But Shechem was attracted to Dinah , so he told her how much he loved her .
CEV	Genesis	34	4	Shechem even asked his father to arrange for him to marry her .
CEV	Genesis	34	5	Meanwhile , Jacob heard what had happened . But his sons were out in the fields with the cattle , so he did not do anything at the time .
CEV	Genesis	34	6	Hamor arrived at Jacob 's home
CEV	Genesis	34	7	just as Jacob 's sons were coming in from work . When they learned that their sister had been raped , they became furiously angry , because nothing is more disgraceful than rape , and it must not be tolerated .
CEV	Genesis	34	8	Hamor said to Jacob and his sons : My son Shechem really loves Dinah . Please let him marry her .
CEV	Genesis	34	9	Why do n't you start letting your families marry into our families and ours marry into yours ?
CEV	Genesis	34	10	You can share this land with us . Move freely about until you find the property you want ; then buy it and settle down here .
CEV	Genesis	34	11	Shechem added , “ Do this favor for me , and I 'll give whatever you want .
CEV	Genesis	34	12	Ask anything , no matter how expensive . I 'll do anything , just let me marry Dinah. ”
CEV	Genesis	34	13	Jacob 's sons wanted to get even with Shechem and his father because of what had happened to their sister .
CEV	Genesis	34	14	So they tricked them by saying : You 're not circumcised ! [ a ] It would be a disgrace for us to let you marry Dinah now .
CEV	Genesis	34	15	But we will let you marry her , if you and the other men in your tribe agree to be circumcised .
CEV	Genesis	34	16	Then your families can marry into ours , and ours can marry into yours , and we can live together like one nation .
CEV	Genesis	34	17	But if you do n't agree to be circumcised , we 'll take Dinah and leave this place .
CEV	Genesis	34	18	Hamor and Shechem liked what was said .
CEV	Genesis	34	19	Shechem was the most respected person in his family , and he was so in love with Dinah that he hurried off to get everything done .
CEV	Genesis	34	20	The two men met with the other leaders of their city and told them :
CEV	Genesis	34	21	These people really are friendly . Why not let them move freely about until they find the property they want ? There 's enough land here for them and for us . Then our families can marry into theirs , and theirs can marry into ours .
CEV	Genesis	34	22	We have to do only one thing before they will agree to stay here and become one nation with us . Our men will have to be circumcised just like theirs .
CEV	Genesis	34	23	Just think ! We 'll get their property , as well as their flocks and herds . All we have to do is to agree , and they will live here with us .
CEV	Genesis	34	24	Every grown man followed this advice and got circumcised . Dinah 's Brothers Take Revenge
CEV	Genesis	34	25	Three days later the men who had been circumcised were still weak from pain . So Simeon and Levi , [ b ] two of Dinah 's brothers , attacked with their swords and killed every man in the town ,
CEV	Genesis	34	26	including Hamor and Shechem . Then they took Dinah and left .
CEV	Genesis	34	27	Jacob 's other sons came and took everything they wanted . All this was done because of the horrible thing that had happened to their sister .
CEV	Genesis	34	28	They took sheep , goats , donkeys , and everything else that was in the town or the countryside .
CEV	Genesis	34	29	After taking everything of value from the houses , they dragged away the wives and children of their victims .
CEV	Genesis	34	30	Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , “ Look what you 've done ! Now I 'm in real trouble with the Canaanites and Perizzites who live around here . There are n't many of us , and if they attack , they 'll kill everyone in my household. ”
CEV	Genesis	34	31	They answered , “ Was it right to let our own sister be treated that way ? ” Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	35	35	( A ) God told Jacob , “ Return to Bethel , where I appeared to you when you were running from your brother Esau . Make your home there and build an altar for me. ”
CEV	Genesis	35	2	Jacob said to his family and to everyone else who was traveling with him : Get rid of your foreign gods ! Then make yourselves acceptable to worship God and put on clean clothes .
CEV	Genesis	35	3	Afterwards , we 'll go to Bethel . I will build an altar there for God , who answered my prayers when I was in trouble and who has always been at my side .
CEV	Genesis	35	4	So everyone gave Jacob their idols and their earrings , [ a ] and he buried them under the oak tree near Shechem .
CEV	Genesis	35	5	While Jacob and his family were traveling through Canaan , God terrified the people in the towns so much that no one dared bother them .
CEV	Genesis	35	6	Finally , they reached Bethel , also known as Luz .
CEV	Genesis	35	7	Jacob built an altar there and called it “ God of Bethel , ” because that was the place where God had appeared to him when he was running from Esau .
CEV	Genesis	35	8	While they were there , Rebekah 's personal servant Deborah [ b ] died . They buried her under an oak tree and called it “ Weeping Oak. ” God Blesses Jacob at Bethel 9-11 ( B ) ( C ) After Jacob came back to the land of Canaan , God appeared to him again . This time he gave Jacob a new name and blessed him by saying : I am God All-Powerful , and from now on your name will be Israel [ c ] instead of Jacob . You will have many children . Your descendants will become nations , and some of the men in your family will even be kings .
CEV	Genesis	35	12	I will give you the land that I promised Abraham and Isaac , and it will belong to your family forever .
CEV	Genesis	35	13	After God had gone ,
CEV	Genesis	35	14	( D ) Jacob set up a large rock , so that he would remember what had happened there . Then he poured wine and olive oil on the rock to show that it was dedicated to God ,
CEV	Genesis	35	15	and he named the place Bethel . [ d ] Benjamin Is Born
CEV	Genesis	35	16	Jacob and his family had left Bethel and were still a long way from Ephrath , when the time came for Rachel 's baby to be born .
CEV	Genesis	35	17	She was having a rough time , but the woman who was helping her said , “ Do n't worry ! It 's a boy. ”
CEV	Genesis	35	18	Rachel was at the point of death , and right before dying , she said , “ I 'll name him Benoni. ” [ e ] But Jacob called him Benjamin . [ f ]
CEV	Genesis	35	19	Rachel was buried beside the road to Ephrath , which is also called Bethlehem .
CEV	Genesis	35	20	Jacob set up a tombstone over her grave , and it is still there .
CEV	Genesis	35	21	Jacob , also known as Israel , traveled to the south of Eder Tower , where he set up camp .
CEV	Genesis	35	22	( E ) During their time there , Jacob 's oldest son Reuben slept with Bilhah , who was one of Jacob 's other wives . [ g ] And Jacob found out about it . Jacob 's Twelve Sons 23-26 Jacob had twelve sons while living in northern Syria . [ h ] His first-born Reuben was the son of Leah , who later gave birth to Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , and Zebulun . Leah 's servant Zilpah had two sons : Gad and Asher . Jacob and his wife Rachel had Joseph and Benjamin . Rachel 's servant woman Bilhah had two more sons : Dan and Naphtali . Isaac Dies
CEV	Genesis	35	27	( F ) Jacob went to his father Isaac at Hebron , also called Mamre or Kiriath-Arba , where Isaac 's father Abraham had lived as a foreigner . 28-29 Isaac died at the ripe old age of
CEV	Genesis	35	180	, then his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .

CEV	Genesis	36	6	Esau took his children and wives , his relatives and servants , his animals and possessions he had acquired while in Canaan , and moved far from Jacob .

CEV	Genesis	37	37	Jacob lived in the land of Canaan , where his father Isaac had lived ,
CEV	Genesis	37	2	and this is the story of his family . When Jacob 's son Joseph was
CEV	Genesis	37	17	“ They 're not here anymore , ” the man replied . “ I overheard them say they were going to Dothan. ” Joseph left and found his brothers in Dothan .
CEV	Genesis	37	3	Jacob loved Joseph more than he did any of his other sons , because Joseph was born when Jacob was very old . Jacob had even given Joseph a fancy coat [ b ]
CEV	Genesis	37	4	which showed that Joseph was his favorite son , and so Joseph 's brothers hated him and would not be friendly to him .
CEV	Genesis	37	5	One day , Joseph told his brothers what he had dreamed , and they hated him even more .
CEV	Genesis	37	6	Joseph said , “ Let me tell you about my dream .
CEV	Genesis	37	7	We were out in the field , tying up bundles of wheat . Suddenly my bundle stood up , and your bundles gathered around and bowed down to it. ”
CEV	Genesis	37	8	His brothers asked , “ Do you really think you are going to be king and rule over us ? ” Now they hated Joseph more than ever because of what he had said about his dream .
CEV	Genesis	37	9	Joseph later had another dream , and he told his brothers , “ Listen to what else I dreamed . The sun , the moon , and eleven stars bowed down to me. ”
CEV	Genesis	37	10	When he told his father about this dream , his father became angry and said , “ What 's that supposed to mean ? Are your mother and I and your brothers all going to come and bow down to you ? ”
CEV	Genesis	37	11	( A ) Joseph 's brothers were jealous of him , but his father kept wondering about the dream . Joseph Is Sold and Taken to Egypt
CEV	Genesis	37	12	both the Midianites and the Ishmaelites were descendants of Abraham , and in Judges 8.22-24 the two names are used of the same people . It is possible that in this passage “ Ishmaelite ” has the meaning “ nomadic traders , ” while “ Midianite ” refers to their ethnic origin . - 37.34 sackcloth : A rough dark-colored cloth made from goat or camel hair and used to make grain sacks . It was worn in times of trouble or sorrow . - 37.36 the king 's : See the note at 12.15 . Copyright ©
CEV	Genesis	37	13	his father Jacob said to him , “ I want you to go to your brothers . They are with the sheep near Shechem. ” “ Yes , sir , ” Joseph answered .
CEV	Genesis	37	14	His father said , “ Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing . Then come back and let me know. ” So he sent him from Hebron Valley . Joseph was near Shechem
CEV	Genesis	37	15	and wandering through the fields , when a man asked , “ What are you looking for ? ”
CEV	Genesis	37	16	Joseph answered , “ I 'm looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep . Can you tell me where they are ? ”
CEV	Genesis	37	18	But before he got there , they saw him coming and made plans to kill him .
CEV	Genesis	37	19	They said to one another , “ Look , here comes the hero of those dreams !
CEV	Genesis	37	20	pieces of silver they sold him to the Ishmaelites [ d ] who took him to Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	37	21	Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them . “ Let 's not kill him , ” he said .
CEV	Genesis	37	22	“ Do n't murder him or even harm him . Just throw him into a well out here in the desert. ” Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father .
CEV	Genesis	37	23	When Joseph came to his brothers , they pulled off his fancy coat [ c ]
CEV	Genesis	37	24	and threw him into a dry well .
CEV	Genesis	37	25	As Joseph 's brothers sat down to eat , they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead . Their camels were loaded with all kinds of spices that they were taking to Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	37	26	So Judah said , “ What will we gain if we kill our brother and hide his body ?
CEV	Genesis	37	27	Let 's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not harm him . After all , he is our brother. ” And the others agreed .
CEV	Genesis	37	28	( B ) When the Midianite merchants came by , Joseph 's brothers took him out of the well , and for
CEV	Genesis	37	29	When Reuben returned to the well and did not find Joseph there , he tore his clothes in sorrow .
CEV	Genesis	37	30	Then he went back to his brothers and said , “ The boy is gone ! What am I going to do ? ”
CEV	Genesis	37	31	Joseph 's brothers killed a goat and dipped Joseph 's fancy coat in its blood .
CEV	Genesis	37	32	After this , they took the coat to their father and said , “ We found this ! Look at it carefully and see if it belongs to your son. ”
CEV	Genesis	37	33	Jacob knew it was Joseph 's coat and said , “ It 's my son 's coat ! Joseph has been torn to pieces and eaten by some wild animal. ”
CEV	Genesis	37	34	Jacob mourned for Joseph a long time , and to show his sorrow he tore his clothes and wore sackcloth . [ e ]
CEV	Genesis	37	35	All of Jacob 's children came to comfort him , but he refused to be comforted . “ No , ” he said , “ I will go to my grave , mourning for my son. ” So Jacob kept on grieving .
CEV	Genesis	37	36	Meanwhile , the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to a man named Potiphar , who was the king 's [ f ] official in charge of the palace guard .

CEV	Genesis	38	38	About that time Judah left his brothers in the hill country and went to live near his friend Hirah in the town of Adullam .
CEV	Genesis	38	2	While there he met the daughter of Shua , a Canaanite man . Judah married her ,
CEV	Genesis	38	3	and they had three sons . He named the first one Er ;
CEV	Genesis	38	4	she named the next one Onan .
CEV	Genesis	38	5	The third one was born when Judah was in Chezib , and she named him Shelah .
CEV	Genesis	38	6	Later , Judah chose Tamar as a wife for Er , his oldest son .
CEV	Genesis	38	7	But Er was very evil , and the Lord took his life .
CEV	Genesis	38	8	So Judah told Onan , “ It 's your duty to marry Tamar and have a child for your brother. ” [ a ]
CEV	Genesis	38	9	Onan knew the child would not be his , [ b ] and when he had sex with Tamar , he made sure that she would not get pregnant .
CEV	Genesis	38	10	The Lord was n't pleased with Onan and took his life too .
CEV	Genesis	38	11	Judah did not want the same thing to happen to his son Shelah , and he told Tamar , “ Go home to your father and live there as a widow until my son Shelah is grown. ” So Tamar went to live with her father .
CEV	Genesis	38	12	Some years later Judah 's wife died , and he mourned for her . He then went with his friend Hirah to the town of Timnah , where his sheep were being sheared .
CEV	Genesis	38	13	Tamar found out that her father-in-law Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep .
CEV	Genesis	38	14	She also realized that Shelah was now a grown man , but she had not been allowed to marry him . So she decided to dress in something other than her widow 's clothes and to cover her face with a veil . After this , she sat outside the town of Enaim on the road to Timnah .
CEV	Genesis	38	15	When Judah came along , he did not recognize her because of the veil . He thought she was a prostitute
CEV	Genesis	38	16	and asked her to sleep with him . She asked , “ What will you give me if I do ? ”
CEV	Genesis	38	17	“ One of my young goats , ” he answered . “ What will you give me to keep until you send the goat ? ” she asked .
CEV	Genesis	38	18	“ What do you want ? ” he asked in return . “ The ring on that cord around your neck , ” was her reply . “ I also want the special walking stick [ c ] you have with you. ” He gave them to her , they slept together , and she became pregnant .
CEV	Genesis	38	19	After returning home , Tamar took off the veil and dressed in her widow 's clothes again .
CEV	Genesis	38	20	Judah asked his friend Hirah take a goat to the woman , so he could get back the ring and walking stick , but she was n't there .
CEV	Genesis	38	21	Hirah asked the people of Enaim , “ Where is the prostitute who sat along the road outside your town ? ” “ There 's never been one here , ” they answered .
CEV	Genesis	38	22	Hirah went back and told Judah , “ I could n't find the woman , and the people of Enaim said no prostitute had ever been there. ”
CEV	Genesis	38	23	“ If you could n't find her , we 'll just let her keep the things I gave her , ” Judah answered . “ And we 'd better forget about the goat , or else we 'll look like fools. ”
CEV	Genesis	38	24	About three months later someone told Judah , “ Your daughter-in-law Tamar has behaved like a prostitute , and now she 's pregnant ! ” “ Drag her out of town and burn her to death ! ” Judah shouted .
CEV	Genesis	38	25	As Tamar was being dragged off , she sent someone to tell her father-in-law , “ The man who gave me this ring , this cord , and this walking stick is the one who got me pregnant. ”
CEV	Genesis	38	26	“ Those are mine ! ” Judah admitted . “ She 's a better person than I am , because I broke my promise to let her marry my son Shelah. ” After this , Judah never slept with her again . 27-28 Tamar later gave birth to twins . But before either of them was born , one of them stuck a hand out of her womb . The woman who was helping tied a red thread around the baby 's hand and explained , “ This one came out first. ”
CEV	Genesis	38	29	At once his hand went back in , and the other child was born first . The woman then said , “ What an opening you 've made for yourself ! ” So they named the baby Perez . [ d ]
CEV	Genesis	38	30	When the brother with the red thread was born , they named him Zerah . [ e ] Footnotes - 38.8 It 's your duty … child … brother : If a man died without having children , his brother was to marry the dead man 's wife and have a child , who was to be considered the child of the dead brother ( see Deuteronomy 25.5,6 ) . - 38.9 the child … not be his : When Judah died , Onan would get his dead brother 's share of the inheritance , but if his dead brother had a son , the inheritance would go to him instead . - 38.18 ring … walking stick : The ring was shaped like a cylinder and could be rolled over soft clay as a way of sealing special documents . The walking stick was probably a symbol of power and the sign of leadership in the tribe , though it may have been a shepherd 's rod . - 38.29 Perez : In Hebrew “ Perez ” sounds like “ opening. ” - 38.30 Zerah : In Hebrew “ Zerah ” means “ bright , ” probably referring to the red thread .

CEV	Genesis	39	39	The Ishmaelites took Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar , the king 's [ a ] official in charge of the palace guard . 2-3 ( A ) So Joseph lived in the home of Potiphar , his Egyptian owner . Soon Potiphar realized that the Lord was helping Joseph to be successful in whatever he did .
CEV	Genesis	39	4	Potiphar liked Joseph and made him his personal assistant , putting him in charge of his house and all of his property .
CEV	Genesis	39	5	Because of Joseph , the Lord began to bless Potiphar 's family and fields .
CEV	Genesis	39	6	Potiphar left everything up to Joseph , and with Joseph there , the only decision he had to make was what he wanted to eat . Joseph was well-built and handsome ,
CEV	Genesis	39	7	( B ) and Potiphar 's wife soon noticed him . She asked him to make love to her ,
CEV	Genesis	39	8	but he refused and said , “ My master is n't worried about anything in his house , because he has placed me in charge of everything he owns .
CEV	Genesis	39	9	No one in my master 's house is more important than I am . The only thing he has n't given me is you , and that 's because you are his wife . I wo n't sin against God by doing such a terrible thing as this. ”
CEV	Genesis	39	10	She kept begging Joseph day after day , but he refused to do what she wanted or even to go near her .
CEV	Genesis	39	11	One day , Joseph went to Potiphar 's house to do his work , and none of the other servants were there .
CEV	Genesis	39	12	Potiphar 's wife grabbed hold of his coat and said , “ Make love to me ! ” Joseph ran out of the house , leaving his coat there in her hands .
CEV	Genesis	39	13	When this happened ,
CEV	Genesis	39	14	she called in her servants and said , “ Look ! This Hebrew has come just to make fools of us . He tried to rape me , but I screamed for help .
CEV	Genesis	39	15	And when he heard me scream , he ran out of the house , leaving his coat with me. ”
CEV	Genesis	39	16	Potiphar 's wife kept Joseph 's coat until her husband came home .
CEV	Genesis	39	17	Then she said , “ That Hebrew slave of yours tried to rape me !
CEV	Genesis	39	18	But when I screamed for help , he left his coat and ran out of the house. ”
CEV	Genesis	39	19	Potiphar became very angry
CEV	Genesis	39	20	and threw Joseph in the same prison where the king 's prisoners were kept . While Joseph was in prison ,
CEV	Genesis	39	21	( C ) the Lord helped him and was good to him . He even made the jailer like Joseph so much that
CEV	Genesis	39	22	he put him in charge of the other prisoners and of everything that was done in the jail .
CEV	Genesis	39	23	The jailer did not worry about anything , because the Lord was with Joseph and made him successful in all that he did . Footnotes - 39.1 the king 's : See the note at 12.15 . Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	40	40	1-3 While Joseph was in prison , both the king 's [ a ] personal servant [ b ] and his chief cook made the king angry . So he had them thrown into the same prison with Joseph .
CEV	Genesis	40	4	They spent a long time in prison , and the official in charge of the palace guard , [ c ] made Joseph their servant .
CEV	Genesis	40	5	One night each of the two men had a dream , but their dreams had different meanings .
CEV	Genesis	40	6	The next morning , when Joseph went to see the men , he could tell they were upset ,
CEV	Genesis	40	7	and he asked , “ Why are you so worried today ? ”
CEV	Genesis	40	8	“ We each had a dream last night , ” they answered , “ and there is no one to tell us what they mean. ” Joseph replied , “ Does n't God know the meaning of dreams ? Now tell me what you dreamed. ”
CEV	Genesis	40	9	The king 's personal servant told Joseph , “ In my dream I saw a vine
CEV	Genesis	40	10	with three branches . As soon as it budded , it blossomed , and its grapes became ripe .
CEV	Genesis	40	11	I held the king 's cup and squeezed the grapes into it , then I gave the cup to the king. ”
CEV	Genesis	40	12	Joseph said : This is the meaning of your dream . The three branches stand for three days ,
CEV	Genesis	40	13	and in three days the king will pardon you . He will make you his personal servant again , and you will serve him his wine , just as you used to do .
CEV	Genesis	40	14	But when these good things happen , please do n't forget to tell the king about me , so I can get out of this place .
CEV	Genesis	40	15	I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews , and here in Egypt I have n't done anything to deserve being thrown in jail .
CEV	Genesis	40	16	When the chief cook saw that Joseph had given a good meaning to the dream , he told Joseph , “ I also had a dream . In it I was carrying three breadbaskets stacked on top of my head .
CEV	Genesis	40	17	The top basket was full of all kinds of baked things for the king , but birds were eating them. ”
CEV	Genesis	40	18	Joseph said : This is the meaning of your dream . The three baskets are three days ,
CEV	Genesis	40	19	( A ) and in three days the king will cut off your head . He will hang your body on a pole , and birds will come and peck at it .
CEV	Genesis	40	20	Three days later , while the king was celebrating his birthday with a dinner for his officials , he sent for his personal servant and the chief cook .
CEV	Genesis	40	21	He put the personal servant back in his old job
CEV	Genesis	40	22	and had the cook put to death . Everything happened just as Joseph had said it would ,
CEV	Genesis	40	23	but the king 's personal servant completely forgot about Joseph . Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	41	41	You are now governor of all Egypt ! ”
CEV	Genesis	41	2	Suddenly , seven fat , healthy cows came up from the river and started eating grass along the bank .
CEV	Genesis	41	3	Then seven ugly , skinny cows came up out of the river and
CEV	Genesis	41	4	ate the fat , healthy cows . When this happened , the king woke up .
CEV	Genesis	41	5	The king went back to sleep and had another dream . This time seven full heads of grain were growing on a single stalk .
CEV	Genesis	41	6	Later , seven other heads of grain appeared , but they were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert .
CEV	Genesis	41	7	The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven full heads . Again the king woke up , and it had only been a dream .
CEV	Genesis	41	8	( A ) The next morning the king was upset . So he called in his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed . None of them could tell him what the dreams meant .
CEV	Genesis	41	9	The king 's personal servant said : Now I remember what I was supposed to do .
CEV	Genesis	41	10	When you were angry with me and your chief cook , you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard .
CEV	Genesis	41	11	One night we both had dreams , and each dream had a different meaning .
CEV	Genesis	41	12	A young Hebrew , who was a servant of the captain of the guard , was there with us at the time . When we told him our dreams , he explained what each of them meant ,
CEV	Genesis	41	13	and everything happened just as he said it would . I got my job back , and the cook was put to death .
CEV	Genesis	41	14	The king sent for Joseph , who was quickly brought out of jail . He shaved , changed his clothes , and went to the king .
CEV	Genesis	41	15	The king said to him , “ I had a dream , yet no one can explain what it means . I am told that you can interpret dreams. ”
CEV	Genesis	41	16	“ Your Majesty , ” Joseph answered , “ I ca n't do it myself , but God can give a good meaning to your dreams. ”
CEV	Genesis	41	17	The king told Joseph : I dreamed I was standing on the bank of the Nile River .
CEV	Genesis	41	18	I saw seven fat , healthy cows come up out of the river , and they began feeding on the grass .
CEV	Genesis	41	19	Next , seven skinny , bony cows came up out of the river . I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	41	20	The skinny cows ate the fat ones .
CEV	Genesis	41	21	But you could n't tell it , because these skinny cows were just as skinny as they were before . At once , I woke up .
CEV	Genesis	41	22	I also dreamed that I saw seven heads of grain growing on one stalk . The heads were full and ripe .
CEV	Genesis	41	23	Then seven other heads of grain came up . They were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert .
CEV	Genesis	41	24	These heads of grain swallowed the full ones . I told my dreams to the magicians , but none of them could tell me the meaning of the dreams .
CEV	Genesis	41	25	Joseph replied : Your Majesty , both of your dreams mean the same thing , and in them God has shown what he is going to do .
CEV	Genesis	41	26	The seven good cows stand for seven years , and so do the seven good heads of grain .
CEV	Genesis	41	27	The seven skinny , ugly cows that came up later also stand for seven years , as do the seven bad heads of grain that were scorched by the desert wind . The dreams mean there will be seven years when there wo n't be enough grain .
CEV	Genesis	41	28	It is just as I said—God has shown what he intends to do .
CEV	Genesis	41	29	For seven years Egypt will have more than enough grain ,
CEV	Genesis	41	30	when the king made him governor , and he went everywhere for the king .
CEV	Genesis	41	31	The famine will be so bad that no one will remember that once there had been plenty .
CEV	Genesis	41	32	God has given you two dreams to let you know that he has definitely decided to do this and that he will do it soon .
CEV	Genesis	41	33	Your Majesty , you should find someone who is wise and will know what to do , so that you can put him in charge of all Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	41	34	Then appoint some other officials to collect one fifth of every crop harvested in Egypt during the seven years when there is plenty .
CEV	Genesis	41	35	Give them the power to collect the grain during those good years and to store it in your cities .
CEV	Genesis	41	36	It can be stored until it is needed during the seven years when there wo n't be enough grain in Egypt . This will keep the country from being destroyed because of the lack of food . Joseph Is Made Governor over Egypt
CEV	Genesis	41	37	The king [ b ] and his officials liked this plan .
CEV	Genesis	41	38	So the king said to them , “ Who could possibly handle this better than Joseph ? After all , the Spirit of God is with him. ”
CEV	Genesis	41	39	The king told Joseph , “ God is the one who has shown you these things . No one else is as wise as you are or knows as much as you do .
CEV	Genesis	41	40	( B ) I 'm putting you in charge of my palace , and everybody will have to obey you . No one will be over you except me .
CEV	Genesis	41	42	( C ) Then the king took off his royal ring and put it on Joseph 's finger . He gave him fine clothes to wear and placed a gold chain around his neck .
CEV	Genesis	41	43	He also let him ride in the chariot next to his own , and people shouted , “ Make way for Joseph ! ” So Joseph was governor of Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	41	44	The king told Joseph , “ Although I 'm king , no one in Egypt is to do anything without your permission. ”
CEV	Genesis	41	45	He gave Joseph the Egyptian name Zaphenath Paneah . And he let him marry Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , a priest in the city of Heliopolis . [ c ] Joseph traveled all over [ d ] Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	41	46	Joseph was
CEV	Genesis	41	47	For seven years there were big harvests of grain .
CEV	Genesis	41	48	Joseph collected and stored up the extra grain in the cities of Egypt near the fields where it was harvested .
CEV	Genesis	41	49	In fact , there was so much grain that they stopped keeping record , because it was like counting the grains of sand along the beach .
CEV	Genesis	41	50	Joseph and his wife had two sons before the famine began .
CEV	Genesis	41	51	Their first son was named Manasseh , which means , “ God has let me forget all my troubles and my family back home. ”
CEV	Genesis	41	52	His second son was named Ephraim , which means “ God has made me a success [ e ] in the land where I suffered. ” [ f ]
CEV	Genesis	41	53	Egypt 's seven years of plenty came to an end ,
CEV	Genesis	41	54	( D ) and the seven years of famine began , just as Joseph had said . There was not enough food in other countries , but all over Egypt there was plenty .
CEV	Genesis	41	55	( E ) When the famine finally struck Egypt , the people asked the king for food , but he said , “ Go to Joseph and do what he tells you to do. ”
CEV	Genesis	41	56	The famine became bad everywhere in Egypt , so Joseph opened the storehouses and sold the grain to the Egyptians .
CEV	Genesis	41	57	People from all over the world came to Egypt to buy grain , because the famine was so severe in their countries .

CEV	Genesis	42	42	When Jacob found out there was grain in Egypt , he said to his sons , “ Why are you just sitting here , staring at one another ?
CEV	Genesis	42	2	( A ) I have heard there is grain in Egypt . Go down and buy some , so we wo n't starve to death. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	3	Ten of Joseph 's brothers went to Egypt to buy grain .
CEV	Genesis	42	4	But Jacob did not send Joseph 's younger brother Benjamin with them ; he was afraid that something might happen to him .
CEV	Genesis	42	5	So Jacob 's sons joined others from Canaan who were going to Egypt because of the terrible famine .
CEV	Genesis	42	6	Since Joseph was governor of Egypt and in charge of selling grain , his brothers came to him and bowed with their faces to the ground . 7-8 They did not recognize Joseph , but at once he knew who they were , though he pretended not to know . Instead , he spoke harshly and asked , “ Where do you come from ? ” “ From the land of Canaan , ” they answered . “ We 've come here to buy grain. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	9	( B ) Joseph remembered what he had dreamed about them and said , “ You 're spies ! You 've come here to find out where our country is weak. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	10	“ No sir , ” they replied . “ We 're your servants , and we have only come to buy grain .
CEV	Genesis	42	11	We 're honest men , and we come from the same family—we 're not spies. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	12	“ That is n't so ! ” Joseph insisted . “ You 've come here to find out where our country is weak. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	13	But they explained , “ Sir , we come from a family of twelve brothers . The youngest is still with our father in Canaan , and one of our brothers is dead. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	14	Joseph replied : It 's like I said . You 're spies ,
CEV	Genesis	42	15	and I 'm going to find out the truth . I swear by the life of the king that you wo n't leave this place until your youngest brother comes here .
CEV	Genesis	42	16	Choose one of you to go after your brother , while the rest of you stay here in jail . That will show whether you are telling the truth . But if you are lying , I swear by the life of the king that you are spies !
CEV	Genesis	42	17	Joseph kept them all under guard for three days ,
CEV	Genesis	42	18	before saying to them : Since I respect God , I 'll give you a chance to save your lives .
CEV	Genesis	42	19	If you are honest men , one of you must stay here in jail , and the rest of you can take the grain back to your starving families .
CEV	Genesis	42	20	But you must bring your youngest brother to me . Then I 'll know that you are telling the truth , and you wo n't be put to death . Joseph 's brothers agreed
CEV	Genesis	42	21	and said to one another , “ We 're being punished because of Joseph . We saw the trouble he was in , but we refused to help him when he begged us . That 's why these terrible things are happening. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	22	( C ) Reuben spoke up , “ Did n't I tell you not to harm the boy ? But you would n't listen , and now we have to pay the price for killing him. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	23	They did not know that Joseph could understand them , since he was speaking through an interpreter .
CEV	Genesis	42	24	Joseph turned away from them and cried , but soon he turned back and spoke to them again . Then he had Simeon tied up and taken away while they watched . Joseph 's Brothers Return to Canaan
CEV	Genesis	42	25	Joseph gave orders for his brothers ' grain sacks to be filled with grain and for their money [ a ] to be put in their sacks . He also gave orders for them to be given food for their journey home . After this was done ,
CEV	Genesis	42	26	they each loaded the grain on their donkeys and left .
CEV	Genesis	42	27	When they stopped for the night , one of them opened his sack to get some grain for his donkey , and at once he saw his moneybag .
CEV	Genesis	42	28	“ Here 's my money ! ” he told his brothers . “ Right here in my sack. ” They were trembling with fear as they stared at one another and asked themselves , “ What has God done to us ? ” [ b ]
CEV	Genesis	42	29	When they returned to the land of Canaan , they told their father Jacob everything that had happened to them :
CEV	Genesis	42	30	The governor of Egypt was rude and treated us like spies .
CEV	Genesis	42	31	But we told him , “ We 're honest men , not spies .
CEV	Genesis	42	32	We come from a family of twelve brothers . The youngest is still with our father in Canaan , and the other is dead. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	33	Then the governor of Egypt told us , “ I 'll find out if you really are honest . Leave one of your brothers here with me , while you take the grain to your starving families .
CEV	Genesis	42	34	But bring your youngest brother to me , so I can be certain that you are honest men and not spies . After that , I 'll let your other brother go free , and you can stay here and trade. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	35	When the brothers started emptying their sacks of grain , they found their moneybags in them . They were frightened , and so was their father Jacob ,
CEV	Genesis	42	36	who said , “ You have already taken my sons Joseph and Simeon from me . And now you want to take away Benjamin ! Everything is against me. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	37	Reuben spoke up , “ Father , if I do n't bring Benjamin back , you can kill both of my sons . Trust me with him , and I 'll bring him back. ”
CEV	Genesis	42	38	But Jacob said , “ I wo n't let my son Benjamin go down to Egypt with the rest of you . His brother is already dead , and he is the only son I have left . [ c ] I am an old man , and if anything happens to him on the way , I 'll die from sorrow , and all of you will be to blame. ” Footnotes - 42.25 money : Probably in the form of small pieces of silver and/or other precious or semi-precious metals ; there were no coins or paper money at this time . - 42.28 What has God … us : They thought God had put the money in their bags , so they would be caught and punished . - 42.38 only son I have left : Jacob had only two sons by Rachel , his favorite wife .

CEV	Genesis	43	43	The famine in Canaan got worse ,
CEV	Genesis	43	2	until finally , Jacob 's family had eaten all the grain they had bought in Egypt . So Jacob said to his sons , “ Go back and buy some more grain. ” 3-5 Judah replied , “ The governor strictly warned us that we would not be allowed to see him unless we brought our youngest brother with us . If you let us take Benjamin along , we will go and buy grain . But we wo n't go without him ! ”
CEV	Genesis	43	6	Jacob asked , “ Why did you cause me so much trouble by telling the governor you had another brother ? ”
CEV	Genesis	43	7	They answered , “ He asked a lot of questions about us and our family . He wanted to know if you were still alive and if we had any more brothers . All we could do was answer his questions . How could we know he would tell us to bring along our brother ? ”
CEV	Genesis	43	8	Then Judah said to his father , “ Let Benjamin go with me , and we will leave at once , so that none of us will starve to death .
CEV	Genesis	43	9	I promise to bring him back safely , and if I do n't , you can blame me as long as I live .
CEV	Genesis	43	10	If we had not wasted all this time , we could already have been there and back twice. ”
CEV	Genesis	43	11	Their father said : If Benjamin must go with you , take the governor a gift of some of the best things from our own country , such as perfume , honey , spices , pistachio nuts , and almonds . [ a ]
CEV	Genesis	43	12	Also take along twice the amount of money for the grain , because there must have been some mistake when the money was put back in your sacks .
CEV	Genesis	43	13	Take Benjamin with you and leave at once .
CEV	Genesis	43	14	When you go in to see the governor , I pray that God All-Powerful will be good to you and that the governor will let your other brother and Benjamin come back home with you . But if I must lose my children , I suppose I must .
CEV	Genesis	43	15	The brothers took the gifts , twice the amount of money , and Benjamin . Then they hurried off to Egypt . When they stood in front of Joseph ,
CEV	Genesis	43	16	he saw Benjamin and told the servant in charge of his house , “ Take these men to my house . Slaughter an animal and cook it , so they can eat with me at noon. ”
CEV	Genesis	43	17	The servant did as he was told and took the brothers to Joseph 's house .
CEV	Genesis	43	18	But on the way they got worried and started thinking , “ We are being taken there because of the money that was put back in our sacks last time . He will arrest us , make us his slaves , and take our donkeys. ”
CEV	Genesis	43	19	So when they arrived at Joseph 's house , they said to the servant in charge ,
CEV	Genesis	43	20	“ Sir , we came to Egypt once before to buy grain .
CEV	Genesis	43	21	But when we stopped for the night , we each found in our grain sacks the exact amount we had paid . We have brought that money back ,
CEV	Genesis	43	22	together with enough money to buy more grain . We do n't know who put the money in our sacks. ”
CEV	Genesis	43	23	“ It 's all right , ” the servant replied . “ Do n't worry . The God you and your father worship must have put the money there , because I received your payment in full. ” Then he brought Simeon out to them .
CEV	Genesis	43	24	The servant took them into Joseph 's house and gave them water to wash their feet . He also tended their donkeys .
CEV	Genesis	43	25	The brothers got their gifts ready to give to Joseph at noon , since they had heard they were going to eat there .
CEV	Genesis	43	26	When Joseph came home , they gave him the gifts they had brought , and they bowed down to him .
CEV	Genesis	43	27	After Joseph had asked how they were , he said , “ What about your elderly father ? Is he still alive ? ”
CEV	Genesis	43	28	They answered , “ Your servant our father is still alive and well. ” And again they bowed down to Joseph .
CEV	Genesis	43	29	When Joseph looked around and saw his brother Benjamin , he said , “ This must be your youngest brother , the one you told me about . God bless you , my son. ”
CEV	Genesis	43	30	Then , because of his love for Benjamin , he rushed off to his room and cried .
CEV	Genesis	43	31	After washing his face and returning , he was able to control himself and said , “ Serve the meal ! ”
CEV	Genesis	43	32	Joseph was served at a table by himself , and his brothers were served at another . The Egyptians sat at yet another table , because Egyptians felt it was disgusting to eat with Hebrews .
CEV	Genesis	43	33	To the surprise of Joseph 's brothers , they were seated in front of him according to their ages , from the oldest to the youngest .
CEV	Genesis	43	34	They were served food from Joseph 's table , and Benjamin was given five times as much as each of the others . So Joseph 's brothers ate and drank with him and had a good time . Footnotes - 43.11 honey , spices , pistachio nuts , and almonds : Some of these foods were still available in Canaan , but the main food was bread , and there was no grain to make bread . Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	44	44	1-2 Later , Joseph told the servant in charge of his house , “ Fill the men 's grain sacks with as much as they can hold and put their money in the sacks . Also put my silver cup in the sack of the youngest brother. ” The servant did as he was told .
CEV	Genesis	44	3	Early the next morning , the men were sent on their way with their donkeys .
CEV	Genesis	44	4	But they had not gone far from the city when Joseph told the servant , “ Go after those men ! When you catch them , say , ‘ My master has been good to you . So why have you stolen his silver cup ?
CEV	Genesis	44	5	Not only does he drink from his cup , but he also uses it to learn about the future . You have done a terrible thing. ’ ”
CEV	Genesis	44	6	When the servant caught up with them , he said exactly what Joseph had told him to say .
CEV	Genesis	44	7	But they replied , “ Sir , why do you say such things ? We would never do anything like that !
CEV	Genesis	44	8	We even returned the money we found in our grain sacks when we got back to Canaan . So why would we want to steal any silver or gold from your master 's house ?
CEV	Genesis	44	9	If you find that one of us has the cup , then kill him , and the rest of us will become your slaves. ”
CEV	Genesis	44	10	“ Good ! ” the man replied , “ I 'll do what you have said . But only the one who has the cup will become my slave . The rest of you can go free. ”
CEV	Genesis	44	11	Each of the brothers quickly put his sack on the ground and opened it .
CEV	Genesis	44	12	Joseph 's servant started searching the sacks , beginning with the one that belonged to the oldest brother . When he came to Benjamin 's sack , he found the cup .
CEV	Genesis	44	13	This upset the brothers so much that they began tearing their clothes in sorrow . Then they loaded their donkeys and returned to the city .
CEV	Genesis	44	14	When Judah and his brothers got there , Joseph was still at home . So they bowed down to Joseph ,
CEV	Genesis	44	15	who asked them , “ What have you done ? Did n't you know I could find out ? ”
CEV	Genesis	44	16	“ Sir , what can we say ? ” Judah replied . “ How can we say we are innocent , when God has shown we are guilty ? And now all of us are your slaves , especially the one who had the cup. ”
CEV	Genesis	44	17	Joseph told them , “ I would never punish all of you . Only the one who was caught with the cup will become my slave . The rest of you are free to go home to your father. ” Judah Pleads for Benjamin
CEV	Genesis	44	18	Judah went over to Joseph and said : Sir , you have as much power as the king [ a ] himself , and I am only your slave . Please do n't get angry if I speak .
CEV	Genesis	44	19	You asked us if our father was still alive and if we had any more brothers .
CEV	Genesis	44	20	So we told you , “ Our father is a very old man . In fact , he was already old when Benjamin was born . Benjamin 's brother is dead . Now Benjamin is the only one of the two brothers who is still alive , and our father loves him very much. ”
CEV	Genesis	44	21	You ordered us to bring him here , so you could see him for yourself .
CEV	Genesis	44	22	We told you that our father would die if Benjamin left him .
CEV	Genesis	44	23	But you warned us that we could never see you again , unless our youngest brother came with us .
CEV	Genesis	44	24	So we returned to our father and reported what you had said .
CEV	Genesis	44	25	Later our father sent us back here to buy more grain .
CEV	Genesis	44	26	But we told him , “ We ca n't go back to Egypt without our youngest brother . We will never be let in to see the governor , unless he is with us. ”
CEV	Genesis	44	27	Sir , our father then reminded us that his favorite wife had given birth to two sons .
CEV	Genesis	44	28	One of them was already missing and had not been seen for a long time . My father thinks the boy was torn to pieces by some wild animal ,
CEV	Genesis	44	29	and he said , “ I am an old man . If you take Benjamin from me , and something happens to him , I will die of a broken heart. ”
CEV	Genesis	44	30	That 's why Benjamin must be with us when I go back to my father . He loves him so much
CEV	Genesis	44	31	that he will die if Benjamin does n't come back with me .
CEV	Genesis	44	32	I promised my father that I would bring him safely home . If I do n't , I told my father he could blame me the rest of my life .
CEV	Genesis	44	33	Sir , I am your slave . Please let me stay here in place of Benjamin and let him return home with his brothers .
CEV	Genesis	44	34	How can I face my father if Benjamin is n't with me ? I could n't bear to see my father in such sorrow . Footnotes - 44.18 the king : See the note at 12.15 . Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	45	45	( A ) Since Joseph could no longer control his feelings in front of his servants , he sent them out of the room . When he was alone with his brothers , he told them , “ I am Joseph. ”
CEV	Genesis	45	2	Then he cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and told about it in the king 's [ a ] palace .
CEV	Genesis	45	3	Joseph asked his brothers if his father was still alive , but they were too frightened to answer .
CEV	Genesis	45	4	Joseph told them to come closer to him , and when they did , he said : Yes , I am your brother Joseph , the one you sold into Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	45	5	Do n't worry or blame yourselves for what you did . God is the one who sent me ahead of you to save lives .
CEV	Genesis	45	6	There has already been a famine for two years , and for five more years no one will plow fields or harvest grain .
CEV	Genesis	45	7	But God sent me on ahead of you to keep your families alive and to save you in this wonderful way .
CEV	Genesis	45	8	After all , you were n't really the ones who sent me here—it was God . He made me the highest official in the king 's court and placed me over all Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	45	9	( B ) Now hurry back and tell my father that his son Joseph says , “ God has made me ruler of Egypt . Come here as quickly as you can .
CEV	Genesis	45	10	You will live near me in the region of Goshen with your children and grandchildren , as well as with your sheep , goats , cattle , and everything else you own .
CEV	Genesis	45	11	I will take care of you there during the next five years of famine . But if you do n't come , you and your family and your animals will starve to death. ”
CEV	Genesis	45	12	All of you , including my brother Benjamin , can tell by what I have said that I really am Joseph .
CEV	Genesis	45	13	Tell my father about my great power here in Egypt and about everything you have seen . Hurry and bring him here .
CEV	Genesis	45	14	Joseph and Benjamin hugged each other and started crying .
CEV	Genesis	45	15	Joseph was still crying as he kissed each of his other brothers . After this , they started talking with Joseph .
CEV	Genesis	45	16	When it was told in the palace that Joseph 's brothers had come , the king and his officials were happy .
CEV	Genesis	45	17	So the king said to Joseph : Tell your brothers to load their donkeys and return to Canaan .
CEV	Genesis	45	18	Tell them to bring their father and their families here . I will give them the best land in Egypt , and they can eat and enjoy everything that grows there .
CEV	Genesis	45	19	Also tell your brothers to take some wagons from Egypt for their wives and children to ride in . And be sure they bring their father .
CEV	Genesis	45	20	They can leave their possessions behind , because they will be given the best of everything in Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	45	21	Jacob 's sons agreed to do what the king had said . And Joseph gave them wagons and food for their trip home , just as the king had ordered .
CEV	Genesis	45	22	Joseph gave some new clothes to each of his brothers , but to Benjamin he gave five new outfits and
CEV	Genesis	45	300	pieces of silver .
CEV	Genesis	45	23	To his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the best things in Egypt , and ten other donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other food for the return trip .

CEV	Genesis	45	25	Joseph 's brothers left Egypt , and when they arrived in Canaan ,
CEV	Genesis	45	26	they told their father that Joseph was still alive and was the ruler of Egypt . But their father was so surprised that he could not believe them .
CEV	Genesis	45	27	Then they told him everything Joseph had said . When he saw the wagons Joseph had sent , he felt much better

CEV	Genesis	46	46	Jacob packed up everything he owned and left for Egypt . On the way he stopped near the town of Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God his father Isaac had worshiped .
CEV	Genesis	46	2	That night , God spoke to him in a dream and said , “ Jacob ! Jacob ! ” “ Here I am , ” Jacob answered .
CEV	Genesis	46	3	God said , “ I am God , the same God your father worshiped . Do n't be afraid to go to Egypt . I will give you so many descendants that one day they will become a nation .
CEV	Genesis	46	4	I will go with you to Egypt , and later I will bring your descendants back here . Your son Joseph will be at your side when you die. ” 5-7 ( A ) Jacob and his family set out from Beersheba and headed for Egypt . His sons put him in the wagon that the king [ a ] had sent for him , and they put their small children and their wives in the other wagons . Jacob 's whole family went to Egypt , including his sons , his grandsons , his daughters , and his granddaughters . They took along their animals and everything else they owned . 8-15 When Jacob went to Egypt , his children who were born in northern Syria [ b ] also went along with their families . Jacob and his wife Leah had a total of

CEV	Genesis	46	16	children , grandchildren , and great-grandchildren . Their son Gad took his sons Ziphion , Haggi , Shuni , Ezbon , Eri , Arodi , and Areli . Their son Asher took his sons Imnah , Ishvah , Ishvi , and Beriah , who took his sons , Heber and Malchiel . Serah , the daughter of Asher , also went . 19-22 ( B ) Jacob and Rachel had
CEV	Genesis	46	14	children and grandchildren . Their son Joseph was already in Egypt , where he had married Asenath , daughter of Potiphera , the priest of Heliopolis . [ d ] Joseph and Asenath had two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim . Jacob and Rachel 's son Benjamin took his sons Bela , Becher , Ashbel , Gera , Naaman , Ehi , Rosh , Muppim , Huppim , and Ard . 23-25 Jacob and Bilhah , the servant woman Laban had given his daughter Rachel , had seven children and grandchildren . Their son Dan took his son Hushim . Their son Naphtali took his sons Jahzeel , Guni , Jezer , and Shillem .
CEV	Genesis	46	26	Sixty-six members of Jacob 's family went to Egypt with him , not counting his daughters-in-law .
CEV	Genesis	46	27	( C ) Jacob 's two grandsons who were born there made it a total of
CEV	Genesis	46	70	members of Jacob 's family in Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	46	28	Jacob had sent his son Judah ahead of him to ask Joseph to meet them in Goshen .
CEV	Genesis	46	29	So Joseph got in his chariot and went to meet his father . When they met , Joseph hugged his father around the neck and cried for a long time .
CEV	Genesis	46	30	Jacob said to Joseph , “ Now that I have seen you and know you are still alive , I am ready to die. ”
CEV	Genesis	46	31	Then Joseph said to his brothers and to everyone who had come with them : I must go and tell the king [ e ] that you have arrived from Canaan .
CEV	Genesis	46	32	I will tell him that you are shepherds and that you have brought your sheep , goats , cattle , and everything else you own .
CEV	Genesis	46	34	When he does , be sure to say , “ We are shepherds . Our families have always raised sheep. ” If you tell him this , he will let you settle in the region of Goshen . Joseph wanted them to say this to the king , because the Egyptians did not like to be around anyone who raised sheep . Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	47	47	1-2 Joseph took five of his brothers to the king and told him , “ My father and my brothers have come from Canaan . They have brought their sheep , goats , cattle , and everything else they own to the region of Goshen. ” Then he introduced his brothers to the king ,
CEV	Genesis	47	3	who asked them , “ What do you do for a living ? ” “ Sir , we are shepherds , ” was their answer . “ Our families have always raised sheep .
CEV	Genesis	47	4	But in our country all the pastures are dried up , and our sheep have no grass to eat . So we , your servants , have come here . Please let us live in the region of Goshen. ”
CEV	Genesis	47	5	The king said to Joseph , “ It 's good that your father and brothers have arrived .
CEV	Genesis	47	6	I will let them live anywhere they choose in the land of Egypt , but I suggest that they settle in Goshen , the best part of our land . I would also like for your finest shepherds to watch after my own sheep and goats. ”
CEV	Genesis	47	7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and introduced him to the king . Jacob gave the king his blessing ,
CEV	Genesis	47	8	and the king asked him , “ How old are you ? ”
CEV	Genesis	47	9	Jacob answered , “ I have lived only
CEV	Genesis	47	130	years , and I have had to move from place to place . My parents and my grandparents also had to move from place to place . But they lived much longer , and their life was not as hard as mine. ”
CEV	Genesis	47	10	Then Jacob gave the king his blessing once again and left .
CEV	Genesis	47	11	Joseph obeyed the king 's orders and gave his father and brothers some of the best land in Egypt near the city of Rameses .
CEV	Genesis	47	12	Joseph also provided food for their families . A Famine in Egypt
CEV	Genesis	47	13	The famine was bad everywhere in Egypt and Canaan , and the people were suffering terribly .
CEV	Genesis	47	14	So Joseph sold them the grain that had been stored up , and he put the money [ a ] in the king 's treasury .
CEV	Genesis	47	15	But when everyone had run out of money , the Egyptians came to Joseph and demanded , “ Give us more grain ! If you do n't , we 'll soon be dead , because our money 's all gone. ”
CEV	Genesis	47	16	“ If you do n't have any money , ” Joseph answered , “ give me your animals , and I 'll let you have some grain. ”
CEV	Genesis	47	17	years , before dying at the age of
CEV	Genesis	47	18	Then the people came to him and said : Sir , there 's no way we can hide the truth from you . We are broke , and we do n't have any more animals . We have nothing left except ourselves and our land .
CEV	Genesis	47	19	Do n't let us starve and our land be ruined . If you 'll give us grain to eat and seed to plant , we 'll sell ourselves and our land to the king . [ b ] We 'll become his slaves .
CEV	Genesis	47	20	The famine became so severe that Joseph finally bought every piece of land in Egypt for the king
CEV	Genesis	47	21	and made everyone the king 's slaves , [ c ]
CEV	Genesis	47	22	except the priests . The king gave the priests a regular food allowance , so they did not have to sell their land .
CEV	Genesis	47	23	Then Joseph said to the people , “ You and your land now belong to the king . I 'm giving you seed to plant ,
CEV	Genesis	47	24	but one fifth of your crops must go to the king . You can keep the rest as seed or as food for your families. ”
CEV	Genesis	47	25	“ Sir , you have saved our lives ! ” they answered . “ We are glad to be slaves of the king. ”
CEV	Genesis	47	26	Then Joseph made a law that one fifth of the harvest would always belong to the king . Only the priests did not lose their land . Jacob Becomes an Old Man
CEV	Genesis	47	27	The people of Israel made their home in the land of Goshen , where they became prosperous and had large families .
CEV	Genesis	47	28	Jacob himself lived there for
CEV	Genesis	47	147	.
CEV	Genesis	47	29	( A ) When Jacob knew he did not have long to live , he called in Joseph and said , “ If you really love me , you must make a solemn promise not to bury me in Egypt .
CEV	Genesis	47	30	Instead , bury me in the place where my ancestors are buried. ” “ I will do what you have asked , ” Joseph answered .
CEV	Genesis	47	31	“ Will you give me your word ? ” Jacob asked . “ Yes , I will , ” Joseph promised . After this , Jacob bowed down and prayed at the head of his bed . Copyright ©

CEV	Genesis	48	48	Joseph was told that his father Jacob had become very sick . So Joseph went to see him and took along his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
CEV	Genesis	48	2	When Joseph arrived , someone told Jacob , “ Your son Joseph has come to see you. ” Jacob sat up in bed , but it took almost all his strength .
CEV	Genesis	48	3	( A ) Jacob told Joseph : God All-Powerful appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan , where he gave me his blessing
CEV	Genesis	48	4	and promised , “ I will give you a large family with many descendants that will grow into a nation . And I am giving you this land that will belong to you and your family forever. ”
CEV	Genesis	48	5	Then Jacob went on to say : Joseph , your two sons Ephraim and Manasseh were born in Egypt , but I accept them as my own , just as Reuben and Simeon are mine .
CEV	Genesis	48	6	Any children you have later will be considered yours , but their inheritance will come from Ephraim and Manasseh .
CEV	Genesis	48	7	( B ) Unfortunately , your mother Rachel died in Canaan after we had left northern Syria [ a ] and before we reached Bethlehem . [ b ] And I had to bury her along the way . 8-10 Jacob was very old and almost blind . He did not recognize the two boys , and so he asked Joseph , “ Who are these boys ? ” Joseph answered , “ They are my sons . God has given them to me here in Egypt. ” “ Bring them to me , ” Jacob said . “ I want to give them my blessing. ” Joseph brought the boys to him , and he hugged and kissed them .
CEV	Genesis	48	11	Jacob turned to Joseph and told him , “ For many years I thought you were dead and that I would never see you again . But now God has even let me live to see your children. ”
CEV	Genesis	48	12	Then Joseph made his sons move away from Jacob 's knees , [ c ] and Joseph bowed down in front of him with his face to the ground .
CEV	Genesis	48	13	After Joseph got up , he brought his two sons over to Jacob again . He led his younger son Ephraim to the left side of Jacob and his older son Manasseh to the right .
CEV	Genesis	48	14	But before Jacob gave them his blessing , he crossed his arms , putting his right hand on the head of Ephraim and his left hand on the head of Manasseh .
CEV	Genesis	48	15	Then he gave Joseph his blessing and said : My grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac worshiped the Lord God . He has been with me all my life ,
CEV	Genesis	48	16	and his angel has kept me safe . Now I pray that he will bless these boys and that my name and the names of Abraham and Isaac will live on because of them . I ask God to give them many children and many descendants as well .
CEV	Genesis	48	17	Joseph did not like it when he saw his father place his right hand on the head of the younger son . So he tried to move his father 's right hand from Ephraim 's head and place it on Manasseh .
CEV	Genesis	48	18	Joseph said , “ Father , you have made a mistake . This is the older boy . Put your right hand on him. ”
CEV	Genesis	48	19	But his father said , “ Son , I know what I am doing . It 's true that Manasseh 's family will someday become a great nation . But Ephraim will be even greater than Manasseh , because his descendants will become many great nations. ”
CEV	Genesis	48	20	( C ) Jacob told him that in the future the people of Israel would ask God 's blessings on one another by saying , “ I pray for God to bless you as much as he blessed Ephraim and Manasseh. ” Jacob put Ephraim 's name first to show that he would be greater than Manasseh .
CEV	Genesis	48	21	After that , Jacob said , “ Joseph , you can see that I wo n't live much longer . But God will be with you and will lead you back to the land he promised our family long ago .

CEV	Genesis	50	1	Joseph started crying , then leaned over to hug and kiss his father .
CEV	Genesis	50	2	Joseph gave orders for Jacob 's body to be embalmed ,
CEV	Genesis	50	3	and it took the usual
CEV	Genesis	50	40	days . The Egyptians mourned
CEV	Genesis	50	70	days for Jacob .
CEV	Genesis	50	4	When the time of mourning was over , Joseph said to the Egyptian leaders , “ If you consider me your friend , please speak to the king [ a ] for me .
CEV	Genesis	50	5	( A ) Just before my father died , he made me promise to bury him in his burial cave in Canaan . If the king will give me permission to go , I will come back here. ”
CEV	Genesis	50	6	The king answered , “ Go to Canaan and keep your promise to your father. ” 7-9 When Joseph left Goshen with his brothers , his relatives , and his father 's relatives to bury Jacob , many of the king 's highest officials and even his military chariots and cavalry went along . The Israelites left behind only their children , their cattle , and their sheep and goats .
CEV	Genesis	50	10	After crossing the Jordan River , Joseph stopped at Atad 's threshing place , where they all mourned and wept seven days for Jacob .
CEV	Genesis	50	11	The Canaanites saw this and said , “ The Egyptians are in great sorrow. ” Then they named the place “ Egypt in Sorrow. ” [ b ]
CEV	Genesis	50	12	So Jacob 's sons did just as their father had instructed .

CEV	Genesis	50	14	After the funeral , Joseph , his brothers , and everyone else returned to Egypt . Joseph 's Promise to His Brothers
CEV	Genesis	50	15	After Jacob died , Joseph 's brothers said to each other , “ What if Joseph still hates us and wants to get even with us for all the cruel things we did to him ? ”
CEV	Genesis	50	16	So they sent this message to Joseph : Before our father died ,
CEV	Genesis	50	17	he told us , “ You did some cruel and terrible things to Joseph , but you must ask him to forgive you. ” Now we ask you to please forgive the terrible things we did . After all , we serve the same God that your father worshiped . When Joseph heard this , he started crying .
CEV	Genesis	50	18	Right then , Joseph 's brothers came and bowed down to the ground in front of him and said , “ We are your slaves. ”
CEV	Genesis	50	19	But Joseph told them , “ Do n't be afraid ! I have no right to change what God has decided .
CEV	Genesis	50	20	You tried to harm me , but God made it turn out for the best , so that he could save all these people , as he is now doing .

CEV	Exodus	1	1	1-5 ( A ) When Jacob went to Egypt , his son Joseph was already there . So Jacob took his eleven other sons and their families . They were : Reuben , Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , Zebulun , Benjamin , Dan , Naphtali , Gad , and Asher . Altogether , Jacob had
CEV	Exodus	1	70	children … great-grandchildren : See Genesis 46.8-27 . - 1.11 Pithom and Rameses : This is the only mention of Pithom in the Bible ; its exact location is unknown , though it was probably in the northern Delta of Egypt .

CEV	Exodus	1	6	After Joseph , his brothers , and everyone else in that generation had died ,
CEV	Exodus	1	7	( B ) the people of Israel became so numerous that the whole region of Goshen was full of them .
CEV	Exodus	1	8	( C ) Many years later a new king came to power . He did not know what Joseph had done for Egypt ,
CEV	Exodus	1	9	and he told the Egyptians : There are too many of those Israelites in our country , and they are becoming more powerful than we are .
CEV	Exodus	1	10	( D ) If we do n't outsmart them , their families will keep growing larger . And if our country goes to war , they could easily fight on the side of our enemies and escape from Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	1	11	The Egyptians put slave bosses in charge of the people of Israel and tried to wear them down with hard work . Those bosses forced them to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses , [ b ] where the king [ c ] could store his supplies .
CEV	Exodus	1	12	But even though the Israelites were mistreated , their families grew larger , and they took over more land . Because of this , the Egyptians feared them worse than before
CEV	Exodus	1	13	and made them work so hard
CEV	Exodus	1	14	that their lives were miserable . The Egyptians were cruel to the people of Israel and forced them to make bricks and to mix mortar and to work in the fields .
CEV	Exodus	1	15	Finally , the king called in Shiphrah and Puah , the two women who helped the Hebrew [ d ] mothers when they gave birth .
CEV	Exodus	1	16	He told them , “ If a Hebrew woman gives birth to a girl , let the child live . If the baby is a boy , kill him ! ”
CEV	Exodus	1	17	But the two women were faithful to God and did not kill the boys , even though the king had told them to .
CEV	Exodus	1	18	The king called them in again and asked , “ Why are you letting those baby boys live ? ”
CEV	Exodus	1	19	They answered , “ Hebrew women have their babies much quicker than Egyptian women . By the time we arrive , their babies are already born. ” 20-21 God was good to the two women because they truly respected him , and he blessed them with children of their own . The Hebrews kept increasing
CEV	Exodus	1	22	( E ) until finally , the king gave a command to everyone in the nation , “ As soon as a Hebrew boy is born , throw him into the Nile River ! But you can let the girls live. ” Footnotes - 1.1-5

CEV	Exodus	2	2	( A ) and she later had a baby boy . He was a beautiful child , and she kept him inside for three months .
CEV	Exodus	2	3	But when she could no longer keep him hidden , she made a basket out of reeds and covered it with tar . She put him in the basket and placed it in the tall grass along the edge of the Nile River .
CEV	Exodus	2	4	The baby 's older sister [ a ] stood off at a distance to see what would happen to him .
CEV	Exodus	2	5	About that time one of the king 's [ b ] daughters came down to take a bath in the river , while her servant women walked along the river bank . She saw the basket in the tall grass and sent one of them to pull it out of the water .
CEV	Exodus	2	6	When the king 's daughter opened the basket , she saw the baby crying and felt sorry for him . She said , “ This must be one of the Hebrew babies. ”
CEV	Exodus	2	7	At once the baby 's older sister came up and asked , “ Do you want me to get a Hebrew woman to take care of the baby for you ? ”
CEV	Exodus	2	8	“ Yes , ” the king 's daughter answered . So the girl brought the baby 's mother ,
CEV	Exodus	2	9	and the king 's daughter told her , “ Take care of this child , and I will pay you. ” The baby 's mother carried him home and took care of him .
CEV	Exodus	2	10	( B ) And when he was old enough , she took him to the king 's daughter , who adopted him . She named him Moses [ c ] because she said , “ I pulled him out of the water. ” Moses Escapes from Egypt
CEV	Exodus	2	11	( C ) ( D ) After Moses had grown up , he went out to where his own people were hard at work , and he saw an Egyptian beating one of them .
CEV	Exodus	2	12	Moses looked around to see if anyone was watching , then he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand .
CEV	Exodus	2	13	When Moses went out the next day , he saw two Hebrews fighting . So he went to the man who had started the fight and asked , “ Why are you beating up one of your own people ? ”
CEV	Exodus	2	14	The man answered , “ Who put you in charge of us and made you our judge ? Are you planning to kill me , just like you killed that Egyptian ? ” This frightened Moses because he was sure that people must have found out what had happened .
CEV	Exodus	2	15	( E ) When the king [ d ] heard what Moses had done , he wanted to kill him . But Moses escaped and went to the land of Midian . One day , when Moses was sitting by a well ,
CEV	Exodus	2	16	the seven daughters of Jethro , the priest of Midian , [ e ] came up to water their father 's sheep and goats .
CEV	Exodus	2	17	Some shepherds tried to chase them away , but Moses came to their rescue and watered their animals .

CEV	Exodus	2	21	Moses agreed to stay on with Jethro , who later let his daughter Zipporah marry Moses .
CEV	Exodus	2	22	And when she had a son , Moses said , “ I will name him Gershom , [ f ] since I am a foreigner in this country. ”
CEV	Exodus	2	23	After the death of the king of Egypt , the Israelites still complained because they were forced to be slaves . They cried out for help ,
CEV	Exodus	2	24	( F ) and God heard their loud cries . He did not forget the promise he had made to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ,

CEV	Exodus	3	3	“ This is strange ! ” he said to himself . “ I 'll go over and see why the bush is n't burning up. ”
CEV	Exodus	3	2	( A ) There an angel of the Lord appeared to him from a burning bush . Moses saw that the bush was on fire , but it was not burning up .
CEV	Exodus	3	4	When the Lord saw Moses coming near , he called him by name from the bush , and Moses answered , “ Here I am. ”
CEV	Exodus	3	5	God replied , “ Do n't come any closer . Take off your sandals—the ground where you are standing is holy .
CEV	Exodus	3	6	I am the God who was worshiped by your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob. ” Moses was afraid to look at God , and so he hid his face .
CEV	Exodus	3	7	The Lord said : I have seen how my people are suffering as slaves in Egypt , and I have heard them beg for my help because of the way they are being mistreated . I feel sorry for them ,
CEV	Exodus	3	8	and I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians . I will bring my people out of Egypt into a country where there is a lot of good land , rich with milk and honey . I will give them the land where the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites now live .
CEV	Exodus	3	9	My people have begged for my help , and I have seen how cruel the Egyptians are to them .
CEV	Exodus	3	10	Now go to the king ! I am sending you to lead my people out of his country .
CEV	Exodus	3	11	But Moses said , “ Who am I to go to the king and lead your people out of Egypt ? ”
CEV	Exodus	3	12	God replied , “ I will be with you . And you will know that I am the one who sent you , when you worship me on this mountain after you have led my people out of Egypt. ” [ b ]
CEV	Exodus	3	13	( B ) Moses answered , “ I will tell the people of Israel that the God their ancestors worshiped has sent me to them . But what should I say , if they ask me your name ? ” 14-15 ( C ) God said to Moses : I am the eternal God . So tell them that the Lord , [ c ] whose name is “ I Am , ” has sent you . This is my name forever , and it is the name that people must use from now on .
CEV	Exodus	3	16	Call together the leaders of Israel and tell them that the God who was worshiped by Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob has appeared to you . Tell them I have seen how terribly they are being treated in Egypt ,
CEV	Exodus	3	17	and I promise to lead them out of their troubles . I will give them a land rich with milk and honey , where the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites now live .
CEV	Exodus	3	18	The leaders of Israel will listen to you . Then you must take them to the king of Egypt and say , “ The Lord God of the Hebrews has appeared to us . Let us walk three days into the desert , where we can offer a sacrifice to him. ”
CEV	Exodus	3	19	But I know that the king of Egypt wo n't let you go unless something forces him to .
CEV	Exodus	3	20	So I will use my mighty power to perform all kinds of miracles and strike down the Egyptians . Then the king will send you away .
CEV	Exodus	3	21	( D ) ( E ) After I punish the Egyptians , they will be so afraid of you that they will give you anything you want . You are my people , and I will let you take many things with you when you leave the land of Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	3	22	Every Israelite woman will go to her Egyptian neighbors or to any Egyptian woman living with them and ask them for gold and silver jewelry and for their finest clothes . The Egyptians will give them to you , and you will put these fine things on your sons and daughters . Carry all this away when you leave Egypt .

CEV	Exodus	4	4	“ Pick it up by the tail ! ” the Lord told him . And when Moses did this , the snake turned back into a walking stick .
CEV	Exodus	4	2	The Lord answered , “ What 's that in your hand ? ” “ A walking stick , ” Moses replied .
CEV	Exodus	4	3	“ Throw it down ! ” the Lord commanded . So Moses threw the stick on the ground . It immediately turned into a snake , and Moses jumped back .
CEV	Exodus	4	5	“ Do this , ” the Lord said , “ and the Israelites will believe that you have seen me , the God who was worshiped by their ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob. ”
CEV	Exodus	4	6	Next , the Lord commanded Moses , “ Put your hand inside your shirt. ” Moses obeyed , and when he took it out , his hand had turned white as snow—like someone with leprosy . [ a ]
CEV	Exodus	4	7	“ Put your hand back inside your shirt , ” the Lord told him . Moses did so , and when he took it out again , it was as healthy as the rest of his body . 8-9 Then the Lord said , “ If no one believes either of these miracles , take some water from the Nile River and pour it on the ground . The water will immediately turn into blood. ”
CEV	Exodus	4	10	Moses replied , “ I have never been a good speaker . I was n't one before you spoke to me , and I 'm not one now . I am slow at speaking , and I can never think of what to say. ”
CEV	Exodus	4	11	But the Lord answered , “ Who makes people able to speak or makes them deaf or unable to speak ? Who gives them sight or makes them blind ? Do n't you know that I am the one who does these things ?
CEV	Exodus	4	12	Now go ! When you speak , I will be with you and give you the words to say. ”
CEV	Exodus	4	13	Moses begged , “ Lord , please send someone else to do it. ”
CEV	Exodus	4	14	The Lord became angry with Moses and said : What about your brother Aaron , the Levite ? I know he is a good speaker . He is already on his way here to visit you , and he will be happy to see you again . 15-16 Aaron will speak to the people for you , and you will be like me , telling Aaron what to say . I will be with both of you as you speak , and I will tell each of you what to do .
CEV	Exodus	4	17	Now take this walking stick and use it to perform miracles . Moses Returns to Egypt
CEV	Exodus	4	18	Moses went to his father-in-law Jethro and asked , “ Please let me return to Egypt to see if any of my people are still alive. ” “ All right , ” Jethro replied . “ I hope all goes well. ”
CEV	Exodus	4	19	But even before this , the Lord had told Moses , “ Leave the land of Midian and return to Egypt . Everyone who wanted to kill you is now dead. ”
CEV	Exodus	4	20	So Moses put his wife and sons on donkeys and headed for Egypt , holding the walking stick that had the power of God .
CEV	Exodus	4	21	On the way the Lord said to Moses : When you get to Egypt , go to the king and work the miracles I have shown you . But I will make him so stubborn that he will refuse to let my people go .
CEV	Exodus	4	22	Then tell him that I have said , “ Israel is my first-born son ,
CEV	Exodus	4	23	( A ) and I commanded you to release him , so he could worship me . But you refused , and now I will kill your first-born son. ” Zipporah 's Son Is Circumcised
CEV	Exodus	4	24	One night while Moses was in camp , the Lord was about to kill him .
CEV	Exodus	4	25	But Zipporah [ b ] circumcised her son with a flint knife . She touched his [ c ] legs with the skin she had cut off and said , “ My dear son , this blood will protect you. ” [ d ]
CEV	Exodus	4	26	So the Lord did not harm Moses . Then Zipporah said , “ Yes , my dear , you are safe because of this circumcision. ” [ e ] Aaron Is Sent To Meet Moses
CEV	Exodus	4	27	The Lord sent Aaron to meet Moses in the desert . So Aaron met Moses at Mount Sinai [ f ] and greeted him with a kiss .
CEV	Exodus	4	28	Moses told Aaron what God had sent him to say ; he also told him about the miracles God had given him the power to perform .
CEV	Exodus	4	29	Later they brought together the leaders of Israel ,
CEV	Exodus	4	30	and Aaron told them what the Lord had sent Moses to say . Then Moses worked the miracles for the people ,
CEV	Exodus	4	31	and everyone believed . They bowed down and worshiped the Lord because they knew that he had seen their suffering and was going to help them .

CEV	Exodus	5	5	Moses and Aaron went to the king [ a ] of Egypt and told him , “ The Lord God says , ‘ Let my people go into the desert , so they can honor me with a celebration there. ’ ”
CEV	Exodus	5	2	“ Who is this Lord and why should I obey him ? ” the king replied . “ I refuse to let you and your people go ! ”
CEV	Exodus	5	3	They answered , “ The Lord God of the Hebrews has appeared to us . Please let us walk three days into the desert where we can offer sacrifices to him . If you do n't , he may strike us down with terrible troubles or with war. ” 4-5 The king said , “ Moses and Aaron , why are you keeping these people from working ? Look how many you are keeping from doing their work . Now everyone get back to work ! ”
CEV	Exodus	5	6	That same day the king gave orders to his Egyptian slave bosses and to the Israelite men directly in charge of the Israelite slaves . He told them :
CEV	Exodus	5	7	Do n't give the slaves any more straw [ b ] to put in their bricks . Force them to find their own straw wherever they can ,
CEV	Exodus	5	8	but they must make the same number of bricks as before . They are lazy , or else they would not beg me to let them go and sacrifice to their God .
CEV	Exodus	5	9	Make them work so hard that they wo n't have time to listen to these lies .
CEV	Exodus	5	10	The slave bosses and the men in charge of the slaves went out and told them , “ The king says he will not give you any more straw .
CEV	Exodus	5	11	Go and find your own straw wherever you can , but you must still make as many bricks as before. ”
CEV	Exodus	5	12	The slaves went all over Egypt , looking for straw .
CEV	Exodus	5	13	But the slave bosses were hard on them and kept saying , “ Each day you have to make as many bricks as you did when you were given straw. ”
CEV	Exodus	5	14	The bosses beat the men in charge of the slaves and said , “ Why did n't you force the slaves to make as many bricks yesterday and today as they did before ? ”
CEV	Exodus	5	15	Finally , the men in charge of the slaves went to the king and said , “ Why are you treating us like this ?
CEV	Exodus	5	16	No one brings us any straw , but we are still ordered to make the same number of bricks . We are beaten with whips , and your own people are to blame. ”
CEV	Exodus	5	17	The king replied , “ You are lazy—nothing but lazy ! That 's why you keep asking me to let you go and sacrifice to your Lord .
CEV	Exodus	5	18	Get back to work ! You wo n't be given straw , but you must still make the same number of bricks. ”
CEV	Exodus	5	19	The men knew they were in deep trouble when they were ordered to make the same number of bricks each day .
CEV	Exodus	5	20	After they left the king , they went to see Moses and Aaron , who had been waiting for them .
CEV	Exodus	5	21	Then the men said , “ We hope the Lord will punish both of you for making the king and his officials hate us . Now they even have an excuse to kill us. ” The Lord 's Promise to Moses
CEV	Exodus	5	22	Moses left them and prayed , “ Our Lord , why have you brought so much trouble on your people ? Is that why you sent me here ?

CEV	Exodus	6	9	When Moses told this to the Israelites , they were too discouraged and mistreated to believe him .
CEV	Exodus	6	10	Then the Lord told Moses
CEV	Exodus	6	11	to demand that the king of Egypt let the Israelites leave .
CEV	Exodus	6	12	But Moses replied , “ I 'm not a powerful speaker . If the Israelites wo n't listen to me , why should the king of Egypt ? ”

CEV	Exodus	8	2	If he refuses , I will cover his entire country with frogs .
CEV	Exodus	8	3	Warn the king that the Nile will be full of frogs , and from there they will spread into the royal palace , including the king 's bedroom and even his bed . Frogs will enter the homes of his officials and will find their way into ovens and into the bowls of bread dough .

CEV	Exodus	8	5	Moses , now command Aaron to hold his stick over the water . Then frogs will come from all rivers , canals , and ponds in Egypt , and they will cover the land .
CEV	Exodus	8	6	Aaron obeyed , and suddenly frogs were everywhere in Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	8	7	But the magicians used their secret powers to do the same thing .
CEV	Exodus	8	9	“ All right , ” Moses answered . “ You choose the time when I am to pray for the frogs to stop bothering you , your officials , and your people , and for them to leave your houses and be found only in the river. ”
CEV	Exodus	8	10	“ Do it tomorrow ! ” the king replied . “ As you wish , ” Moses agreed . “ Then everyone will discover that there is no god like the Lord ,

CEV	Exodus	8	12	After Moses and Aaron left the palace , Moses begged the Lord to do something about the frogs he had sent as punishment for the king .
CEV	Exodus	8	13	The Lord listened to Moses , and the frogs died everywhere—in houses , yards , and fields .

CEV	Exodus	8	18	When the magicians tried to use their secret powers to do this , [ b ] they failed , and gnats stayed on people and animals .
CEV	Exodus	8	19	( A ) The magicians told the king , [ c ] “ God has done this. ” But , as the Lord had said , the king was too stubborn to listen . Flies
CEV	Exodus	8	20	The Lord said to Moses : Early tomorrow morning , while the king [ d ] is on his way to the river , go and say to him , “ The Lord commands you to let his people go , so they can worship him .

CEV	Exodus	8	24	The Lord kept his promise—the palace and the homes of the royal officials swarmed with flies , and the rest of the country was infested with them as well .
CEV	Exodus	8	25	Then the king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them , “ Go ahead and sacrifice to your God , but stay here in Egypt. ”
CEV	Exodus	8	26	“ That 's impossible ! ” Moses replied . “ Any sacrifices we offer to the Lord our God would disgust the Egyptians , and they would stone us to death .
CEV	Exodus	8	27	No indeed ! The Lord has ordered us to walk three days into the desert before offering sacrifices to him , and that 's what we have to do. ”
CEV	Exodus	8	28	Then the king told him , “ I 'll let you go into the desert to offer sacrifices , if you do n't go very far . But in the meantime , pray for me. ”
CEV	Exodus	8	29	“ Your Majesty , ” Moses replied , “ I 'll pray for you as soon as I leave , and by tomorrow the flies will stop bothering you , your officials , and the citizens of your country . Only make sure that you 're telling the truth this time and that you really intend to let our people offer sacrifices to the Lord. ”
CEV	Exodus	8	30	After leaving the palace , Moses prayed ,

CEV	Exodus	9	15	In fact , he could already have sent a terrible disease and wiped you from the face of the earth .
CEV	Exodus	9	16	( B ) But he has kept you alive , just to show you his power and to bring honor to himself everywhere in the world .
CEV	Exodus	9	17	You are still determined not to let the Lord 's people go .
CEV	Exodus	9	18	All right . At this time tomorrow , he will bring on Egypt the worst hailstorm in its history .
CEV	Exodus	9	19	You had better give orders for every person and every animal in Egypt to take shelter . If they do n't , they will die .
CEV	Exodus	9	20	Some of the king 's officials were frightened by what the Lord had said , and they hurried off to make sure their slaves and animals were safe .
CEV	Exodus	9	21	But others paid no attention to his threats and left their slaves and animals out in the open .
CEV	Exodus	9	22	Then the Lord told Moses , “ Stretch your arm toward the sky , so that hailstones will fall on people , animals , and crops in the land of Egypt. ” 23-24 ( C ) Moses pointed his walking stick toward the sky , and hailstones started falling everywhere . Thunder roared , and lightning flashed back and forth , striking the ground . This was the worst storm in the history of Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	9	25	People , animals , and crops were pounded by the hailstones , and bark was stripped from trees .
CEV	Exodus	9	26	Only Goshen , where the Israelites lived , was safe from the storm .
CEV	Exodus	9	27	The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them , “ Now I have really sinned ! My people and I are guilty , and the Lord is right .
CEV	Exodus	9	28	We ca n't stand any more of this thunder and hail . Please ask the Lord to make it stop . Your people can go—you do n't have to stay in Egypt any longer. ”
CEV	Exodus	9	29	Moses answered , “ As soon as I leave the city , I will lift my arms in prayer . When the thunder and hail stop , you will know that the earth belongs to the Lord .
CEV	Exodus	9	30	But I am certain that neither you nor your officials really fear the Lord God. ”
CEV	Exodus	9	31	Meanwhile , the flax and barley crops had been destroyed by the storm because they were ready to ripen .
CEV	Exodus	9	32	But the wheat crops [ d ] ripen later , and they were not damaged .
CEV	Exodus	9	33	After Moses left the royal palace and the city , he lifted his arms in prayer to the Lord , and the thunder , hail , and drenching rain stopped .
CEV	Exodus	9	34	When the king realized that the storm was over , he disobeyed once more . He and his officials were so stubborn
CEV	Exodus	9	35	that he refused to let the Israelites go . This was exactly what the Lord had said would happen . Copyright ©

CEV	Exodus	10	10	The king replied , “ The Lord had better watch over you on the day I let you leave with your families ! You 're up to no good .
CEV	Exodus	10	2	I did this because I want you to tell your children and your grandchildren about my miracles and about my harsh treatment of the Egyptians . Then all of you will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Exodus	10	3	Moses and Aaron went to the king and told him that the Lord God of the Hebrews had said : How long will you stubbornly refuse to obey ? Release my people so they can worship me .
CEV	Exodus	10	4	Do this by tomorrow , or I will cover your country with so many locusts [ b ]
CEV	Exodus	10	5	that you wo n't be able to see the ground . Most of your crops were ruined by the hailstones , but these locusts will destroy what little is left , including the trees .
CEV	Exodus	10	6	Your palace , the homes of your officials , and all the other houses in Egypt will overflow with more locusts than have ever been seen in this country . After Moses left the palace ,
CEV	Exodus	10	7	the king 's officials asked , “ Your Majesty , how much longer is this man going to be a troublemaker ? Why do n't you let the people leave , so they can worship the Lord their God ? Do n't you know that Egypt is a disaster ? ”
CEV	Exodus	10	8	The king had Moses and Aaron brought back , and he said , “ All right , you may go and worship the Lord your God . But first tell me who will be going. ”
CEV	Exodus	10	9	“ Everyone , young and old , ” Moses answered . “ We will even take our sheep , goats , and cattle , because we want to hold a celebration in honor of the Lord. ”
CEV	Exodus	10	11	Do you want to worship the Lord ? All right , take only the men and go. ” Then Moses and Aaron were chased out of the palace .

CEV	Exodus	10	14	( A ) were swarming everywhere . Never before had there been so many locusts in Egypt , and never again will there be so many .
CEV	Exodus	10	15	The ground was black with locusts , and they ate everything left on the trees and in the fields . Nothing green remained in Egypt—not a tree or a plant .
CEV	Exodus	10	16	At once the king sent for Moses and Aaron . He told them , “ I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you .
CEV	Exodus	10	17	Forgive me one more time and ask the Lord to stop these insects from killing every living plant. ”
CEV	Exodus	10	18	Moses left the palace and prayed .
CEV	Exodus	10	19	Then the Lord sent a strong west wind [ c ] that swept the locusts into the Red Sea . [ d ] Not one locust was left anywhere in Egypt ,
CEV	Exodus	10	20	but the Lord made the king so stubborn that he still refused to let the Israelites go . Darkness
CEV	Exodus	10	21	( B ) The Lord said to Moses , “ Stretch your arm toward the sky , and everything will be covered with darkness thick enough to touch. ”
CEV	Exodus	10	22	( C ) Moses stretched his arm toward the sky , and Egypt was covered with darkness for three days .
CEV	Exodus	10	23	During that time , the Egyptians could not see each other or leave their homes , but there was light where the Israelites lived .
CEV	Exodus	10	24	The king [ e ] sent for Moses and told him , “ Go worship the Lord ! And take your families with you . Just leave your sheep , goats , and cattle. ”
CEV	Exodus	10	25	“ No ! ” Moses replied . “ You must let us offer sacrifices to the Lord our God ,
CEV	Exodus	10	26	and we wo n't know which animals we will need until we get there . That 's why we ca n't leave even one of them here. ”
CEV	Exodus	10	27	This time the Lord made the king so stubborn
CEV	Exodus	10	28	that he said to Moses , “ Get out and stay out ! If you ever come back , you 're dead ! ”

CEV	Exodus	11	11	The Lord said to Moses : I am going to punish the king [ a ] of Egypt and his people one more time . Then the king will gladly let you leave his land . In fact , he will even chase you out .
CEV	Exodus	11	2	Now go and tell my people to ask their Egyptian neighbors for gold and silver jewelry .
CEV	Exodus	11	3	So the Lord made the Egyptians greatly respect the Israelites , and everyone , including the king 's officials , considered Moses an important leader .
CEV	Exodus	11	4	Moses went to the king and said : I have come to let you know what the Lord is going to do . About midnight he will go through the land of Egypt ,
CEV	Exodus	11	5	and wherever he goes , the first-born son in every family will die . Your own son will die , and so will the son of the lowest slave woman . Even the first-born males of your cattle will die .
CEV	Exodus	11	6	Everywhere in Egypt there will be loud crying . Nothing like this has ever happened before or will ever happen again .
CEV	Exodus	11	7	But there wo n't be any need for the Israelites to cry . Things will be so quiet that not even a dog will be heard barking . Then you Egyptians will know that the Lord is good to the Israelites , even while he punishes you .
CEV	Exodus	11	8	Your leaders will come and bow down , begging me to take my people and leave your country . Then we will leave . Moses was very angry ; he turned and left the king .
CEV	Exodus	11	9	What the Lord had earlier said to Moses came true . He had said , “ The king of Egypt wo n't listen . Then I will perform even more miracles. ”
CEV	Exodus	11	10	So the king of Egypt saw Moses and Aaron work miracles , but the Lord made him stubbornly refuse to let the Israelites leave his country . Footnotes - 11.1 The king : See the note at 1.11 . Copyright ©

CEV	Exodus	12	12	That same night I will pass through Egypt and kill the first-born son in every family and the first-born male of all animals . I am the Lord , and I will punish the gods of Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	12	2	This month [ a ] is to be the first month of the year for you .
CEV	Exodus	12	3	Tell the people of Israel that on the tenth day of this month the head of each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for his family to eat . 4-5 If any family is too small to eat the whole animal , they must share it with their next-door neighbors . Choose either a sheep or a goat , but it must be a one-year-old male that has nothing wrong with it . And it must be large enough for everyone to have some of the meat .
CEV	Exodus	12	6	Each family must take care of its animal until the evening of the fourteenth day of the month , when the animals are to be killed .
CEV	Exodus	12	7	Some of the blood must be put on the two doorposts and above the door of each house where the animals are to be eaten .
CEV	Exodus	12	8	That night the animals are to be roasted and eaten , together with bitter herbs and thin bread made without yeast .
CEV	Exodus	12	9	Do n't eat the meat raw or boiled . The entire animal , including its head , legs , and insides , must be roasted .
CEV	Exodus	12	10	Eat what you want that night , and the next morning burn whatever is left .
CEV	Exodus	12	11	When you eat the meal , be dressed and ready to travel . Have your sandals on , carry your walking stick in your hand , and eat quickly . This is the Passover Festival in honor of me , your Lord .
CEV	Exodus	12	13	The blood on the houses will show me where you live , and when I see the blood , I will pass over you . Then you wo n't be bothered by the terrible disasters I will bring on Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	12	14	( B ) Remember this day and celebrate it each year as a festival in my honor .
CEV	Exodus	12	15	For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast . And on the first of these seven days , you must remove all yeast from your homes . If you eat anything made with yeast during this festival , you will no longer be part of Israel .
CEV	Exodus	12	16	Meet together for worship on the first and seventh days of the festival . The only work you are allowed to do on either of these two days is that of preparing the bread .
CEV	Exodus	12	17	Celebrate this Festival of Thin Bread as a way of remembering the day that I brought your families and tribes out of Egypt . And do this each year .
CEV	Exodus	12	18	Begin on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month by eating bread made without yeast . Then continue this celebration until the evening of the twenty-first day .
CEV	Exodus	12	19	During these seven days no yeast is allowed in anyone 's home , whether they are native Israelites or not . If you are caught eating anything made with yeast , you will no longer be part of Israel .
CEV	Exodus	12	20	Stay away from yeast , no matter where you live . No one is allowed to eat anything made with yeast !
CEV	Exodus	12	21	Moses called the leaders of Israel together and said : Each family is to pick out a sheep and kill it for Passover .
CEV	Exodus	12	22	Make a brush from a few small branches of a hyssop plant and dip the brush in the bowl that has the blood of the animal in it . Then brush some of the blood above the door and on the posts at each side of the door of your house . After this , everyone is to stay inside until morning .
CEV	Exodus	12	23	( C ) During that night the Lord will go through the country of Egypt and kill the first-born son in every Egyptian family . He will see where you have put the blood , and he will not come into your house . His angel that brings death will pass over and not kill your first-born sons . 24-25 After you have entered the country promised to you by the Lord , you and your children must continue to celebrate Passover each year .
CEV	Exodus	12	26	Your children will ask you , “ What are we celebrating ? ”
CEV	Exodus	12	27	And you will answer , “ The Passover animal is killed to honor the Lord . We do these things because on that night long ago the Lord passed over the homes of our people in Egypt . He killed the first-born sons of the Egyptians , but he spared our children from death. ” After Moses finished speaking , the people of Israel knelt down and worshiped the Lord .
CEV	Exodus	12	28	Then they left and did what Moses and Aaron had told them to do . Death for the First-Born Sons
CEV	Exodus	12	29	( D ) At midnight the Lord killed the first-born son of every Egyptian family , from the son of the king [ b ] to the son of every prisoner in jail . He also killed the first-born male of every animal that belonged to the Egyptians .
CEV	Exodus	12	30	That night the king , his officials , and everyone else in Egypt got up and started crying bitterly . In every Egyptian home , someone was dead . The People of Israel Escape from Egypt
CEV	Exodus	12	31	During the night the king [ c ] sent for Moses and Aaron and told them , “ Get your people out of my country and leave us alone ! Go and worship the Lord , as you have asked .
CEV	Exodus	12	32	Take your sheep , goats , and cattle , and get out . But ask your God to be kind to me. ”
CEV	Exodus	12	33	The Egyptians did everything they could to get the Israelites to leave their country as quickly as possible . They said , “ Please hurry and leave . If you do n't , we will all be dead. ”
CEV	Exodus	12	34	So the Israelites quickly made some bread dough and put it in pans . But they did not mix any yeast in the dough to make it rise . They wrapped cloth around the pans and carried them on their shoulders .
CEV	Exodus	12	35	( E ) The Israelites had already done what Moses had told them to do . They had gone to their Egyptian neighbors and asked for gold and silver and for clothes .
CEV	Exodus	12	36	The Lord had made the Egyptians friendly toward the people of Israel , and they gave them whatever they asked for . In this way they carried away the wealth of the Egyptians when they left Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	12	37	The Israelites walked from the city of Rameses to the city of Succoth . There were about 600,000 of them , not counting women and children .
CEV	Exodus	12	38	Many other people went with them as well , and there were also a lot of sheep , goats , and cattle .
CEV	Exodus	12	39	They left Egypt in such a hurry that they did not have time to prepare any food except the bread dough made without yeast . So they baked it and made thin bread . 40-41 ( F ) The Lord 's people left Egypt exactly
CEV	Exodus	12	430	years after they had arrived .
CEV	Exodus	12	42	On that night the Lord kept watch for them , and on this same night each year Israel will always keep watch in honor of the Lord . Instructions for Passover
CEV	Exodus	12	43	The Lord gave Moses and Aaron the following instructions for celebrating Passover : Only Israelites may eat the Passover meal .
CEV	Exodus	12	44	Your slaves may eat the meal if they have been circumcised ,
CEV	Exodus	12	45	but no foreigners who work for you are allowed to have any .
CEV	Exodus	12	46	( G ) The entire meal must be eaten inside , and no one may leave the house during the celebration . No bones of the Passover lamb may be broken .
CEV	Exodus	12	47	And all Israelites must take part in the meal .
CEV	Exodus	12	48	If anyone who is n't an Israelite wants to celebrate Passover with you , every man and boy in that family must first be circumcised . Then they may join in the meal , just like native Israelites . No uncircumcised man or boy may eat the Passover meal !
CEV	Exodus	12	49	This law applies both to native Israelites and to those foreigners who live among you .
CEV	Exodus	12	50	The Israelites obeyed everything the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron to tell them .
CEV	Exodus	12	51	And on that same day the Lord brought Israel 's families and tribes out of Egypt . Copyright ©

CEV	Exodus	13	13	You can spare the life of a first-born donkey [ b ] by sacrificing a lamb ; if you do n't , you must break the donkey 's neck . You must spare every first-born son .
CEV	Exodus	13	2	( A ) “ Dedicate to me the first-born son of every family and the first-born males of your flocks and herds . These belong to me. ” The Festival of Thin Bread 3-4 Moses said to the people : Remember this day in the month of Abib . [ a ] It is the day when the Lord 's mighty power rescued you from Egypt , where you were slaves . Do not eat anything made with yeast .
CEV	Exodus	13	5	The Lord promised your ancestors that he would bring you into the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Hivites , and Jebusites . It is a land rich with milk and honey . Each year during the month of Abib , celebrate these events in the following way :
CEV	Exodus	13	6	For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast , and on the seventh day you are to celebrate a festival in honor of the Lord .
CEV	Exodus	13	7	During those seven days , you must not eat anything made with yeast or even have yeast anywhere near your homes .
CEV	Exodus	13	8	Then on the seventh day you must explain to your children that you do this because the Lord brought you out of Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	13	9	This celebration will be like wearing a sign on your hand or on your forehead , because then you will pass on to others the teaching of the Lord , whose mighty power brought you out of Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	13	10	Celebrate this festival each year at the same time .
CEV	Exodus	13	11	The Lord will give you the land of the Canaanites , just as he promised you and your ancestors .
CEV	Exodus	13	12	( B ) From then on , you must give him every first-born son from your families and every first-born male from your animals , because these belong to him .
CEV	Exodus	13	14	In the future your children will ask what this ceremony means . Explain it to them by saying , “ The Lord used his mighty power to rescue us from slavery in Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	13	15	The king [ c ] stubbornly refused to set us free , so the Lord killed the first-born male of every animal and the first-born son of every Egyptian family . This is why we sacrifice to the Lord every first-born male of every animal and save every first-born son. ”
CEV	Exodus	13	16	This ceremony will serve the same purpose as a sign on your hand or on your forehead to tell how the Lord 's mighty power rescued us from Egypt . The Lord Leads His People
CEV	Exodus	13	17	After the king [ d ] had finally let the people go , the Lord did not lead them through Philistine territory , [ e ] though that was the shortest way . God had said , “ If they are attacked , they may decide to return to Egypt. ”
CEV	Exodus	13	18	So he led them around through the desert and toward the Red Sea . [ f ] The Israelites left Egypt , prepared for battle .
CEV	Exodus	13	19	( C ) Moses had them take the bones of Joseph , whose dying words had been , “ God will come to your rescue , and when he does , be sure to take my bones with you. ”
CEV	Exodus	13	20	The people of Israel left Succoth and camped at Etham at the border of Egypt near the desert . 21-22 ( D ) During the day the Lord went ahead of his people in a thick cloud , and during the night he went ahead of them in a flaming fire . That way the Lord could lead them at all times , whether day or night .

CEV	Exodus	14	14	The Lord will fight for you , and you wo n't have to do a thing. ”
CEV	Exodus	14	2	Tell the people of Israel to turn back and camp across from Pi-Hahiroth near Baal-Zephon , between Migdol and the Red Sea . [ a ]
CEV	Exodus	14	3	The king [ b ] will think you were afraid to cross the desert and that you are wandering around , trying to find another way to leave the country .
CEV	Exodus	14	4	I will make the king stubborn again , and he will try to catch you . Then I will destroy him and his army . People everywhere will praise me for my victory , and the Egyptians will know that I really am the Lord . The Israelites obeyed the Lord and camped where he told them .
CEV	Exodus	14	5	When the king of Egypt heard that the Israelites had finally left , he and his officials changed their minds and said , “ Look what we have done ! We let them get away , and they will no longer be our slaves. ”
CEV	Exodus	14	6	The king got his war chariot and army ready .
CEV	Exodus	14	7	He commanded his officers in charge of his
CEV	Exodus	14	600	best chariots and all his other chariots to start after the Israelites .
CEV	Exodus	14	8	The Lord made the king so stubborn that he went after them , while the Israelites proudly [ c ] went on their way .
CEV	Exodus	14	9	But the king 's horses and chariots and soldiers caught up with them while they were camping by the Red Sea near Pi-Hahiroth and Baal-Zephon .
CEV	Exodus	14	10	When the Israelites saw the king coming with his army , they were frightened and begged the Lord for help .
CEV	Exodus	14	11	They also complained to Moses , “ Was n't there enough room in Egypt to bury us ? Is that why you brought us out here to die in the desert ? Why did you bring us out of Egypt anyway ?
CEV	Exodus	14	12	While we were there , did n't we tell you to leave us alone ? We 'd rather be slaves in Egypt than die in this desert ! ”
CEV	Exodus	14	13	But Moses answered , “ Do n't be afraid ! Be brave , and you will see the Lord save you today . These Egyptians will never bother you again .
CEV	Exodus	14	15	The Lord said to Moses , “ Why do you keep calling out to me for help ? Tell the Israelites to move forward .
CEV	Exodus	14	16	Then hold your walking stick over the sea . The water will open up and make a road where they can walk through on dry ground .
CEV	Exodus	14	17	I will make the Egyptians so stubborn that they will go after you . Then I will be praised because of what happens to the king and his chariots and cavalry .
CEV	Exodus	14	18	The Egyptians will know for sure that I am the Lord. ”
CEV	Exodus	14	19	All this time God 's angel had gone ahead of Israel 's army , but now he moved behind them . A large cloud had also gone ahead of them ,
CEV	Exodus	14	20	but now it moved between the Egyptians and the Israelites . The cloud gave light to the Israelites , but made it dark for the Egyptians , and during the night they could not come any closer .
CEV	Exodus	14	21	( A ) Moses stretched his arm over the sea , and the Lord sent a strong east wind that blew all night until there was dry land where the water had been . The sea opened up ,
CEV	Exodus	14	22	( B ) and the Israelites walked through on dry land with a wall of water on each side .
CEV	Exodus	14	23	The Egyptian chariots and cavalry went after them .
CEV	Exodus	14	24	But before daylight the Lord looked down at the Egyptian army from the fiery cloud and made them panic .
CEV	Exodus	14	25	Their chariot wheels got stuck , [ d ] and it was hard for them to move . So the Egyptians said to one another , “ Let 's leave these people alone ! The Lord is on their side and is fighting against us. ”
CEV	Exodus	14	26	The Lord told Moses , “ Stretch your arm toward the sea—the water will cover the Egyptians and their cavalry and chariots. ”
CEV	Exodus	14	27	Moses stretched out his arm , and at daybreak the water rushed toward the Egyptians . They tried to run away , but the Lord drowned them in the sea .
CEV	Exodus	14	28	The water came and covered the chariots , the cavalry , and the whole Egyptian army that had followed the Israelites into the sea . Not one of them was left alive .
CEV	Exodus	14	29	But the sea had made a wall of water on each side of the Israelites , so they walked through on dry land .
CEV	Exodus	14	30	On that day , when the Israelites saw the bodies of the Egyptians washed up on the shore , they knew that the Lord had saved them .

CEV	Exodus	15	22	After the Israelites left the Red Sea , [ c ] Moses led them through the Shur Desert for three days , before finding water .
CEV	Exodus	15	23	They did find water at Marah , but it was bitter , which is how that place got its name . [ d ]
CEV	Exodus	15	24	The people complained and said , “ Moses , what are we going to drink ? ”
CEV	Exodus	15	25	( E ) Moses asked the Lord for help , and the Lord told him to throw a certain piece of wood into the water . Moses did so , and the water became fit to drink . At Marah the Lord tested his people and also gave them some laws and teachings .

CEV	Exodus	16	16	And he orders you to gather about two liters for each person in your family—that should be more than enough. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	2	There in the desert they started complaining to Moses and Aaron ,
CEV	Exodus	16	3	“ We wish the Lord had killed us in Egypt . When we lived there , we could at least sit down and eat all the bread and meat we wanted . But you have brought us out here into this desert , where we are going to starve. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	4	( A ) The Lord said to Moses , “ I will send bread [ b ] down from heaven like rain . Tell the people to go out each day and gather only enough for that day . That 's how I will see if they obey me .
CEV	Exodus	16	5	But on the sixth day of each week they must gather and cook twice as much. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	6	Moses and Aaron told the people , “ This evening you will know that the Lord was the one who rescued you from Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	16	7	And in the morning you will see his glorious power , because he has heard your complaints against him . Why should you grumble to us ? Who are we ? ”
CEV	Exodus	16	8	Then Moses continued , “ You will know it is the Lord when he gives you meat each evening and more than enough bread each morning . He is really the one you are complaining about , not us—we are nobodies—but the Lord has heard your complaints. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	9	Moses turned to Aaron and said , “ Bring the people together , because the Lord has heard their complaints. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	10	Aaron was speaking to them , when everyone looked out toward the desert and saw the bright glory of the Lord in a cloud .
CEV	Exodus	16	11	The Lord said to Moses ,
CEV	Exodus	16	12	“ I have heard my people complain . Now tell them that each evening they will have meat and each morning they will have more than enough bread . Then they will know that I am the Lord their God. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	13	That evening a lot of quails came and landed everywhere in the camp , and the next morning dew covered the ground .
CEV	Exodus	16	14	After the dew had gone , the desert was covered with thin flakes that looked like frost .
CEV	Exodus	16	15	( B ) The people had never seen anything like this , and they started asking each other , “ What is it ? ” [ c ] Moses answered , “ This is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat .
CEV	Exodus	16	17	They did as they were told . Some gathered more and some gathered less .
CEV	Exodus	16	18	( C ) Everyone had exactly what they needed , just the right amount .
CEV	Exodus	16	19	Moses told them not to keep any overnight .
CEV	Exodus	16	20	Some of them disobeyed , but the next morning what they kept was stinking and full of worms , and Moses was angry .
CEV	Exodus	16	21	Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed , and in the heat of the day the rest melted .
CEV	Exodus	16	22	However , on the sixth day of the week , everyone gathered enough to have four liters , instead of two . When the leaders reported this to Moses ,
CEV	Exodus	16	23	( D ) he told them that the Lord had said , “ Tomorrow is the Sabbath , a sacred day of rest in honor of me . So gather all you want to bake or boil , and make sure you save enough for tomorrow. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	24	The people obeyed , and the next morning the food smelled fine and had no worms .
CEV	Exodus	16	25	“ You may eat the food , ” Moses said . “ Today is the Sabbath in honor of the Lord , and there wo n't be any of this food on the ground today .
CEV	Exodus	16	26	You will find it there for the first six days of the week , but not on the Sabbath. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	27	A few of the Israelites did go out to look for some , but there was none .
CEV	Exodus	16	28	Then the Lord said , “ Moses , how long will you people keep disobeying my laws and teachings ?
CEV	Exodus	16	29	Remember that I was the one who gave you the Sabbath . That 's why on the sixth day I provide enough bread for two days . Everyone is to stay home and rest on the Sabbath. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	30	And so they rested on the Sabbath .
CEV	Exodus	16	31	( E ) The Israelites called the bread manna . [ d ] It was white like coriander seed and delicious as wafers made with honey .
CEV	Exodus	16	32	Moses told the people that the Lord had said , “ Store up two liters of this manna , because I want future generations to see the food I gave you during the time you were in the desert after I rescued you from Egypt. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	33	( F ) Then Moses told Aaron , “ Put some manna in a jar and store it in the place of worship for future generations to see. ”
CEV	Exodus	16	34	Aaron followed the Lord 's instructions and put the manna in front of the sacred chest for safekeeping . 35-36 ( G ) The Israelites ate manna for
CEV	Exodus	16	40	years , before they came to the border of Canaan that was a settled land . [ e ] Footnotes - 16.1 the western edge of the Sinai Desert : Hebrew “ the Sin Desert. ” - 16.4 bread : This was something like a thin wafer , and it was called “ manna , ” which in Hebrew means , “ What is it ? ” - 16.15 What is it : See the note at 16.4 . - 16.31 manna : See the note at 16.4 . - 16.35,36 land : The Hebrew text adds , “ An omer is one tenth of an ephah. ” In the CEV “ omer ” is usually translated “ two liters. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Exodus	17	17	( A ) The Israelites left the desert and moved from one place to another each time the Lord ordered them to . Once they camped at Rephidim , [ a ] but there was no water for them to drink .
CEV	Exodus	17	2	The people started complaining to Moses , “ Give us some water ! ” Moses replied , “ Why are you complaining to me and trying to put the Lord to the test ? ”
CEV	Exodus	17	3	But the people were thirsty and kept on complaining , “ Moses , did you bring us out of Egypt just to let us and our families and our animals die of thirst ? ”
CEV	Exodus	17	4	Then Moses prayed to the Lord , “ What am I going to do with these people ? They are about to stone me to death ! ”
CEV	Exodus	17	5	The Lord answered , “ Take some of the leaders with you and go ahead of the rest of the people . Also take along the walking stick with which you struck the Nile River .
CEV	Exodus	17	6	When you get to the rock at Mount Sinai , [ b ] I will be there with you . Strike the rock with the stick , and water will pour out for the people to drink. ” Moses did this while the leaders watched .
CEV	Exodus	17	7	The people had complained and tested the Lord by asking , “ Is the Lord really with us ? ” So Moses named that place Massah , which means “ testing ” and Meribah , which means “ complaining. ” Israel Defeats the Amalekites
CEV	Exodus	17	8	When the Israelites were at Rephidim , they were attacked by the Amalekites .
CEV	Exodus	17	9	So Moses told Joshua , “ Have some men ready to attack the Amalekites tomorrow . I will stand on a hilltop , holding this walking stick that has the power of God. ”
CEV	Exodus	17	10	Joshua led the attack as Moses had commanded , while Moses , Aaron , and Hur stood on the hilltop .
CEV	Exodus	17	11	The Israelites out-fought the Amalekites as long as Moses held up his arms , but they started losing whenever he lowered them .
CEV	Exodus	17	12	After a while , his arms were so tired that Aaron and Hur got a rock for him to sit on . Then they stood beside him and supported his arms in the same position until sunset .
CEV	Exodus	17	13	That 's how Joshua defeated the Amalekites .
CEV	Exodus	17	14	( B ) Afterwards , the Lord said to Moses , “ Write an account of this victory and read it to Joshua . I want the Amalekites to be forgotten forever. ”
CEV	Exodus	17	15	Moses built an altar and named it “ The Lord Gives Me Victory. ”
CEV	Exodus	17	16	Then Moses explained , “ This is because I depended on the Lord . [ c ] But in future generations , the Lord will fight the Amalekites again and again. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Exodus	18	18	You and the people who come to you will soon be worn out . The job is too much for one person ; you ca n't do it alone .
CEV	Exodus	18	7	When they arrived , Moses went out and bowed down in front of Jethro , then kissed him . After they had greeted each other , they went into the tent ,
CEV	Exodus	18	8	where Moses told him everything the Lord had done to protect Israel against the Egyptians and their king . He also told him how the Lord had helped them in all of their troubles .
CEV	Exodus	18	9	Jethro was so pleased to hear this good news about what the Lord had done ,
CEV	Exodus	18	10	,
CEV	Exodus	18	11	( B ) Now I know that the Lord is the greatest God , because he has rescued Israel from their arrogant enemies. ”
CEV	Exodus	18	12	Jethro offered sacrifices to God . Then Aaron and Israel 's leaders came to eat with Jethro there at the place of worship . Judges Are Appointed ( Deuteronomy 1.9-18 )
CEV	Exodus	18	13	The next morning Moses sat down at the place where he decided legal cases for the people , and everyone crowded around him until evening .
CEV	Exodus	18	14	Jethro saw how much Moses had to do for the people , and he asked , “ Why are you the only judge ? Why do you let these people crowd around you from morning till evening ? ”
CEV	Exodus	18	15	Moses answered , “ Because they come here to find out what God wants them to do .
CEV	Exodus	18	16	They bring their complaints to me , and I make decisions on the basis of God 's laws. ”
CEV	Exodus	18	17	Jethro replied : That is n't the best way to do it .
CEV	Exodus	18	19	God will help you if you follow my advice . You should be the one to speak to God for the people ,
CEV	Exodus	18	20	and you should teach them God 's laws and show them what they must do to live right .
CEV	Exodus	18	21	You will need to appoint some competent leaders who respect God and are trustworthy and honest . Then put them over groups of
CEV	Exodus	18	50	,
CEV	Exodus	18	100	, and 1,000 .
CEV	Exodus	18	22	These judges can handle the ordinary cases and bring the more difficult ones to you . Having them to share the load will make your work easier .
CEV	Exodus	18	23	This is the way God wants it done . You wo n't be under nearly as much stress , and everyone else will return home feeling satisfied .
CEV	Exodus	18	24	Moses followed Jethro 's advice .
CEV	Exodus	18	25	He chose some competent leaders from every tribe in Israel and put them over groups of
CEV	Exodus	18	26	They served as judges , deciding the easy cases themselves , but bringing the more difficult ones to Moses .

CEV	Exodus	19	19	The trumpet blew louder and louder . Moses spoke , and God answered him with thunder .
CEV	Exodus	19	3	Moses went up the mountain to meet with the Lord God , who told him to say to the people :
CEV	Exodus	19	4	You saw what I did in Egypt , and you know how I brought you here to me , just as a mighty eagle carries its young .
CEV	Exodus	19	5	( A ) ( B ) Now if you will faithfully obey me , you will be my very own people . The whole world is mine ,
CEV	Exodus	19	6	( C ) but you will be my holy nation and serve me as priests . Moses , that is what you must tell the Israelites .
CEV	Exodus	19	7	After Moses went back , he reported to the leaders what the Lord had said ,
CEV	Exodus	19	8	and they all promised , “ We will do everything the Lord has commanded. ” So Moses told the Lord about this .
CEV	Exodus	19	9	The Lord said to Moses , “ I will come to you in a thick cloud and let the people hear me speak to you . Then they will always trust you. ” Again Moses reported to the Lord what the people had said .
CEV	Exodus	19	10	Once more the Lord spoke to Moses : Go back and tell the people that today and tomorrow they must get themselves ready to meet me . They must wash their clothes
CEV	Exodus	19	11	and be ready by the day after tomorrow , when I will come down to Mount Sinai , where all of them can see me .
CEV	Exodus	19	12	( D ) Warn the people that they are forbidden to touch any part of the mountain . Anyone who does will be put to death ,
CEV	Exodus	19	13	either with stones or arrows , and no one must touch the body of the person being put to death in this way . Even an animal that touches this mountain must be put to death . You may go up the mountain only after a signal is given on the trumpet .
CEV	Exodus	19	14	After Moses went down the mountain , he gave orders for the people to wash their clothes and make themselves acceptable to worship God .
CEV	Exodus	19	15	He told them to be ready in three days and not to have sex in the meantime . The Lord Comes to Mount Sinai
CEV	Exodus	19	16	( E ) ( F ) On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning . A thick cloud covered the mountain , a loud trumpet blast was heard , and everyone in camp trembled with fear .
CEV	Exodus	19	17	Moses led them out of the camp to meet God , and they stood at the foot of the mountain .
CEV	Exodus	19	18	Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the Lord had come down in a flaming fire . Smoke poured out of the mountain just like a furnace , and the whole mountain shook .
CEV	Exodus	19	20	The Lord came down to the top of Mount Sinai and told Moses to meet him there .
CEV	Exodus	19	21	Then he said , “ Moses , go and warn the people not to cross the boundary that you set at the foot of the mountain . They must not cross it to come and look at me , because if they do , many of them will die .
CEV	Exodus	19	22	Only the priests may come near me , and they must obey strict rules before I let them . If they do n't , they will be punished. ”
CEV	Exodus	19	23	Moses replied , “ The people can not come up the mountain . You warned us to stay away because it is holy. ”
CEV	Exodus	19	24	Then the Lord told Moses , “ Go down and bring Aaron back here with you . But the priests and people must not try to push their way through , or I will rush at them like a flood ! ”
CEV	Exodus	19	25	After Moses had gone back down , he told the people what the Lord had said . Footnotes - 19.1,2 Rephidim : See the note at 17.1 . Copyright ©

CEV	Exodus	20	7	( C ) Do not misuse my name . [ a ] I am the Lord your God , and I will punish anyone who misuses my name .
CEV	Exodus	20	8	( D ) Remember that the Sabbath Day belongs to me .
CEV	Exodus	20	9	( E ) You have six days when you can do your work ,
CEV	Exodus	20	10	but the seventh day of each week belongs to me , your God . No one is to work on that day—not you , your children , your slaves , your animals , or the foreigners who live in your towns .
CEV	Exodus	20	11	( F ) In six days I made the sky , the earth , the oceans , and everything in them , but on the seventh day I rested . That 's why I made the Sabbath a special day that belongs to me .

CEV	Exodus	20	18	( M ) The people trembled with fear when they heard the thunder and the trumpet and saw the lightning and the smoke coming from the mountain . They stood a long way off
CEV	Exodus	20	19	and said to Moses , “ If you speak to us , we will listen . But do n't let God speak to us , or we will die ! ”
CEV	Exodus	20	21	But when Moses went near the thick cloud where God was , the people stayed a long way off . Idols and Altars
CEV	Exodus	20	22	The Lord told Moses to say to the people of Israel : With your own eyes you saw me speak to you from heaven .
CEV	Exodus	20	23	So you must never make idols of silver or gold to worship in place of me . [ b ]
CEV	Exodus	20	24	Build an altar out of earth , and offer on it your sacrifices [ c ] of sheep , goats , and cattle . Wherever I choose to be worshiped , I will come down to bless you .
CEV	Exodus	20	25	( N ) If you ever build an altar for me out of stones , do not use any tools to chisel the stones , because that would make the altar unfit for use in worship .
CEV	Exodus	20	26	And do n't build an altar that requires steps ; you might expose yourself when you climb up .

CEV	Exodus	21	21	However , if the slave lives a few days after the beating , you are not to be punished . After all , you have already lost the services of that slave who was your property .
CEV	Exodus	21	2	( A ) If you buy a Hebrew slave , he must remain your slave for six years . But in the seventh year you must set him free , without cost to him .
CEV	Exodus	21	3	If he was single at the time you bought him , he alone must be set free . But if he was married at the time , both he and his wife must be given their freedom .
CEV	Exodus	21	4	If you give him a wife , and they have children , only the man himself must be set free ; his wife and children remain the property of his owner .
CEV	Exodus	21	5	But suppose the slave loves his wife and children and his owner so much that he wo n't leave them .
CEV	Exodus	21	6	Then he must stand beside either the door or the doorpost at the place of worship , [ a ] while his owner punches a small hole through one of his ears with a sharp metal rod . This makes him a slave for life .
CEV	Exodus	21	7	A young woman who was sold by her father does n't gain her freedom in the same way that a man does .
CEV	Exodus	21	8	If she does n't please the man who bought her to be his wife , he must let her be bought back . [ b ] He can not sell her to foreigners ; this would break the contract he made with her .
CEV	Exodus	21	9	If he selects her as a wife for his son , he must treat her as his own daughter .
CEV	Exodus	21	10	If the man later marries another woman , he must continue to provide food and clothing for the one he bought and to treat her as a wife .

CEV	Exodus	21	12	( B ) Death is the punishment for murder .
CEV	Exodus	21	13	( C ) But if you did not intend to kill someone , and I , the Lord , let it happen anyway , you may run for safety to a place that I have set aside .
CEV	Exodus	21	14	If you plan in advance to murder someone , there 's no escape , not even by holding on to my altar . [ c ] You will be dragged off and killed .
CEV	Exodus	21	15	Death is the punishment for attacking your father or mother .

CEV	Exodus	21	17	( E ) Death is the punishment for cursing your father or mother .
CEV	Exodus	21	18	Suppose two of you are arguing , and you hit the other with either a rock or your fist , without causing a fatal injury . If the victim has to stay in bed ,

CEV	Exodus	21	20	Death is the punishment for beating to death any of your slaves .
CEV	Exodus	21	22	Suppose a pregnant woman suffers a miscarriage [ d ] as the result of an injury caused by someone who is fighting . If she is n't badly hurt , the one who injured her must pay whatever fine her husband demands and the judges approve .

CEV	Exodus	21	24	( F ) eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
CEV	Exodus	21	25	burn for burn , cut for cut , and bruise for bruise .
CEV	Exodus	21	26	If you hit one of your slaves and cause the loss of an eye , the slave must be set free .

CEV	Exodus	21	28	A bull that kills someone with its horns must be killed and its meat destroyed , but the owner of the bull is n't responsible for the death .
CEV	Exodus	21	29	Suppose you own a bull that has been in the habit of attacking people , but you have refused to keep it fenced in . If that bull kills someone , both you and the bull must be put to death by stoning .
CEV	Exodus	21	30	pieces of silver for the loss of the slave , and the bull must be killed by stoning .
CEV	Exodus	21	31	This same law applies if the bull gores someone 's son or daughter .
CEV	Exodus	21	32	If the bull kills a slave , you must pay the slave owner
CEV	Exodus	21	33	Suppose someone 's ox or donkey is killed by falling into an open pit that you dug or left uncovered on your property .
CEV	Exodus	21	34	You must pay for the dead animal , and it becomes yours .
CEV	Exodus	21	35	If your bull kills someone else 's , yours must be sold . Then the money from your bull and the meat from the dead bull must be divided equally between you and the other owner .
CEV	Exodus	21	36	If you refuse to fence in a bull that is known to attack others , you must replace any animal it kills , but the dead animal will belong to you .

CEV	Exodus	28	2	Make Aaron some beautiful clothes that are worthy of a high priest .

CEV	Exodus	28	35	If Aaron wears these clothes when he enters the holy place as my high priest , the sound of the bells will be heard , and his life will not be in danger .
CEV	Exodus	28	36	On a narrow strip of pure gold engrave the words : “ Dedicated to the Lord. ”
CEV	Exodus	28	37	Fasten it to the front of Aaron 's turban with a blue cord ,
CEV	Exodus	28	38	so he can wear it on his forehead . This will show that he will take on himself the guilt for any sins the people of Israel commit in offering their gifts to me , and I will forgive them .
CEV	Exodus	28	39	Make Aaron 's robe and turban of fine linen and decorate his sash with fancy needlework . The Clothes for the Other Priests ( Exodus 39.27-29 )
CEV	Exodus	28	40	Since Aaron 's sons are priests , they should also look dignified . So make robes , sashes , and special caps for them .
CEV	Exodus	28	41	Then dress Aaron and his sons in these clothes , pour olive oil on their heads , and ordain them as my priests .
CEV	Exodus	28	42	Make linen shorts for them that reach from the waist down to the thigh , so they wo n't expose themselves .
CEV	Exodus	28	43	Whenever they enter the sacred tent or serve at the altar or enter the holy place , they must wear these shorts , or else they will be guilty and die . This same rule applies to any of their descendants who serve as priests .

CEV	Exodus	29	24	and put this bread , together with the meat , into the hands of Aaron and his sons . Then they will lift it all up [ e ] to show that it is dedicated to me .
CEV	Exodus	29	25	After this , put the meat and bread on the altar and send them up in smoke with a smell that pleases me .
CEV	Exodus	29	26	You may eat the choice ribs from this second ram , but you must first lift them up [ f ] to show that this meat is dedicated to me . 27-28 In the future , when anyone from Israel offers the ribs and a hind leg of a ram either to ordain a priest or to ask for my blessing , the meat belongs to me , but it may be eaten by the priests . This law will never change . 29-30 After Aaron 's death , his priestly clothes are to be handed down to each descendant who succeeds him as high priest , and these clothes must be worn during the seven-day ceremony of ordination .
CEV	Exodus	29	31	Boil the meat of the ordination ram in a sacred place ,
CEV	Exodus	29	32	then Aaron and his sons are to eat it together with the three kinds of bread [ g ] at the entrance to the sacred tent .
CEV	Exodus	29	33	At their ordination , a ceremony of forgiveness was performed for them with this sacred food , and only they have the right to eat it .
CEV	Exodus	29	34	If any of the sacred food is left until morning , it must be completely burned .
CEV	Exodus	29	35	Repeat this ordination ceremony for Aaron and his sons seven days in a row , just as I have instructed you .
CEV	Exodus	29	36	Each day you must offer a bull as a sacrifice for sin and as a way of purifying the altar . In addition , you must smear the altar with olive oil to make it completely holy .
CEV	Exodus	29	37	Do this for seven days , and the altar will become so holy that anyone who touches it will become holy . Daily Sacrifices ( Leviticus 6.8-13 ; Numbers 28.1-8 ) The Lord said :
CEV	Exodus	29	38	Each day you must sacrifice two lambs a year old ,
CEV	Exodus	29	39	one in the morning and one in the evening . 40-41 With each lamb offer one kilogram of your finest flour mixed with a liter of pure olive oil , and also pour out a liter of wine as an offering . The smell of this sacrifice on the fires of the altar will be pleasing to me . 42-43 You and your descendants must always offer this sacrifice on the altar at the entrance to the sacred tent . People of Israel , I will meet and speak with you there , and my shining glory will make the place holy .
CEV	Exodus	29	44	Because of who I am , the tent will become sacred , and Aaron and his sons will become worthy to serve as my priests .
CEV	Exodus	29	45	I will live among you as your God ,
CEV	Exodus	29	46	and you will know that I am the Lord your God , the one who rescued you from Egypt , so that I could live among you .

CEV	Exodus	30	30	When you ordain Aaron and his sons as my priests , sprinkle them with some of this oil ,
CEV	Exodus	30	2	Make it
CEV	Exodus	30	45	centimeters square and
CEV	Exodus	30	90	centimeters high , and make each of its four corners stick up like the horn of a bull .
CEV	Exodus	30	3	Cover it with pure gold and put a gold edging around it .
CEV	Exodus	30	4	Then below the edging on opposite sides attach two gold rings through which you can put the poles for carrying the altar .
CEV	Exodus	30	5	These poles are also to be made of acacia wood covered with gold .
CEV	Exodus	30	6	Put the altar in front of the inside curtain of the sacred tent . The chest with the place of mercy [ a ] is kept behind that curtain , and I will talk with you there . 7-8 From now on , when Aaron takes care of the lamps each morning and evening , he must burn sweet-smelling incense to me on the altar .
CEV	Exodus	30	9	Burn only the proper incense on the altar and never use it for grain sacrifices or animal sacrifices or drink offerings .
CEV	Exodus	30	10	( A ) Once a year Aaron must purify the altar by smearing on its four corners [ b ] the blood of an animal sacrificed for sin , and this practice must always be followed . The altar is sacred because it is dedicated to me . The Money for the Sacred Tent
CEV	Exodus	30	11	The Lord said to Moses :
CEV	Exodus	30	12	Find out how many grown men there are in Israel and require each of them to pay me to keep him safe from danger while you are counting them . 13-15 ( B ) Each man over
CEV	Exodus	30	19	, whether rich or poor , must pay me the same amount of money , weighed according to the official standards .
CEV	Exodus	30	16	This money is to be used for the upkeep of the sacred tent , and because of it , I will never forget my people . The Large Bronze Bowl ( Exodus 38.8 )
CEV	Exodus	30	17	The Lord said to Moses : 18-21 ( C ) Make a large bronze bowl and a bronze stand for it . Then put them between the altar for sacrifice and the sacred tent , so the priests can wash their hands and feet before entering the tent or offering a sacrifice on the altar . Each priest in every generation must wash himself in this way , or else he will die right there . The Oil for Dedication and Ordination ( Exodus 37.29 )
CEV	Exodus	30	22	( D ) The Lord said to Moses : 23-25 Mix four liters of olive oil with the following costly spices : six kilograms of myrrh , three kilograms of cinnamon , three kilograms of cane , and six kilograms of cassia . Measure these according to the official standards . Then use this sacred mixture
CEV	Exodus	30	26	for dedicating the tent and chest ,
CEV	Exodus	30	27	the table with its equipment , the lampstand with its equipment , the incense altar with all its utensils ,
CEV	Exodus	30	28	the altar for sacrifices , and the large bowl with its stand .
CEV	Exodus	30	29	By dedicating them in this way , you will make them so holy that anyone who even touches them will become holy .
CEV	Exodus	30	31	and say to the people of Israel : “ This oil must always be used in the ordination service of a priest . It is holy because it is dedicated to the Lord .
CEV	Exodus	30	32	So treat it as holy ! Do n't ever use it for everyday purposes or mix any for yourselves .
CEV	Exodus	30	33	If you do , you will no longer belong to the Lord 's people. ” The Sweet-Smelling Incense 34-35 Mix equal amounts of the costly spices stacte , onycha , galbanum , and pure frankincense , then add salt to make the mixture pure and holy .
CEV	Exodus	30	36	Pound some of it into powder and sprinkle it in front of the sacred chest , where I meet with you . Be sure to treat this incense as something very holy .
CEV	Exodus	30	37	It is truly holy because it is dedicated to me , so do n't ever make any for yourselves .
CEV	Exodus	30	38	If you ever make any of it to use as perfume , you will no longer belong to my people . Copyright ©

CEV	Exodus	31	31	The Lord said to Moses :
CEV	Exodus	31	2	I have chosen Bezalel [ a ] from the Judah tribe to make the sacred tent and its furnishings . 3-5 Not only have I filled him with my Spirit , but I have given him wisdom and made him a skilled craftsman who can create objects of art with gold , silver , bronze , precious stones , and wood .
CEV	Exodus	31	6	I have appointed Oholiab [ b ] from the tribe of Dan to work with him , and I have also given skills to those who will help them make everything exactly as I have commanded you : 7-11 the sacred tent with its furnishings , the sacred chest with its place of mercy , the table with all that is on it , the lamp with its equipment , the incense altar , the altar for sacrifices with its equipment , the bronze bowl with its stand , the beautiful priestly clothes for Aaron and his sons , the oil for dedication and ordination services , and the sweet-smelling incense for the holy place . Laws for the Sabbath 12-13 Moses told the Israelites that the Lord had said : The Sabbath belongs to me . Now I command you and your descendants to always obey the laws of the Sabbath . By doing this , you will know that I have chosen you as my own . 14-15 ( A ) Keep the Sabbath holy . You have six days to do your work , but the Sabbath is mine , and it must remain a day of rest . If you work on the Sabbath , you will no longer be part of my people , and you will be put to death .
CEV	Exodus	31	16	Every generation of Israelites must respect the Sabbath .
CEV	Exodus	31	17	( B ) This day will always serve as a reminder , both to me and to the Israelites , that I made the heavens and the earth in six days , then on the seventh day I rested and relaxed .
CEV	Exodus	31	18	When God had finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai , he gave him the two flat stones on which he had written all his laws with his own hand . Copyright ©

CEV	Exodus	32	32	( F ) But I beg you to forgive them . If you do n't , please wipe my name out of your book. ” [ a ]
CEV	Exodus	32	2	Aaron told them , “ Bring me the gold earrings that your wives and sons and daughters are wearing. ”
CEV	Exodus	32	3	Everybody took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron ,
CEV	Exodus	32	4	( B ) then he melted them and made an idol in the shape of a young bull . All the people said to one another , “ This is the god who brought us out of Egypt ! ”
CEV	Exodus	32	5	When Aaron saw what was happening , he built an altar in front of the idol and said , “ Tomorrow we will celebrate in honor of the Lord. ”
CEV	Exodus	32	6	( C ) The people got up early the next morning and killed some animals to be used for sacrifices and others to be eaten . Then everyone ate and drank so much that they began to carry on like wild people .
CEV	Exodus	32	7	The Lord said to Moses : Hurry back down ! Those people you led out of Egypt are acting like fools .
CEV	Exodus	32	8	They have already stopped obeying me and have made themselves an idol in the shape of a young bull . They have bowed down to it , offered sacrifices , and said that it is the god who brought them out of Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	32	9	Moses , I have seen how stubborn these people are ,
CEV	Exodus	32	10	and I 'm angry enough to destroy them , so do n't try to stop me . But I will make your descendants into a great nation .
CEV	Exodus	32	11	( D ) Moses tried to get the Lord God to change his mind : Our Lord , you used your mighty power to bring these people out of Egypt . Now do n't become angry and destroy them .
CEV	Exodus	32	12	If you do , the Egyptians will say that you brought your people out here into the mountains just to get rid of them . Please do n't be angry with your people . Do n't destroy them !
CEV	Exodus	32	13	( E ) Remember the solemn promise you made to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . You promised that someday they would have as many descendants as there are stars in the sky and that you would give them land .
CEV	Exodus	32	14	So even though the Lord had threatened to destroy the people , he changed his mind and let them live . 15-16 Moses went back down the mountain with the two flat stones on which God had written all of his laws with his own hand , using both sides of the stones .
CEV	Exodus	32	17	When Joshua heard the noisy shouts of the people , he said to Moses , “ A battle must be going on down in the camp. ”
CEV	Exodus	32	18	But Moses replied , “ It does n't sound like they are shouting because they have won or lost a battle . It sounds more like a wild party ! ”
CEV	Exodus	32	19	As Moses got closer to the camp , he saw the idol , and he also saw the people dancing around . This made him so angry that he threw down the stones and broke them to pieces at the foot of the mountain .
CEV	Exodus	32	20	He melted the idol the people had made , and he ground it into powder . He scattered it in their water and made them drink it .
CEV	Exodus	32	21	Moses asked Aaron , “ What did these people do to harm you ? Why did you make them sin in this terrible way ? ”
CEV	Exodus	32	22	Aaron answered : Do n't be angry with me . You know as well as I do that they are determined to do evil .
CEV	Exodus	32	23	They even told me , “ That man Moses led us out of Egypt , but now we do n't know what has happened to him . Make us a god to lead us. ”
CEV	Exodus	32	24	Then I asked them to bring me their gold earrings . They took them off and gave them to me . I threw the gold into a fire , and out came this bull .
CEV	Exodus	32	25	Moses knew that the people were out of control and that it was Aaron 's fault . And now they had made fools of themselves in front of their enemies .
CEV	Exodus	32	26	So Moses stood at the gate of the camp and shouted , “ Everyone who is on the Lord 's side come over here ! ” Then the men of the Levi tribe gathered around Moses ,
CEV	Exodus	32	27	and he said to them , “ The Lord God of Israel commands you to strap on your swords and go through the camp , killing your relatives , your friends , and your neighbors. ”
CEV	Exodus	32	28	The men of the Levi tribe followed his orders , and that day they killed about 3,000 men .
CEV	Exodus	32	29	Moses said to them , “ You obeyed the Lord and did what was right , and so you will serve as his priests for the people of Israel . It was hard for you to kill your own sons and brothers , but the Lord has blessed you and made you his priests today. ”
CEV	Exodus	32	30	The next day Moses told the people , “ This is a terrible thing you have done . But I will go back to the Lord to see if I can do something to keep this sin from being held against you. ”
CEV	Exodus	32	31	Moses returned to the Lord and said , “ The people have committed a terrible sin . They have made a gold idol to be their god .
CEV	Exodus	32	33	The Lord replied , “ I will wipe out of my book the name of everyone who has sinned against me .
CEV	Exodus	32	34	Now take my people to the place I told you about , and my angel will lead you . But when the time comes , I will punish them for this sin. ”
CEV	Exodus	32	35	So the Lord punished the people of Israel with a terrible disease for talking Aaron into making the gold idol .

CEV	Exodus	33	33	( A ) The Lord said to Moses : You led the people of Israel out of Egypt . Now get ready to lead them to the land I promised their ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . 2-3 It is a land rich with milk and honey , and I will send an angel to force out those people who live there—the Canaanites , the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . But I will not go with my people . They are so rebellious that I would destroy them before they get there . 4-5 Even before the Lord said these harsh things , he had told Moses , “ These people really are rebellious , and I would kill them at once , if I went with them . But tell them to take off their fancy jewelry , then I 'll decide what to do with them. ” So the people started mourning ,
CEV	Exodus	33	6	and after leaving Mount Sinai , [ a ] they stopped wearing fancy jewelry . The Lord Is with His People
CEV	Exodus	33	7	Moses used to set up a tent far from camp . He called it the “ meeting tent , ” and whoever needed some message from the Lord would go there .
CEV	Exodus	33	8	Each time Moses went out to this tent , everyone would stand at the entrance to their own tents and watch him enter . 9-11 Then they would bow down because a thick cloud would come down in front of the tent , and the Lord would speak to Moses face to face , just like a friend . Afterwards , Moses would return to camp , but his young assistant Joshua [ b ] would stay at the tent . The Lord Promises To Be with His People
CEV	Exodus	33	12	Moses said to the Lord , “ I know that you have told me to lead these people to the land you promised them . But you have not said who will go along to help me . You have said that you are my friend and that you are pleased with me .
CEV	Exodus	33	13	If this is true , let me know what your plans are , then I can obey and continue to please you . And do n't forget that you have chosen this nation to be your own. ”
CEV	Exodus	33	14	The Lord said , “ I will go with you and give you peace. ”
CEV	Exodus	33	15	Then Moses replied , “ If you are n't going with us , please do n't make us leave this place .
CEV	Exodus	33	16	But if you do go with us , everyone will know that you are pleased with your people and with me . That way , we will be different from the rest of the people on earth. ”
CEV	Exodus	33	17	So the Lord told him , “ I will do what you have asked , because I am your friend and I am pleased with you. ”
CEV	Exodus	33	18	Then Moses said , “ I pray that you will let me see you in all of your glory. ”
CEV	Exodus	33	19	( B ) The Lord answered : All right . I am the Lord , and I show mercy and kindness to anyone I choose . I will let you see my glory and hear my holy name ,
CEV	Exodus	33	20	but I wo n't let you see my face , because anyone who sees my face will die .
CEV	Exodus	33	21	There is a rock not far from me . Stand beside it ,
CEV	Exodus	33	22	and before I pass by in all of my shining glory , I will put you in a large crack in the rock . I will cover your eyes with my hand until I have passed by .
CEV	Exodus	33	23	Then I will take my hand away , and you will see my back . You will not see my face . Copyright ©

CEV	Exodus	34	34	Moses would always remove the veil when he went into the sacred tent to speak with the Lord . And when he came out , he would tell the people everything the Lord had told him to say .
CEV	Exodus	34	2	Be ready tomorrow morning to come up Mount Sinai and meet me at the top .
CEV	Exodus	34	3	No one is to come with you or to be on the mountain at all . Do n't even let the sheep and cattle graze at the foot of the mountain. ”
CEV	Exodus	34	4	So Moses cut two flat stones like the first ones , and early the next morning he carried them to the top of Mount Sinai , just as the Lord had commanded .
CEV	Exodus	34	5	The Lord God came down in a cloud and stood beside Moses there on the mountain . God spoke his holy name , “ the Lord. ” [ a ]
CEV	Exodus	34	6	( A ) Then he passed in front of Moses and called out , “ I am the Lord God . I am merciful and very patient with my people . I show great love , and I can be trusted .
CEV	Exodus	34	7	I keep my promises to my people forever , but I also punish anyone who sins . When people sin , I punish them and their children , and also their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. ”
CEV	Exodus	34	8	Moses quickly bowed down to the ground and worshiped the Lord .
CEV	Exodus	34	9	He prayed , “ Lord , if you really are pleased with me , I pray that you will go with us . It is true that these people are sinful and rebellious , but forgive our sin and let us be your people. ” A Promise and Its Demands ( Exodus 23.14-19 ; Deuteronomy 7.1-5 ; 16.1-17 )
CEV	Exodus	34	10	The Lord said : I promise to perform miracles for you that have never been seen anywhere on earth . Neighboring nations will stand in fear and know that I was the one who did these marvelous things .
CEV	Exodus	34	11	I will force out the Amorites , the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , but you must do what I command you today .
CEV	Exodus	34	12	Do n't make treaties with any of those people . If you do , it will be like falling into a trap .
CEV	Exodus	34	13	( B ) Instead , you must destroy their altars and tear down the sacred poles [ b ] they use in the worship of the goddess Asherah .
CEV	Exodus	34	14	I demand your complete loyalty—you must not worship any other god !
CEV	Exodus	34	15	Do n't make treaties with the people there , or you will soon find yourselves worshiping their gods and taking part in their sacrificial meals .
CEV	Exodus	34	16	Your men will even marry their women and be influenced to worship their gods .
CEV	Exodus	34	17	( C ) Do n't make metal images of gods .
CEV	Exodus	34	18	( D ) Do n't fail to observe the Festival of Thin Bread in the month of Abib . [ c ] Obey me and eat bread without yeast for seven days during Abib , because that is the month you left Egypt .
CEV	Exodus	34	19	( E ) The first-born males of your families and of your flocks and herds belong to me .
CEV	Exodus	34	20	( F ) You can save the life of a first-born donkey [ d ] by sacrificing a lamb ; if you do n't , you must break the donkey 's neck . You must save every first-born son . Bring an offering every time you come to worship .
CEV	Exodus	34	21	( G ) Work for six days and rest on the seventh day , even during the seasons for plowing and harvesting .
CEV	Exodus	34	22	( H ) Celebrate the Harvest Festival [ e ] each spring when you start harvesting your wheat , and celebrate the Festival of Shelters [ f ] each autumn when you pick your fruit .
CEV	Exodus	34	23	Your men must come to worship me three times a year , because I am the Lord God of Israel .
CEV	Exodus	34	24	As you advance , I will force the nations out of your land and enlarge your borders . Then no one will try to take your property when you come to worship me these three times each year .
CEV	Exodus	34	25	( I ) When you sacrifice an animal on the altar , do n't offer bread made with yeast . And do n't save any part of the Passover meal for the next day .
CEV	Exodus	34	26	( J ) I am the Lord your God , and you must bring the first part of your harvest to the place of worship . Do n't boil a young goat in its mother 's milk .
CEV	Exodus	34	27	The Lord told Moses to put these laws in writing , as part of his agreement with Israel .
CEV	Exodus	34	28	Moses stayed on the mountain with the Lord for
CEV	Exodus	34	40	days and nights , without eating or drinking . And he wrote down the Ten Commandments , the most important part of God 's agreement with his people . Moses Comes Down from Mount Sinai
CEV	Exodus	34	29	( K ) Moses came down from Mount Sinai , carrying the Ten Commandments . His face was shining brightly because the Lord had been speaking to him . But Moses did not know at first that his face was shining .
CEV	Exodus	34	30	When Aaron and the others looked at Moses , they saw this , and they were afraid to go near him .
CEV	Exodus	34	31	Moses called out for Aaron and the leaders to come to him , and he spoke with them .
CEV	Exodus	34	32	Then the rest of the people of Israel gathered around Moses , and he gave them the laws that the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai .
CEV	Exodus	34	33	The face of Moses kept shining , and after he had spoken with the people , he covered his face with a veil .
CEV	Exodus	34	35	They could see that his face was still shining . So after he had spoken with them , he would put the veil back on and leave it on until the next time he went to speak with the Lord . Footnotes Copyright ©

CEV	Leviticus	4	18	Then , in my presence , he must smear some of the blood on each of the four corners of the incense altar , before pouring out the rest at the foot of the bronze altar [ d ] near the entrance to the tent . 19-21 After this , the priest will remove the fat from the bull and send it up in smoke on the altar . Finally , he will burn its remains outside the camp , just as he did with the other bull . By this sacrifice the sin of the whole nation will be forgiven . When a Tribal Leader Sins The Lord God said :
CEV	Leviticus	4	22	Any tribal leader who disobeys me without knowing it is still guilty .
CEV	Leviticus	4	23	As soon as the leader realizes what has happened , he must sacrifice a goat [ e ] that has nothing wrong with it .
CEV	Leviticus	4	24	This is a sacrifice for sin . So he will lay his hand on the animal 's head , before having it killed in my presence at the north side of the bronze altar .
CEV	Leviticus	4	25	The priest will dip a finger in the blood , smear some of it on each of the four corners of the altar , and pour out the rest at the foot of the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	4	26	Then he must send all of the fat up in smoke , just as he does when a sacrifice is offered to ask my blessing . [ f ] By this sacrifice the leader 's sin will be forgiven . When Ordinary People Sin The Lord said :
CEV	Leviticus	4	27	( A ) When any of you ordinary people disobey me without meaning to , you are still guilty .
CEV	Leviticus	4	28	As soon as you realize what you have done , you must sacrifice a female goat that has nothing wrong with it .
CEV	Leviticus	4	29	Lead the goat to the north side of the bronze altar and lay your hand on its head , before having it killed .
CEV	Leviticus	4	30	Then a priest will dip a finger in the blood ; he will smear some of it on each of the four corners of the altar and pour out the rest at the foot of the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	4	31	After this , the priest will remove all of the fat , just as he does when an animal is sacrificed to ask my blessing . [ g ] The priest will then send the fat up in smoke with a smell that pleases me . This animal is sacrificed so that I will forgive you ordinary people when you sin .
CEV	Leviticus	4	32	If you offer a lamb instead of a goat as a sacrifice for sin , it must be a female that has nothing wrong with it .
CEV	Leviticus	4	33	Lead the lamb to the altar and lay your hand on its head , before having it killed .
CEV	Leviticus	4	34	The priest will dip a finger in the blood , smear some of it on each of the four corners of the altar , and pour out the rest at the foot of the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	4	35	After this , all of the fat must be removed , just as when an animal is sacrificed to ask my blessing . Then the priest will send it up in smoke to me , together with a food offering , and your sin will be forgiven .

CEV	Leviticus	5	5	As soon as you discover that you have committed any of these sins , you must confess what you have done .
CEV	Leviticus	5	2	You are guilty and unfit to worship me , if you accidentally touch the dead body of any kind of unclean animal .
CEV	Leviticus	5	3	You are guilty if you find out that you have accidentally touched anything unclean that comes from a human body .
CEV	Leviticus	5	4	You are guilty the moment you realize that you have made a hasty promise to do something good or bad .
CEV	Leviticus	5	6	Then you must bring a female sheep or goat to me as the price for your sin . A priest will sacrifice the animal , and you will be forgiven .
CEV	Leviticus	5	7	If you are poor and can not afford to bring an animal , you may bring two doves or two pigeons . One of these will be a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness , and the other will be a sacrifice to please me .
CEV	Leviticus	5	8	Give both birds to the priest , who will offer one as a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness . He will wring its neck without tearing off its head ,
CEV	Leviticus	5	9	splatter some of its blood on one side of the bronze altar , and drain out the rest at the foot of the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	5	10	Then he will follow the proper rules for offering the other bird as a sacrifice to please me . You will be forgiven when the priest offers these sacrifices as the price for your sin .
CEV	Leviticus	5	11	If you are so poor that you can not afford doves or pigeons , you may bring one kilogram of your finest flour . This is a sacrifice to ask my forgiveness , so do n't sprinkle olive oil or sweet-smelling incense on it .
CEV	Leviticus	5	12	Give the flour to a priest , who will scoop up a handful and send it up in smoke together with the other offerings . This is a reminder that all of the flour belongs to me .
CEV	Leviticus	5	13	By offering this sacrifice , the priest pays the price for any of these sins you may have committed . The priest gets to keep the rest of the flour , just as he does with grain sacrifices . Sacrifices To Make Things Right ( Leviticus 7.1-10 ) 14-15 The Lord told Moses what the people must do to make things right when they find out they have cheated the Lord without meaning to : If this happens , you must either sacrifice a ram that has nothing wrong with it or else pay the price of a ram with the official money used by the priests .
CEV	Leviticus	5	16	In addition , you must pay what you owe plus a fine of
CEV	Leviticus	5	20	percent . Then the priest will offer the ram as a sacrifice to make things right , and you will be forgiven . 17-19 If you break any of my commands without meaning to , you are still guilty , and you can be punished . When you realize what you have done , you must either bring to the priest a ram that has nothing wrong with it or else pay him for one . The priest will then offer it as a sacrifice to make things right , and you will be forgiven . Copyright ©

CEV	Leviticus	6	6	1-3 ( A ) The Lord told Moses what the people must do when they commit other sins against the Lord : You have sinned if you rob or cheat someone , if you keep back money or valuables left in your care , or if you find something and claim not to have it .
CEV	Leviticus	6	4	When this happens , you must return what does n't belong to you
CEV	Leviticus	6	5	and pay the owner a fine of
CEV	Leviticus	6	20	and told him what sacrifices the priests must offer on the morning and evening of the day they are ordained : It is the same as the regular morning and evening sacrifices—half a kilogram of flour
CEV	Leviticus	6	10	The next morning you will dress in your priestly clothes , including your linen underwear . Then clean away the ashes left by the sacrifices and pile them beside the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	6	11	Change into your everyday clothes , take the ashes outside the camp , and pile them in the special place . [ b ]
CEV	Leviticus	6	12	The fire must never go out , so put wood on it each morning . After this , you are to lay an animal on the altar next to the fat that you sacrifice to ask my blessing . [ c ] Then send it all up in smoke to me .
CEV	Leviticus	6	13	The altar fire must always be kept burning—it must never go out . Sacrifices To Give Thanks to the Lord The Lord said :
CEV	Leviticus	6	14	When someone offers a sacrifice to give thanks to me , [ d ] the priests from Aaron 's family must bring it to the front of the bronze altar ,
CEV	Leviticus	6	15	where one of them will scoop up a handful of the flour and oil , together with all the incense on it . Then , to show that the whole offering belongs to me , he will lay all of this on the altar and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me . 16-17 The rest of it is to be baked without yeast and eaten by the priests in the sacred courtyard of the sacred tent . This bread is very holy , just like the sacrifices for sin or the sacrifices for making things right , and I have given this part to the priests from what is offered to me on the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	6	18	Only the men in Aaron 's family are allowed to eat this bread , and they must go through a ceremony to be made holy before touching it . [ e ] This law will never change . When Priests Are Ordained
CEV	Leviticus	6	19	The Lord spoke to Moses
CEV	Leviticus	6	21	mixed with olive oil and cooked in a shallow pan . The bread must then be crumbled into small pieces [ f ] and sent up in smoke with a smell that pleases me . 22-23 Each of Aaron 's descendants who is ordained as a priest must perform this ceremony and make sure that the bread is completely burned on the altar . None of it may be eaten ! Sacrifices for Sin ( Leviticus 4.1,2 )
CEV	Leviticus	6	24	The Lord told Moses
CEV	Leviticus	6	25	how the priests from Aaron 's family were to offer the sacrifice for sin : This sacrifice is very sacred , and the animal must be killed in my presence at the north side of the bronze altar .
CEV	Leviticus	6	26	The priest who offers this sacrifice must eat it in the sacred courtyard of the sacred tent ,
CEV	Leviticus	6	27	and anyone or anything that touches the meat will be holy . [ g ] If any of the animal 's blood is splattered on the clothes of the priest , they must be washed in a holy place .
CEV	Leviticus	6	28	If the meat was cooked in a clay pot , the pot must be destroyed , [ h ] but if it was cooked in a bronze pot , the pot must be scrubbed and rinsed with water .
CEV	Leviticus	6	29	This sacrifice is very holy , and only the priests may have any part of it .
CEV	Leviticus	6	30	None of the meat may be eaten from the sacrifices for sin that require blood to be brought into the sacred tent . [ i ] These sacrifices must be completely burned .

CEV	Leviticus	7	7	The ceremony for this sacrifice and the one for sin are the same , and the meat may be eaten only by the priest who performs this ceremony of forgiveness .
CEV	Leviticus	7	2	The animal must be killed in the same place where the sacrifice to please me [ a ] is killed , and the animal 's blood must be splattered against the four sides of the bronze altar .
CEV	Leviticus	7	3	Offer all of the animal 's fat , including the fat on its tail and on its insides ,
CEV	Leviticus	7	4	as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat .
CEV	Leviticus	7	5	One of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke to me .
CEV	Leviticus	7	6	This sacrifice for making things right is very holy . Only the priests may eat it , and they must eat it in a holy place . [ b ]
CEV	Leviticus	7	8	In fact , the priest who offers a sacrifice to please me [ c ] may keep the skin of the animal ,
CEV	Leviticus	7	9	just as he may eat the bread from a sacrifice to give thanks to me . [ d ]
CEV	Leviticus	7	10	All other grain sacrifices—with or without olive oil in them—are to be divided equally among the priests of Aaron 's family . Sacrifices To Ask the Lord 's Blessing The Lord said :
CEV	Leviticus	7	11	Here are the instructions for offering a sacrifice to ask my blessing : [ e ]
CEV	Leviticus	7	12	If you offer it to give thanks , you must offer some bread together with it . Use the finest flour to make three kinds of bread without yeast—two in the form of loaves mixed with olive oil and one in the form of thin wafers brushed with oil .
CEV	Leviticus	7	13	You must also make some bread with yeast .
CEV	Leviticus	7	14	Give me one loaf or wafer from each of these four kinds of bread , after which they will belong to the priest who splattered the blood against the bronze altar .
CEV	Leviticus	7	15	When you offer an animal to ask a blessing from me or to thank me , the meat belongs to you , but it must be eaten the same day .
CEV	Leviticus	7	16	It is different with the sacrifices you offer when you make me a promise or voluntarily give me something . The meat from those sacrifices may be kept and eaten the next day , 17-18 but any that is left over must be destroyed . If you eat any of it after the second day , your sacrifice will be useless and unacceptable , and you will be both disgusting and guilty .
CEV	Leviticus	7	19	Do n't eat any of the meat that has touched something unclean . Instead , burn it . The rest of the meat may be eaten by anyone who is clean and acceptable to me . 20-21 But do n't eat any of this meat if you have become unclean by touching something unclean from a human or an animal or from any other creature . If you do , you will no longer belong to the community of Israel .
CEV	Leviticus	7	22	The Lord told Moses
CEV	Leviticus	7	23	to say to the people : Do n't eat the fat of cattle , sheep , or goats .
CEV	Leviticus	7	24	If one of your animals dies or is killed by some wild animal , you may do anything with its fat except eat it .
CEV	Leviticus	7	25	If you eat the fat of an animal that can be used as a sacrifice to me , you will no longer belong to the community of Israel .
CEV	Leviticus	7	26	( A ) And no matter where you live , you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal ,
CEV	Leviticus	7	27	or you will no longer belong to the community of Israel .
CEV	Leviticus	7	28	The Lord also told Moses 29-30 to say to the people of Israel : If you want to offer a sacrifice to ask my blessing , you must bring the part to be burned and lay it on the bronze altar . But you must first lift up [ f ] the choice ribs with their fat to show that the offering is dedicated to me .
CEV	Leviticus	7	31	A priest from Aaron 's family will then send the fat up in smoke , but the ribs belong to the priests . 32-33 The upper joint of the right hind leg is for the priest who offers the blood and the fat of the animal .
CEV	Leviticus	7	34	I have decided that the people of Israel must always give the choice ribs and the upper joint of the right hind leg to Aaron 's descendants
CEV	Leviticus	7	35	who have been ordained as priests to serve me .
CEV	Leviticus	7	36	This law will never change . I am the Lord !
CEV	Leviticus	7	37	These are the ceremonies for sacrifices to please the Lord , to give him thanks , and to ask for his blessing or his forgiveness , as well as the ceremonies for those sacrifices that demand a payment and for the sacrifices that are offered when priests are ordained .
CEV	Leviticus	7	38	While Moses and the people of Israel were in the desert at Mount Sinai , the Lord commanded them to start offering these sacrifices . Footnotes - 7.2 sacrifice to please me : See the note at 1.1-3 . - 7.6 holy place : The courtyard of the sacred tent ( see 6.16,17 ) . - 7.8 sacrifice to please me : See the note at 1.1-3 . - 7.9 sacrifice to give thanks to me : See the note at 2.1 . - 7.11 sacrifice to ask my blessing : See the note at 3.1 . - 7.29,30 lift up : Or “ wave. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Leviticus	8	8	Next , he put on Aaron the sacred breastpiece that was used in finding out what the Lord wanted his people to do .
CEV	Leviticus	8	2	Send for Aaron and his sons , as well as their priestly clothes , the oil for ordination , the bull for the sin offering , the two rams , and a basket of bread made without yeast .
CEV	Leviticus	8	3	Then bring the whole community of Israel together at the entrance to the sacred tent .
CEV	Leviticus	8	4	Moses obeyed the Lord , and when everyone had come together ,
CEV	Leviticus	8	5	he said , “ We are here to follow the Lord 's instructions. ”
CEV	Leviticus	8	6	After Moses told Aaron and his sons to step forward , he told them to wash themselves .
CEV	Leviticus	8	7	He put the priestly shirt and robe on Aaron and wrapped the sash around his waist . Then he put the sacred vest on Aaron and fastened it with the finely woven belt .
CEV	Leviticus	8	9	He placed the turban on Aaron 's head , and on the front of the turban was the narrow strip of thin gold as a sign of his dedication to the Lord .
CEV	Leviticus	8	10	Moses then dedicated the sacred tent and everything in it to the Lord by sprinkling them with some of the oil for ordination .
CEV	Leviticus	8	11	He sprinkled the bronze altar seven times , and he sprinkled its equipment , as well as the large bronze bowl and its base .
CEV	Leviticus	8	12	He also poured some of the oil on Aaron 's head to dedicate him to the Lord .
CEV	Leviticus	8	13	Next , Moses dressed Aaron 's sons in their shirts , then tied sashes around them and put special caps on them , just as the Lord had commanded .
CEV	Leviticus	8	14	Moses led out the bull that was to be sacrificed for sin , and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head .
CEV	Leviticus	8	15	After it was killed , Moses dipped a finger in the blood and smeared some of it on each of the four corners of the bronze altar , before pouring out the rest at the foot of the altar . This purified the altar and made it a fit place for offering the sacrifice for sin .
CEV	Leviticus	8	16	Moses then took the fat on the bull 's insides , as well as the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat , and sent them up in smoke on the altar fire .
CEV	Leviticus	8	17	Finally , he took the skin and the flesh of the bull , together with the food still in its stomach , and burned them outside the camp , just as the Lord had commanded .
CEV	Leviticus	8	18	Moses led out the ram for the sacrifice to please the Lord . [ a ] After Aaron and his sons had laid their hands on its head ,
CEV	Leviticus	8	19	Moses killed the ram and splattered its blood against the four sides of the altar . 20-21 Moses had the animal cut up , and he washed its insides and hind legs . Then he laid the head , the fat , and the rest of the ram on the altar and sent them up in smoke with a smell that pleased the Lord . All this was done just as the Lord had commanded .
CEV	Leviticus	8	22	Moses led out the ram for the ceremony of ordination . Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head ,
CEV	Leviticus	8	23	and it was killed . Moses smeared some of its blood on Aaron 's right earlobe , some on his right thumb , and some on the big toe of his right foot .
CEV	Leviticus	8	24	Moses did the same thing for Aaron 's sons , before splattering the rest of the blood against the four sides of the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	8	25	He took the animal 's fat tail , the fat on its insides , and the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat , and the right hind leg .
CEV	Leviticus	8	26	Then he took from a basket some of each of the three kinds of bread [ b ] that had been made without yeast and had been dedicated to the Lord .
CEV	Leviticus	8	27	Moses placed the bread on top of the meat and gave it all to Aaron and his sons , who lifted it up [ c ] to show that it was dedicated to the Lord .
CEV	Leviticus	8	28	After this , Moses placed it on the fires of the altar and sent it up in smoke with a smell that pleased the Lord . This was part of the ordination ceremony .
CEV	Leviticus	8	29	Moses lifted up [ d ] the choice ribs of the ram to show that they were dedicated to the Lord . This was the part that the Lord had said Moses could have .
CEV	Leviticus	8	30	Finally , Moses sprinkled the priestly clothes of Aaron and his sons with some of the oil for ordination and with some of the blood from the altar . So Aaron and his sons , together with their priestly clothes , were dedicated to the Lord .
CEV	Leviticus	8	31	Moses said to Aaron and his sons : The Lord told me that you must boil this meat at the entrance to the sacred tent and eat it there with the bread .
CEV	Leviticus	8	32	Burn what is left over
CEV	Leviticus	8	33	and stay near the entrance to the sacred tent until the ordination ceremony ends seven days from now .

CEV	Leviticus	9	9	His sons brought him the blood . He dipped a finger in it , smeared some on the four corners of the bronze altar , and poured out the rest at its foot .
CEV	Leviticus	9	2	Then he said to Aaron : Find a young bull and a ram that have nothing wrong with them . Offer the bull to the Lord as a sacrifice for sin and the ram as a sacrifice to please him . [ a ]
CEV	Leviticus	9	3	Tell the people of Israel that they must offer sacrifices as well . They must offer a goat [ b ] as a sacrifice for sin , and a bull and a ram as a sacrifice to please the Lord . The bull and the ram must be a year old and have nothing wrong with them .
CEV	Leviticus	9	4	Then the people must offer a bull and a ram as a sacrifice to ask the Lord 's blessing [ c ] and also a grain sacrifice [ d ] mixed with oil . Do this , because the Lord will appear to you today .
CEV	Leviticus	9	5	After the animals and the grain had been brought to the front of the sacred tent , and the people were standing there in the presence of the Lord ,
CEV	Leviticus	9	6	Moses said : The Lord has ordered you to do this , so that he may appear to you in all of his glory .
CEV	Leviticus	9	7	( A ) Aaron , step up to the altar and offer the sacrifice to please the Lord , then offer the sacrifices for the forgiveness of your sins and for the sins of the people , just as the Lord has commanded .
CEV	Leviticus	9	8	Aaron stepped up to the altar and killed the bull that was to be the sacrifice for his sins .
CEV	Leviticus	9	10	But he sent up in smoke the fat , the kidneys , and the lower part of the liver , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
CEV	Leviticus	9	11	Then Aaron burned the skin and the flesh outside the camp .
CEV	Leviticus	9	12	After Aaron had killed the ram that was sacrificed to please the Lord , Aaron 's sons brought him the blood , and he splattered it against all four sides of the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	9	13	They brought him each piece of the animal , including the head , and he burned them all on the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	9	14	He washed the insides and the hind legs and also sent them up in smoke .
CEV	Leviticus	9	15	Next , Aaron sacrificed the goat for the sins of the people , as he had done with the sacrifice for his own sins .
CEV	Leviticus	9	16	And so , he burned this sacrifice on the altar in the proper way .
CEV	Leviticus	9	17	He also presented the grain sacrifice and burned a handful of the flour on the altar as part of the morning sacrifice .
CEV	Leviticus	9	18	( B ) Finally , he killed the bull and the ram as a sacrifice to ask the Lord 's blessing on the people . Aaron 's sons brought him the blood , and he splattered it against the four sides of the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	9	19	His sons placed all the fat , as well as the kidneys and the lower part of the liver
CEV	Leviticus	9	20	on top of the choice ribs .
CEV	Leviticus	9	21	Then Aaron burned the fat on the altar and lifted up [ e ] the ribs and the right hind leg to show that these were dedicated to the Lord . This was done just as the Lord had instructed Moses .
CEV	Leviticus	9	22	( C ) Aaron held out his hand and gave the people his blessing , before coming down from the bronze altar where he had offered the sacrifices .
CEV	Leviticus	9	23	He and Moses went into the sacred tent , and when they came out , they gave the people their blessing . Then the Lord appeared to the people in all of his glory .
CEV	Leviticus	9	24	The Lord sent fiery flames that burned up everything on the altar , and when everyone saw this , they shouted and fell to their knees to worship the Lord . Copyright ©

CEV	Leviticus	10	10	You must learn the difference between what is holy and what is n't holy and between the clean and the unclean .
CEV	Leviticus	10	2	Suddenly the Lord sent fiery flames and burned them to death .
CEV	Leviticus	10	3	Then Moses told Aaron that this was exactly what the Lord had meant when he said : “ I demand respect from my priests , and I will be praised by everyone ! ” Aaron was speechless .
CEV	Leviticus	10	4	Moses sent for Mishael and Elzaphan , the two sons of Aaron 's uncle Uzziel . Then he told them , “ Take these two dead relatives of yours outside the camp far from the entrance to the sacred tent. ”
CEV	Leviticus	10	5	So they dragged the dead men away by their clothes .
CEV	Leviticus	10	6	Then Moses told Aaron and his other two sons , Eleazar and Ithamar : Do n't show your sorrow by messing up your hair and tearing your priestly clothes , or the Lord will get angry . He will kill the three of you and punish everyone else . It 's all right for your relatives , the people of Israel , to mourn for those he destroyed by fire .
CEV	Leviticus	10	7	But you are the Lord 's chosen priests , and you must not leave the sacred tent , or you will die . Aaron and his two sons obeyed Moses .
CEV	Leviticus	10	8	The Lord said to Aaron :
CEV	Leviticus	10	9	When you or your sons enter the sacred tent , you must never drink beer or wine . If you do , you will die right there ! This law will never change .
CEV	Leviticus	10	11	You must also teach the people of Israel everything that I commanded Moses to say to them .
CEV	Leviticus	10	12	( A ) Moses told Aaron and his two sons , Eleazar and Ithamar : The grain sacrifice that was offered to give thanks to the Lord [ b ] is very holy . So make bread without yeast from the part that was n't sent up in smoke and eat it beside the altar .
CEV	Leviticus	10	13	The Lord has said that this belongs to you and your sons , and that it must be eaten in a holy place . 14-15 ( B ) But the choice ribs and the hind leg that were lifted up [ c ] may be eaten by your entire family , as long as you do so in an acceptable place . [ d ] These parts are yours from the sacrifices that the people offer to ask the Lord 's blessing . [ e ] This is what the Lord has commanded , and it will never change .
CEV	Leviticus	10	16	When Moses asked around and learned that the ram for the sin sacrifice had already been burned on the altar , he became angry with Eleazar and Ithamar and said ,
CEV	Leviticus	10	17	( C ) “ Why did n't you eat the meat from this sacrifice in an acceptable place ? It is very holy , and the Lord has given you this sacrifice to remove Israel 's sin and guilt .
CEV	Leviticus	10	18	Whenever an animal 's blood is n't brought into the sacred tent , I commanded you to eat its meat in an acceptable place , but you burned it instead. ”
CEV	Leviticus	10	19	Their father Aaron replied , “ Today two of my sons offered the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice to please the Lord , and look what has happened to me ! Would the Lord have approved if I had eaten the sacrifice for sin ? ”

And you must not eat pigs—they have divided hoofs , but do n't chew the cud . All of these animals are unclean , [ b ] and you are forbidden even to touch their dead bodies . 9-12 You may eat anything that lives in water and has fins and scales . But it would be disgusting for you to eat anything else that lives in water , and you must not even touch their dead bodies . 13-19 Eagles , vultures , buzzards , crows , ostriches , hawks , sea gulls , owls , pelicans , storks , herons , hoopoes , [ c ] and bats are also disgusting , and you are forbidden to eat any of them . 20-23 The only winged insects you may eat are locusts , grasshoppers , and crickets . All other winged insects that crawl are too disgusting for you to eat . 24-28 Do n't even touch the dead bodies of animals that have divided hoofs but do n't chew the cud . And do n't touch the dead bodies of animals that have paws . If you do , you must wash your clothes , but you are still unclean until evening . 29-30 Moles , rats , mice , and all kinds of lizards are unclean .
CEV	Leviticus	11	31	Anyone who touches their dead bodies or anything touched by their dead bodies becomes unclean until evening .
CEV	Leviticus	11	32	If something made of wood , cloth , or leather touches one of their dead bodies , it must be washed , but it is still unclean until evening .
CEV	Leviticus	11	33	If any of these animals is found dead in a clay pot , the pot must be broken to pieces , and everything in it becomes unclean .
CEV	Leviticus	11	34	If you pour water from this pot on any food , that food becomes unclean , and anything drinkable in the pot becomes unclean .
CEV	Leviticus	11	35	If the dead body of one of these animals touches anything else , including ovens and stoves , that thing becomes unclean and must be destroyed .
CEV	Leviticus	11	36	A spring or a cistern where one of these dead animals is found is still clean , but anyone who touches the animal becomes unclean .
CEV	Leviticus	11	37	If the dead body of one of these animals is found lying on seeds that have been set aside for planting , the seeds remain clean .
CEV	Leviticus	11	38	But seeds that are soaking in water become unclean , if the dead animal is found in the water .

CEV	Leviticus	11	40	If you eat any of its meat or carry its body away , you must wash your clothes , but you are still unclean until evening . 41-42 Do n't eat any of those disgusting little creatures that crawl or walk close to the ground .
CEV	Leviticus	11	43	If you eat any of them , you will become just as disgusting and unclean as they are .
CEV	Leviticus	11	44	( C ) I am the Lord your God , and you must dedicate yourselves to me and be holy , just as I am holy . Do n't become disgusting by eating any of these unclean creatures .
CEV	Leviticus	11	45	I brought you out of Egypt so that I could be your God . Now you must become holy , because I am holy ! 46-47 I have given these laws so that you will know what animals , birds , and fish are clean and may be eaten , and which ones are unclean and may not be eaten . Footnotes - 11.3 chews the cud : Some animals that eat grass and leaves have more than one stomach and chew their food a second time after it has been partly digested in the first stomach . This partly digested food is called the “ cud. ” - 11.4-8 unclean : In the Old Testament “ clean ” and “ unclean ” refer to whatever makes a person , animal , or object acceptable or unacceptable to God . For example , a person became unclean by eating certain foods , touching certain objects , and having certain kinds of diseases or bodily discharges . - 11.13-19 Eagles … hoopoes : Some of the birds in this list are difficult to identify .

CEV	Leviticus	12	12	The Lord told Moses
CEV	Leviticus	12	2	to say to the community of Israel : If a woman gives birth to a son , she is unclean for seven days , just as she is during her monthly period .
CEV	Leviticus	12	3	( A ) Her son must be circumcised on the eighth day ,
CEV	Leviticus	12	4	but her loss of blood keeps her from being completely clean for another
CEV	Leviticus	12	33	days . During this time she must not touch anything holy or go to the place of worship .
CEV	Leviticus	12	5	Any woman who gives birth to a daughter is unclean for two weeks , just as she is during her period . And she wo n't be completely clean for another
CEV	Leviticus	12	66	days .
CEV	Leviticus	12	6	When the mother has completed her time of cleansing , she must come to the front of the sacred tent and bring to the priest a year-old lamb as a sacrifice to please me [ a ] and a dove or a pigeon as a sacrifice for sin .

CEV	Leviticus	13	13	The Lord told Moses and Aaron to say to the people :
CEV	Leviticus	13	2	If sores or boils or a skin rash should break out and start spreading on your body , you must be brought to Aaron or to one of the other priests .
CEV	Leviticus	13	3	If the priest discovers that the hair in the infected area has turned white and that the infection seems more than skin deep , he will say , “ This is leprosy [ a ] —you are unclean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	4	But if the infected area is white and only skin deep , and if the hair in it has n't turned white , the priest will order you to stay away from everyone else for seven days .
CEV	Leviticus	13	5	If the disease has n't spread by that time , he will order you to stay away from everyone else for another seven days .
CEV	Leviticus	13	6	Then if the disease has n't become any worse or spread , the priest will say , “ You are clean . It is only a sore . After you wash your clothes , you may go home. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	7	However , if the disease comes back , you must return to the priest .
CEV	Leviticus	13	8	If it is discovered that the disease has started spreading , he will say , “ This is leprosy—you are unclean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	9	Any of you with a skin disease must be brought to a priest .
CEV	Leviticus	13	10	If he discovers that the sore spot is white with pus and that the hair around it has also turned white ,
CEV	Leviticus	13	11	he will say , “ This is leprosy . You are unclean and must stay away from everyone else. ” 12-13 But if the disease has run its course and only the scars remain , he will say , “ You are clean. ” 14-15 If the sores come back and turn white again , he will say , “ This is leprosy—you are unclean. ” 16-17 However , if the sores heal and only white spots remain , the priest will say , “ You are now clean. ” 18-19 If you have a sore that either swells or turns reddish-white after it has healed , then you must show it to a priest .
CEV	Leviticus	13	20	If he discovers that the hair in the infected area has turned white and that the infection seems more than skin deep , he will say , “ This is leprosy—you are unclean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	21	But if the white area is only on the surface of the skin and has n't become any worse , and if the hair in it has n't turned white , he will tell you to stay away from everyone else for seven days .
CEV	Leviticus	13	22	If the sore begins spreading during this time , the priest will say , “ You are unclean because you have a disease. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	23	But if it does n't spread , and only a scar remains , he will say , “ You are now clean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	24	If you have a burn that gets infected and turns red or reddish-white ,
CEV	Leviticus	13	25	a priest must examine it . Then if he discovers that the hair in the infected area has turned white and that the infection seems more than skin deep , he will say , “ The burn has turned into leprosy , and you are unclean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	26	But if the priest finds that the hair in the infected area has n't turned white and that the sore is only skin deep and it is healing , he will tell you to stay away from everyone else for seven days .
CEV	Leviticus	13	27	On the seventh day the priest will examine you again , and if the infection is spreading , he will say , “ This is leprosy—you are unclean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	28	However , if the infection has n't spread and has begun to heal , and if only a scar remains , he will say , “ Only a scar remains from the burn , and you are clean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	29	If you have a sore on your head or chin ,
CEV	Leviticus	13	30	it must be examined by a priest . If the infection seems more than skin deep , and the hair in it has thinned out and lost its color , he will say , “ This is leprosy—you are unclean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	31	On the other hand , if he discovers that the itchy spot is only skin deep , but that the hair still is n't healthy , he will order you to stay away from everyone else for seven days .
CEV	Leviticus	13	32	By that time , if the itch has n't spread , if the hair seems healthy , and if the itch is only skin deep ,
CEV	Leviticus	13	33	you must shave off the hair around the infection , but not those on it . Then the priest will tell you to stay away from everyone else for another seven days .
CEV	Leviticus	13	34	By that time , if the itch has n't spread and seems no more than skin deep , he will say , “ You are clean ; now you must wash your clothes. ” 35-36 Later , if the itch starts spreading , even though the hair is still healthy , the priest will say , “ You are unclean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	37	But if he thinks you are completely well , he will say , “ You are clean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	38	If white spots break out on your skin ,
CEV	Leviticus	13	39	but the priest discovers that it is only a rash , he will say , “ You are clean. ” 40-41 If you become bald on any part of your head , you are still clean . 42-43 But if a priest discovers that a reddish-white sore has broken out on the bald spot and looks like leprosy , he will say ,
CEV	Leviticus	13	44	“ This is leprosy—you are unclean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	45	If you ever have leprosy , you must tear your clothes , leave your hair uncombed , cover the lower part of your face , and go around shouting , “ I 'm unclean ! I 'm unclean ! ”
CEV	Leviticus	13	46	As long as you have the disease , you are unclean and must live alone outside the camp . 47-50 If a greenish or reddish spot [ b ] appears anywhere on any of your clothing or on anything made of leather , you must let the priest examine the clothing or the leather . He will put it aside for seven days ,
CEV	Leviticus	13	51	and if the mildew has spread in that time , he will say , “ This is unclean
CEV	Leviticus	13	52	because the mildew has spread. ” Then he will burn the clothing or the piece of leather .
CEV	Leviticus	13	53	If the priest discovers that the mildew has n't spread ,
CEV	Leviticus	13	54	he will tell you to wash the clothing or leather and put it aside for another seven days ,
CEV	Leviticus	13	55	after which he will examine it again . If the spot has n't spread , but is still greenish or reddish , the clothing or leather is unclean and must be burned .
CEV	Leviticus	13	56	But if the spot has faded after being washed , he will tear away the spot .
CEV	Leviticus	13	57	Later , if the spot reappears elsewhere on the clothing or the leather , you must burn it .
CEV	Leviticus	13	58	Even if the spot completely disappears after being washed , it must be washed again before it is clean .
CEV	Leviticus	13	59	These are the rules for deciding if clothing is clean or unclean after a spot appears on it . Copyright ©

CEV	Leviticus	14	5	The priest will order someone to kill one of the birds over a clay pot of spring water .

CEV	Leviticus	14	9	Then you must once again shave your head , face , and eyebrows , as well as the hair on the rest of your body . Finally , wash your clothes and take a bath , and you will be completely clean .
CEV	Leviticus	14	10	On the eighth day you must bring to the priest two rams and a year-old female lamb that have nothing wrong with them ; also bring
CEV	Leviticus	14	300	milliliters of olive oil and one kilogram of flour mixed with oil as a grain sacrifice . The priest will then lift these up [ e ] to dedicate them to me .
CEV	Leviticus	14	3	kilograms of your finest flour mixed with oil .
CEV	Leviticus	14	11	Then the priest will present you and your offerings to me at the entrance to my sacred tent .
CEV	Leviticus	14	12	There he will offer one of the rams , together with the oil , as a sacrifice to make things right . [ b ] He will also lift them up [ c ] to show that they are dedicated to me .
CEV	Leviticus	14	13	. Copyright ©

CEV	Leviticus	14	16	dip a finger of his right hand into the oil , and sprinkle some of it seven times toward the sacred tent .
CEV	Leviticus	14	17	Next , the priest will smear some of the oil on your right ear lobe , some on your right thumb , and some on the big toe of your right foot , 18-20 and he will pour the rest of the oil from his palm on your head . Then he will offer the other two animals—one as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a sacrifice to please me , together with a grain sacrifice . After this you will be completely clean .
CEV	Leviticus	14	21	If you are poor and can not afford to offer this much , you may offer a ram as a sacrifice to make things right , together with
CEV	Leviticus	14	22	Depending on what you can afford , you must also offer either two doves or two pigeons , one as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a sacrifice to please me .
CEV	Leviticus	14	23	The priest will offer these to me in front of the sacred tent on the eighth day . 24-25 The priest will kill this ram for the sacrifice to make things right , and he will lift it up [ f ] with the olive oil in dedication to me . Then he will smear some of the blood on your right ear lobe , some on your right thumb , and some on the big toe of your right foot .
CEV	Leviticus	14	26	The priest will pour some of the olive oil into the palm of his left hand ,
CEV	Leviticus	14	27	then dip a finger of his right hand in the oil and sprinkle some of it seven times toward the sacred tent .
CEV	Leviticus	14	28	He will smear some of the oil on your right ear lobe , some on your right thumb , and some on the big toe of your right foot , just as he did with the blood of the sacrifice to make things right . 29-31 And he will pour the rest of the oil from his palm on your head . Then , depending on what you can afford , he will offer either the doves or the pigeons together with the grain sacrifice . One of the birds is the sacrifice for sin , and the other is the sacrifice to please me . After this you will be completely clean .
CEV	Leviticus	14	32	These are the things you must do if you have leprosy and can not afford the usual sacrifices to make you clean . When There Is Mildew in a House
CEV	Leviticus	14	33	The Lord told Moses and Aaron to say to the people :
CEV	Leviticus	14	34	After I have given you the land of Canaan as your permanent possession , here is what you must do , if I ever put mildew [ g ] on the walls of any of your homes .
CEV	Leviticus	14	35	First , you must say to a priest , “ I think there is mildew on the wall of my house. ”
CEV	Leviticus	14	36	The priest will reply , “ Empty the house before I inspect it , or else everything in it will be unclean. ”
CEV	Leviticus	14	37	If the priest discovers greenish or reddish spots that go deeper than the surface of the walls ,
CEV	Leviticus	14	38	he will have the house closed for seven days .
CEV	Leviticus	14	39	Then he will return and check to see if the mildew has spread . 40-41 If so , he will order someone to scrape the plaster from the walls , remove the stones covered with mildew , then haul everything off and dump it in an unclean place outside the town .
CEV	Leviticus	14	42	Afterwards the wall must be repaired with new stones and fresh plaster .
CEV	Leviticus	14	43	If the mildew appears a second time ,
CEV	Leviticus	14	44	the priest will come and say , “ This house is unclean . It 's covered with mildew that ca n't be removed. ”
CEV	Leviticus	14	45	Then he will have the house torn down and every bit of wood , stone , and plaster hauled off to an unclean place outside the town .
CEV	Leviticus	14	46	Meanwhile , if any of you entered the house while it was closed , you will be unclean until evening .
CEV	Leviticus	14	47	And if you either slept or ate in the house , you must wash your clothes .
CEV	Leviticus	14	48	On the other hand , if the priest discovers that mildew has n't reappeared after the house was newly plastered , he will say , “ This house is clean—the mildew has gone. ”
CEV	Leviticus	14	49	Then , to show that the house is now clean , he will get two birds , a stick of cedar wood , a piece of red yarn , and a branch from a hyssop plant and bring them to the house .
CEV	Leviticus	14	50	He will kill one of the birds over a clay pot of spring water 51-52 and let its blood drain into the pot . Then he will dip the cedar , the hyssop , the yarn , and the other bird into the mixture of blood and water . Next , he will sprinkle the house seven times with the mixture , then the house will be completely clean .
CEV	Leviticus	14	53	Finally , he will release the bird and let it fly away , ending the ceremony for purifying the house . 54-57 These are the things you must do if you discover that you are unclean because of an itch or a sore , or that your clothing or house is unclean because of mildew .

CEV	Leviticus	16	16	By doing this , you will take away the sins that make both the most holy place and the people of Israel unclean . Do the same for the sacred tent , which is here among the people .
CEV	Leviticus	16	3	( B ) Before entering this most holy place , you must offer a bull as a sacrifice for your sins [ c ] and a ram as a sacrifice to please me . [ d ]
CEV	Leviticus	16	4	You will take a bath and put on the sacred linen clothes , including the underwear , the robe , the sash , and the turban .
CEV	Leviticus	16	5	Then the community of Israel will bring you a ram and two goats , both of them males . The goats are to be used as sacrifices for sin , and the ram is to be used as a sacrifice to please me .
CEV	Leviticus	16	6	Aaron , you must offer the bull as a sacrifice of forgiveness for your own sins and for the sins of your family .
CEV	Leviticus	16	7	Then you will lead the two goats into my presence at the front of the sacred tent ,
CEV	Leviticus	16	8	where I will show you [ e ] which goat will be sacrificed to me and which one will be sent into the desert to the demon Azazel . [ f ]
CEV	Leviticus	16	9	After you offer the first goat as a sacrifice for sin ,
CEV	Leviticus	16	10	the other one must be presented to me alive , before you send it into the desert to take away the sins of the people .
CEV	Leviticus	16	11	You must offer the bull as a sacrifice to ask forgiveness for your own sins and for the sins of your family .
CEV	Leviticus	16	12	Then you will take a fire pan of live coals from the bronze altar , together with two handfuls of finely ground incense , into the most holy place .
CEV	Leviticus	16	13	There you will present them to me by placing the incense on the coals , so that the place of mercy will be covered with a cloud of smoke . Do this , or you will die right there !
CEV	Leviticus	16	14	Next , use a finger to sprinkle some of the blood on the place of mercy , which is on the lid of the sacred chest ; then sprinkle blood seven times in front of the chest .
CEV	Leviticus	16	15	( C ) Aaron , you must next sacrifice the goat for the sins of the people , and you must sprinkle its blood inside the most holy place , just as you did with the blood of the bull .
CEV	Leviticus	16	17	Only you are allowed in the sacred tent from the time you enter until the time you come out .
CEV	Leviticus	16	18	After leaving the tent , you will purify the bronze altar by smearing each of its four corners with some of the blood from the bull and from the goat .
CEV	Leviticus	16	19	Use a finger to sprinkle the altar seven times with the blood , and it will be completely clean from the sins of the people .
CEV	Leviticus	16	20	After you have purified the most holy place , the sacred tent , and the bronze altar , you must bring the live goat to the front of the tent .
CEV	Leviticus	16	21	( D ) There you will lay your hands on its head , while confessing every sin the people have committed , and you will appoint someone to lead the goat into the desert , so that it can take away their sins .
CEV	Leviticus	16	22	Finally , this goat that carries the heavy burden of Israel 's sins must be released deep in the desert . 23-24 ( E ) Aaron , after this you must go inside the sacred tent , take a bath , put on your regular priestly clothes , and leave there the clothes you put on before entering the most holy place .

CEV	Leviticus	16	29	( G ) On the tenth day of the seventh month [ g ] of each year , you must go without eating to show sorrow for your sins , and no one , including foreigners who live among you , is allowed to work .
CEV	Leviticus	16	30	This is the day on which the sacrifice for the forgiveness of your sins will be made in my presence ,
CEV	Leviticus	16	31	and from now on , it must be celebrated each year . Go without eating and make this a day of complete rest just like the Sabbath .
CEV	Leviticus	16	32	The high priest must offer the sacrifices for cleansing from sin , while wearing the sacred linen clothes .

CEV	Leviticus	17	17	The Lord told Moses
CEV	Leviticus	17	2	to tell Aaron , his sons , and everyone else in Israel : 3-4 Whenever you kill any of your cattle , sheep , or goats as sacrifices to me , you must do it at the entrance to the sacred tent . If you do n't , you will be guilty of pouring out blood , and you will no longer belong to the community of Israel .
CEV	Leviticus	17	5	And so , when you sacrifice an animal to ask my blessing , [ a ] it must not be done out in a field ,
CEV	Leviticus	17	6	but in front of the sacred tent . Then a priest can splatter its blood against the bronze altar and send its fat up in smoke with a smell that pleases me .
CEV	Leviticus	17	7	Do n't ever turn from me again and offer sacrifices to goat-demons . This law will never change .
CEV	Leviticus	17	8	Remember ! No one in Israel , including foreigners , is to offer a sacrifice anywhere
CEV	Leviticus	17	9	except at the entrance to the sacred tent . If you do , you will no longer belong to my people . Do Not Eat Blood The Lord said :
CEV	Leviticus	17	10	( A ) I will turn against any of my people who eat blood . This also includes any foreigners living among you .
CEV	Leviticus	17	11	( B ) Life is in the blood , and I have given you the blood of animals to sacrifice in place of your own .
CEV	Leviticus	17	12	That 's also why I have forbidden you to eat blood .
CEV	Leviticus	17	13	Even if you should hunt and kill a bird or an animal , you must drain out the blood and cover it with soil .
CEV	Leviticus	17	14	The life of every living creature is in its blood . That 's why I have forbidden you to eat blood and why I have warned you that anyone who does will no longer belong to my people .
CEV	Leviticus	17	15	If you happen to find a dead animal and eat it , you must take a bath and wash your clothes , but you are still unclean until evening .
CEV	Leviticus	17	16	If you do n't take a bath , you will suffer for what you did wrong . Footnotes - 17.5 sacrifice … to ask my blessing : See the note at 3.1 . Copyright ©

CEV	Leviticus	24	24	The Lord told Moses
CEV	Leviticus	24	2	to say to the community of Israel : You must supply the purest olive oil for the lamps in the sacred tent , so they will keep burning . 3-4 Aaron will set up the gold lampstand in the holy place of the sacred tent . Then he will light the seven lamps that must be kept burning there in my presence , every night from now on . This law will never change . The Sacred Bread The Lord said :
CEV	Leviticus	24	5	( A ) Use your finest flour to bake twelve loaves of bread about two kilograms each ,
CEV	Leviticus	24	6	then take them into the sacred tent and lay them on the gold table in two rows of six loaves .
CEV	Leviticus	24	7	Alongside each row put some pure incense that will be sent up by fire in place of the bread as an offering to me .
CEV	Leviticus	24	8	Aaron must lay fresh loaves on the table each Sabbath , and priests in all generations must continue this practice as part of Israel 's agreement with me .
CEV	Leviticus	24	9	( B ) This bread will always belong to Aaron and his family ; it is very holy because it was offered to me , and it must be eaten in a holy place . [ a ] Punishment for Cursing the Lord 10-11 Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri from the tribe of Dan , had married an Egyptian , and they had a son . One day their son got into a fight with an Israelite man in camp and cursed the name of the Lord . So the young man was dragged off to Moses ,
CEV	Leviticus	24	12	who had him guarded while everyone waited for the Lord to tell them what to do .
CEV	Leviticus	24	13	Finally , the Lord said to Moses :
CEV	Leviticus	24	14	This man has cursed me ! Take him outside the camp and tell the witnesses to lay their hands on his head . Then command the whole community of Israel to stone him to death . 15-16 And warn the others that everyone else who curses me will die in the same way , whether they are Israelites by birth or foreigners living among you .
CEV	Leviticus	24	17	( C ) Death is also the penalty for murder ,
CEV	Leviticus	24	18	but the killing of an animal that belongs to someone else requires only that the animal be replaced .
CEV	Leviticus	24	19	Personal injuries to others must be dealt with in keeping with the crime—
CEV	Leviticus	24	20	( D ) a broken bone for a broken bone , an eye for an eye , or a tooth for a tooth .
CEV	Leviticus	24	21	It 's possible to pay the owner for an animal that has been killed , but death is the penalty for murder .
CEV	Leviticus	24	22	( E ) I am the Lord your God , and I demand equal justice both for you Israelites and for those foreigners who live among you .
CEV	Leviticus	24	23	When Moses finished speaking , the people did what the Lord had told Moses , and they stoned to death the man who had cursed the Lord . Footnotes - 24.9 holy place : The courtyard of the sacred tent ( see 6.16,17 ) . Copyright ©

CEV	Leviticus	25	25	If any of you Israelites become so poor that you are forced to sell your property , your closest relative must buy it back ,
CEV	Leviticus	25	2	to say to the community of Israel : After you enter the land that I am giving you , it must be allowed to rest one year out of every seven .
CEV	Leviticus	25	3	You may raise grain and grapes for six years ,
CEV	Leviticus	25	4	but the seventh year you must let your fields and vineyards rest in honor of me , your Lord .
CEV	Leviticus	25	5	This is to be a time of complete rest for your fields and vineyards , so do n't harvest anything they produce . 6-7 However , you and your slaves and your hired workers , as well as any domestic or wild animals , may eat whatever grows on its own . The Year of Celebration The Lord said to his people :
CEV	Leviticus	25	8	Once every
CEV	Leviticus	25	49	or uncle or cousin , or some other family member . In fact , if you ever get enough money , you may buy your own freedom
CEV	Leviticus	25	9	on the tenth day of the seventh month , [ a ] which is also the Great Day of Forgiveness , [ b ] trumpets are to be blown everywhere in the land .
CEV	Leviticus	25	10	This fiftieth year [ c ] is sacred—it is a time of freedom and of celebration when everyone will receive back their original property , and slaves will return home to their families .
CEV	Leviticus	25	11	This is a year of complete celebration , so do n't plant any seed or harvest what your fields or vineyards produce .
CEV	Leviticus	25	12	In this time of sacred celebration you may eat only what grows on its own .
CEV	Leviticus	25	13	During this year , all property must go back to its original owner . 14-15 So when you buy or sell farmland , the price is to be determined by the number of crops it can produce before the next Year of Celebration . Do n't try to cheat .
CEV	Leviticus	25	16	If it is a long time before the next Year of Celebration , the price will be higher , because what is really being sold are the crops that the land can produce .
CEV	Leviticus	25	17	I am the Lord your God , so obey me and do n't cheat anyone . 18-19 If you obey my laws and teachings , you will live safely in the land and enjoy its abundant crops .
CEV	Leviticus	25	20	Do n't ever worry about what you will eat during the seventh year when you are forbidden to plant or harvest .
CEV	Leviticus	25	21	I will see to it that you harvest enough in the sixth year to last for three years .
CEV	Leviticus	25	22	In the eighth year you will live on what you harvested in the sixth year , but in the ninth year you will eat what you plant and harvest in the eighth year .
CEV	Leviticus	25	23	No land may be permanently bought or sold . It all belongs to me—it is n't your land , and you only live there for a little while .
CEV	Leviticus	25	24	When property is being sold , the original owner must be given the first chance to buy it .
CEV	Leviticus	25	26	if that relative has the money . Later , if you can afford to buy it ,
CEV	Leviticus	25	27	you must pay enough to make up for what the present owner will lose on it before the next Year of Celebration , when the property would become yours again .
CEV	Leviticus	25	28	But if you do n't have the money to pay the present owner a fair price , you will have to wait until the Year of Celebration , when the property will once again become yours .
CEV	Leviticus	25	29	If you sell a house in a walled city , you have only one year in which to buy it back .
CEV	Leviticus	25	30	If you do n't buy it back before that year is up , it becomes the permanent property of the one who bought it , and it will not be returned to you in the Year of Celebration .
CEV	Leviticus	25	31	But a house out in a village may be bought back at any time just like a field . And it must be returned to its original owner in the Year of Celebration .
CEV	Leviticus	25	32	If any Levites own houses inside a walled city , they will always have the right to buy them back .
CEV	Leviticus	25	33	And any houses that they do not buy back will be returned to them in the Year of Celebration , because these homes are their permanent property among the people of Israel .
CEV	Leviticus	25	34	No pastureland owned by the Levi tribe can ever be sold ; it is their permanent possession . Help for the Poor The Lord said :
CEV	Leviticus	25	35	( B ) If any of your people become poor and unable to support themselves , you must help them , just as you are supposed to help foreigners who live among you . 36-37 ( C ) Do n't take advantage of them by charging any kind of interest or selling them food for profit . Instead , honor me by letting them stay where they now live .
CEV	Leviticus	25	38	Remember—I am the Lord your God ! I rescued you from Egypt and gave you the land of Canaan , so that I would be your God .
CEV	Leviticus	25	39	( D ) Suppose some of your people become so poor that they have to sell themselves and become your slaves .
CEV	Leviticus	25	40	Then you must treat them as servants , rather than as slaves . And in the Year of Celebration they are to be set free ,
CEV	Leviticus	25	41	so they and their children may return home to their families and property .
CEV	Leviticus	25	42	I brought them out of Egypt to be my servants , not to be sold as slaves .
CEV	Leviticus	25	43	So obey me , and do n't be cruel to the poor .
CEV	Leviticus	25	44	If you want slaves , buy them from other nations
CEV	Leviticus	25	45	or from the foreigners who live in your own country , and make them your property .
CEV	Leviticus	25	46	You can own them , and even leave them to your children when you die , but do not make slaves of your own people or be cruel to them .
CEV	Leviticus	25	47	Even if some of you Israelites become so much in debt that you must sell yourselves to foreigners in your country ,
CEV	Leviticus	25	48	you still have the right to be set free by a relative , such as a brother
CEV	Leviticus	25	50	by paying your owner for the number of years you would still be a slave before the next Year of Celebration . 51-52 The longer the time until then , the more you will have to pay .
CEV	Leviticus	25	53	And even while you are the slaves of foreigners in your own country , your people must make sure that you are not mistreated .
CEV	Leviticus	25	54	If you can not gain your freedom in any of these ways , both you and your children will still be set free in the Year of Celebration .

CEV	Leviticus	26	26	You will have such a shortage of bread , that ten women will be able to bake their bread in the same oven . Each of you will get only a few crumbs , and you will go hungry .
CEV	Leviticus	26	2	Respect the Sabbath and honor the place where I am worshiped , because I am the Lord .
CEV	Leviticus	26	3	( B ) Faithfully obey my laws ,
CEV	Leviticus	26	4	and I will send rain to make your crops grow and your trees produce fruit .
CEV	Leviticus	26	5	of you and
CEV	Leviticus	26	6	I will bless your country with peace , and you will rest without fear . I will wipe out the dangerous animals and protect you from enemy attacks .
CEV	Leviticus	26	7	You will chase and destroy your enemies ,
CEV	Leviticus	26	8	even if there are only
CEV	Leviticus	26	100	of you and 10,000 of them .
CEV	Leviticus	26	9	I will treat you with such kindness that your nation will grow strong , and I will also keep my promises to you .
CEV	Leviticus	26	10	Your barns will overflow with grain each year .
CEV	Leviticus	26	11	I will live among you and never again look on you with disgust .
CEV	Leviticus	26	12	( C ) I will walk with you—I will be your God , and you will be my people .
CEV	Leviticus	26	13	I am the Lord your God , and I rescued you from Egypt , so that you would never again be slaves . I have set you free ; now walk with your heads held high . Punishment for Disobeying the Lord The Lord said : 14-15 ( D ) If you disobey me and my laws , and if you break our agreement ,
CEV	Leviticus	26	16	I will punish you terribly , and you will be ruined . You will be struck with incurable diseases and with fever that leads to blindness and depression . Your enemies will eat the crops you plant ,
CEV	Leviticus	26	17	and I will turn from you and let you be destroyed by your attackers . You will even run at the very rumor of attack .
CEV	Leviticus	26	18	Then , if you still refuse to obey me , I will punish you seven times for each of your sins ,
CEV	Leviticus	26	19	until your pride is completely crushed . I will hold back the rain , so the sky above you will be like iron , and the ground beneath your feet will be like copper .
CEV	Leviticus	26	20	All of your hard work will be for nothing—and there will be no harvest of grain or fruit .
CEV	Leviticus	26	21	If you keep rebelling against me , I 'll punish you seven times worse , just as your sins deserve !
CEV	Leviticus	26	22	I 'll send wild animals to attack you , and they will gobble up your children and livestock . So few of you will be left that your roads will be deserted .
CEV	Leviticus	26	23	If you remain my enemies after this ,
CEV	Leviticus	26	24	I 'll remain your enemy and punish you even worse .
CEV	Leviticus	26	25	War will break out because you broke our agreement , and if you escape to your walled cities , I 'll punish you with horrible diseases , and you will be captured by your enemies .
CEV	Leviticus	26	27	Then if you do n't stop rebelling ,
CEV	Leviticus	26	28	I 'll really get furious and punish you terribly for your sins !
CEV	Leviticus	26	29	In fact , you will be so desperate for food that you will eat your own children .
CEV	Leviticus	26	30	I 'll destroy your shrines and tear down your incense altars , leaving your dead bodies piled on top of your idols . And you will be disgusting to me .
CEV	Leviticus	26	31	I 'll wipe out your towns and your places of worship and will no longer be pleased with the smell of your sacrifices .
CEV	Leviticus	26	32	Your land will become so desolate that even your enemies who settle there will be shocked when they see it .
CEV	Leviticus	26	33	After I destroy your towns and ruin your land with war , I 'll scatter you among the nations . 34-35 While you are prisoners in foreign lands , your own land will enjoy years of rest and refreshment , as it should have done each seventh year when you lived there . 36-37 In the land of your enemies , you will tremble at the rustle of a leaf , as though it were a sword . And you will become so weak that you will stumble and fall over each other , even when no one is chasing you .
CEV	Leviticus	26	38	Many of you will die in foreign lands ,
CEV	Leviticus	26	39	and others of you will waste away in sorrow as the result of your sins and the sins of your ancestors . 40-41 Then suppose you realize that I turned against you and brought you to the land of your enemies because both you and your ancestors had stubbornly sinned against me . If you humbly confess what you have done and start living right ,
CEV	Leviticus	26	42	( E ) I 'll keep the promise I made to your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I will bless your land
CEV	Leviticus	26	43	and let it rest during the time that you are in a foreign country , paying for your rebellion against me and my laws .
CEV	Leviticus	26	44	( F ) No matter what you have done , I am still the Lord your God , and I will never completely reject you or become absolutely disgusted with you there in the land of your enemies .
CEV	Leviticus	26	45	While nations watched , I rescued your ancestors from Egypt so that I would be their God . Yes , I am your Lord , and I will never forget our agreement .

CEV	Leviticus	27	20	percent .
CEV	Leviticus	27	60	and above and
CEV	Leviticus	27	30	( B ) Ten percent of everything you harvest is holy and belongs to me , whether it grows in your fields or on your fruit trees .
CEV	Leviticus	27	5	years , and
CEV	Leviticus	27	10	If you try to substitute any other animal , no matter how good , for the one you promised , they will both become holy and must be sacrificed .
CEV	Leviticus	27	15	But if you decide to buy it back , you must pay an additional
CEV	Leviticus	27	1	month to
CEV	Leviticus	27	3	pieces for girls .
CEV	Leviticus	27	8	If you have promised to give someone to me and ca n't afford to pay the full amount for that person 's release , you will be taken to a priest , and he will decide how much you can afford .
CEV	Leviticus	27	9	If you promise to sacrifice an animal to me , it becomes holy , and there is no way you can set it free .
CEV	Leviticus	27	11	Donkeys are unfit for sacrifice , so if you promise me a donkey , [ a ] you must bring it to the priest ,
CEV	Leviticus	27	12	and let him determine its value .
CEV	Leviticus	27	13	But if you want to buy it back , you must pay an additional
CEV	Leviticus	27	14	If you promise a house to me , a priest will set the price , whatever the condition of the house .
CEV	Leviticus	27	16	If you promise part of your family 's land to me , its value must be determined by the amount of seed needed to plant the land , and the rate will be ten pieces of silver for every
CEV	Leviticus	27	17	If this promise is made in the Year of Celebration , [ b ] the land will be valued at the full price .
CEV	Leviticus	27	18	But any time after that , the price will be figured according to the number of years before the next Year of Celebration .
CEV	Leviticus	27	19	If you decide to buy back the land , you must pay the price plus an additional
CEV	Leviticus	27	21	When the Year of Celebration comes , the land becomes holy because it belongs to me , and it will be given to the priests .
CEV	Leviticus	27	22	If you promise me a field that you have bought ,
CEV	Leviticus	27	23	its value will be decided by a priest , according to the number of years before the next Year of Celebration , and the money you pay will be mine .
CEV	Leviticus	27	24	However , on the next Year of Celebration , the land will go back to the family of its original owner .
CEV	Leviticus	27	25	Every price will be set by the official standards . Various Offerings The Lord said :
CEV	Leviticus	27	26	All first-born animals of your flocks and herds are already mine , and so you can not promise any of them to me .
CEV	Leviticus	27	28	( A ) Anything that you completely dedicate to me must be completely destroyed . [ d ] It can not be bought back or sold . Every person , animal , and piece of property that you dedicate completely is only for me .
CEV	Leviticus	27	29	In fact , any humans who have been promised to me in this way must be put to death .
CEV	Leviticus	27	31	If you want to buy back this part of your harvest , you may do so by paying what it is worth plus an additional
CEV	Leviticus	27	32	When you count your flocks and herds , one out of ten of every newborn animal [ e ] is holy and belongs to me ,
CEV	Leviticus	27	33	no matter how good or bad it is . If you substitute one animal for another , both of them become holy , and neither can be bought back .

CEV	Numbers	1	1	( A ) The people of Israel had left Egypt and were living in the Sinai Desert . Then on the first day of the second month [ a ] of the second year , when Moses was in the sacred tent the Lord said : 2-3 I want you and Aaron to find out how many people are in each of Israel 's clans and families . And make a list of all the men

CEV	Numbers	1	47	But those from the Levi tribe were not included
CEV	Numbers	1	48	because the Lord had said to Moses :
CEV	Numbers	1	49	When you count the Israelites , do not include those from the Levi tribe . 50-51 Instead , give them the job of caring for the sacred tent , its furnishings , and the objects used for worship . They will camp around the tent , and whenever you move , they will take it down , carry it to the new camp , and set it up again . Anyone else who tries to go near it must be put to death .
CEV	Numbers	1	52	The rest of the Israelites will camp in their own groups and under their own banners .

CEV	Numbers	3	22	and they had 7,500 men and boys at least one month old . 23-24 The Gershonites , under the leadership of Eliasaph son of Lael , were to camp on the west side of the sacred tent .
CEV	Numbers	3	25	Their duties at the tent included taking care of the tent itself , along with its outer covering , the curtain for the entrance ,
CEV	Numbers	3	26	the curtains hanging inside the courtyard around the tent , as well as the curtain and ropes for the entrance to the courtyard and its altar . The Gershonites were responsible for setting these things up and taking them down .

CEV	Numbers	3	42	Moses obeyed the Lord and counted the first-born sons ;
CEV	Numbers	3	43	there were 22,273 of them .
CEV	Numbers	3	44	Then the Lord said ,
CEV	Numbers	3	45	“ The Levites will belong to me and will take the place of the first-born sons ; their livestock will take the place of the Israelites ' first-born livestock .
CEV	Numbers	3	46	But since there are more first-born sons than Levites , the extra
CEV	Numbers	3	273	first-born men and boys ,
CEV	Numbers	3	47	For each one , you are to collect five pieces of silver , weighed according to the official standards .
CEV	Numbers	3	48	This money must then be given to Aaron and his sons. ”

CEV	Numbers	5	5	( A ) The Lord told Moses
CEV	Numbers	5	4	The Israelites obeyed the Lord 's instructions . The Penalty for Committing a Crime ( Leviticus 6.1-7 )
CEV	Numbers	5	6	to say to the community of Israel : If any of you commit a crime against someone , you have sinned against me .
CEV	Numbers	5	7	You must confess your guilt and pay the victim in full for whatever damage has been done , plus a fine of
CEV	Numbers	5	20	percent .
CEV	Numbers	5	8	If the victim has no relative who can accept this money , it belongs to me and will be paid to the priest . In addition to that payment , you must take a ram for the priest to sacrifice so your sin will be forgiven . 9-10 When you make a donation to the sacred tent , that money belongs only to the priest , and each priest will keep what is given to him . A Suspicious Husband
CEV	Numbers	5	11	The Lord told Moses 12-14 to say to the people of Israel : Suppose a man becomes jealous and suspects that his wife has been unfaithful , but he has no proof .
CEV	Numbers	5	15	He must take his wife to the priest , together with one kilogram of ground barley as an offering to find out if she is guilty . No olive oil or incense is to be put on that offering .
CEV	Numbers	5	16	The priest will lead the woman to my altar and make her stand there .
CEV	Numbers	5	17	He will then pour sacred water into a clay jar and stir in some dust from the floor of the sacred tent . 18-22 Next , he will remove her veil , then hand her the barley offering , and say , “ If you have been faithful to your husband , this water wo n't harm you . But if you have been unfaithful , it will bring down the Lord 's curse—you will never be able to give birth to a child , and everyone will curse your name. ” Then the woman will answer , “ If I am guilty , let it happen just as you say. ”
CEV	Numbers	5	23	The priest will write these curses on special paper and wash them off into the bitter water ,
CEV	Numbers	5	24	so that when the woman drinks this water , the curses will enter her body .
CEV	Numbers	5	25	He will take the barley offering from her and lift it up [ b ] in dedication to me , the Lord . Then he will place it on my altar
CEV	Numbers	5	26	and burn part of it as a sacrifice . After that , the woman must drink the bitter water .
CEV	Numbers	5	27	If the woman has been unfaithful , the water will immediately make her unable to have children , and she will be a curse among her people .
CEV	Numbers	5	28	But if she is innocent , her body will not be harmed , and she will still be able to have children . 29-30 This is the ceremony that must take place at my altar when a husband suspects that his wife has been unfaithful . The priest must tell the woman to stand in my presence and carefully follow these instructions .
CEV	Numbers	5	31	If the husband is wrong , he will not be punished ; but if his wife is guilty , she will be punished . Copyright ©

CEV	Numbers	6	6	During the time that you are a Nazirite , you must never go close to a dead body , 7-8 not even that of your father , mother , brother , or sister . That would make you unclean . Your hair is the sign that you are dedicated to me , so remain holy .
CEV	Numbers	6	2	to say to the people of Israel : If any of you want to dedicate yourself to me by vowing to become a Nazirite ,
CEV	Numbers	6	3	( A ) you must no longer drink any wine or beer or use any kind of vinegar . Do n't drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins—
CEV	Numbers	6	4	not even the seeds or skins .
CEV	Numbers	6	5	The hair of a Nazirite is sacred to me , and as long as you are a Nazirite , you must never cut your hair .
CEV	Numbers	6	9	If someone suddenly dies near you , your hair is no longer sacred , and you must shave it seven days later during the ceremony to make you clean .
CEV	Numbers	6	10	Then on the next day , bring two doves or two pigeons to the priest at the sacred tent .
CEV	Numbers	6	11	He will offer one of the birds as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a sacrifice to please me . [ a ] You will then be forgiven for being too near a dead body , and your hair will again become sacred .
CEV	Numbers	6	12	But the dead body made you unacceptable , so you must make another vow to become a Nazirite and be dedicated once more . Finally , a year-old ram must be offered as the sacrifice to make things right .
CEV	Numbers	6	13	( B ) When you have completed your promised time of being a Nazirite , go to the sacred tent
CEV	Numbers	6	14	and offer three animals that have nothing wrong with them : a year-old ram as a sacrifice to please me , a year-old female lamb as a sacrifice for sin , and a full-grown ram as a sacrifice to ask my blessing . [ b ]
CEV	Numbers	6	15	Wine offerings and grain sacrifices must also be brought with these animals . Finally , you are to bring a basket of bread made with your finest flour and olive oil , but without yeast . Also bring some thin wafers brushed with oil .
CEV	Numbers	6	16	The priest will take these gifts to my altar and offer them , so that I will be pleased and will forgive you .
CEV	Numbers	6	17	Then he will sacrifice the ram and offer the wine , grain , and bread .
CEV	Numbers	6	18	After that , you will stand at the entrance to the sacred tent , shave your head , and put the hair in the fire where the priest has offered the sacrifice to ask my blessing .
CEV	Numbers	6	19	Once the meat from the ram 's shoulder has been boiled , the priest will take it , along with one loaf of bread and one wafer brushed with oil , and give them to you .
CEV	Numbers	6	20	You will hand them back to the priest , who will lift them up [ c ] in dedication to me . Then he can eat the meat from the ram 's shoulder , its choice ribs , and its hind leg , because this is his share of the sacrifice . After this , you will no longer be a Nazirite , and you will be free to drink wine .
CEV	Numbers	6	21	These are the requirements for Nazirites . However , if you can afford to offer more , you must do so . The Blessing for the People
CEV	Numbers	6	22	The Lord told Moses ,
CEV	Numbers	6	23	“ When Aaron and his sons bless the people of Israel , they must say :
CEV	Numbers	6	24	I pray that the Lord will bless and protect you ,
CEV	Numbers	6	25	and that he will show you mercy and kindness .
CEV	Numbers	6	26	May the Lord be good to you and give you peace. ”
CEV	Numbers	6	27	Then the Lord said , “ If Aaron and his sons ask me to bless the Israelites , I will give them my blessing. ” Footnotes - 6.11 sacrifice to please me : This sacrifice has traditionally been called a “ whole burnt offering , ” because the whole animal was burned on the altar . A main purpose of such a sacrifice was to please the Lord with the smell of the sacrifice , and so in the CEV it is often called “ a sacrifice to please the Lord. ” - 6.14 sacrifice to ask my blessing : This sacrifice has traditionally been called a “ peace offering ” or an “ offering of well-being. ” A main purpose of such a sacrifice was to ask the Lord 's blessing , and so in the CEV it is often called a “ sacrifice to ask the Lord 's blessing. ” - 6.20 lift them up : See the note at 5.25 .

CEV	Numbers	7	7	When Moses had finished setting up the sacred tent , he dedicated it to the Lord , together with its furnishings , the altar , and its equipment .
CEV	Numbers	7	2	Then the twelve tribal leaders of Israel , the same men who had been in charge of counting the people , [ a ] came to the tent
CEV	Numbers	7	3	with gifts for the Lord . They brought six strong carts and twelve oxen—one ox from each leader and a cart from every two .
CEV	Numbers	7	4	The Lord said to Moses ,
CEV	Numbers	7	5	“ Accept these gifts , so the Levites can use them here at the sacred tent for carrying the sacred things. ”
CEV	Numbers	7	6	Then Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites , 7-8 who were under the leadership of Ithamar son of Aaron . Moses gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites for their work , and four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites for their work .
CEV	Numbers	7	9	But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites , because they were in charge of the sacred objects that had to be carried on their shoulders .
CEV	Numbers	7	10	On the day the altar was dedicated , the twelve leaders brought offerings for its dedication .
CEV	Numbers	7	11	The Lord said to Moses , “ Each day one leader is to give his offering for the dedication. ” 12-83 So each leader brought the following gifts : a silver bowl that weighed one and a half kilograms and a silver sprinkling bowl weighing almost a kilogram , both of them filled with flour and olive oil as grain sacrifices and weighed according to the official standards ; a small gold dish filled with incense ; a young bull , a full-grown ram , and a year-old ram as sacrifices to please the Lord ; [ b ] a goat [ c ] as a sacrifice for sin ; and two bulls , five full-grown rams , five goats , and five rams a year old as sacrifices to ask the Lord 's blessing .

CEV	Numbers	7	28	kilograms , according to the official standards ;
CEV	Numbers	7	24	bulls ,
CEV	Numbers	7	60	rams a year old as sacrifices to ask the Lord 's blessing .

CEV	Numbers	8	2	“ Tell Aaron to put the seven lamps on the lampstand so they shine toward the front. ”

CEV	Numbers	8	4	The lampstand was made of hammered gold from its base to the decorative flowers on top , exactly like the pattern the Lord had described to Moses . Instructions for Ordaining the Levites
CEV	Numbers	8	5	The Lord said to Moses :
CEV	Numbers	8	6	The Levites must be acceptable to me before they begin working at the sacred tent . So separate them from the rest of the Israelites
CEV	Numbers	8	7	and sprinkle them with the water that washes away their sins . Then have them shave their entire bodies and wash their clothes .
CEV	Numbers	8	9	Then you , Moses , will call together all the people of Israel and send the Levites to my sacred tent ,
CEV	Numbers	8	10	where the people will place their hands on them .
CEV	Numbers	8	11	Aaron will present the Levites to me as a gift from the people , so that the Levites will do my work .
CEV	Numbers	8	12	After this , the Levites are to place their hands on the heads of the bulls . Sacrifice one of the bulls for the forgiveness of sin , and the other to make sure that I am pleased . Then the Levites will be acceptable to me .
CEV	Numbers	8	13	They will stand at my altar in front of Aaron and his sons , who will dedicate the Levites to me .
CEV	Numbers	8	14	This ceremony will show that the Levites are different from the other Israelites and belong to me in a special way .
CEV	Numbers	8	15	After they have been made acceptable and have been dedicated , they will be allowed to work at my sacred tent .
CEV	Numbers	8	16	They are mine and will take the place of the first-born Israelite sons .
CEV	Numbers	8	17	( B ) When I killed the oldest sons of the Egyptians , I decided that the first-born sons in each Israelite family would be mine , as well as every first-born male from their flocks and herds .
CEV	Numbers	8	18	But now I have chosen these Levites as substitutes for the first-born sons ,
CEV	Numbers	8	19	and I have given them as gifts to Aaron and his sons to serve at the sacred tent . I will hold them responsible for what happens to anyone who gets too close to the sacred tent . [ a ] The Levites Are Dedicated to the Lord
CEV	Numbers	8	20	Moses , Aaron , and the other Israelites made sure that the Levites did everything the Lord had commanded .
CEV	Numbers	8	21	The Levites sprinkled themselves with the water of forgiveness and washed their clothes . Then Aaron brought them to the altar and offered sacrifices to forgive their sins and make them acceptable to the Lord .
CEV	Numbers	8	22	After this , the Levites worked at the sacred tent as assistants to Aaron and his sons , just as the Lord had commanded .
CEV	Numbers	8	23	The Lord also told Moses , 24-25 “ Levites who are between the ages of
CEV	Numbers	8	25	and
CEV	Numbers	8	50	, they must retire .
CEV	Numbers	8	26	They may help the other Levites in their duties , but they must no longer be responsible for any work themselves . Remember this when you assign their duties. ” Footnotes - 8.19 I will hold … sacred tent : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text . Copyright ©

CEV	Numbers	9	6	Some people in Israel 's camp had touched a dead body and had become unfit to worship the Lord , and they could not celebrate Passover . But they asked Moses and Aaron ,
CEV	Numbers	9	7	“ Even though we have touched a dead body , why ca n't we celebrate Passover and offer sacrifices to the Lord at the same time as everyone else ? ”
CEV	Numbers	9	8	Moses said , “ Wait here while I go into the sacred tent and find out what the Lord says about this. ”

CEV	Numbers	9	12	( B ) and do n't leave any of it until morning or break any of the animal 's bones . Be sure to follow these regulations .
CEV	Numbers	9	13	But if any of you are fit to worship me , and yet refuse to celebrate Passover when you are not away on a journey , you will no longer belong to my people . You will be punished because you did not offer sacrifices to me at the proper time .
CEV	Numbers	9	14	Anyone , including foreigners who live among you , can celebrate Passover , if they follow all the regulations . The Cloud over the Sacred Tent ( Exodus 40.34-38 ) 15-16 As soon as the sacred tent was set up , [ d ] a thick cloud appeared and covered it . The cloud was there each day , and during the night , a fire could be seen in it . 17-19 The Lord used this cloud to tell the Israelites when to move their camp and where to set it up again . As long as the cloud covered the tent , the Israelites did not break camp . But when the cloud moved , they followed it , and wherever it stopped , they camped and stayed there , 20-22 whether it was only one night , a few days , a month , or even a year . As long as the cloud remained over the tent , the Israelites stayed where they were . But when the cloud moved , so did the Israelites .
CEV	Numbers	9	23	They obeyed the Lord 's commands and went wherever he directed Moses .

CEV	Numbers	11	5	In Egypt we could eat all the fish we wanted , and there were cucumbers , melons , all kinds of onions , and garlic .
CEV	Numbers	11	6	But we 're starving out here , and the only food we have is this manna. ”
CEV	Numbers	11	7	( A ) The manna was like small whitish seeds 8-9 ( B ) and tasted like something baked with sweet olive oil . It appeared at night with the dew . In the morning the people would collect the manna , grind or crush it into flour , then boil it and make it into thin wafers .

CEV	Numbers	11	12	but they 're not my children . You told me to nurse them along and to carry them to the land you promised their ancestors .

CEV	Numbers	11	14	This job is too much for me . How can I take care of all these people by myself ?

CEV	Numbers	11	70	leaders went back to camp . The Lord Sends Quails
CEV	Numbers	11	17	While I am talking with you there , I will give them some of your authority , so they can share responsibility for my people . You will no longer have to care for them by yourself .
CEV	Numbers	11	18	As for the Israelites , I have heard them complaining about not having meat and about being better off in Egypt . So tell them to make themselves acceptable to me , because tomorrow they will have meat . 19-20 In fact , they will have meat day after day for a whole month—not just a few days , or even
CEV	Numbers	11	20	. They turned against me and wanted to go back to Egypt . Now they will eat meat until they get sick of it .
CEV	Numbers	11	21	Moses replied , “ At least 600,000 grown men are here with me . How can you say there will be enough meat to feed them and their families for a whole month ?
CEV	Numbers	11	22	Even if we butchered all our sheep and cattle , or caught every fish in the sea , we would n't have enough to feed them. ”
CEV	Numbers	11	23	The Lord answered , “ I can do anything ! Watch and you 'll see my words come true. ”
CEV	Numbers	11	24	Moses told the people what the Lord had said . Then he chose
CEV	Numbers	11	25	and the Lord spoke with him . Then the Lord took some authority [ b ] from Moses and gave it to the
CEV	Numbers	11	26	Eldad and Medad were two leaders who had not gone to the tent . But when the Spirit took control of them , they began shouting like prophets right there in camp .
CEV	Numbers	11	27	A boy ran to Moses and told him about Eldad and Medad .
CEV	Numbers	11	28	Joshua [ c ] was there helping Moses , as he had done since he was young . And he said to Moses , “ Sir , you must stop them ! ”
CEV	Numbers	11	29	But Moses replied , “ Are you concerned what this might do to me ? I wish the Lord would give his Spirit to all his people so everyone could be a prophet. ”
CEV	Numbers	11	30	Then Moses and the
CEV	Numbers	11	31	Some time later the Lord sent a strong wind that blew quails in from the sea until Israel 's camp was completely surrounded with birds , piled up about a meter high for many kilometers in every direction .
CEV	Numbers	11	32	The people picked up quails for two days—each person filled at least ten large baskets . Then they spread them out to dry .
CEV	Numbers	11	33	But before the meat could be eaten , the Lord became angry and sent a deadly disease through the camp .

CEV	Numbers	13	2	“ Choose a leader from each tribe and send them into Canaan to explore the land I am giving you. ”
CEV	Numbers	13	3	So Moses sent twelve tribal leaders from Israel 's camp in the Paran Desert 4-16 with orders to explore the land of Canaan .

CEV	Numbers	13	17	Before Moses sent them into Canaan , he said : After you go through the Southern Desert of Canaan , continue north into the hill country
CEV	Numbers	13	18	and find out what those regions are like . Be sure to remember how many people live there , how strong they are , 19-20 and if they live in open towns or walled cities . See if the land is good for growing crops and find out what kinds of trees grow there . It 's time for grapes to ripen , so try to bring back some of the fruit that grows there .
CEV	Numbers	13	21	The twelve men left to explore Canaan from the Zin Desert in the south all the way to the town of Rehob near Lebo-Hamath in the north .
CEV	Numbers	13	22	As they went through the Southern Desert , they came to the town of Hebron , which was seven years older than the Egyptian town of Zoan . In Hebron , they saw the three Anakim [ b ] clans of Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai . 23-24 When they got to Bunch Valley , [ c ] they cut off a branch with such a huge bunch of grapes , that it took two men to carry it on a pole . That 's why the place was called Bunch Valley . Along with the grapes , they also took back pomegranates [ d ] and figs . The Men Report Back to the People

CEV	Numbers	13	27	and said : Look at this fruit ! The land we explored is rich with milk and honey .
CEV	Numbers	13	28	But the people who live there are strong , and their cities are large and walled . We even saw the three Anakim [ e ] clans .
CEV	Numbers	13	29	Besides that , the Amalekites live in the Southern Desert ; the Hittites , Jebusites , and Amorites are in the hill country ; and the Canaanites [ f ] live along the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River .
CEV	Numbers	13	30	Caleb calmed down the crowd and said , “ Let 's go and take the land . I know we can do it ! ”
CEV	Numbers	13	31	But the other men replied , “ Those people are much too strong for us. ”
CEV	Numbers	13	32	Then they started spreading rumors and saying , “ We wo n't be able to grow anything in that soil . And the people are like giants .

CEV	Numbers	14	12	So they will no longer be my people . I will destroy them , but I will make you the ancestor of a nation even stronger than theirs. ” 13-16 ( B ) Moses replied : With your mighty power you rescued your people from Egypt , so please do n't destroy us here in the desert . If you do , the Egyptians will hear about it and tell the people of Canaan . Those Canaanites already know that we are your people , and that we see you face to face . And they have heard how you lead us with a thick cloud during the day and flaming fire at night . But if you kill us , they will claim it was because you were n't powerful enough to lead us into Canaan as you promised .
CEV	Numbers	14	17	Show us your great power , Lord . You promised
CEV	Numbers	14	18	( C ) that you love to show mercy and kindness . And you said that you are very patient , but that you will punish everyone guilty of doing wrong—not only them but their children and grandchildren as well .

CEV	Numbers	14	20	years old
CEV	Numbers	14	21	( D ) But as surely as I live and my power has no limit , 22-23 I swear that not one of these Israelites will enter the land I promised to give their ancestors . These people have seen my power in Egypt and in the desert , but they will never see Canaan . They have disobeyed and tested me too many times .
CEV	Numbers	14	24	( E ) But my servant Caleb is n't like the others . So because he has faith in me , I will allow him to cross into Canaan , and his descendants will settle there .
CEV	Numbers	14	25	Now listen , Moses ! The Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys of Canaan . [ a ] And tomorrow , you 'll need to turn around and head back into the desert toward the Red Sea . [ b ] The Israelites Are Punished for Complaining
CEV	Numbers	14	26	The Lord told Moses and Aaron 27-28 to give this message to the people of Israel : You sinful people have complained against me too many times ! Now I swear by my own life that I will give you exactly what you wanted . [ c ]
CEV	Numbers	14	29	( F ) You will die right here in the desert , and your dead bodies will cover the ground . You have insulted me , and none of you men who are over
CEV	Numbers	14	30	will enter the land that I solemnly promised to give you as your own—only Caleb and Joshua [ d ] will go in .
CEV	Numbers	14	31	You were worried that your own children would be captured . But I , the Lord , will let them enter the land you have rejected .
CEV	Numbers	14	32	You will die here in the desert !
CEV	Numbers	14	33	( G ) Your children will wander around in this desert
CEV	Numbers	14	40	So they got up early the next morning and got ready to head toward the hill country of Canaan . They said , “ We were wrong to complain about the Lord . Let 's go into the land that he promised us. ”
CEV	Numbers	14	34	I will punish you severely every day for the next
CEV	Numbers	14	35	You sinful people who ganged up against me will die here in the desert .

CEV	Numbers	14	41	But Moses replied , “ You 're disobeying the Lord ! Your plan wo n't work , 42-43 so do n't even try it . The Lord refuses to help you , because you turned your backs on him . The Amalekites and the Canaanites are your enemies , and they will attack and defeat you. ”

CEV	Numbers	15	15	The Lord told Moses
CEV	Numbers	15	2	to give the Israelites the following laws about offering sacrifices :
CEV	Numbers	15	3	Bulls or rams or goats [ a ] are the animals that you may burn on the altar as sacrifices to please me . [ b ] You may also offer sacrifices voluntarily or because you made a promise , or because they are part of your regular religious ceremonies . The smell of the smoke from these sacrifices is pleasing to me . 4-5 If you sacrifice a young ram or goat , you must also offer a kilogram of your finest flour mixed with a liter of olive oil as a grain sacrifice . A liter of wine must also be poured on the altar . 6-7 And if the animal is a full-grown ram , you must offer two kilograms of flour mixed with one and a half liters of olive oil . One and a half liters of wine must also be poured on the altar . The smell of this smoke is pleasing to me .
CEV	Numbers	15	8	If a bull is offered as a sacrifice to please me or to ask my blessing , [ c ]
CEV	Numbers	15	9	you must offer three kilograms of flour mixed with two liters of olive oil .
CEV	Numbers	15	10	Two liters of wine must also be poured on the altar . The smell of this smoke is pleasing to me . 11-13 If you are a native Israelite , you must obey these rules each time you offer a bull , a ram , or a goat as a sacrifice .
CEV	Numbers	15	14	And the foreigners who live among you must also follow these rules . 15-16 ( A ) This law will never change . I am the Lord , and I consider all people the same , whether they are Israelites or foreigners living among you . 17-19 When you eat food in the land that I am giving you , remember to set aside some of it as an offering to me .
CEV	Numbers	15	20	From the first batch of bread dough that you make after each new grain harvest , make a loaf of bread and offer it to me , just as you offer grain .
CEV	Numbers	15	21	All your descendants must follow this law and offer part of the first batch of bread dough . 22-23 The Lord also told Moses to tell the people what must be done if they ever disobey his laws :
CEV	Numbers	15	24	If all of you disobey one of my laws without knowing it , you must offer a bull as a sacrifice to please me , together with a grain sacrifice , a wine offering , and a goat as a sacrifice for sin .
CEV	Numbers	15	25	Then the priest will pray and ask me to forgive you . And since you did not mean to do wrong , and you offered sacrifices ,
CEV	Numbers	15	26	the sin of everyone—both Israelites and foreigners among you—will be forgiven .
CEV	Numbers	15	27	( B ) But if one of you does wrong without knowing it , you must sacrifice a year-old female goat as a sacrifice for sin .
CEV	Numbers	15	28	The priest will then ask me to forgive you , and your sin will be forgiven .
CEV	Numbers	15	29	The law will be the same for anyone who does wrong without meaning to , whether an Israelite or a foreigner living among you . 30-31 But if one of you does wrong on purpose , whether Israelite or foreigner , you have sinned against me by disobeying my laws . You will no longer belong to my people . A Man Put to Death for Gathering Firewood on the Sabbath
CEV	Numbers	15	32	Once , while the Israelites were traveling through the desert , a man was caught gathering firewood on the Sabbath . [ d ]
CEV	Numbers	15	33	He was taken to Moses , Aaron , and the rest of the community .
CEV	Numbers	15	34	But no one knew what to do with him , so he was not allowed to leave .
CEV	Numbers	15	35	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell the people to take that man outside the camp and stone him to death ! ”
CEV	Numbers	15	36	So he was killed , just as the Lord had commanded Moses . The Tassels on the People 's Clothes
CEV	Numbers	15	37	The Lord told Moses
CEV	Numbers	15	38	( C ) to say to the people of Israel , “ Sew tassels onto the bottom edge of your clothes and tie a blue string to each tassel . 39-40 These will remind you that you must obey my laws and teachings . And when you do , you will be dedicated to me and wo n't follow your own sinful desires .

CEV	Numbers	16	16	Then he said to Korah , “ Tomorrow you and your followers must go with Aaron to the Lord 's sacred tent .
CEV	Numbers	16	250	men who had offered incense to him .
CEV	Numbers	16	3	and Aaron and said , “ Why do you think you 're so much better than everyone else ? We 're part of the Lord 's holy people , and he 's with all of us . What makes you think you 're the only ones in charge ? ”
CEV	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard this , he knelt down to pray . [ b ]
CEV	Numbers	16	5	Then he said to Korah and his followers : Tomorrow morning the Lord will show us the person he has chosen to be his priest , and that man will faithfully serve him . 6-7 Korah , here is what you and your followers must do : Get some fire pans , fill them with coals and incense , and place them near the sacred tent . And the man the Lord chooses will be his priest . [ c ] Korah , this time you Levites have gone too far ! 8-9 You know that the God of Israel has chosen you Levites from all Israel to serve him by being in charge of the sacred tent and by helping the community to worship in the proper way . What more do you want ?
CEV	Numbers	16	10	The Lord has given you a special responsibility , and now , Korah , you think you should also be his priest .
CEV	Numbers	16	11	You and your followers have rebelled against the Lord , not against Aaron .
CEV	Numbers	16	12	Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram , but they sent back this message : “ We wo n't come !
CEV	Numbers	16	13	It 's bad enough that you took us from our rich farmland in Egypt to let us die here in the desert . Now you also want to boss us around !
CEV	Numbers	16	14	You keep promising us rich farmlands with fertile fields and vineyards—but where are they ? Stop trying to trick these people . No , we wo n't come to see you. ”
CEV	Numbers	16	15	Moses was very angry and said to the Lord , “ Do n't listen to these men ! I have n't done anything wrong to them . I have n't taken as much as a donkey. ”
CEV	Numbers	16	17	Each of you take along your fire pan with incense in it and offer the incense to the Lord. ”
CEV	Numbers	16	18	The next day the men placed incense and coals in their fire pans and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the sacred tent .
CEV	Numbers	16	19	Meanwhile , Korah had convinced the rest of the Israelites to rebel against their two leaders . When that happened , the Lord appeared in all his glory
CEV	Numbers	16	20	and said to Moses and Aaron ,
CEV	Numbers	16	21	“ Get away from the rest of the Israelites so I can kill them at once ! ”
CEV	Numbers	16	22	But the two men bowed down and prayed , “ Our God , you gave these people life . Why would you punish everyone here when only one man has sinned ? ”
CEV	Numbers	16	23	The Lord answered Moses ,
CEV	Numbers	16	24	“ Tell the people to stay away from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram. ”
CEV	Numbers	16	25	Moses walked over to Dathan and Abiram , and the other leaders of Israel followed .
CEV	Numbers	16	26	Then Moses warned the people , “ Get away from the tents of these sinful men ! Do n't touch anything that belongs to them or you 'll be wiped out. ”
CEV	Numbers	16	27	So everyone moved away from those tents , except Korah , Dathan , Abiram , and their families .
CEV	Numbers	16	28	Moses said to the crowd , “ The Lord has chosen me and told me to do these things—it was n't my idea . And here 's how you will know :
CEV	Numbers	16	29	If these men die a natural death , it means the Lord has n't chosen me .
CEV	Numbers	16	30	But suppose the Lord does something that has never been done before . For example , what if a huge crack appears in the ground , and these men and their families fall into it and are buried alive , together with everything they own ? Then you will know they have turned their backs on the Lord ! ”
CEV	Numbers	16	31	As soon as Moses said this , the ground under the men opened up 32-33 and swallowed them alive , together with their families and everything they owned . Then the ground closed back up , and they were gone .
CEV	Numbers	16	34	The rest of the Israelites heard their screams , so they ran off , shouting , “ We do n't want that to happen to us ! ”
CEV	Numbers	16	35	Suddenly the Lord sent a fire that burned up the
CEV	Numbers	16	36	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
CEV	Numbers	16	37	“ Tell Aaron 's son Eleazar to take the fire pans from the smoldering fire and scatter the coals . The pans are now sacred ,
CEV	Numbers	16	38	because they were used for offering incense to me . Have them hammered into a thin layer of bronze as a covering for the altar . Those men died because of their sin , and now their fire pans will become a warning for the rest of the community. ”
CEV	Numbers	16	39	Eleazar collected the pans and had them hammered into a thin layer of bronze as a covering for the altar ,

CEV	Numbers	16	41	The next day the people of Israel again complained against Moses and Aaron , “ The two of you killed some of the Lord 's people ! ”
CEV	Numbers	16	42	As the people crowded around them , Moses and Aaron turned toward the sacred tent , and the Lord appeared in his glory in the cloud covering the tent .
CEV	Numbers	16	43	So Moses and Aaron walked to the front of the tent ,
CEV	Numbers	16	44	( C ) where the Lord said to them ,
CEV	Numbers	16	45	“ Stand back ! I am going to wipe out these Israelites once and for all. ” They immediately bowed down and prayed .
CEV	Numbers	16	46	Then Moses told Aaron , “ Grab your fire pan and fill it with hot coals from the altar . Put incense in it , then quickly take it to where the people are and offer it to the Lord , so they can be forgiven . The Lord is very angry , and people have already started dying ! ” 47-48 Aaron did exactly what he had been told . He ran over to the crowd of people and stood between the dead bodies and the people who were still alive . He placed the incense on the pan , then offered it to the Lord and asked him to forgive the people 's sin . The disease immediately stopped spreading , and no one else died from it .
CEV	Numbers	16	49	But 14,700 Israelites were dead , not counting those who had died with Korah and his followers .
CEV	Numbers	16	50	Aaron walked back and stood with Moses at the sacred tent . Footnotes - 16.1,2 Dathan , Abiram , and On : Hebrew “ Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab , and On son of Peleth. ” - 16.4 he knelt down to pray : Or “ he fell to his knees in sorrow. ” - 16.6,7 Get some fire pans … his priest : Only priests could offer incense at the sacred altar ; anyone else who tried would be killed .

CEV	Numbers	17	17	The Lord told Moses : 2-3 Call together the twelve tribes of Israel and tell the leader of each tribe to write his name on the walking stick he carries as a symbol of his authority . Make sure Aaron 's name is written on the one from the Levi tribe , then collect all the sticks .
CEV	Numbers	17	4	Place these sticks in the tent right in front of the sacred chest where I appear to you .
CEV	Numbers	17	5	I will then choose a man to be my priest , and his stick will sprout . After that happens , I wo n't have to listen to any more complaints about you .
CEV	Numbers	17	6	Moses told the people what the Lord had commanded , and they gave him the walking sticks from the twelve tribal leaders , including Aaron 's from the Levi tribe .
CEV	Numbers	17	7	Moses took them and placed them in the Lord 's sacred tent .
CEV	Numbers	17	8	( A ) The next day when Moses went into the tent , flowers and almonds were already growing on Aaron 's stick .
CEV	Numbers	17	9	Moses brought the twelve sticks out of the tent and showed them to the people . Each of the leaders found his own and took it .
CEV	Numbers	17	10	But the Lord told Moses , “ Put Aaron 's stick back ! Let it stay near the sacred chest as a warning to anyone who might think of rebelling . If these people do n't stop their grumbling about me , I will wipe them out. ”
CEV	Numbers	17	11	Moses did what he was told .
CEV	Numbers	17	12	The Israelites cried out to Moses , “ We 're done for

CEV	Numbers	18	18	You are allowed to eat the meat of those animals , just as you can eat the choice ribs and the right hind leg of the special sacrifices .
CEV	Numbers	18	2	The Levites are your relatives and are here to help you in your service at the tent .
CEV	Numbers	18	3	You must see that they perform their duties . But if they go near any of the sacred objects or the altar , all of you will die .
CEV	Numbers	18	4	No one else is allowed to take care of the sacred tent or do anything connected with it .
CEV	Numbers	18	5	Follow these instructions , so I wo n't become angry and punish the Israelites ever again .
CEV	Numbers	18	6	I alone chose the Levites from all the other tribes to belong to me , and I have given them to you as your helpers .
CEV	Numbers	18	7	But only you and your sons can serve as priests at the altar and in the most holy place . Your work as priests is a gift from me , and anyone else who tries to do that work must be put to death . The Priests ' Share of Offerings Given to the Lord ( Deuteronomy 18.1-8 ) 8-9 The Lord said to Aaron : I have put you in charge of the sacred gifts and sacrifices that the Israelites bring to me . And from now on , you , your sons , and your descendants will receive part of the sacrifices for sin , as well as part of the grain sacrifices , and the sacrifices to make things right . Your share of these sacrifices will be the parts not burned on the altar .
CEV	Numbers	18	10	Since these things are sacred , they must be eaten near the sacred tent , but only men are allowed to eat them .
CEV	Numbers	18	11	You will also receive part of the special gifts and offerings that the Israelites bring to me . Any member of your family who is clean and acceptable for worship can eat these things .
CEV	Numbers	18	12	For example , when the Israelites bring me the first batches of oil , wine , and grain , you can have the best parts of those gifts .
CEV	Numbers	18	13	And the first part of the crops from their fields and vineyards also belongs to you . The people will offer this to me , then anyone in your family who is clean may have some of it .
CEV	Numbers	18	14	( A ) Everything in Israel that has been completely dedicated to me [ b ] will now belong to you .
CEV	Numbers	18	15	The first-born son in every Israelite family , as well as the first-born males of their flocks and herds , belong to me . But every first-born son and first-born donkey [ c ] must be bought back from me .
CEV	Numbers	18	16	The price for a first-born son who is at least one month old will be five pieces of silver , weighed according to the official standards .
CEV	Numbers	18	17	However , all first-born cattle , sheep , and goats belong to me and can not be bought back . Splatter their blood on the altar and send their fat up in smoke , so I can smell it and be pleased .
CEV	Numbers	18	19	From now on , the sacred offerings that the Israelites give to me will belong to you , your sons , and your daughters . This is my promise to you and your descendants , and it will never change .
CEV	Numbers	18	20	You will not receive any land in Israel as your own . I am the Lord , and I will give you whatever you need . What the Levites Receive The Lord said to Aaron :
CEV	Numbers	18	21	( B ) Ten percent of the Israelites ' crops and one out of every ten of their newborn animals belong to me . But I am giving all this to the Levites as their pay for the work they do at the sacred tent . 22-23 They are the only ones allowed to work at the tent , and they must not let anyone else come near it . Those who do come near must be put to death , and the Levites will also be punished . This law will never change . Since the Levites wo n't be given any land in Israel as their own ,
CEV	Numbers	18	24	they will be given the crops and newborn animals that the Israelites offer to me . What the Levites Must Give
CEV	Numbers	18	25	The Lord told Moses
CEV	Numbers	18	26	to say to the Levites : When you receive from the people of Israel ten percent of their crops and newborn animals , you must offer a tenth of that to me .
CEV	Numbers	18	27	Just as the Israelites give me part of their grain and wine , you must set aside part of what you receive
CEV	Numbers	18	28	as an offering to me . That amount must then be given to Aaron ,
CEV	Numbers	18	29	so the best of what you receive will be mine .
CEV	Numbers	18	30	After you have dedicated the best parts to me , you can eat the rest , just as the Israelites eat part of their grain and wine after offering them to me . [ d ]
CEV	Numbers	18	31	Your share may be eaten anywhere by anyone in your family , because it is your pay for working at the sacred tent .
CEV	Numbers	18	32	You wo n't be punished for eating it , as long as you have already offered the best parts to me . The gifts and sacrifices brought by the people must remain sacred , and if you eat any part of them before they are offered to me , you will be put to death . Footnotes - 18.1 are responsible … sacred tent : Or “ are to make sure that no one gets near the sacred tent. ” - 18.14 that has been completely dedicated to me : This translates a Hebrew word that describes property and things that were taken away from humans and given to God forever . Sometimes such things had to be completely destroyed ( see Joshua 6.15-19 ) . - 18.15 donkey : The Hebrew text has “ unclean animal , ” which probably refers to a donkey ( see Exodus 13.13 ; 34.20 ) . - 18.30 just as the Israelites … to me : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text .

CEV	Numbers	19	11	If you touch a dead body , you will be unclean for seven days .
CEV	Numbers	19	12	But if you wash with the water mixed with the cow 's ashes on the third day and again on the seventh day , you will be clean and acceptable for worship . You must wash yourself on those days ; if you do n't , you will remain unclean .

That same person must dip a hyssop branch in the water and ashes , then sprinkle it on the tent and everything in it , including everyone who was inside . If you have touched a human bone , a grave , or a dead body , you must be sprinkled with that water .
CEV	Numbers	19	20	If you are unclean and refuse to be made clean by washing with the water mixed with ashes , you will be guilty of making my sacred tent unclean , and you will no longer belong to the people of Israel .
CEV	Numbers	19	21	These laws will never change . The man who sprinkled the water and the ashes on you when you were unclean must also wash his clothes . And whoever touches this water is unclean until evening .
CEV	Numbers	19	22	When you are unclean , everything you touch becomes unclean , and anyone who touches you will be unclean until evening . Copyright ©

CEV	Numbers	20	20	But the king insisted , “ You ca n't go through our land ! ” Then Edom sent out its strongest troops
CEV	Numbers	20	2	( A ) The Israelites had no water , so they went to Moses and Aaron
CEV	Numbers	20	3	and complained , “ Moses , we 'd be better off if we had died along with the others in front of the Lord 's sacred tent . [ b ]
CEV	Numbers	20	4	You brought us into this desert , and now we and our livestock are going to die !
CEV	Numbers	20	5	Egypt was better than this horrible place . At least there we had grain and figs and grapevines and pomegranates . [ c ] But now we do n't even have any water. ”
CEV	Numbers	20	6	Moses and Aaron went to the entrance to the sacred tent , where they bowed down . The Lord appeared to them in all of his glory 7-8 and said , “ Moses , get your walking stick . [ d ] Then you and Aaron call the people together and command that rock to give you water . That 's how you will provide water for the people of Israel and their livestock. ”
CEV	Numbers	20	9	Moses obeyed and took his stick from the sacred tent .
CEV	Numbers	20	10	After he and Aaron had gathered the people around the rock , he said , “ Look , you rebellious people , and you will see water flow from this rock ! ”
CEV	Numbers	20	11	( B ) He raised his stick in the air and struck the rock two times . At once , water gushed from the rock , and the people and their livestock had water to drink .
CEV	Numbers	20	12	But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Because you refused to believe in my power , these people did not respect me . And so , you will not be the ones to lead them into the land I have promised. ”
CEV	Numbers	20	13	The Israelites had complained against the Lord , and he had shown them his holy power by giving them water to drink . So they named the place Meribah , which means “ Complaining. ” Israel Is n't Allowed To Go through Edom
CEV	Numbers	20	14	Moses sent messengers from Israel 's camp near Kadesh with this message for the king of Edom : We are Israelites , your own relatives , and we 're sure you have heard the terrible things that have happened to us .
CEV	Numbers	20	15	Our ancestors settled in Egypt and lived there a long time . But later the Egyptians were cruel to us ,
CEV	Numbers	20	16	and when we begged our Lord for help , he answered our prayer and brought us out of that land . Now we are camped at the border of your territory , near the town of Kadesh .
CEV	Numbers	20	17	Please let us go through your country . We wo n't go near your fields or vineyards , and we wo n't drink any water from your wells . We will stay on the main road [ e ] until we leave your territory .

CEV	Numbers	20	19	Moses sent back this message : “ We promise to stay on the main road , and if any of us or our livestock drink your water , we will pay for it . We just want to pass through. ”
CEV	Numbers	20	21	to keep Israel from passing through its territory . So the Israelites had to go in another direction . Aaron Dies
CEV	Numbers	20	22	After the Israelites had left Kadesh and had gone as far as Mount Hor
CEV	Numbers	20	23	on the Edomite border , the Lord said ,
CEV	Numbers	20	24	“ Aaron , this is where you will die . You and Moses disobeyed me at Meribah , and so you will not enter the land I promised the Israelites .

CEV	Numbers	20	26	Then take Aaron 's priestly robe from him and place it on Eleazar . Aaron will die there. ”

CEV	Numbers	21	2	The Israelites prayed , “ Our Lord , if you will help us defeat these Canaanites , we will completely destroy their towns and everything in them , to show that they belong to you. ” [ a ]
CEV	Numbers	21	3	The Lord answered their prayer and helped them wipe out the Canaanite army and completely destroy their towns . That 's why one of the towns is named Hormah , which means “ Destroyed Place. ” Moses Makes a Bronze Snake
CEV	Numbers	21	4	( B ) The Israelites had to go around the territory of Edom , so when they left Mount Hor , they headed south toward the Red Sea . [ b ] But along the way , the people became so impatient

CEV	Numbers	21	6	Then the Lord sent poisonous snakes that bit and killed many of them .
CEV	Numbers	21	7	Some of the people went to Moses and admitted , “ It was wrong of us to insult you and the Lord . Now please ask him to make these snakes go away. ” Moses prayed ,
CEV	Numbers	21	8	and the Lord answered , “ Make a snake out of bronze and place it on top of a pole . Anyone who gets bitten can look at the snake and be saved from death. ”
CEV	Numbers	21	9	( D ) Moses obeyed the Lord . And all of those who looked at the bronze snake lived , even though they had been bitten by the poisonous snakes . Israel 's Journey to Moab
CEV	Numbers	21	10	As the Israelites continued their journey to Canaan , they camped at Oboth ,

CEV	Numbers	21	17	That 's also the same well the Israelites sang about in this song : Let 's celebrate ! The well has given us water .
CEV	Numbers	21	18	With their royal scepters , our leaders pointed out where to dig the well . The Israelites left the desert and camped near the town of Mattanah ,
CEV	Numbers	21	19	then at Nahaliel , and then at Bamoth .

CEV	Numbers	21	23	But Sihon refused to let Israel travel through his land . Instead , he called together his entire army and marched into the desert to attack Israel near the town of Jahaz .
CEV	Numbers	21	24	Israel defeated them and took over the Amorite territory from the Arnon River gorge in the south to the Jabbok River gorge in the north . Beyond the Jabbok was the territory of the Ammonites , who were much stronger than Israel .
CEV	Numbers	21	25	The Israelites settled in the Amorite towns , including the capital city of Heshbon with its surrounding villages .
CEV	Numbers	21	26	King Sihon had ruled from Heshbon , after defeating the Moabites and taking over their land north of the Arnon River gorge .
CEV	Numbers	21	27	That 's why the Amorites had written this poem about Heshbon : Come and rebuild Heshbon , King Sihon 's capital city !
CEV	Numbers	21	28	( E ) His armies marched out like fiery flames , burning down the town of Ar and destroying [ f ] the hills along the Arnon River .

CEV	Numbers	22	22	Balaam was riding his donkey to Moab , and two of his servants were with him . But God was angry that Balaam had gone , so one of the Lord 's angels stood in the road to stop him .
CEV	Numbers	22	4	They said to the Midianite leaders , “ That huge mob of Israelites will wipe out everything in sight , like a bull eating grass in a field. ” So King Balak
CEV	Numbers	22	5	( A ) sent a message to Balaam son of Beor who lived among his relatives in the town of Pethor near the Euphrates River . It said : I need your help . A large group of people has come here from Egypt and settled near my territory .
CEV	Numbers	22	6	They are too powerful for us to defeat , so would you come and place a curse on them ? Maybe then we can run them off . I know that anyone you bless will be successful , but anyone you curse will fail .
CEV	Numbers	22	7	The leaders of Moab and Midian left and took along money to pay Balaam . When they got to his house , they gave him Balak 's message .
CEV	Numbers	22	8	“ Spend the night here , ” Balaam replied , “ and tomorrow I will tell you the Lord 's answer. ” So the officials stayed at his house .
CEV	Numbers	22	9	During the night , God asked Balaam , “ Who are these people at your house ? ”
CEV	Numbers	22	10	“ They are messengers from King Balak of Moab , ” Balaam answered . “ He sent them
CEV	Numbers	22	11	to ask me to go to Moab and put a curse on the people who have come there from Egypt . They have settled everywhere around him , and he wants to run them off. ”
CEV	Numbers	22	12	But God replied , “ Do n't go with Balak 's messengers . I have blessed those people who have come from Egypt , so do n't curse them. ”
CEV	Numbers	22	13	The next morning , Balaam said to Balak 's officials , “ Go on back home . The Lord says I can not go with you. ”
CEV	Numbers	22	14	The officials left and told Balak that Balaam refused to come .
CEV	Numbers	22	15	Then Balak sent a larger group of officials , who were even more important than the first ones .
CEV	Numbers	22	16	They went to Balaam and told him that Balak had said , “ Balaam , if you come to Moab ,
CEV	Numbers	22	17	I 'll pay you very well and do whatever you ask . Just come and place a curse on these people. ”
CEV	Numbers	22	18	Balaam answered , “ Even if Balak offered me a palace full of silver or gold , I would n't do anything to disobey the Lord my God .
CEV	Numbers	22	19	You are welcome to spend the night here , just as the others did . I will find out if the Lord has something else to say about this. ”
CEV	Numbers	22	20	That night , God said , “ Balaam , I 'll let you go to Moab with Balak 's messengers , but do only what I say. ”
CEV	Numbers	22	21	So Balaam got up the next morning and saddled his donkey , then left with the Moabite officials . Balaam and His Donkey Meet an Angel
CEV	Numbers	22	23	When Balaam 's donkey saw the angel standing there with a sword , it walked off the road and into an open field . Balaam had to beat the donkey to get it back on the road .
CEV	Numbers	22	24	Then the angel stood between two vineyards , in a narrow path with a stone wall on each side .
CEV	Numbers	22	25	When the donkey saw the angel , it walked so close to one of the walls that Balaam 's foot scraped against the wall . Balaam beat the donkey again .
CEV	Numbers	22	26	The angel moved once more and stood in a spot so narrow that there was no room for the donkey to go around .
CEV	Numbers	22	27	So it just lay down . Balaam lost his temper , then picked up a stick and whacked the donkey .
CEV	Numbers	22	28	When that happened , the Lord told the donkey to speak , and it asked Balaam , “ What have I done that made you beat me three times ? ”
CEV	Numbers	22	29	“ You made me look stupid ! ” Balaam answered . “ If I had a sword , I 'd kill you here and now ! ”
CEV	Numbers	22	30	“ But you 're my owner , ” answered the donkey , “ and you 've ridden me many times . Have I ever done anything like this before ? ” “ No , ” Balaam admitted .
CEV	Numbers	22	31	Just then , the Lord let Balaam see the angel standing in the road , holding a sword , and Balaam bowed down .
CEV	Numbers	22	32	The angel said , “ You had no right to treat your donkey like that ! I was the one who blocked your way , because I do n't think you should go to Moab . [ b ]
CEV	Numbers	22	33	If your donkey had not seen me and stopped those three times , I would have killed you and let the donkey live. ”
CEV	Numbers	22	34	Balaam replied , “ I was wrong . I did n't know you were trying to stop me . If you do n't think I should go , I 'll return home at once. ”
CEV	Numbers	22	35	“ It 's all right for you to go , ” the Lord 's angel answered . “ But you must say only what I tell you. ” So Balaam went on with Balak 's officials . King Balak Meets Balaam
CEV	Numbers	22	36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming , he went to meet him at the town of Ir on the Arnon River , which is the northern border of Moab .
CEV	Numbers	22	37	Balak asked , “ Why did n't you come when I invited you the first time ? Did you think I was n't going to pay you ? ”

CEV	Numbers	22	39	They left and went to the town of Kiriath-Huzoth ,
CEV	Numbers	22	40	where Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the officials who were with him .

CEV	Numbers	23	23	No magic charms can work against them— just look what God has done for his people .
CEV	Numbers	23	2	After Balak had done this , they sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar .
CEV	Numbers	23	3	Then Balaam said , “ Wait here beside your offerings , and I 'll go somewhere to be alone . Maybe the Lord will appear to me . If he does , I will tell you everything he says. ” And he left .
CEV	Numbers	23	4	When God appeared to him , Balaam said , “ I have built seven altars and have sacrificed a bull and a ram on each one. ”
CEV	Numbers	23	5	The Lord gave Balaam a message , then sent him back to tell Balak .
CEV	Numbers	23	6	When Balaam returned , he found Balak and his officials standing beside the offerings .
CEV	Numbers	23	7	Balaam said : “ King Balak of Moab brought me from the hills of Syria to curse Israel and announce its doom .
CEV	Numbers	23	8	But I ca n't go against God ! He did not curse or condemn Israel . *
CEV	Numbers	23	9	“ From the mountain peaks , I look down and see Israel , the obedient people of God .
CEV	Numbers	23	10	They are living alone in peace . And though they are many , they do n't bother the other nations . “ I hope to obey God for as long as I live and to die in such peace. ”
CEV	Numbers	23	11	Balak said , “ What are you doing ? I asked you to come and place a curse on my enemies . But you have blessed them instead ! ”
CEV	Numbers	23	12	Balaam answered , “ I can say only what the Lord tells me. ” Balaam 's Second Message
CEV	Numbers	23	13	Balak said to Balaam , “ Let 's go somewhere else . Maybe if you see a smaller part of the Israelites , you will be able to curse them for me. ”
CEV	Numbers	23	14	So he took Balaam to a field on top of Mount Pisgah where lookouts were stationed . [ a ] Then he built seven altars there and sacrificed a bull and a ram on each one .
CEV	Numbers	23	15	“ Wait here beside your offerings , ” Balaam said . “ The Lord will appear to me over there. ”
CEV	Numbers	23	16	The Lord appeared to Balaam and gave him another message , then he told him to go and tell Balak .
CEV	Numbers	23	17	Balaam went back and saw him and his officials standing beside the offerings . Balak asked , “ What did the Lord say ? ”
CEV	Numbers	23	18	Balaam answered : “ Pay close attention to my words—
CEV	Numbers	23	19	God is no mere human ! He does n't tell lies or change his mind . God always keeps his promises .
CEV	Numbers	23	20	“ My command from God was to bless these people , and there 's nothing I can do to change what he has done .
CEV	Numbers	23	21	Israel 's king is the Lord God . He lives there with them and intends them no harm .
CEV	Numbers	23	22	With the strength of a wild ox , God led Israel out of Egypt .
CEV	Numbers	23	24	They are like angry lions ready to attack ; and they wo n't rest until their victim is gobbled up. ”
CEV	Numbers	23	25	Balak shouted , “ If you 're not going to curse Israel , then at least do n't bless them. ”
CEV	Numbers	23	26	“ I 've already told you , ” Balaam answered . “ I will say only what the Lord tells me. ” Balaam 's Third Message
CEV	Numbers	23	27	Balak said to Balaam , “ Come on , let 's try another place . Maybe God will let you curse Israel from there. ”
CEV	Numbers	23	28	So he took Balaam to Mount Peor overlooking the desert north of the Dead Sea .
CEV	Numbers	23	29	Balaam said , “ Build seven altars here , then bring me seven bulls and seven rams. ”
CEV	Numbers	23	30	After Balak had done what Balaam asked , he sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar . Footnotes - 23.14 a field … where lookouts were stationed : Or “ Zophim Field on the top of Mount Pisgah. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Numbers	24	2	and saw the tribes of Israel camped below . Just then , God 's Spirit took control of him ,
CEV	Numbers	24	3	and Balaam said : “ I am the son of Beor , and my words are true , [ a ] so listen to my message !
CEV	Numbers	24	4	It comes from the Lord , the God All-Powerful . I bowed down to him and saw a vision of Israel .
CEV	Numbers	24	5	“ People of Israel , your camp is lovely .
CEV	Numbers	24	6	It 's like a grove of palm trees [ b ] or a garden beside a river . You are like tall aloe trees that the Lord has planted , or like cedars growing near water .
CEV	Numbers	24	7	You and your descendants will prosper like an orchard beside a stream . Your king will rule with power and be a greater king than Agag the Amalekite . [ c ]
CEV	Numbers	24	8	With the strength of a wild ox , God led you out of Egypt . You will defeat your enemies , shooting them with arrows [ d ] and crushing their bones .
CEV	Numbers	24	9	( A ) Like a lion you lie down , resting after an attack . Who would dare disturb you ? “ Anyone who blesses you will be blessed ; anyone who curses you will be cursed. ”
CEV	Numbers	24	10	When Balak heard this , he was so furious that he pounded his fist against his hand and said , “ I called you here to place a curse on my enemies , and you 've blessed them three times .
CEV	Numbers	24	11	Leave now and go home ! I told you I would pay you well , but since the Lord did n't let you do what I asked , you wo n't be paid. ”
CEV	Numbers	24	12	Balaam answered , “ I told your messengers
CEV	Numbers	24	13	that even if you offered me a palace full of silver or gold , I would still obey the Lord . And I explained that I would say only what he told me .
CEV	Numbers	24	14	So I 'm going back home , but I 'm leaving you with a warning about what the Israelites will someday do to your nation. ” Balaam 's Fourth Message
CEV	Numbers	24	15	Balaam said : “ I am the son of Beor , and my words are true , [ e ] so listen to my message !
CEV	Numbers	24	16	My knowledge comes from God Most High , the Lord All-Powerful . I bowed down to him and saw a vision of Israel .
CEV	Numbers	24	17	“ What I saw in my vision has n't happened yet . But someday , a king of Israel will appear like a star . He will wipe out you Moabites [ f ] and destroy [ g ] those tribes who live in the desert . [ h ]
CEV	Numbers	24	18	Israel will conquer Edom and capture the land of that enemy nation .
CEV	Numbers	24	19	The king of Israel will rule and destroy the survivors of every town there . [ i ]

CEV	Numbers	25	25	While the Israelites were camped at Acacia , some of the men had sex with Moabite women .
CEV	Numbers	25	2	These women then invited the men to ceremonies where sacrifices were offered to their gods . The men ate the meat from the sacrifices and worshiped the Moabite gods .
CEV	Numbers	25	3	The Lord was angry with Israel because they had worshiped the god Baal Peor .
CEV	Numbers	25	4	So he said to Moses , “ Take the Israelite leaders who are responsible for this and have them killed in front of my sacred tent where everyone can see . Maybe then I will stop being angry with the Israelites. ”
CEV	Numbers	25	5	Moses told Israel 's officials , [ a ] “ Each of you must put to death any of your men who worshiped Baal. ”
CEV	Numbers	25	6	Later , Moses and the people were at the sacred tent , crying , when one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite [ b ] woman to meet his family .
CEV	Numbers	25	7	Phinehas , the grandson of Aaron [ c ] the priest , saw the couple and left the crowd . He found a spear
CEV	Numbers	25	8	and followed the man into his tent , where he ran the spear through the man and into the woman 's stomach . The Lord immediately stopped punishing Israel with a deadly disease ,
CEV	Numbers	25	9	but 24,000 Israelites had already died .
CEV	Numbers	25	10	The Lord said to Moses ,
CEV	Numbers	25	11	“ In my anger , I would have wiped out the Israelites if Phinehas had not been faithful to me . 12-13 But instead of punishing them , I forgave them . So because of the loyalty that Phinehas showed , I solemnly promise that he and his descendants will always be my priests. ”
CEV	Numbers	25	14	The Israelite man that was killed was Zimri son of Salu , who was one of the leaders of the Simeon tribe .
CEV	Numbers	25	15	And the Midianite woman killed with him was Cozbi , the daughter of a Midianite clan leader named Zur .
CEV	Numbers	25	16	The Lord told Moses , 17-18 “ The Midianites are now enemies of Israel , so attack and defeat them ! They tricked the people of Israel into worshiping their god at Peor , and they are responsible for the death of Cozbi , the daughter of one of their own leaders. ” Footnotes - 25.5 officials : These were special leaders who were probably responsible for an entire tribe or part of a tribe . - 25.6 Midianite : Used here as a general term for various peoples who lived east of the Jordan River .

CEV	Numbers	26	26	( A ) After the Lord had stopped the deadly disease from killing the Israelites , he said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron ,
CEV	Numbers	26	2	“ I want you to find out how many Israelites are in each family . Then make a list of every man
CEV	Numbers	26	20	years and older , just as Moses and their ancestors had done when they left Egypt . [ a ] 5-7 There were 43,730 men from the tribe of Reuben , the oldest son of Jacob . [ b ] These men were from the clans of Hanoch , Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi .
CEV	Numbers	26	3	Israel was now camped in the hills of Moab across the Jordan River from the town of Jericho . Moses and Eleazar told them
CEV	Numbers	26	4	what the Lord had said about counting the men
CEV	Numbers	26	8	Pallu was the father of Eliab
CEV	Numbers	26	9	and the grandfather of Nemuel , Dathan , and Abiram . These are the same Dathan and Abiram who had been chosen by the people , but who followed Korah and rebelled against Moses , Aaron , and the Lord .
CEV	Numbers	26	10	That 's when the Lord made the earth open up and swallow Dathan , Abiram , and Korah . At the same time , fire destroyed
CEV	Numbers	26	250	men as a warning to the other Israelites . [ c ]
CEV	Numbers	26	11	But the Korahite clan was n't destroyed . 12-14 There were 22,200 men from the tribe of Simeon ; they were from the clans of Nemuel , Jamin , Jachin , Zerah , and Shaul . 15-18 There were 40,500 men from the tribe of Gad ; they were from the clans of Zephon , Haggi , Shuni , Ozni , Eri , Arod , and Areli . 19-22 There were 76,500 men from the tribe of Judah ; they were from the clans of Shelah , Perez , and Zerah , as well as Hezron and Hamul , whose ancestor was Perez . Judah 's sons Er and Onan had died in Canaan . [ d ] 23-25 There were 64,300 men from the tribe of Issachar ; they were from the clans of Tola , Puvah , Jashub , and Shimron . 26-27 There were 60,500 men from the tribe of Zebulun ; they were from the clans of Sered , Elon , and Jahleel . 28-34 There were 52,700 men from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph ; they were from the clan of Machir , the clan of Gilead his son , and the clans of his six grandsons : Iezer , Helek , Asriel , Shechem , Shemida , and Hepher . Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons , but he had five daughters : Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah . [ e ] 35-37 There were 32,500 men from the tribe of Ephraim son of Joseph ; they were from the clans of Shuthelah , Becher , Tahan , and Eran the son of Shuthelah . 38-41 There were 45,600 men from the tribe of Benjamin ; they were from the clans of Bela , Ashbel , Ahiram , Shephupham , Hupham , as well as from Ard and Naaman , the two sons of Bela . 42-43 There were 64,400 men from the tribe of Dan ; they were all from the clan of Shuham . 44-47 There were 53,400 men from the tribe of Asher ; they were from the clans of Imnah , Ishvi , and Beriah , and from the two clans of Heber and Malchiel , the sons of Beriah . Asher 's daughter was Serah . 48-50 There were 45,400 men from the tribe of Naphtali ; they were from the clans of Jahzeel , Guni , Jezer , and Shillem .
CEV	Numbers	26	51	The total number of Israelite men listed was 601,730 .
CEV	Numbers	26	52	( B ) The Lord said to Moses ,
CEV	Numbers	26	53	“ Divide the land of Canaan among these tribes , according to the number of people in each one ,
CEV	Numbers	26	54	so the larger tribes have more land than the smaller ones . 55-56 I will show you [ f ] what land to give each tribe , and they will receive as much land as they need , according to the number of people in it. ”
CEV	Numbers	26	57	The tribe of Levi included the clans of the Gershonites , Kohathites , Merarites ,
CEV	Numbers	26	58	as well as the clans of Libni , Hebron , Mahli , Mushi , and Korah . Kohath the Levite was the father of Amram ,
CEV	Numbers	26	59	the husband of Levi 's daughter Jochebed , who was born in Egypt . Amram and Jochebed 's three children were Aaron , Moses , and Miriam .
CEV	Numbers	26	60	( C ) Aaron was the father of Nadab , Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
CEV	Numbers	26	61	( D ) But Nadab and Abihu had died when they offered fire that was unacceptable to the Lord . [ g ]
CEV	Numbers	26	62	In the tribe of Levi there were 23,000 men and boys at least a month old . They were not listed with the other tribes , because they would not receive any land in Canaan .
CEV	Numbers	26	63	Moses and Eleazar counted the Israelites while they were camped in the hills of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho .
CEV	Numbers	26	64	None of the people that Moses and Aaron had counted in the Sinai Desert were still alive ,

CEV	Numbers	27	27	Zelophehad [ a ] was from the Manasseh tribe , and he had five daughters , whose names were Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
CEV	Numbers	27	2	One day his daughters went to the sacred tent , where they met with Moses , Eleazar , and some other leaders of Israel , as well as a large crowd of Israelites . The young women said :
CEV	Numbers	27	3	You know that our father died in the desert . But it was for something he did wrong , not for joining with Korah in rebelling against the Lord . Our father left no sons
CEV	Numbers	27	4	to carry on his family name . But why should his name die out for that reason ? Give us some land like the rest of his relatives in our clan , so our father 's name can live on .
CEV	Numbers	27	5	Moses asked the Lord what should be done ,
CEV	Numbers	27	6	and the Lord answered :
CEV	Numbers	27	7	( A ) Zelophehad 's daughters are right . They should each be given part of the land their father would have received .
CEV	Numbers	27	8	Tell the Israelites that when a man dies without a son , his daughter will inherit his land .
CEV	Numbers	27	9	If he has no daughter , his brothers will inherit the land .
CEV	Numbers	27	10	But if he has no brothers , his father 's brothers will inherit the land .
CEV	Numbers	27	11	And if his father has no brothers , the land must be given to his nearest relative in the clan . This is my law , and the Israelites must obey it . Joshua Is Appointed Israel 's Leader ( Deuteronomy 31.1-8 )
CEV	Numbers	27	12	( B ) The Lord said to Moses , “ One day you will go up into the Abarim Mountains , and from there you will see the land I am giving the Israelites .
CEV	Numbers	27	13	After you have seen it , you will die , [ b ] just like your brother Aaron ,
CEV	Numbers	27	14	because both of you disobeyed me at Meribah near the town of Kadesh in the Zin Desert . When the Israelites insulted me there , you did n't believe in my holy power. ” [ c ]
CEV	Numbers	27	15	Moses replied ,
CEV	Numbers	27	16	“ You are the Lord God , and you know what is in everyone 's heart . So I ask you to appoint a leader for Israel .
CEV	Numbers	27	17	( C ) Your people need someone to lead them into battle , or else they will be like sheep wandering around without a shepherd. ”
CEV	Numbers	27	18	( D ) The Lord answered , “ Joshua son of Nun can do the job . Place your hands on him to show that he is the one to take your place .
CEV	Numbers	27	19	Then go with him and tell him to stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the Israelites . Appoint Joshua as their new leader
CEV	Numbers	27	20	and tell them they must now obey him , just as they obey you .
CEV	Numbers	27	21	( E ) But Joshua must depend on Eleazar to find out from me [ d ] what I want him to do as he leads Israel into battle. ”
CEV	Numbers	27	22	Moses followed the Lord 's instructions and took Joshua to Eleazar and the people ,
CEV	Numbers	27	23	( F ) then he placed his hands on Joshua and appointed him Israel 's leader .

CEV	Numbers	30	30	The Lord told Moses to say to Israel 's tribal leaders :
CEV	Numbers	30	2	( A ) When one of you men makes a promise to the Lord , [ a ] you must keep your word .
CEV	Numbers	30	3	Suppose a young woman who is still living with her parents makes a promise to the Lord .
CEV	Numbers	30	4	If her father hears about it and says nothing , she must keep her promise .
CEV	Numbers	30	5	But if he hears about it and objects , then she no longer has to keep her promise . The Lord will forgive her , because her father did not agree with the promise . 6-7 Suppose a woman makes a promise to the Lord and then gets married . If her husband later hears about the promise but says nothing , she must do what she said , whether she meant it or not .
CEV	Numbers	30	8	But if her husband hears about the promise and objects , she no longer has to keep it , and the Lord will forgive her .
CEV	Numbers	30	9	Widows and divorced women must keep every promise they make to the Lord .
CEV	Numbers	30	10	Suppose a married woman makes a promise to the Lord .
CEV	Numbers	30	11	If her husband hears about the promise and says nothing , she must do what she said .
CEV	Numbers	30	12	But if he hears about the promise and does object , she no longer has to keep it . The Lord will forgive her , because her husband would not allow her to keep the promise .
CEV	Numbers	30	13	Her husband has the final say about any promises she makes to the Lord .
CEV	Numbers	30	14	If her husband hears about a promise and says nothing about it for a whole day , she must do what she said—since he did not object , the promise must be kept .
CEV	Numbers	30	15	But if he waits until the next day to stop her from keeping her promise , he is the one who must be punished .
CEV	Numbers	30	16	These are the laws that the Lord gave Moses about husbands and wives , and about young daughters who still live at home . Footnotes - 30.2 a promise to the Lord : Either the promise of a gift or the promise to do something . Copyright ©

CEV	Numbers	31	31	Moses and Eleazar followed the Lord 's instructions 32-35 and listed everything that had been taken from the Midianites . The list included 675,000 sheep and goats , 72,000 cattle , 61,000 donkeys , and 32,000 young women who had never had sex . 36-47 Each half included 337,500 sheep and goats , 36,000 cattle , 30,500 donkeys , and 16,000 young women . From the half that belonged to the soldiers , Moses counted out
CEV	Numbers	31	2	“ Before you die , make sure that the Midianites are punished for what they did to Israel. ” [ a ]
CEV	Numbers	31	3	Then Moses told the people , “ The Lord wants to punish the Midianites . So tell our men to prepare for battle .
CEV	Numbers	31	4	Each tribe will send 1,000 men to fight. ”
CEV	Numbers	31	5	Twelve thousand men were picked from the tribes of Israel , and after they were prepared for battle ,
CEV	Numbers	31	6	Moses sent them off to war . Phinehas the son of Eleazar went with them and took along some things from the sacred tent [ b ] and the trumpets for sounding the battle signal .
CEV	Numbers	31	7	The Israelites fought against the Midianites , just as the Lord had commanded Moses . They killed all the men ,
CEV	Numbers	31	8	including Balaam son of Beor and the five Midianite kings , Evi , Rekem , Zur , Hur , and Reba .
CEV	Numbers	31	9	The Israelites captured every woman and child , then led away the Midianites ' cattle and sheep , and took everything else that belonged to them .
CEV	Numbers	31	10	They also burned down the Midianite towns and villages .
CEV	Numbers	31	11	Israel 's soldiers gathered together everything they had taken from the Midianites , including the captives and the animals . 12-13 Then they returned to their own camp in the hills of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho , where Moses , Eleazar , and the other Israelite leaders met the troops outside camp .
CEV	Numbers	31	14	Moses became angry with the army commanders
CEV	Numbers	31	15	and said , “ I ca n't believe you let the women live !
CEV	Numbers	31	16	( A ) They are the ones who followed Balaam 's advice and invited our people to worship the god Baal Peor . That 's why the Lord punished us by killing so many of our people .
CEV	Numbers	31	17	You must put to death every boy and all the women who have ever had sex .
CEV	Numbers	31	18	But do not kill the young women who have never had sex . You may keep them for yourselves. ”
CEV	Numbers	31	19	Then Moses said to the soldiers , “ If you killed anyone or touched a dead body , you are unclean and have to stay outside the camp for seven days . On the third and seventh days , you must go through a ceremony to make yourselves and your captives clean .
CEV	Numbers	31	20	Then wash your clothes and anything made from animal skin , goat 's hair , or wood. ” 21-23 Eleazar then explained , “ If you need to purify something that wo n't burn , such as gold , silver , bronze , iron , tin , or lead , you must first place it in a hot fire . After you take it out , sprinkle it with the water that purifies . Everything else should only be sprinkled with the water . Do all of this , just as the Lord commanded Moses .
CEV	Numbers	31	24	Wash your clothes on the seventh day , and after that , you will be clean and may return to the camp. ” Everything Taken from the Midianites Is Divided
CEV	Numbers	31	25	The Lord told Moses : 26-27 Make a list of everything taken from the Midianites , including the captives and the animals . Then divide them between the soldiers and the rest of the people . Eleazar the priest and the family leaders will help you . 28-29 From the half that belongs to the soldiers , set aside for the Lord one out of every
CEV	Numbers	31	500	people or animals and give these to Eleazar .
CEV	Numbers	31	30	From the half that belongs to the people , set aside one out of every
CEV	Numbers	31	50	So we want to give the Lord all the gold jewelry we took from the Midianites . It 's our gift to him for watching over us and our troops. ”
CEV	Numbers	31	675	sheep and goats ,
CEV	Numbers	31	72	cattle ,
CEV	Numbers	31	61	donkeys , and
CEV	Numbers	31	32	women and gave them to Eleazar to be dedicated to the Lord . Then from the half that belonged to the people , Moses set aside one out of every
CEV	Numbers	31	48	The army commanders went to Moses
CEV	Numbers	31	49	and said , “ Sir , we have counted our troops , and not one soldier is missing .
CEV	Numbers	31	51	Moses and Eleazar accepted the jewelry from the commanders ,
CEV	Numbers	31	52	and its total weight was over
CEV	Numbers	31	200	kilograms .
CEV	Numbers	31	53	This did not include the things that the soldiers had kept for themselves .
CEV	Numbers	31	54	So Moses and Eleazar placed the gold in the Lord 's sacred tent to remind Israel of what had happened . [ c ] Copyright ©

CEV	Numbers	32	32	We will cross the Jordan River , ready to fight for the Lord in Canaan . But the land we will inherit as our own will be on this side of the river. ”
CEV	Numbers	32	2	So they went to Moses , Eleazar , and the other leaders of Israel and said , 3-4 “ The Lord has helped us capture the land around the towns of Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sebam , Nebo , and Beon . That 's good pastureland , and since we own cattle and sheep ,
CEV	Numbers	32	5	would you let us stay here east of the Jordan River and have this land as our own ? ”
CEV	Numbers	32	6	Moses answered : You mean you 'd stay here while the rest of the Israelites go into battle ?
CEV	Numbers	32	7	If you did that , it would discourage the others from crossing over into the land the Lord promised them .
CEV	Numbers	32	8	( A ) This is exactly what happened when I sent your ancestors from Kadesh-Barnea to explore the land .
CEV	Numbers	32	9	They went as far as Eshcol Valley , then returned and told the people that we should not enter it .
CEV	Numbers	32	10	( B ) The Lord became very angry .
CEV	Numbers	32	11	And he said that no one who was
CEV	Numbers	32	20	Moses said : You promised that you would be ready to fight for the Lord .
CEV	Numbers	32	12	except Caleb and Joshua . [ a ] They remained faithful to the Lord ,
CEV	Numbers	32	13	but he was so angry with the others that he forced them to wander around in the desert for
CEV	Numbers	32	40	So Moses gave the Machirites the region of Gilead , and they settled there .
CEV	Numbers	32	14	Now you people of Reuben and Gad are doing the same thing and making the Lord even angrier .
CEV	Numbers	32	15	If you reject the Lord , he will once again abandon his people and leave them here in the desert . And you will be to blame !
CEV	Numbers	32	16	The men from Reuben and Gad replied : Let us build places to keep our sheep and goats , and towns for our wives and children ,
CEV	Numbers	32	17	where they can stay and be safe . Then we 'll prepare to fight and lead the other tribes into battle .
CEV	Numbers	32	18	We will stay with them until they have settled in their own tribal lands .
CEV	Numbers	32	19	The land on this side of the Jordan River will be ours , so we wo n't expect to receive any on the other side .
CEV	Numbers	32	21	You also agreed to cross the Jordan and stay with the rest of the Israelites , until the Lord forces our enemies out of the land . If you do these things ,
CEV	Numbers	32	22	then after the Lord helps Israel capture the land , you can return to your own land . You will no longer have to stay with the others .
CEV	Numbers	32	23	But if you do n't keep your promise , you will sin against the Lord and be punished .
CEV	Numbers	32	24	Go ahead and build towns for your wives and children , and places for your sheep and goats . Just be sure to do what you have promised .
CEV	Numbers	32	25	The men from Reuben and Gad answered : Sir , we will do just what you have said .
CEV	Numbers	32	26	Our wives and children and sheep and cattle will stay here in the towns in Gilead .
CEV	Numbers	32	27	But those of us who are prepared for battle will cross the Jordan and fight for the Lord .
CEV	Numbers	32	28	( C ) Then Moses said to Eleazar , Joshua , and the family leaders ,
CEV	Numbers	32	29	“ Make sure that the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for battle and cross the Jordan River with you . If they do , then after the land is in your control , give them the region of Gilead as their tribal land .
CEV	Numbers	32	30	But if they break their promise , they will receive land on the other side of the Jordan , like the rest of the tribes. ”
CEV	Numbers	32	31	The tribes of Gad and Reuben replied , “ We are your servants and will do whatever the Lord has commanded .
CEV	Numbers	32	33	So Moses gave the tribes of Gad , Reuben , and half of Manasseh [ b ] the territory and towns that King Sihon the Amorite had ruled , as well as the territory and towns that King Og of Bashan had ruled . [ c ]
CEV	Numbers	32	34	The tribe of Gad rebuilt the towns of Dibon , Ataroth , Aroer ,
CEV	Numbers	32	35	Atroth-Shophan , Jazer , Jogbehah ,
CEV	Numbers	32	36	Beth-Nimrah , and Beth-Haran . They built walls around them and also built places to keep their sheep and goats .
CEV	Numbers	32	37	The tribe of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon , Elealeh , Kiriathaim ,
CEV	Numbers	32	38	Sibmah , as well as the towns that used to be known as Nebo and Baal-Meon . They renamed all those places .
CEV	Numbers	32	39	The clan of Machir from the tribe of East Manasseh went to the region of Gilead , captured its towns , and forced out the Amorites .
CEV	Numbers	32	41	Jair from the Manasseh tribe captured villages and renamed them “ Villages of Jair. ” [ d ]

CEV	Numbers	33	33	As Israel traveled from Egypt under the command of Moses and Aaron ,
CEV	Numbers	33	2	Moses kept a list of the places they camped , just as the Lord had instructed . Here is the record of their journey : 3-4 Israel left the Egyptian city of Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month . [ a ] This was the day after the Lord had punished Egypt 's gods by killing the first-born sons in every Egyptian family . So while the Egyptians were burying the bodies , they watched the Israelites proudly [ b ] leave their country .
CEV	Numbers	33	5	After the Israelites left Rameses , they camped at Succoth ,
CEV	Numbers	33	6	and from there , they moved their camp to Etham on the edge of the desert .
CEV	Numbers	33	7	Then they turned back toward Pi-Hahiroth , east of Baal-Zephon , and camped near Migdol .
CEV	Numbers	33	8	They left Pi-Hahiroth , [ c ] crossed the Red Sea , [ d ] then walked three days into the Etham Desert and camped at Marah .
CEV	Numbers	33	9	Next , they camped at Elim , where there were
CEV	Numbers	33	12	springs of water and
CEV	Numbers	33	70	palm trees .
CEV	Numbers	33	10	They left Elim and camped near the Red Sea , [ e ]
CEV	Numbers	33	11	then turned east and camped along the western edge of the Sinai Desert . [ f ] 12-14 From there they went to Dophkah , Alush , and Rephidim , where they had no water . [ g ]
CEV	Numbers	33	15	They left Rephidim and finally reached the Sinai Desert . 16-36 As Israel traveled from the Sinai Desert to Kadesh in the Zin Desert , they camped at Kibroth-Hattaavah , Hazeroth , Rithmah , Rimmon-Perez , Libnah , Rissah , Kehelathah , Mount Shepher , Haradah , Makheloth , Tahath , Terah , Mithkah , Hashmonah , Moseroth , Bene-Jaakan , Hor-Haggidgad , Jotbathah , Abronah , Ezion-Geber , and finally Kadesh .
CEV	Numbers	33	37	When they left Kadesh , they came to Mount Hor , on the border of Edom .
CEV	Numbers	33	38	( A ) That 's where the Lord commanded Aaron the priest to go to the top of the mountain . Aaron died there on the first day of the fifth month , [ h ]
CEV	Numbers	33	40	( B ) It was then that the Canaanite king of Arad , who lived in the Southern Desert of Canaan , heard that Israel was headed that way . 41-47 The Israelites left Mount Hor and headed toward Moab . Along the way , they camped at Zalmonah , Punon , Oboth , Iye-Abarim in the territory of Moab , Dibon-Gad , Almon-Diblathaim , at a place near Mount Nebo in the Abarim Mountains ,
CEV	Numbers	33	39	He was
CEV	Numbers	33	123	years old at the time .
CEV	Numbers	33	48	and finally in the lowlands of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho .
CEV	Numbers	33	49	Their camp stretched from Beth-Jeshimoth to Acacia . The Lord 's Command To Conquer Canaan
CEV	Numbers	33	50	While Israel was camped in the lowlands of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho , the Lord told Moses
CEV	Numbers	33	51	to give the people of Israel this message : When you cross the Jordan River and enter Canaan ,
CEV	Numbers	33	52	you must force out the people living there . Destroy their idols and tear down their altars .
CEV	Numbers	33	53	Then settle in the land—I have given it to you as your own .
CEV	Numbers	33	54	( C ) I will show you [ i ] how to divide the land among the tribes , according to the number of clans in each one , so that the larger tribes will have more land than the smaller ones .
CEV	Numbers	33	55	If you do n't force out all the people there , they will be like splinters in your eyes and thorns in your back . They will always be trouble for you ,
CEV	Numbers	33	56	and I will treat you as severely as I planned on treating them .

CEV	Numbers	34	34	The Lord told Moses
CEV	Numbers	34	2	to tell the people of Israel that their land in Canaan would have the following borders :
CEV	Numbers	34	3	The southern border will be the Zin Desert and the northwest part of Edom . This border will begin at the south end of the Dead Sea .
CEV	Numbers	34	4	It will go west from there , but will turn southward to include Scorpion Pass , the village of Zin , and the town of Kadesh-Barnea . From there , the border will continue to Hazar-Addar and on to Azmon .
CEV	Numbers	34	5	It will run along the Egyptian Gorge and end at the Mediterranean Sea .
CEV	Numbers	34	6	The western border will be the Mediterranean Sea .
CEV	Numbers	34	7	The northern border will begin at the Mediterranean , then continue eastward to Mount Hor . [ a ]
CEV	Numbers	34	8	After that , it will run to Lebo-Hamath and across to Zedad , which is the northern edge of your land .
CEV	Numbers	34	9	From Zedad , the border will continue east to Ziphron and end at Hazar-Enan .
CEV	Numbers	34	10	The eastern border will begin at Hazar-Enan in the north , then run south to Shepham ,
CEV	Numbers	34	11	and on down to Riblah on the east side of Ain . From there , it will go south to the eastern hills of Lake Galilee , [ b ]
CEV	Numbers	34	12	then follow the Jordan River down to the north end of the Dead Sea . The land within those four borders will belong to you .
CEV	Numbers	34	13	( A ) ( B ) Then Moses told the people , “ You will receive the land inside these borders . It will be yours , but the Lord has commanded you to divide it among the nine and a half tribes .
CEV	Numbers	34	14	The tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh have already been given their land
CEV	Numbers	34	15	across from Jericho , east of the Jordan River. ” The Leaders Who Will Divide the Land
CEV	Numbers	34	16	The Lord said to Moses ,
CEV	Numbers	34	17	“ Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun will divide the land for the Israelites .
CEV	Numbers	34	18	One leader from each tribe will help them , 19-28 and here is the list of their names : Caleb son of Jephunneh from Judah , Shemuel son of Ammihud from Simeon , Elidad son of Chislon from Benjamin , Bukki son of Jogli from Dan , Hanniel son of Ephod from Manasseh , Kemuel son of Shiphtan from Ephraim , Elizaphan son of Parnach from Zebulun , Paltiel son of Azzan from Issachar , Ahihud son of Shelomi from Asher , and Pedahel son of Ammihud from Naphtali. ”

CEV	Numbers	35	35	( A ) While the people of Israel were still camped in the lowlands of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho , the Lord told Moses
CEV	Numbers	35	2	to say to them : When you receive your tribal lands , you must give towns and pastures to the Levi tribe .
CEV	Numbers	35	3	That way , the Levites will have towns to live in and pastures for their animals . 4-5 The pasture around each of these towns must be in the shape of a square , with the town itself in the center . The pasture is to measure
CEV	Numbers	35	900	meters on each side , with
CEV	Numbers	35	450	meters of land outside each of the town walls . This will be the Levites ' pastureland .
CEV	Numbers	35	6	Six of the towns you give them will be Safe Towns where a person who has accidentally killed someone can run for protection . But you will also give the Levites
CEV	Numbers	35	42	other towns ,
CEV	Numbers	35	7	so they will have a total of
CEV	Numbers	35	48	towns with their surrounding pastures .
CEV	Numbers	35	8	Since the towns for the Levites must come from Israel 's own tribal lands , the larger tribes will give more towns than the smaller ones . The Safe Towns ( Deuteronomy 19.1-13 ; Joshua 20.1-9 )
CEV	Numbers	35	9	( B ) The Lord then told Moses
CEV	Numbers	35	10	to tell the people of Israel : After you have crossed the Jordan River and are settled in Canaan ,
CEV	Numbers	35	11	choose Safe Towns , where a person who has accidentally killed someone can run for protection .
CEV	Numbers	35	12	If the victim 's relatives think it was murder , they might try to take revenge . [ a ] Anyone accused of murder can run to one of these Safe Towns for protection and not be killed before a trial is held .
CEV	Numbers	35	13	There are to be six of these Safe Towns ,
CEV	Numbers	35	14	three on each side of the Jordan River .
CEV	Numbers	35	15	They will be places of protection for anyone who lives in Israel and accidentally kills someone . Laws about Murder and Accidental Killing The Lord said : 16-18 Suppose you hit someone with a piece of iron or a large stone or a dangerous wooden tool . If that person dies , then you are a murderer and must be put to death
CEV	Numbers	35	19	by one of the victim 's relatives . He will take revenge [ b ] for his relative 's death as soon as he finds you . 20-21 Or suppose you get angry and kill someone by pushing or hitting or by throwing something . You are a murderer and must be put to death by one of the victim 's relatives . 22-24 But if you are not angry and accidentally kill someone in any of these ways , the townspeople must hold a trial and decide if you are guilty .
CEV	Numbers	35	25	If they decide that you are innocent , you will be protected from the victim 's relative and sent to stay in one of the Safe Towns until the high priest dies .
CEV	Numbers	35	26	But if you ever leave the Safe Town
CEV	Numbers	35	27	and are killed by the victim 's relative , he can not be punished for killing you .
CEV	Numbers	35	28	You must stay inside the town until the high priest dies ; only then can you go back home .
CEV	Numbers	35	29	The community of Israel must always obey these laws .
CEV	Numbers	35	30	( C ) Death is the penalty for murder . But no one accused of murder can be put to death unless there are at least two witnesses to the crime .
CEV	Numbers	35	31	You can not give someone money to escape the death penalty ; you must pay with your own life !
CEV	Numbers	35	32	And if you have been proven innocent of murder and are living in a Safe Town , you can not pay to go back home ; you must stay there until the high priest dies . 33-34 I , the Lord , live among you people of Israel , so your land must be kept pure . But when a murder takes place , blood pollutes the land , and it becomes unclean . If that happens , the murderer must be put to death , so the land will be clean again . Keep murder out of Israel !

CEV	Numbers	36	36	One day the family leaders from the Gilead clan of the Manasseh tribe went to Moses and the other family leaders of Israel
CEV	Numbers	36	2	( A ) and said , “ Sir , the Lord has said that he will show [ a ] what land each tribe will receive as their own . And the Lord has commanded you to give the daughters of our relative Zelophehad [ b ] the land that he would have received .
CEV	Numbers	36	3	But if they marry men from other tribes of Israel , the land they receive will become part of that tribe 's inheritance and will no longer belong to us .
CEV	Numbers	36	4	Even when land is returned to its original owner in the Year of Celebration , [ c ] we will not get back Zelophehad 's land—it will belong to the tribe into which his daughters married. ”
CEV	Numbers	36	5	So Moses told the people that the Lord had said : These men from the Manasseh tribe are right .
CEV	Numbers	36	6	I will allow Zelophehad 's daughters to marry anyone , as long as those men belong to one of the clans of the Manasseh tribe .
CEV	Numbers	36	7	Tribal land must not be given to another tribe—it will remain the property of the tribe that received it . 8-9 In the future , any daughter who inherits land must marry someone from her own tribe . Israel 's tribal land is never to be passed from one tribe to another . 10-11 Mahlah , Tirzah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad obeyed the Lord and married their uncles ' sons
CEV	Numbers	36	12	and remained part of the Manasseh tribe . So their land stayed in their father 's clan .
CEV	Numbers	36	13	These are the laws that the Lord gave to Moses and the Israelites while they were camped in the lowlands of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho . Footnotes - 36.2 that he will show : See the note at 26.55,56 . - 36.2 Zelophehad : See also 26.28-34 ; 27.1-11 . - 36.4 Year of Celebration : This was a sacred year for Israel , traditionally called the “ Year of Jubilee. ” During this year , all property had to go back to its original owner . But here , the property was not sold ; it became part of the other tribe 's land when the daughter who owned it married into that tribe . So the property could not be returned even during this year .

CEV	Deuteronomy	1	1	1-5 ( A ) This book contains the speeches that Moses made while Israel was in the land of Moab , camped near the town of Suph in the desert east of the Jordan River . The town of Paran was in one direction from their camp , and the towns of Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Dizahab [ a ] were in the opposite direction . Earlier , Moses had defeated the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon . Moses had also defeated King Og of Bashan , who used to live in Ashtaroth for part of the year and in Edrei for the rest of the year . Although it takes only eleven days to walk from Mount Sinai [ b ] to Kadesh-Barnea by way of the Mount Seir Road , these speeches were not made until

CEV	Deuteronomy	1	6	People of Israel , when we were in our camp at Mount Sinai , [ e ] the Lord our God told us : You have stayed here long enough .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	7	Leave this place and go into the land that belongs to the Amorites and their neighbors the Canaanites . This land includes the Jordan River valley , the hill country , the western foothills , the Southern Desert , the Mediterranean seacoast , the Lebanon Mountains , and all the territory as far as the Euphrates River .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	8	I give you this land , just as I promised your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . Now you must go and take the land . Leaders Were Appointed ( Exodus 18.13-27 ) Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	9	Right after the Lord commanded us to leave Mount Sinai , [ f ] I told you : Israel , being your leader is too big a job for one person .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	10	,
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	11	God has even promised to bless us a thousand times more , and I pray that he will .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	12	But I can not take care of all your problems and settle all your arguments alone .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	13	Each tribe must choose some experienced men who are known for their wisdom and understanding , and I will make those men the official leaders of their tribes .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	14	You answered , “ That 's a good idea ! ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	15	Then I took these men , who were already wise and respected leaders , and I appointed them as your official leaders . Some of them became military officers in charge of groups of 1,000 , or
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	100	, or
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	50	, or
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	16	and others became judges . I gave these judges the following instructions : When you settle legal cases , your decisions must be fair . It does n't matter if the case is between two Israelites , or between an Israelite and a foreigner living in your community .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	17	And it does n't matter if one is helpless and the other is powerful . Do n't be afraid of anyone ! No matter who shows up in your court , God will help you make a fair decision . If any case is too hard for you , bring the people to me , and I will make the decision .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	18	After I gave these instructions to the judges , I taught you the Lord 's commands . Men Were Sent To Explore the Hill Country ( Numbers 13.1-33 ) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	19	The Lord had commanded us to leave Mount Sinai [ g ] and go to the hill country that belonged to the Amorites , so we started out into the huge desert . You remember how frightening it was , but soon we were at Kadesh-Barnea , 20-21 and I told you , “ We have reached the hill country . It belongs to the Amorites now , but the Lord our God is giving it to us . He is the same God our ancestors worshiped , and he has told us to go in and take this land , so do n't hesitate and be afraid. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	22	Then all of you came to me and said , “ Before we go into the land , let 's send some men to explore it . When they come back , they can tell us about the towns we will find and what roads we should take to get there. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	23	It seemed like a good idea , so I chose twelve men , one from each tribe .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	24	They explored the hill country as far as Bunch Valley [ h ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	25	and even brought back some of the fruit . They said , “ The Lord our God is giving us good land. ” Israel Refused To Obey the Lord ( Numbers 14.1-45 ) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	26	( B ) You did not want to go into the land , and you refused to obey the Lord your God .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	27	You stayed in your tents and grumbled , “ The Lord must hate us—he brought us out of Egypt , just so he could hand us over to the Amorites and get rid of us .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	28	We are afraid , because the men who explored the land told us that the cities are large , with walls that reach to the sky . The people who live there are taller and stronger than we are , [ i ] and some of them are Anakim . [ j ] We have nowhere to go. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	29	Then I said , “ Do n't worry !
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	30	The Lord our God will lead the way . He will fight on our side , just as he did when we saw him do all those things to the Egyptians .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	31	( C ) And you know that the Lord has taken care of us the whole time we 've been in the desert , just as you might carry one of your children. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	32	( D ) But you still would not trust the Lord ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	33	even though he had always been with us in the desert . During the daytime , the Lord was in the cloud , leading us in the right direction and showing us where to camp . And at night , he was there in the fire . [ k ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	34	( E ) You had made the Lord angry , and he said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	35	You people of this generation are evil , and I refuse to let you go into the good land that I promised your ancestors .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	36	Caleb son of Jephunneh is the only one of your generation that I will allow to go in . He obeyed me completely , so I will give him and his descendants the land he explored .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	37	The Lord was even angry with me because of you people , and he said , “ Moses , I wo n't let you go into the land either .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	38	Instead , I will let Joshua [ l ] your assistant lead Israel to conquer the land . So encourage him. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	39	Then the Lord spoke to you again : People of Israel , you said that your innocent young children would be taken prisoner in the battle for the land . But someday I will let them go into the land , and with my help they will conquer it and live there .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	41	Then you told me , “ We disobeyed the Lord our God , but now we want to obey him . We will go into the hill country and fight , just as he told us to do. ” So you picked up your weapons , thinking it would be easy to take over the hill country .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	42	But the Lord said , “ Moses , warn them not to go into the hill country . I wo n't help them fight , and their enemies will defeat them. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	43	I told you what the Lord had said , but you paid no attention . You disobeyed him and went into the hill country anyway . You thought you were so great !
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	44	But when the Amorites in the hill country attacked from their towns , you ran from them as you would run from a swarm of bees . The Amorites chased your troops into Seir [ n ] as far as Hormah , killing them as they went .
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	45	Then you came back to the place of worship at Kadesh-Barnea and wept , but the Lord would not listen to your prayers . Israel Spent Years in the Desert Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	1	46	After we had been in Kadesh for a few months , we obeyed the Lord and headed back into the desert by way of Red Sea [ o ] Road . Footnotes - 1.1-5 Suph … Paran … Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Dizahab : The exact location of these towns is not known . - 1.1-5 Mount Sinai : The Hebrew text has “ Horeb , ” another name for Mount Sinai . - 1.1-5 Egypt : The Israelites would soon enter Canaan , but they would have entered the land of Canaan from Kadesh-Barnea

CEV	Deuteronomy	2	2	until the Lord said : Moses ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	1	( A ) We spent many years wandering around outside the hill country of Seir , [ a ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	3	Israel has wandered in these hills long enough . Turn and go north .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	4	( B ) And give the people these orders : “ Be very careful , because you will soon go through the land that belongs to your relatives , the descendants of Esau . [ b ] They are afraid of you ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	5	but do n't start a war with them . I have given them the hill country of Seir , so I wo n't give any of it to you , not even enough to set a foot on .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	6	And as you go through their land , you will have to buy food and water from them. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	7	The Lord has helped us and taken care of us during the past
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	40	years that we have been in this huge desert . We 've had everything we needed , and the Lord has blessed us and made us successful in whatever we have done .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	8	We went past the territory that belonged to our relatives , the descendants of Esau . [ c ] We followed Arabah Road that starts in the south at Elath and Ezion-Geber , then we turned onto the desert road that leads to Moab .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	9	( C ) The Lord told me , “ Do n't try to start a war with Moab . Leave them alone , because I gave the land of Ar [ d ] to them , [ e ] and I will not let you have any of it. ” Tribes That Lived near Canaan
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	10	Before the Lord gave the Moabites their land , a large and powerful tribe lived there . They were the Emim , and they were as tall as the Anakim .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	11	The Moabites called them Emim , though others sometimes used the name Rephaim [ f ] for both the Anakim and the Emim .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	12	The Horites used to live in Seir , but the Edomites [ g ] took over that region . They killed many of the Horites and forced the rest of them to leave , just as Israel did to the people in the land that the Lord gave them . Israel Crossed the Zered Gorge Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	13	When we came to the Zered Gorge along the southern border of Moab , the Lord told us to cross the gorge into Moab , and we did .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	14	( D ) This was
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	38	years after we left Kadesh-Barnea , and by that time all the men who had been in the army at Kadesh-Barnea had died , just as the Lord had said they would . 15-16 The Lord kept getting rid of [ h ] them until finally none of them were left .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	17	Then the Lord told me ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	18	“ Moses , now go past the town of Ar and cross Moab 's northern border
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	19	( E ) into Ammon . But do n't start a war with the Ammonites . I gave them [ i ] their land , and I wo n't give any of it to Israel. ” More Nations That Lived near Canaan
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	20	Before the Ammonites conquered the land that the Lord had given them , some of the Rephaim used to live there , although the Ammonites called them Zamzummim .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	21	The Zamzummim were a large and powerful tribe and were as tall as the Anakim . [ j ] But the Lord helped the Ammonites , and they killed many of the Zamzummim and forced the rest to leave . Then the Ammonites settled there .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	22	The Lord helped them as he had helped the Edomites , [ k ] who killed many of the Horites in Seir and forced the rest to leave before settling there themselves .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	23	A group called the Avvim used to live in villages as far south as Gaza , but the Philistines [ l ] killed them and settled on their land . Israel Crossed the Arnon Gorge Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	24	After we went through Ammon , the Lord told us : Israel , pack up your possessions , take down your tents , and cross the Arnon River gorge . [ m ] The territory of the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon lies on the other side of the river , but I now give you his land . So attack and take it !
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	25	Today I will start making all other nations afraid of you . They will tremble with fear when anyone mentions you , and they will be terrified when you show up . The Defeat of King Sihon of Heshbon ( Numbers 21.21-30 ) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	26	After we had crossed the Arnon and had set up camp in the Kedemoth Desert , I sent messengers to King Sihon of Heshbon , telling him that his nation and ours could be at peace . I said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	27	Please let Israel go across your country . We will walk straight through , without turning off the road . 28-29 You can even sell us food and water , and we will pay with silver . We need to reach the Jordan River and cross it , because the Lord our God is giving us the land on the west side . The Edomites and Moabites [ n ] have already let us cross their land . Please let us cross your land as well . 30-31 But Sihon refused to let us go across his country , because the Lord made him stubborn and eager to fight us . The Lord told me , “ I am going to help you defeat Sihon and take his land , so attack him ! ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	32	We met Sihon and his army in battle at Jahaz ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	33	and the Lord our God helped us defeat them . We killed Sihon , his sons , and everyone else in his army .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	34	Then we captured and destroyed every town in Sihon 's kingdom , killing everyone ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	35	but keeping the livestock and everything else of value .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	36	The Lord helped us capture every town from the Arnon River gorge north to the boundary of Gilead , including the town of Aroer on the edge of the gorge and the town in the middle of the gorge .
CEV	Deuteronomy	2	37	However , we stayed away from all the Ammonite towns , both in the hill country and near the Jabbok River , just as the Lord had commanded . Footnotes - 2.1 hill country of Seir : See the note at 1.44 . - 2.4 your relatives , the descendants of Esau : Esau was the brother of Jacob , the ancestor of the nation of Israel . Esau 's descendants were also known as the nation of Edom . - 2.8 We went past … Esau : According to Numbers 20.14-21 , the king of Edom did not let the Israelites go through his land . - 2.9 Ar : One of the main cities of Moab ( see Numbers 21.28 ) ; sometimes it may have stood for the whole territory of Moab . - 2.9 them : The Hebrew text has “ the descendants of Lot ” ; the nation of Moab descended from Moab , who was the son of Lot , the nephew of Abraham . - 2.10,11 Emim … Anakim … Rephaim : These may refer to a group or groups of very tall people that lived in or near Palestine before the Israelites ( see also Numbers 13.33 ) . - 2.12 Edomites : The Hebrew text has “ the descendants of Esau , ” who became the nation of Edom . - 2.15,16 getting rid of : Or “ sending diseases on. ” - 2.19 them : The Hebrew text has “ descendants of Lot ” ; the nation of Ammon descended from Benammi , who was the son of Lot , the nephew of Abraham . - 2.21 Anakim : See the note at 2.10,11 . - 2.22 Edomites : See the note at 2.12 . - 2.23 Philistines : The Hebrew text has “ the Caphtorim from Caphtor , ” probably referring to the Philistines who originally came from Crete . - 2.24 Arnon River gorge : The northern boundary of Moab 's territory and the southern boundary of Sihon 's kingdom . - 2.28,29 Edomites and Moabites : Hebrew “ descendants of Esau , who live in Seir and Moabites who live in Ar. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	3	3	When we turned onto the road that leads to Bashan , King Og of Bashan led out his whole army to fight us at Edrei .
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	2	But the Lord told me , “ Moses , do n't be afraid of King Og . I am going to help you defeat him and his army and take over his land . Destroy him and his people , just as you did with the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon. ” 3-6 The Lord our God helped us destroy Og and his army and conquer his entire kingdom of Bashan , including the Argob region . His kingdom had lots of villages and
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	60	towns with high walls and gates that locked with bars . We completely destroyed [ a ] them all , killing everyone ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	7	but keeping the livestock and everything else of value .
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	8	Sihon and Og had ruled Amorite kingdoms east of the Jordan River . Their land stretched from the Arnon River gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north , and we captured it all .
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	9	Mount Hermon is called Mount Sirion by the people of Sidon , and it is called Mount Senir by the Amorites .
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	10	We captured all the towns in the highlands , all of Gilead , and all of Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei , two of the towns that Og had ruled . Og 's Coffin
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	11	King Og was the last of the Rephaim , [ b ] and his coffin [ c ] is in the town of Rabbah in Ammon . It is made of hard black rock [ d ] and is four meters long and almost two meters wide . The Land East of the Jordan River Is Divided ( Numbers 32.1-42 ) Moses said to Israel : 12-17 I gave some of the land and towns we captured to the tribes of Reuben and Gad . Their share started at the Arnon River gorge in the south , took in the town of Aroer on the edge of the gorge , and went far enough north to include the southern half of the Gilead region . The northern part of their land went as far east as the upper Jabbok River gorge , which formed their border with the Ammonites . [ e ] I also gave them the eastern side of the Jordan River valley , from Lake Galilee [ f ] south to the Dead Sea [ g ] below the slopes of Mount Pisgah . I gave the northern half of Gilead and all of the Bashan region to half the tribe of Manasseh . [ h ] Bashan had belonged to King Og , and the Argob region in Bashan used to be called the Land of the Rephaim . Jair from the Manasseh tribe conquered the Argob region as far west as the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah . The Israelites even started calling Bashan by the name “ Villages of Jair , ” [ i ] and that is still its name . I gave the northern half of Gilead to the Machir clan . [ j ] 18-19 ( A ) At that time I told the men of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh : The Lord our God told me to give you this land with its towns , and that 's what I have done . Now your wives and children can stay here with your large flocks of sheep and goats and your large herds of cattle . But all of you men that can serve in our army must cross the Jordan River and help the other tribes , because they are your relatives .
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	20	The Lord will let them defeat the enemy nations on the west side of the Jordan and take their land . Afterwards , you can come back here to the land I gave you . 21-22 Then I told Joshua , “ You saw how the Lord our God helped us destroy King Sihon and King Og . So do n't be afraid ! Wherever you go , the Lord will fight on your side and help you destroy your enemies. ” God Refused To Let Moses Enter Canaan Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	23	( B ) At that time I prayed and begged ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	24	“ Our Lord , it seems that you have just begun to show me your great power . No other god in the sky or on earth is able to do the mighty things that you do .
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	25	The land west of the Jordan is such good land . Please let me cross the Jordan and see the hills and the Lebanon Mountains. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	26	But the Lord was angry with me because of you people , [ k ] and he refused to listen . “ That 's enough ! ” he said . “ I do n't want to hear any more .
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	27	Climb to the top of Mount Pisgah and look north , south , east , and west . Take a good look , but you are not going to cross the Jordan River .
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	28	Joshua will lead Israel across the Jordan to take the land , so help him be strong and brave and tell him what he must do. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	3	29	After this we stayed in the valley at Beth-Peor . Footnotes - 3.3-6 completely destroyed : The Hebrew word means that the town was given completely to the Lord , and since it could not be used for normal purposes any more , it had to be destroyed . Every person was killed and sometimes all the animals as well . - 3.11 Rephaim : See the note at 2.10,11 . - 3.11 coffin : Or “ bed. ” - 3.11 hard black rock : The Hebrew text has “ iron , ” which probably refers to basalt , a hard black rock . - 3.12-17 The northern part … border with the Ammonites : The Jabbok River flowed from south to north , then it turned west and formed the northern border of the land belonging to the Reuben and Gad tribes . - 3.12-17 Lake Galilee : The Hebrew text has “ Lake Chinnereth , ” an earlier name . - 3.12-17 the Dead Sea : Hebrew “ the Sea of the Arabah , the Salt Sea. ” - 3.12-17 half the tribe of Manasseh : Or “ East Manasseh. ” - 3.12-17 Villages of Jair : Or “ Havvoth-Jair. ” - 3.12-17 Machir clan : One of the clans of the Manasseh tribe . - 3.26 But the Lord … people : See 1.37 .

CEV	Deuteronomy	4	4	But all of you that were faithful to the Lord your God are still alive today . 5-8 ( C ) No other nation has laws that are as fair as the ones the Lord my God told me to give you . If you faithfully obey them when you enter the land , you will show other nations how wise you are . In fact , everyone that hears about your laws will say , “ That great nation certainly is wise ! ” And what makes us greater than other nations ? We have a God who is close to us and answers our prayers .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	2	( A ) and now he is your God . I am telling you everything he has commanded , so do n't add anything or take anything away .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	3	( B ) You saw how he killed everyone who worshiped the god Baal Peor . [ a ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	9	You must be very careful not to forget the things you have seen God do for you . Keep reminding yourselves , and tell your children and grandchildren as well .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	10	Do you remember the day you stood in the Lord 's presence at Mount Sinai ? [ b ] The Lord said , “ Moses , bring the people of Israel here . I want to speak to them so they will obey me as long as they live , and so they will teach their children to obey me too. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	11	( D ) Mount Sinai [ c ] was surrounded by deep dark clouds , and fire went up to the sky . You came to the foot of the mountain ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	12	and the Lord spoke to you from the fire . You could hear him and understand what he was saying , but you could n't see him .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	13	( E ) The Lord said he was making an agreement with you , and he told you that your part of the agreement is to obey the Ten Commandments . Then the Lord wrote these Commandments on two flat stones .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	14	( F ) That 's when the Lord commanded me to give you the laws and teachings you must obey in the land that you will conquer west of the Jordan River . Do n't Worship Idols Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	15	When God spoke to you from the fire , he was invisible . So be careful
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	16	( G ) not to commit the sin of worshiping idols . Do n't make idols to be worshiped , whether they are shaped like men , women ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	17	( H ) animals , birds ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	18	reptiles , or fish .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	19	And when you see the sun or moon or stars , do n't be tempted to bow down and worship them . The Lord put them there for all the other nations to worship .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	20	( I ) But you are the Lord 's people , because he rescued you from Egypt , that fiery furnace .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	21	( J ) The Lord was angry with me because of what you said , [ d ] and he told me that he would not let me cross the Jordan River into the good land that he is giving you . [ e ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	22	So I must stay here and die on this side of the Jordan , but you will cross the river and take the land .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	23	Always remember the agreement that the Lord your God made with you , and do n't make an idol in any shape or form .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	24	( K ) The Lord will be angry if you worship other gods , and he can be like a fire destroying everything in its path . 25-26 Soon you will cross the Jordan River and settle down in the land . Then in the years to come , you will have children , and they will give you grandchildren . After many years , you might lose your sense of right and wrong and make idols , even though the Lord your God hates them . So I am giving you fair warning today , and I call the earth and the sky as witnesses . If you ever make idols , the Lord will be angry , and you wo n't have long to live , because the Lord will let you be wiped out .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	27	( L ) Only a few of you will survive , and the Lord will force you to leave the land and will scatter you among the nations .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	28	There you will have to worship gods made of wood and stone , and these are nothing but idols that ca n't see or hear or eat or smell . 29-30 ( M ) In all of your troubles , you may finally decide that you want to worship only the Lord . And if you turn back to him and obey him completely , he will again be your God .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	31	The Lord your God will have mercy—he wo n't destroy you or desert you . The Lord will remember his promise , and he will keep the agreement he made with your ancestors . 32-34 When the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt , you saw how he fought for you and showed his great power by performing terrifying miracles . You became his people , and at Mount Sinai you heard him talking to you out of fiery flames . And yet you are still alive ! Has anything like this ever happened since the time God created humans ? No matter where you go or who you ask , you will get the same answer . No one has ever heard of another god even trying to do such things as the Lord your God has done for you . 35-36 ( N ) The Lord wants you to know he is the only true God , and he wants you to obey him . That 's why he let you see his mighty miracles and his fierce fire on earth , and why you heard his voice from that fire and from the sky .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	37	The Lord loved your ancestors and decided that you would be his people . So the Lord used his great power to bring you out of Egypt .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	38	Now you face other nations more powerful than you are , but the Lord has already started forcing them out of their land and giving it to you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	39	So remember that the Lord is the only true God , whether in the sky above or on the earth below .
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	40	Today I am explaining his laws and teachings . And if you always obey them , you and your descendants will live long and be successful in the land the Lord is giving you . Safe Towns 41-43 ( O ) Moses said , “ People of Israel , you must set aside the following three towns east of the Jordan River as Safe Towns : Bezer in the desert highlands belonging to the Reuben tribe ; Ramoth in Gilead , belonging to the Gad tribe ; and Golan in Bashan , belonging to the Manasseh tribe . If you kill a neighbor without meaning to , and if you had not been angry with that person , you can run to one of these towns and find safety. ” [ f ] The Second Speech : Moses Tells What the Lord Demands Israel at Beth-Peor 44-46 The Israelites had come from Egypt and were camped east of the Jordan River near Beth-Peor , when Moses gave these laws and teachings . The land around their camp had once belonged to King Sihon of Heshbon . But Moses and the Israelites defeated him
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	47	and King Og of Bashan , and took their lands . These two Amorite kings had ruled the territory east of the Jordan River
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	48	from the town of Aroer on the edge of the Arnon River gorge , north to Mount Hermon . [ g ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	4	49	Their land included the eastern side of the Jordan River valley , as far south as the Dead Sea [ h ] below the slopes of Mount Pisgah .

CEV	Deuteronomy	5	5	but you were afraid of the fire and refused to go up the mountain . So I spoke with the Lord for you , then I told you that he had said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	2	The Lord our God made an agreement with our nation at Mount Sinai . [ a ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	3	That agreement was n't only with [ b ] our ancestors but with us , who are here today .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	4	The Lord himself spoke to you out of the fire ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	6	I am the Lord your God , the one who brought you out of Egypt where you were slaves .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	7	Do not worship any god except me .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	8	( A ) Do not make idols that look like anything in the sky or on earth or in the ocean under the earth .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	9	( B ) Do n't bow down and worship idols . I am the Lord your God , and I demand all your love . If you reject me and worship idols , I will punish your families for three or four generations .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	10	But if you love me and obey my laws , I will be kind to your families for thousands of generations .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	11	( C ) Do not misuse my name . [ c ] I am the Lord your God , and I will punish anyone who misuses my name .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	12	( D ) Show respect for the Sabbath Day—it belongs to me .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	13	( E ) You have six days when you can do your work ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	14	but the seventh day of the week belongs to me , your God . No one is to work on that day—not you , your children , your oxen or donkeys or any other animal , not even those foreigners who live in your towns . And do n't make your slaves do any work .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	15	This special day of rest will remind you that I reached out my mighty arm and rescued you from slavery in Egypt .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	16	( F ) Respect your father and mother , and you will live a long and successful life in the land I am giving you .

CEV	Deuteronomy	5	22	( L ) When we were gathered at the mountain , the Lord spoke to us in a loud voice from the dark fiery cloud . The Lord gave us these commands , and only these . Then he wrote them on two flat stones and gave them to me . The People Were Afraid ( Exodus 20.18-21 ) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	23	When fire blazed from the mountain , and you heard the voice coming from the darkness , your tribal leaders came to me
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	24	and said : Today the Lord our God has shown us how powerful and glorious he is . He spoke to us from the fire , and we learned that people can live , even though God speaks to them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	25	But we do n't want to take a chance on being killed by that terrible fire , and if we keep on hearing the Lord 's voice , we will die .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	26	Has anyone else ever heard the only true God speaking from fire , as we have ? And even if they have , would they live to tell about it ?
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	27	Moses , go up close and listen to the Lord . Then come back and tell us , and we will do everything he says .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	28	The Lord heard you and said : Moses , I heard what the people said to you , and I approve .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	29	I wish they would always worship me with fear and trembling and be this willing to obey me ! Then they and their children would always enjoy a successful life .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	30	Now , tell them to return to their tents ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	31	but you come back here to me . After I tell you my laws and teachings , you will repeat them to the people , so they can obey these laws in the land I am giving them . Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	32	Israel , you must carefully obey the Lord 's commands .
CEV	Deuteronomy	5	33	Follow them , because they make a path that will lead to a long successful life in the land the Lord your God is giving you . Footnotes Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	6	6	( C ) Memorize his laws
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	2	And if you and your descendants want to live a long time , you must always worship the Lord and obey his laws .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	3	Pay attention , Israel ! Our ancestors worshiped the Lord , and he promised to give us this land that is rich with milk and honey . Be careful to obey him , and you will become a successful and powerful nation .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	4	( A ) Listen , Israel ! The Lord our God is the only true God ! [ b ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	5	( B ) So love the Lord your God with all your heart , soul , and strength .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	7	and tell them to your children over and over again . Talk about them all the time , whether you 're at home or walking along the road or going to bed at night , or getting up in the morning .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	8	Write down copies and tie them to your wrists and foreheads to help you obey them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	9	Write these laws on the door frames of your homes and on your town gates . Worship Only the Lord Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	10	( D ) The Lord promised your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob that he would give you this land . Now he will take you there and give you large towns , with good buildings that you did n't build ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	11	and houses full of good things that you did n't put there . The Lord will give you wells [ c ] that you did n't have to dig , and vineyards and olive orchards that you did n't have to plant . But when you have eaten so much that you ca n't eat any more ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	12	do n't forget it was the Lord who set you free from slavery and brought you out of Egypt .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	13	( E ) Worship and obey the Lord your God with fear and trembling , and promise that you will be loyal to him .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	14	Do n't have anything to do with gods that are worshiped by the nations around you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	15	If you worship other gods , the Lord will be furious and wipe you off the face of the earth . The Lord your God is with you ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	16	( F ) so do n't try to make him prove that he can help you , as you did at Massah . [ d ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	17	Always obey the laws that the Lord has given you 18-19 and live in a way that pleases him . Then you will be able to go in and take this good land from your enemies , just as he promised your ancestors .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	20	Someday your children will ask , “ Why did the Lord give us these laws and teachings ? ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	21	Then you will answer : We were slaves of the king of Egypt , but the Lord used his great power and set us free .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	22	We saw him perform miracles and make horrible things happen to the king , his officials , and everyone else .
CEV	Deuteronomy	6	23	The Lord rescued us from Egypt , so he could bring us into this land , as he had promised our ancestors . 24-25 That 's why the Lord our God demands that we obey his laws and worship him with fear and trembling . And if we do , he will protect us and help us be successful . Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	7	7	You were the weakest of all nations ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	2	the Lord will force them out of the land . Then you must destroy them without mercy . Do n't make any peace treaties with them ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	3	and do n't let your sons and daughters marry any of them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	4	If you do , those people will lead your descendants to worship other gods and to turn their backs on the Lord . That will make him very angry , and he will quickly destroy Israel .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	5	( B ) So when you conquer these nations , tear down the altars where they worship their gods . Break up their sacred stones , cut down the poles that they use in worshiping the goddess Asherah , and throw their idols in the fire . The Lord 's Chosen People Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	6	( C ) Israel , you are the chosen people of the Lord your God . There are many nations on this earth , but he chose only Israel to be his very own .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	8	but the Lord chose you because he loves you and because he had made a promise to your ancestors . Then with his mighty arm , he rescued you from the king of Egypt , who had made you his slaves .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	9	( D ) You know that the Lord your God is the only true God . So love him and obey his commands , and he will faithfully keep his agreement with you and your descendants for a thousand generations .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	10	But if you turn against the Lord , he will quickly destroy you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	11	So be sure to obey his laws and teachings I am giving you today . The Lord Will Bless You if You Obey ( Deuteronomy 28.1-14 ; Leviticus 26.3-13 ) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	12	( E ) If you completely obey these laws , the Lord your God will be loyal and keep the agreement he made with you , just as he promised our ancestors .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	13	The Lord will love you and bless you by giving you many children and plenty of food , wine , and olive oil . Your herds of cattle will have many calves , and your flocks of sheep will have many lambs .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	14	God will bless you more than any other nation—your families will grow and your livestock increase .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	15	You will no longer suffer with the same horrible diseases that you sometimes had in Egypt . You will be healthy , but the Lord will make your enemies suffer from those diseases . Destroy the Nations and Their Gods Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	16	When the Lord helps you defeat your enemies , you must destroy them without pity ! And do n't get trapped into worshiping their gods .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	17	You may be thinking , “ How can we destroy these nations ? They are more powerful than we are. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	18	But stop worrying ! Just remember what the Lord your God did to Egypt and its king .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	19	You saw how the Lord used his tremendous power to work great miracles and bring you out of Egypt . And he will again work miracles for you when you face these enemies you fear so much .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	20	Some of them may try to survive by hiding from you , but the Lord will make them panic , and soon they will be dead . [ a ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	21	So do n't be frightened when you meet them in battle . The Lord your God is great and fearsome , and he will fight at your side .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	22	As you attack these nations , the Lord will force them out little by little . He wo n't let you get rid of them all at once—if he did , there would n't be enough people living in the land to keep down the number of wild animals . 23-24 But when you attack your enemies , the Lord will make them panic , and you will easily destroy them . You will defeat their kings one after another until they are gone , and no one will remember they ever lived .
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	25	After you conquer a nation , burn their idols . Do n't get trapped into wanting the silver or gold on an idol . Even the metal on an idol is disgusting to the Lord ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	7	26	so destroy it . If you bring it home with you , both you and your house will be destroyed . Stay away from those disgusting idols ! Footnotes - 7.20 make them … dead : Or “ send hornets to kill them. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	8	8	Israel , do you want to go into the land the Lord promised your ancestors ? Do you want to capture it , live there , and become a powerful nation ? Then be sure to obey every command I am giving you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	2	Do n't forget how the Lord your God has led you through the desert for the past
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	40	years , your clothing has n't worn out , and your feet have n't swollen .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	3	( A ) so he made you go hungry . Then he gave you manna , [ a ] a kind of food that you and your ancestors had never even heard about . The Lord was teaching you that people need more than food to live—they need every word that the Lord has spoken .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	4	Over the past
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	5	( B ) So keep in mind that the Lord has been correcting you , just as parents correct their children .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	6	Obey the commands the Lord your God has given you and worship him with fear and trembling .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	7	The Lord your God is bringing you into a good land with streams that flow from springs in the valleys and hills . 8-9 You can dig for copper in those hills , and the stones are made of iron ore. And you wo n't go hungry . Wheat and barley fields are everywhere , and so are vineyards and orchards full of fig , pomegranate , [ b ] and olive trees , and there is plenty of honey . Do n't Forget the Lord Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	10	After you eat and are full , give praise to the Lord your God for the good land he gave you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	11	( C ) Make sure that you never forget the Lord or disobey his laws and teachings that I am giving you today . If you always obey them ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	12	you will have plenty to eat , and you will build good houses to live in .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	13	You will get more and more cattle , sheep , silver , gold , and other possessions .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	14	But when all this happens , do n't be proud ! Do n't forget that you were once slaves in Egypt and that it was the Lord who set you free .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	15	Remember how he led you in that huge and frightening desert where poisonous snakes and scorpions live . There was no water , but the Lord split open a rock , and water poured out so you could drink .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	16	He also gave you manna , [ c ] a kind of food your ancestors had never even heard about . The Lord was testing you to make you trust him , so that later on he could be good to you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	17	When you become successful , do n't say , “ I 'm rich , and I 've earned it all myself. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	8	18	Instead , remember that the Lord your God gives you the strength to make a living . That 's how he keeps the promise he made to your ancestors . 19-20 But I 'm warning you—if you forget the Lord your God and worship other gods , the Lord will destroy you , just as he destroyed the nations you fought .

CEV	Deuteronomy	9	9	Israel , listen to me ! You will soon cross the Jordan River and go into the land to force out the nations that live there . They are more powerful than you are , and the walls around their cities reach to the sky .
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	2	Some of these nations are descendants of the Anakim . [ a ] You know how tall and strong they are , and you 've heard that no one can defeat them in battle .
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	3	But the Lord your God has promised to go ahead of you , like a raging fire burning everything in its path . So when you attack your enemies , it will be easy for you to destroy them and take their land . 4-6 After the Lord helps you wipe out these nations and conquer their land , do n't think he did it because you are such good people . You are n't good—you are stubborn ! No , the Lord is going to help you , because the nations that live there are evil , and because he wants to keep the promise he made to your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . When Israel Made an Idol ( Exodus
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	32	) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	7	Do n't ever forget how you kept rebelling and making the Lord angry the whole time you were in the desert . You rebelled from the day you left Egypt until the day you arrived here .
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	8	At Mount Sinai [ b ] you made the Lord so angry that he was going to destroy you . 9-11 ( A ) It happened during those
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	40	days and nights
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	12	he said : Moses , hurry down the mountain to those people you led out of Egypt . They have already disobeyed me and committed the terrible sin of making an idol .

CEV	Deuteronomy	9	15	Fire was raging on the mountaintop as I went back down , carrying the two stones with the commandments on them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	16	I saw how quickly you had sinned and disobeyed the Lord your God . There you were , worshiping the metal idol you had made in the shape of a calf .
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	17	So I threw down the two stones and smashed them before your very eyes . 18-20 I bowed down at the place of worship and prayed to the Lord , without eating or drinking for
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	21	It was a sin for you to make that idol , so I threw it into the fire to melt it down . Then I took the lump of gold , ground it into powder , and threw the powder into the stream flowing down the mountain .
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	22	( B ) You also made the Lord angry when you were staying at Taberah , [ e ] at Massah , [ f ] and at Kibroth-Hattaavah . [ g ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	23	( C ) Then at Kadesh-Barnea the Lord said , “ I am giving you the land , so go ahead and take it ! ” But since you did n't trust the Lord , you rebelled and disobeyed his command . [ h ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	24	In fact , you 've rebelled against the Lord for as long as he has [ i ] known you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	25	After you had made the idol in the shape of a calf , the Lord said he was going to destroy you . So I lay face down in front of the Lord for
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	26	and prayed : Our Lord , please do n't wipe out your people . You used your great power to rescue them from Egypt and to make them your very own .
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	27	Israel 's ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob obeyed you faithfully . Think about them , and not about Israel 's stubbornness , evil , and sin .
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	28	If you destroy your people , the Egyptians will say , “ The Lord promised to give Israel land , but he was n't powerful enough to keep his promise . In fact , he hated them so much that he took them into the desert and killed them. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	9	29	But you , our Lord , chose the people of Israel to be your own , and with your mighty power you rescued them from Egypt .

CEV	Deuteronomy	10	10	( C ) When I had taken the second set of stones up the mountain , I spent
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	2	He told me that he would write on the new stones the same words he had written on the ones I broke , and that I could put these stones in this sacred chest .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	3	So I made a chest out of acacia wood , and I chiseled two flat stones like the ones I broke . Then I carried the stones up the mountain ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	4	where the Lord wrote the Ten Commandments on them , just as he had done the first time . The commandments were exactly what he had announced from the fire , when you were gathered at the mountain . After the Lord returned the stones to me ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	5	I took them down the mountainside and put them in the chest , just as he had commanded . And they are still there . Aaron Died ( Numbers 20.22-29 ) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	6	( A ) Later we set up camp at the wells belonging to the descendants of Jaakan . [ a ] Then we moved on and camped at Moserah , where Aaron died and was buried , and his son Eleazar became the priest .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	7	Next , we camped at Gudgodah and then at Jotbathah , where there are flowing streams . The Levites Were Appointed To Carry the Chest Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	8	( B ) After I put the two stones in the sacred chest , [ b ] the Lord chose the tribe of Levi , not only to carry the chest , but also to serve as his priests at the place of worship and to bless the other tribes in his name . And they still do these things .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	9	The Lord promised that he would always provide for the tribe of Levi , and that 's why he wo n't give them any land , when he divides it among the other tribes . The Lord Answered the Prayers of Moses ( Exodus 34.9,10,27-29 ) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	40	days and nights there , just as I had done before . Once again , the Lord answered my prayer and did not destroy you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	11	Instead , he told me , “ Moses , get ready to lead the people into the land that I promised their ancestors. ” [ c ] What the Lord Wants Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	12	People of Israel , what does the Lord your God want from you ? The Lord wants you to respect and follow him , to love and serve him with all your heart and soul ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	13	and to obey his laws and teachings that I am giving you today . Do this , and all will go well for you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	14	Everything belongs to the Lord your God , not only the earth and everything on it , but also the sky and the highest heavens .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	15	Yet the Lord loved your ancestors and wanted them to belong to him . So he chose them and their descendants rather than any other nation , and today you are still his people .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	16	Remember your agreement with the Lord and stop being so stubborn .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	17	( D ) The Lord your God is more powerful than all other gods and lords , and his tremendous power is to be feared . His decisions are always fair , and you can not bribe him to change his mind .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	18	( E ) The Lord defends the rights of orphans and widows . He cares for foreigners and gives them food and clothing .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	19	And you should also care for them , because you were foreigners in Egypt .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	20	Respect the Lord your God , be faithful , and serve only him , making promises in his name .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	21	Offer your praises to him , because you have seen him work such terrifying miracles for you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	22	( F ) When your ancestors went to live in Egypt , there were only
CEV	Deuteronomy	10	70	of them . But the Lord has blessed you , and now there are more of you than there are stars in the sky . Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	11	10	It 's better land than you had in Egypt , where you had to struggle just to water your crops . [ c ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	12	because the Lord your God keeps his eye on this land and takes care of it all year long .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	13	( D ) The Lord your God commands you to love him and to serve him with all your heart and soul . If you obey him , 14-15 he will send rain at the right seasons , [ e ] so you will have more than enough food , wine , and olive oil , and there will be plenty of grass for your cattle .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	16	But watch out ! You will be tempted to turn your backs on the Lord . And if you worship other gods ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	17	the Lord will become angry and keep the rain from falling . Nothing will grow in your fields , and you will die and disappear from the good land that the Lord is giving you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	18	( E ) Memorize these laws and think about them . Write down copies and tie them to your wrists and your foreheads to help you obey them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	19	Teach them to your children . Talk about them all the time—whether you 're at home or walking along the road or going to bed at night , or getting up in the morning .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	20	Write them on the door frames of your homes and on your town gates .

CEV	Deuteronomy	11	22	Love the Lord your God faithfully and obey all the laws and teachings I 'm giving you today . If you live the way the Lord wants ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	23	he will help you take the land . And even though the nations there are more powerful than you , the Lord will force them to leave when you attack .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	24	( F ) You will capture the land everywhere you go , from the Southern Desert to the Lebanon Mountains , and from the Euphrates River west to the Mediterranean Sea .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	25	No one will be able to stand up to you . The Lord will make everyone terrified of you , just as he promised .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	26	You have a choice—do you want the Lord to bless you , or do you want him to put a curse on you ?
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	27	Today I am giving you his laws , and if you obey him , he will bless you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	28	But if you disobey him and worship those gods that have never done anything for you , the Lord will put a curse on you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	29	( G ) After the Lord your God helps you take the land , you must have a ceremony where you announce his blessings from Mount Gerizim and his curses from Mount Ebal .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	30	You know that these two mountains are west of the Jordan River in land now controlled by the Canaanites living in the Jordan River valley . The mountains are west of the road near the sacred trees of Moreh on the other side of Gilgal .
CEV	Deuteronomy	11	31	Soon you will cross the Jordan River to conquer the land that the Lord your God is giving you . And when you have settled there ,

CEV	Deuteronomy	12	12	Now I 'll tell you the laws and teachings that you have to obey as long as you live . Your ancestors worshiped the Lord , and he is giving you this land .
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	2	But the nations that live there worship other gods . So after you capture the land , you must completely destroy their places of worship—on mountains and hills or in the shade of large trees .
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	3	( A ) Wherever these nations worship their gods , you must tear down their altars , break their sacred stones , burn the sacred poles [ a ] used in worshiping the goddess Asherah , and smash their idols to pieces . Destroy these places of worship so completely that no one will remember they were ever there .
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	4	Do n't worship the Lord your God in the way those nations worship their gods . 5-19 ( B ) Soon you will cross the Jordan , and the Lord will help you conquer your enemies and let you live in peace , there in the land he has given you . But after you are settled , life will be different . You must not offer sacrifices just anywhere you want to . Instead , the Lord will choose a place somewhere in Israel where you must go to worship him . All of your sacrifices and offerings must be taken there , including sacrifices to please the Lord [ b ] and any gift you promise or voluntarily give him . That 's where you must also take one tenth of your grain , wine , and olive oil , [ c ] as well as the first-born of your cattle , sheep , and goats . [ d ] You and your family and servants will eat your gifts and sacrifices [ e ] and celebrate there at the place of worship , because the Lord your God has made you successful in everything you have done . And since Levites will not have any land of their own , you must ask some of them to come along and celebrate with you . Sometimes you may want to kill an animal for food and not as a sacrifice . If the Lord has blessed you and given you enough cows or sheep or goats , then you can butcher one of them where you live . You can eat it just like the meat from a deer or gazelle that you kill when you go hunting . And even those people who are unclean and unfit for worship can have some of the meat . But you must not eat the blood of any animal—let the blood drain out on the ground . 20-21 The Lord has promised that later on he will give Israel more land , and some of you may not be able to travel all the way from your homes to the place of worship each time you are hungry for meat . [ f ] But the Lord will give you cattle , sheep , and goats , and you can butcher any of those animals at home and eat as much as you want .
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	22	It is the same as eating the meat from a deer or a gazelle that you kill when you go hunting . And in this way , anyone who is unclean and unfit for worship can have some of the meat . [ g ] 23-24 ( C ) But do n't eat the blood . It is the life of the animal , so let it drain out on the ground before you eat the meat .
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	25	Do you want the Lord to make you successful ? Do you want your children to be successful even after you are gone ? Then do what pleases the Lord and do n't eat blood . 26-27 All sacrifices and offerings to the Lord must be taken to the place where he chooses to be worshiped . If you offer a sacrifice to please the Lord , all of its meat must be burned on the altar . You can eat the meat from certain kinds of sacrifices , but you must always pour out the animal 's blood on the altar .
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	28	If you obey these laws , you will be doing what the Lord your God says is right and good . Then he will help you and your descendants be successful . Worship the Lord in the Right Way Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	29	Israel , as you go into the land and attack the nations that are there , the Lord will get rid of them , and you can have their land .
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	30	But that 's when you must be especially careful not to ask , “ How did those nations worship their gods ? Should n't we worship the Lord in the same way ? ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	31	No , you should not ! The Lord hates the disgusting way those nations worship their gods , because they even burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices .
CEV	Deuteronomy	12	32	( D ) Obey all the laws and teachings I am giving you . Do n't add any , and do n't take any away . Footnotes - 12.3 sacred poles : Or “ trees , ” used as symbols of Asherah , the goddess of fertility . - 12.5-19 sacrifices to please the Lord : These sacrifices have traditionally been called “ whole burnt offerings ” because the whole animal was burned on the altar . A main purpose of such sacrifices was to please the Lord with the smell of the sacrifice , and so in the CEV they are often called “ sacrifices to please the Lord. ” - 12.5-19 one tenth of your grain , wine , and olive oil : The Israelites had to give one tenth of their harvest of these products to the Lord each year ( see 14.22-29 ; 26.12,13 ; Leviticus 27.30-33 ) . - 12.5-19 the first-born of your cattle , sheep , and goats : The Israelites had to sacrifice these to the Lord ( see 15.19-22 ) . - 12.5-19 sacrifices : Some sacrifices were completely burned on the altar ; in other sacrifices , part of the animal was burned and part was given to the priests , but most of the meat was eaten by the worshipers as a sacred meal . - 12.20,21 meat : Usually eaten only on special occasions , such as during a sacred meal when sacrifices were offered to the Lord . - 12.22 anyone … the meat : Only those who were properly prepared for worship , or “ clean , ” could eat a sacred meal , but anyone could eat this kind of meat .

CEV	Deuteronomy	13	13	You may hear that some worthless people have talked everyone there into worshiping other gods , even though these gods had never done anything for them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	13	3	If the prophet says this , do n't listen ! The Lord your God will be watching to find out whether or not you love him with all your heart and soul .
CEV	Deuteronomy	13	4	You must be completely faithful to the Lord . Worship and obey only the Lord and do this with fear and trembling ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	13	5	because he rescued you from slavery in Egypt . If a prophet tells you to disobey the Lord your God and to stop worshiping him , then that prophet is evil and must be put to death . 6-10 ( A ) Someone else may say to you , “ Let 's worship other gods. ” That person may be your best friend , your brother or sister , your son or daughter , or your own dear wife or husband . But you must not listen to people who say such things . Instead , you must stone them to death . You must be the first to throw the stones , then others from the community will finish the job . Do n't show any pity . The gods worshiped by other nations have never done anything for you or your ancestors . People who ask you to worship other gods are trying to get you to stop worshiping the Lord , who rescued you from slavery in Egypt . So put to death anyone who asks you to worship another god .
CEV	Deuteronomy	13	11	And when the rest of Israel hears about it , they will be afraid , and no one else will ever do such an evil thing again .
CEV	Deuteronomy	13	12	After the Lord your God gives you towns to live in , you may hear a rumor about one of the towns .
CEV	Deuteronomy	13	14	You must carefully find out if the rumor is true . Then if the people of that town have actually done such a disgusting thing in your own country ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	13	15	you must take your swords and kill every one of them , and their livestock too . 16-17 Gather all the possessions of the people who lived there , and pile them up in the marketplace , without keeping anything for yourself . Set the pile and the whole town on fire , and do n't ever rebuild the town . The whole town will be a sacrifice to the Lord your God . Then he wo n't be angry anymore , and he will have mercy on you and make your nation stronger , just as he promised your ancestors .
CEV	Deuteronomy	13	18	That 's why you must do what the Lord your God says is right . I am giving you his laws and teachings today , and you must obey them . Footnotes - 13.1,2 a prophet : Hebrew adds “ or a dreamer of dreams , ” another name for a prophet . Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	14	14	( A ) People of Israel , you are the Lord 's children , so when you mourn for the dead , you must not cut yourselves or shave your forehead . [ a ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	2	( B ) Out of all the nations on this earth , the Lord your God chose you to be his own . You belong to the Lord , so do n't behave like those who worship other gods . Animals That Can Be Eaten ( Leviticus 11.1-47 )
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	3	( C ) Do n't eat any disgusting animals . 4-5 You may eat the meat of cattle , sheep , and goats ; wild sheep and goats ; and gazelles , antelopes , and all kinds of deer .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	6	It is all right to eat meat from any animals that have divided hoofs and also chew the cud . [ b ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	7	But do n't eat camels , rabbits , and rock badgers . These animals chew the cud but do not have divided hoofs . You must treat them as unclean .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	8	And do n't eat pork , since pigs have divided hoofs , but they do not chew their cud . Do n't even touch a dead pig !
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	9	You can eat any fish that has fins and scales . But there are other creatures that live in the water ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	10	and if they do not have fins and scales , you must not eat them . Treat them as unclean .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	11	You can eat any clean bird . 12-18 But do n't eat the meat of any of the following birds : eagles , vultures , falcons , kites , ravens , ostriches , owls , sea gulls , hawks , pelicans , ospreys , cormorants , storks , herons , and hoopoes . [ c ] You must not eat bats .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	19	Swarming insects are unclean , so do n't eat them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	20	However , you are allowed to eat certain kinds of winged insects . [ d ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	21	( D ) You belong to the Lord your God , so if you happen to find a dead animal , do n't eat its meat . You may give it to foreigners who live in your town or sell it to foreigners who are visiting your town . Do n't boil a young goat in its mother 's milk . Give the Lord Ten Percent of Your Harvest Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	22	( E ) People of Israel , every year you must set aside ten percent of your grain harvest .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	23	Also set aside ten percent of your wine and olive oil , and the first-born of every cow , sheep , and goat . Take these to the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped , and eat them there . This will teach you to always respect the Lord your God .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	24	But suppose you ca n't carry that ten percent of your harvest to the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped . If you live too far away , or if the Lord gives you a big harvest ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	25	then sell this part and take the money there instead .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	26	When you and your family arrive , spend the money on food for a big celebration . Buy cattle , sheep , goats , wine , beer , and if there are any other kinds of food that you want , buy those too .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	27	And since people of the Levi tribe wo n't own any land for growing crops , remember to ask the Levites to celebrate with you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	28	Every third year , instead of using the ten percent of your harvest for a big celebration , bring it into town and put it in a community storehouse .
CEV	Deuteronomy	14	29	The Levites have no land of their own , so you must give them food from the storehouse . You must also give food to the poor who live in your town , including orphans , widows , and foreigners . If they have enough to eat , then the Lord your God will be pleased and make you successful in everything you do . Footnotes - 14.1 when you mourn … forehead : Or “ you must not worship Baal , cutting yourselves and shaving your forehead. ” - 14.6 chew the cud : Some animals that eat grass and leaves have more than one stomach , and they chew their food a second time , after it has been partly digested in the first stomach .

CEV	Deuteronomy	15	15	I am commanding you to obey the Lord as a reminder that you were slaves in Egypt before he set you free .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	3	This law applies only to loans you have made to other Israelites . Foreigners will still have to pay back what you have loaned them . 4-6 No one in Israel should ever be poor . The Lord your God is giving you this land , and he has promised to make you very successful , if you obey his laws and teachings that I 'm giving you today . You will lend money to many nations , but you wo n't have to borrow . You will rule many nations , but they wo n't rule you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	7	( A ) After the Lord your God gives land to each of you , there may be poor Israelites in the town where you live . If there are , then do n't be mean and selfish with your money .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	8	Instead , be kind and lend them what they need .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	9	Be careful ! Do n't say to yourself , “ Soon it will be the seventh year , and then I wo n't be able to get my money back. ” It would be horrible for you to think that way and to be so selfish that you refuse to help the poor . They are your relatives , and if you do n't help them , they may ask the Lord to decide whether you have done wrong . And he will say that you are guilty .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	10	You should be happy to give the poor what they need , because then the Lord will make you successful in everything you do .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	11	( B ) There will always be some Israelites who are poor and needy . That 's why I am commanding you to be generous with them . Setting Slaves Free ( Exodus 21.1-11 ) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	12	( C ) If any of you buy Israelites as slaves , you must set them free after six years .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	13	And do n't just tell them they are free to leave—
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	14	give them sheep and goats and a good supply of grain and wine . The more the Lord has given you , the more you should give them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	16	But one of your slaves may say , “ I love you and your family , and I would be better off staying with you , so please do n't make me leave. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	17	Take the slave to the door of your house and push a sharp metal rod through one earlobe and into the door . Such slaves will belong to you for life , whether they are men or women .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	18	Do n't complain when you have to set a slave free . After all , you got six years of service at half the cost of hiring someone to do the work . [ b ] First-Born Animals ( Leviticus 27.26,27 ; Numbers 18.15-18 ) Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	19	( D ) If the first-born animal of a cow or sheep or goat is a male , it must be given to the Lord . Do n't put first-born cattle to work or cut wool from first-born sheep .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	20	Instead , each year you must take the first-born of these animals to the place where the Lord your God chooses to be worshiped . You and your family will sacrifice them to the Lord and then eat them as part of a sacred meal .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	21	But if the animal is lame or blind or has something else wrong with it , you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	22	You can butcher it where you live , and eat it just like the meat of a deer or gazelle that you kill while hunting . Even those people who are unclean and unfit for worship can have some .
CEV	Deuteronomy	15	23	( E ) But you must never eat the blood of an animal—let it drain out on the ground . Footnotes - 15.1,2 The Lord says … no longer ask for payment : Or “ ‘ The Lord says loans do not need to be paid back this year. ’ Then if you have loaned money to another Israelite , you can not ask for payment until the next year. ” - 15.18 six years … work : Or “ six years of service , and it cost you no more than if you had hired someone to do the work ” ; or “ six years of service , for what you would have had to pay a worker for two years. ” Copyright ©

But do n't serve bread made with yeast at the Passover meal . Serve the same kind of thin bread that you ate when you were slaves suffering in Egypt [ b ] and when you had to leave Egypt quickly . As long as you live , this thin bread will remind you of the day you left Egypt . For seven days following Passover , [ c ] do n't make any bread with yeast .

CEV	Deuteronomy	16	5	Do n't offer the Passover sacrifice in just any town where you happen to live .

CEV	Deuteronomy	16	9	( B ) Seven weeks after you start your grain harvest , 10-11 go to the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped and celebrate the Harvest Festival [ e ] in honor of the Lord your God . Bring him an offering as large as you can afford , depending on how big a harvest he has given you . Be sure to take along your sons and daughters and all your servants . Also invite the poor , including Levites , foreigners , orphans , and widows .
CEV	Deuteronomy	16	12	Remember that you used to be slaves in Egypt , so obey these laws . The Festival of Shelters ( Leviticus 23.33-43 ; Numbers 29.12-38 ) Moses said to Israel : 13-15 ( C ) After you have finished the grain harvest and the grape harvest , [ f ] take your sons and daughters and all your servants to the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped . Celebrate the Festival of Shelters for seven days . Also invite the poor , including Levites , foreigners , orphans , and widows . The Lord will give you big harvests and make you successful in everything you do . You will be completely happy , so celebrate this festival in honor of the Lord your God . Three Festivals at the Place of Worship ( Exodus 23.14-17 ) Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	16	17	The bigger the harvest the Lord gives you , the bigger your gift should be . Treat Everyone with Justice Moses said to Israel : 18-19 ( D ) After you are settled in the towns that you will receive from the Lord your God , the people in each town must appoint judges and other officers . Those of you that become judges must be completely fair when you make legal decisions , even if someone important is involved . Do n't take bribes to give unfair decisions . Bribes keep people who are wise from seeing the truth and turn honest people into liars . [ h ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	16	20	People of Israel , if you want to enjoy a long and successful life , make sure that everyone is treated with justice in the land the Lord is giving you . Do n't Set Up Sacred Poles or Stones Moses said to Israel :

CEV	Deuteronomy	17	17	( E ) And the king must not have a lot of wives—they might tempt him to be unfaithful to the Lord . [ c ] Finally , the king must not try to get huge amounts of silver and gold .
CEV	Deuteronomy	17	4	So when you hear that someone in your town is committing this disgusting sin , you must carefully find out if that person really is guilty . 5-7 ( B ) But you will need two or three witnesses—one witness is n't enough to prove a person guilty . Get rid of those who are guilty of such evil . Take them outside your town gates and everyone must stone them to death . But the witnesses must be the first to throw stones . Difficult Cases Moses said to Israel : 8-12 It may be difficult to find out the truth in some legal cases in your town . You may not be able to decide if someone was killed accidentally or murdered . Or you may not be able to tell whether an injury or some property damage was done by accident or on purpose . If the case is too difficult , take it to the court at the place where the Lord your God chooses to be worshiped . This court will be made up of one judge and several priests [ b ] who serve at the Lord 's altar . They will explain the law to you and give you their decision about the case . Do exactly what they tell you , or you will be put to death .
CEV	Deuteronomy	17	13	When other Israelites hear about it , they will be afraid and obey the decisions of the court . The King Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	17	14	( C ) People of Israel , after you capture the land the Lord your God is giving you , and after you settle on it , you will say , “ We want a king , just like the nations around us. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	17	15	Go ahead and appoint a king , but make sure that he is an Israelite and that he is the one the Lord has chosen .
CEV	Deuteronomy	17	16	( D ) The king should not have many horses , especially those from Egypt . The Lord has said never to go back there again .
CEV	Deuteronomy	17	18	The official copy of God 's laws [ d ] will be kept by the priests of the Levi tribe . So , as soon as anyone becomes king , he must go to the priests and write out a copy of these laws while they watch .

CEV	Deuteronomy	18	4	In addition , they will receive the first part of your grain harvest and part of your first batches of wine and olive oil . [ b ] You must also give them the first wool that is cut from your sheep each year .
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	5	Give these gifts to the priests , because the Lord has chosen them and their descendants out of all the tribes of Israel to be his special servants at the place of worship .
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	6	Any Levite can leave his hometown , and go to the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	7	and then be a special servant of the Lord [ c ] there , just like all the other Levites .
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	8	Some Levites may have money from selling family possessions , and others may not . But all Levites serving at the place of worship will receive the same amount of food from the sacrifices and gifts brought by the people . Do n't Do Disgusting Things Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	9	Soon you will go into the land that the Lord your God is giving you . The nations that live there do things that are disgusting to the Lord , and you must not follow their example . 10-11 ( B ) Do n't sacrifice your son or daughter . And do n't try to use any kind of magic or witchcraft to tell fortunes [ d ] or to cast spells or to talk with spirits of the dead .
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	12	The Lord is disgusted with anyone who does these things , and that 's why he will help you destroy the nations that are in the land .
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	13	( C ) Never be guilty of doing any of these disgusting things ! A Prophet like Moses Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	14	You will go in and take the land from nations that practice magic and witchcraft . But the Lord your God wo n't allow you to do those things .
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	15	( D ) Instead , he will choose one of your own people to be a prophet just like me , and you must do what that prophet says .
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	16	You were asking for a prophet the day you were gathered at Mount Sinai [ e ] and said to the Lord , “ Please do n't let us hear your voice or see this terrible fire again—if we do , we will die ! ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	17	Then the Lord told me : Moses , they have said the right thing .
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	19	( E ) Since the message comes from me , anyone who does n't obey the message will have to answer to me .
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	20	But if I have n't spoken , and a prophet claims to have a message from me , you must kill that prophet , and you must also kill any prophet who claims to have a message from another god . Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	21	You may be asking yourselves , “ How can we tell if a prophet 's message really comes from the Lord ? ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	18	22	You will know , because if the Lord says something will happen , it will happen . And if it does n't , you will know that the prophet was falsely claiming to speak for the Lord . Do n't be afraid of any prophet whose message does n't come from the Lord .

CEV	Deuteronomy	19	19	( A ) Soon you will go into the land and attack the nations . The Lord your God will destroy them and give you their lands , towns , and homes . Then after you are settled , 2-4 you must choose three of your towns to be Safe Towns . Divide the land into three regions with one Safe Town near the middle of each , so that a Safe Town can be easily reached from anywhere in your land . Then , if one of you accidentally kills someone , you can run to a Safe Town and find protection from being put to death . But you must not have been angry with the person you killed .
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	5	For example , suppose you and a friend go into the forest to cut wood . You are chopping down a tree with an ax , when the ax head slips off the handle , hits your friend , and kills him . You can run to one of the Safe Towns and save your life .
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	6	You do n't deserve to die , since you did not mean to harm your friend . But he did get killed , and his relatives might be very angry . They might even choose one of the men from their family to track you down and kill you . If it is too far to one of the Safe Towns , the victim 's relative might be able to catch you and kill you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	7	That 's why I said there must be three Safe Towns . 8-9 Israel , the Lord your God has promised that if you obey his laws and teachings I 'm giving you , and if you always love him , then he will give you the land he promised your ancestors . When that happens , you must name three more Safe Towns in the new territory .
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	10	You will need them , so innocent people wo n't be killed on your land while they are trying to reach a Safe Town that is too far away . You will be guilty of murder , if innocent people lose their lives because you did n't name enough Safe Towns in the land the Lord your God will give you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	11	But what if you really do commit murder ? Suppose one of you hates a neighbor . So you wait in a deserted place , kill the neighbor , and run to a Safe Town .
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	12	If that happens , the leaders of your town must send messengers to bring you back from the Safe Town . They will hand you over to one of the victim 's relatives , who will put you to death .
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	13	Israel , for the good of the whole country , you must kill anyone who murders an innocent person . Never show mercy to a murderer ! Property Lines Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	14	( B ) In the land the Lord is giving you , there are already stones set up to mark the property lines between fields . So do n't move those stones . Witnesses Must Tell the Truth Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	15	( C ) Before you are convicted of a crime , at least two witnesses must be able to testify that you did it .
CEV	Deuteronomy	19	16	If you accuse someone of a crime , but seem to be lying , 17-18 then both you and the accused must be taken to the court at the place where the Lord is worshiped . There the priests and judges will find out if you are lying or telling the truth . If you are lying and the accused is innocent , 19-21 ( D ) then you will be punished without mercy . You will receive the same punishment the accused would have received if found guilty , whether it means losing an eye , a tooth , a hand , a foot , or even your life . Israel , the crime of telling lies in court must be punished . And when people hear what happens to witnesses that lie , everyone else who testifies in court will tell the truth . Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	20	2	Before you march into battle , a priest will go to the front of the army
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	3	and say , “ Soldiers of Israel , listen to me ! Today when you go into battle , do n't be afraid of the enemy , and when you see them , do n't panic .
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	4	The Lord your God will fight alongside you and help you win the battle. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	5	Then the tribal officials will say to the troops : If any of you have built a new house , but have n't yet moved in , you may go home . It is n't right for you to die in battle and for somebody else to live in your new house .
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	6	If any of you have planted a vineyard but have n't had your first grape harvest , you may go home . It is n't right for you to die in battle and for somebody else to enjoy your grapes .
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	7	If any of you are engaged to be married , you may go back home and get married . It is n't right for you to die in battle and for somebody else to marry the woman you are engaged to .
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	8	Finally , if any of you are afraid , you may go home . We do n't want you to discourage the other soldiers .
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	9	When the officials are finished giving these orders , they will appoint officers to be in command of the army . 10-15 Before you attack a town that is far from your land , offer peace to the people who live there . If they surrender and open their town gates , they will become your slaves . But if they reject your offer of peace and try to fight , surround their town and attack . Then , after the Lord helps you capture it , kill all the men . Take the women and children as slaves and keep the livestock and everything else of value .
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	16	Whenever you capture towns in the land the Lord your God is giving you , be sure to kill all the people and animals .
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	17	He has commanded you to completely wipe out the Hittites , the Amorites , the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	18	If you allow them to live , they will persuade you to worship their disgusting gods , and you will be unfaithful to the Lord .
CEV	Deuteronomy	20	19	When you are attacking a town , do n't chop down its fruit trees , not even if you have had the town surrounded for a long time . Fruit trees are n't your enemies , and they produce food that you can eat , so do n't cut them down .

CEV	Deuteronomy	21	2	The judges and other leaders from the towns around there must find out what town is the closest to where the body was found .
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	3	The leaders from that town will go to their cattle herds and choose a young cow that has never been put to work . [ a ] 4-5 They and some of the priests will take this cow to a nearby valley where there is a stream , but no crops . Once they reach the valley , the leaders will break the cow 's neck . The priests must be there , because the Lord your God has chosen them to be his special servants at the place of worship . The Lord has chosen them to bless the people in his name and to be judges in all legal cases , whether property or injury is involved .
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	6	The town leaders will wash their hands over the body of the dead cow
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	7	and say , “ We had no part in this murder , and we do n't know who did it . 8-9 But since an innocent person was murdered , we beg you , our Lord , to accept this sacrifice and forgive Israel . We are your people , and you rescued us . Please do n't hold this crime against us. ” If you obey the Lord and do these things , he will forgive Israel . Marrying a Woman Taken Prisoner in War Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	10	From time to time , you men will serve as soldiers and go off to war . The Lord your God will help you defeat your enemies , and you will take many prisoners . 11-13 One of these prisoners may be a beautiful woman , and you may want to marry her . But first you must bring her into your home , and have her shave her head , cut her nails , get rid of her foreign clothes , and start wearing Israelite clothes . She will mourn a month for her father and mother , then you can marry her .
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	14	Later on , if you are not happy with the woman , you can divorce her , and she can go free . But you have slept with her as your wife , so you can not sell her as a slave or make her into your own slave . Rights of a First-Born Son Moses said to Israel : 15-17 Suppose a man has two wives and loves one more than the other . The first son of either wife is the man 's first-born son , even if the boy 's mother is the wife the man does n't love . Later , when the man is near death and is dividing up his property , he must give a double share to his first-born son , simply because he was the first to be born . A Son Who Rebels Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	18	A father and a mother may have a stubborn and rebellious son who refuses to obey them even after he has been punished .
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	19	If a son is like that , his parents must drag him to the town gate , where the leaders of the town hold their meetings .
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	20	The parents will tell the leaders , “ This son of ours is stubborn and never obeys . He spends all his time drinking and partying. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	22	If a criminal is put to death , and you hang the dead body on a tree ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	21	23	( A ) you must not leave it there overnight . Bury it the same day , because the dead body of a criminal hanging on a tree will bring God 's curse on the land .

CEV	Deuteronomy	25	4	( B ) Do n't muzzle an ox while it is threshing grain . [ b ] A Son for a Dead Brother Moses said to Israel : 5-6 ( C ) Suppose two brothers are living on the same property , when one of them dies without having a son to carry on his name . If this happens , his widow must not marry anyone outside the family . Instead , she must marry her late husband 's brother , and their first son will be the legal son of the dead man .
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	7	( D ) But suppose the brother refuses to marry the widow . She must go to a meeting of the town leaders at the town gate and say , “ My husband died without having a son to carry on his name . And my husband 's brother refuses to marry me so I can have a son. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	8	The leaders will call the living brother to the town gate and try to persuade him to marry the widow . But if he does n't change his mind and marry her ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	9	she must go over to him while the town leaders watch . She will pull off one of his sandals and spit in his face , while saying , “ That 's what happens to a man who wo n't help provide descendants for his dead brother. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	10	From then on , that man 's family will be known as “ the family of the man whose sandal was pulled off. ” When Two Men Fight Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	11	If two men are fighting , and the wife of one man tries to rescue her husband by grabbing the other man 's private parts ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	12	you must cut off her hand . Do n't have any mercy . Be Honest in Business Moses said to Israel : 13-14 ( E ) Do n't try to cheat people by having two sets of weights or measures , one to get more when you are buying , and the other to give less when you are selling .
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	15	If you weigh and measure things honestly , the Lord your God will let you enjoy a long life in the land he is giving you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	16	But the Lord is disgusted with anyone who cheats or is dishonest . Wipe Out Amalek Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	17	( F ) People of Israel , do you remember what the Amalekites did to you after you came out of Egypt ?
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	18	You were tired , and they followed along behind , attacking those who could not keep up with the others . This showed that the Amalekites have no respect for God .
CEV	Deuteronomy	25	19	The Lord your God will help you capture the land , and he will give you peace . But when that day comes , you must wipe out Amalek so completely that no one will remember they ever lived . Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	26	26	The Lord is giving you the land , and soon you will conquer it , settle down ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	2	( A ) and plant crops . And when you begin harvesting each of your crops , the very first things you pick must be put in a basket . Take them to the place where the Lord your God chooses to be worshiped ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	3	and tell the priest , “ Long ago the Lord our God promised our ancestors that he would give us this land . And today , I thank him for keeping his promise and giving me a share of the land. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	4	The priest will take the basket and set it in front of the Lord 's altar .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	5	Then , standing there in front of the place of worship , you must pray : My ancestor was homeless , an Aramean who went to live in Egypt . There were only a few in his family then , but they became great and powerful , a nation of many people .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	6	The Egyptians were cruel and had no pity on us . They mistreated our people and forced us into slavery .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	7	We called out for help to you , the Lord God of our ancestors . You heard our cries ; you knew we were in trouble and abused .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	8	Then you terrified the Egyptians with your mighty miracles and rescued us from Egypt .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	9	You brought us here and gave us this land rich with milk and honey .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	10	Now , Lord , I bring to you the best of the crops that you have given me . After you say these things , place the basket in front of the Lord 's altar and bow down to worship him .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	11	Then you and your family must celebrate by eating a meal at the place of worship to thank the Lord your God for giving you such a good harvest . And remember to invite the Levites and the foreigners who live in your town . Ten Percent of the Harvest Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	12	( B ) Every year you are to give ten percent of your harvest to the Lord . [ a ] But every third year , [ b ] this ten percent must be given to the poor who live in your town , including Levites , foreigners , orphans , and widows . That way , they will have enough to eat .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	13	Then you must pray : Our Lord and our God , you have said that ten percent of my harvest is sacred . I have obeyed your command and given this to the poor , including the Levites , foreigners , orphans , and widows .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	14	I have not eaten any of this sacred food while I was in mourning ; in fact , I never touched it when I was unclean . [ c ] And none of it has been offered as a sacrifice to the spirits of the dead . I have done everything exactly as you commanded .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	15	Our Lord , look down from your temple in heaven and bless us and our land . You promised our ancestors that you would give us this land rich with milk and honey , and you have kept your promise . The Lord Is Your God , and You Are His People Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	16	Today the Lord your God has commanded you to obey these laws and teachings with all your heart and soul .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	17	In response , you have agreed that the Lord will be your God , that you will obey all his laws and teachings , and that you will listen when he speaks to you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	18	( C ) Since you have agreed to obey the Lord , he has agreed that you will be his people and that you will belong to him , just as he promised .
CEV	Deuteronomy	26	19	The Lord created all nations , but he will make you more famous than any of them , and you will receive more praise and honor . You will belong only to the Lord your God , just as he promised . Footnotes - 26.12 Every year … Lord : See 14.22-29 . - 26.12 every third year : Probably the third and sixth years of the seven-year cycle described in 15.1-11 and Leviticus 25.1-7 . - 26.14 in mourning … unclean : Touching a dead body made a person unclean and unfit to worship God . Ten percent of the harvest belonged to God , and was not to be touched by an unclean person . Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	27	27	Moses stood together with the leaders and told the people of Israel : Obey all the laws and teachings that I am giving you today . 2-4 ( A ) Soon you will enter the land that the Lord your God is giving to you . He is the God your ancestors worshiped , and he has promised that this land is rich with milk and honey . After you cross the Jordan River , go to Mount Ebal . Set up large slabs of stone , then cover them with white plaster and write on them a copy of these laws .
CEV	Deuteronomy	27	5	( B ) At this same place , build an altar for offering sacrifices to the Lord your God . But do n't use stones that have been cut with iron tools .
CEV	Deuteronomy	27	6	Look for stones that can be used without being cut . Then offer sacrifices to please the Lord , [ a ] burning them completely on the altar .
CEV	Deuteronomy	27	7	Next , offer sacrifices to ask the Lord 's blessing , [ b ] and serve the meat at a sacred meal where you will celebrate in honor of the Lord .
CEV	Deuteronomy	27	8	Do n't forget to write out a copy of these laws on the stone slabs that you are going to set up . Make sure that the writing is easy to read . Curses on Those Who Disobey
CEV	Deuteronomy	27	9	Moses stood together with the priests [ c ] and said , “ Israel , be quiet and listen to me ! Today you have become the people of the Lord your God . [ d ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	27	10	So you must obey his laws and teachings that I am giving you. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	27	11	That same day , Moses gave them the following instructions : 12-13 ( C ) After you cross the Jordan River , you will go to Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal . [ e ] The tribes of Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , Ephraim , Manasseh , [ f ] and Benjamin will go up on Mount Gerizim , where they will bless the people of Israel . The tribes of Reuben , Gad , Asher , Zebulun , Dan , and Naphtali will go up on Mount Ebal where they will agree to the curses . 14-26 ( D ) The people of the Levi tribe will speak each curse in a loud voice , then the rest of the people [ g ] will agree to that curse by saying , “ Amen ! ” Here are the curses : We ask the Lord to put a curse on anyone who makes an idol or worships idols , even secretly . The Lord is disgusted with idols . We ask the Lord to put a curse on all who do not show respect for their father and mother . We ask the Lord to put a curse on anyone who moves the rocks that mark property lines . We ask the Lord to put a curse on anyone who tells blind people to go the wrong way . We ask the Lord to put a curse on anyone who keeps the poor from getting justice , whether these poor are foreigners , widows , or orphans . We ask the Lord to put a curse on any man who sleeps with his father 's wife ; that man has shown no respect for his father 's marriage . We ask the Lord to put a curse on anyone who has sex with an animal . We ask the Lord to put a curse on any man who sleeps with his sister or his half sister or his mother-in-law . We ask the Lord to put a curse on anyone who commits murder , even when there are no witnesses to the crime . We ask the Lord to put a curse on anyone who accepts money to murder an innocent victim . We ask the Lord to put a curse on anyone who refuses to obey his laws . And so , to each of these curses , the people will answer , “ Amen ! ” Footnotes - 27.6 sacrifices to please the Lord : See the note at 12.5-19 . - 27.7 sacrifices to ask the Lord 's blessing : These sacrifices have traditionally been called “ peace offerings ” or “ offerings of well-being. ” A main purpose was to ask for the Lord 's blessing , and so in the CEV they are sometimes called “ sacrifices to ask the Lord 's blessing. ” - 27.9 priests : See the note at 17.8-12 . - 27.9 Today you have become the people of the Lord your God : As a result of the agreement that the Lord had made with them , recorded in 26.16-19 . - 27.12,13 Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal : These mountains were separated by a valley . - 27.12,13 Ephraim , Manasseh : The Hebrew text has “ Joseph ” ; the descendants of Joseph formed the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh . - 27.14-26 the rest of the people : Or “ all the people who are standing on Mount Ebal. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	28	36	The Lord will let you and your king be taken captive to a country that you and your ancestors have never even heard of , and there you will have to worship idols [ c ] made of wood and stone .

Disobedience Brings Destruction Moses said to Israel :

CEV	Deuteronomy	28	63	The Lord is happy to make you successful and to help your nation grow while you conquer the land . But if you disobey him , he will be just as happy to pull you up by your roots .
CEV	Deuteronomy	28	64	Those of you that survive will be scattered to every nation on earth , and you will have to worship stone and wood idols [ g ] that never helped you or your ancestors .

CEV	Deuteronomy	29	29	The Lord our God has n't explained the present or the future , but he has commanded us to obey the laws he gave to us and our descendants . Footnotes Copyright ©
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	40	years I , the Lord , led you through the desert , but your clothes and your sandals did n't wear out , and I gave you special food . [ b ] I did these things so you would realize that I am your God. ” But the Lord must give you a change of heart before you truly understand what you have seen and heard .
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	7	( A ) When we first camped here , King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan attacked , but we defeated them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	8	( B ) Then we captured their land and divided it among the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh . Keep the Agreement Moses said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	9	Israel , the Lord has made an agreement with you , and if you keep your part , you will be successful in everything you do . 10-12 Today everyone in our nation is standing here in the Lord 's presence , including leaders and officials , parents and children , and even those foreigners who cut wood and carry water for us . We are at this place of worship to promise that we will keep our part of the agreement with the Lord our God . 13-15 In this agreement , the Lord promised that you would be his people and that he would be your God . He first made this promise to your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and today the Lord is making this same promise to you . But it is n't just for you ; it is also for your descendants . 16-17 When we lived in Egypt , you saw the Egyptians worship disgusting idols of wood , stone , silver , and gold . Then as we traveled through other nations , you saw those people worship other disgusting idols .
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	18	( C ) So make sure that everyone in your tribe remains faithful to the Lord and never starts worshiping gods of other nations . If even one of you worships idols , you will be like the root of a plant that produces bitter , poisonous fruit .
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	19	You may be an Israelite and know all about the Lord 's agreement with us , but he wo n't bless you if you rebel against him . You may think you can get away with it , but you will cause the rest of Israel to be punished along with you . [ c ] 20-21 The Lord will be furious , and instead of forgiving you , he will separate you from the other tribes . Then he will destroy you , by piling on you all the curses in The Book of God 's Law , and you will be forgotten forever .
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	22	The Lord will strike your country with diseases and disasters . Your descendants and foreigners from distant countries will see that your land
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	23	( D ) has become a scorching desert of salt and sulfur , where nothing is planted , nothing sprouts , and nothing grows . It will be as lifeless as the land around the cities of Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , after the Lord became angry and destroyed them . [ d ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	24	People from other nations will ask , “ Why did the Lord destroy this country ? Why was he so furious ? ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	25	And they will be given this answer : Our ancestors worshiped the Lord , but after he brought them out of Egypt and made an agreement with them , they rejected the agreement
CEV	Deuteronomy	29	26	and decided to worship gods that had never helped them . The Lord had forbidden Israel to worship these gods , 27-28 and so he became furious and punished the land with all the curses in The Book of God 's Law . Then he pulled up Israel by the roots and tossed them into a foreign country , where they still are today .

CEV	Deuteronomy	30	30	( A ) I have told you everything the Lord your God will do for you , and I 've also told you the curses he will put on you if you reject him . He will scatter you in faraway countries , but when you realize that he is punishing you ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	2	return to him with all your heart and soul and start obeying the commands I have given to you today . 3-4 Then he will stop punishing you and treat you with kindness . He may have scattered you to the farthest countries on earth , but he will bring you back
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	5	to the land that had belonged to your ancestors and make you even more successful and powerful than they ever were .
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	6	You and your descendants are stubborn , but the Lord will make you willing to obey him and love him with all your heart and soul , and you will enjoy a long life .
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	7	Then the Lord your God will remove the curses from you and put them on those enemies who hate and attack you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	8	You will again obey the laws and teachings of the Lord ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	9	and he will bless you with many children , large herds and flocks , and abundant crops . The Lord will be happy to do good things for you , just as he did for your ancestors .
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	10	But you must decide once and for all to worship him with all your heart and soul and to obey everything in The Book of God 's Law . Choose Life , Not Death Moses said to Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	11	You know God 's laws , and it is n't impossible to obey them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	12	( B ) His commands are n't in heaven , so you ca n't excuse yourselves by saying , “ How can we obey the Lord 's commands ? They are in heaven , and no one can go up to get them , then bring them down and explain them to us. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	13	And you ca n't say , “ How can we obey the Lord 's commands ? They are across the sea , and someone must go across , then bring them back and explain them to us. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	14	No , these commands are nearby and you know them by heart . All you have to do is obey !
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	15	( C ) Today I am giving you a choice . You can choose life and success or death and disaster . 16-18 I am commanding you to be loyal to the Lord , to live the way he has told you , and to obey his laws and teachings . You are about to cross the Jordan River and take the land that he is giving you . If you obey him , you will live and become successful and powerful . On the other hand , you might choose to disobey the Lord and reject him . So I 'm warning you that if you bow down and worship other gods , you wo n't have long to live .
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	19	Now I call the sky and the earth to be witnesses that I am offering you this choice . Will you choose for the Lord to make you prosperous and give you a long life ? Or will he put you under a curse and kill you ? Choose life !
CEV	Deuteronomy	30	20	( D ) Be completely faithful to the Lord your God , love him , and do whatever he tells you . The Lord is the only one who can give life , and he will let you live a long time in the land that he promised to your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	31	31	Moses again spoke to the whole nation of Israel :
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	2	( A ) I am
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	120	years old , and I am no longer able to be your leader . And besides that , the Lord your God has told me that he wo n't let me cross the Jordan River . 3-5 ( B ) But he has promised that he and Joshua will lead you across the Jordan to attack the nations that live on the other side . The Lord will destroy those nations just as he destroyed Sihon and Og , those two Amorite kings . Just remember—whenever you capture a place , kill everyone who lives there .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be brave and strong ! Do n't be afraid of the nations on the other side of the Jordan . The Lord your God will always be at your side , and he will never abandon you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	7	Then Moses called Joshua up in front of the crowd and said : Joshua , be brave and strong as you lead these people into their land . The Lord made a promise long ago to Israel 's ancestors that this land would someday belong to Israel . That time has now come , and you must divide up the land among the people .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	8	( C ) The Lord will lead you into the land . He will always be with you and help you , so do n't ever be afraid of your enemies . Read These Laws
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	9	Moses wrote down all of these laws and teachings and gave them to the priests and the leaders of Israel . The priests were from the Levi tribe , and they carried the sacred chest that belonged to the Lord . 10-11 ( D ) Moses told these priests and leaders : Each year the Israelites must come together to celebrate the Festival of Shelters at the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped . You must read these laws and teachings to the people at the festival every seventh year , the year when loans do not need to be repaid . [ a ] 12-13 Everyone must come—men , women , children , and even the foreigners who live in your towns . And each new generation will listen and learn to worship the Lord their God with fear and trembling and to do exactly what is said in God 's Law . Israel Will Reject the Lord
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	14	The Lord told Moses , “ You will soon die , so bring Joshua to the sacred tent , and I will appoint him the leader of Israel. ” Moses and Joshua went to the sacred tent ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	15	and the Lord appeared in a thick cloud right over the entrance to the tent .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	16	The Lord said : Moses , you will soon die . But Israel is going into a land where other gods are worshiped , and Israel will reject me and start worshiping these gods . The people will break the agreement I made with them ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	17	and I will be so furious that I will abandon them and ignore their prayers . I will send disasters and suffering that will nearly wipe them out . Finally , they will realize that the disasters happened because I abandoned them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	18	They will pray to me , but I will ignore them because they were evil and started worshiping other gods .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	19	Moses and Joshua , I am going to give you the words to a new song . Write them down and teach the song to the Israelites . If they learn it , they will know what I want them to do , and so they will have no excuse for not obeying me .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	20	I am bringing them into the land that I promised their ancestors . It is a land rich with milk and honey , and the Israelites will have more than enough food to eat . But they will get fat and turn their backs on me and start worshiping other gods . The Israelites will reject me and break the agreement that I made with them .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	21	When I punish the Israelites and their descendants with suffering and disasters , I will remind them that they know the words to this song , so they have no excuse for not obeying me . I will give them the land that I promised , but I know the way they are going to live later on .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	22	Moses at once wrote down the words to the song , [ b ] and he taught it to the Israelites .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	23	( E ) The Lord told Joshua , “ Be brave and strong ! I will help you lead the people of Israel into the land that I have promised them. ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	24	Moses wrote down all these laws and teachings in a book ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	25	then he went to the Levites who carried the sacred chest and said :
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	26	This is The Book of God 's Law . Keep it beside the sacred chest that holds the agreement the Lord your God made with Israel . This book is proof that you know what the Lord wants you to do .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	27	I know how stubborn and rebellious you and the rest of the Israelites are . You have rebelled against the Lord while I have been alive , and it will only get worse after I am gone .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	28	So call together the leaders and officials of the tribes of Israel . I will bring this book and read every word of it to you , and I will call the sky and the earth as witnesses that all of you know what you are supposed to do .
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	29	I am going to die soon , and I know that in the future you will stop caring about what is right and what is wrong , and so you will disobey the Lord and stop living the way I told you to live . The Lord will be angry , and terrible things will happen to you . The Song of Moses
CEV	Deuteronomy	31	30	Moses called a meeting of all the people of Israel , so he could teach them the words to the song that the Lord had given him . And here are the words : Copyright ©

CEV	Deuteronomy	32	32	Our enemies are grapevines rooted in the fields of Sodom and Gomorrah . [ k ] The grapes they produce are full of bitter poison ;
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	2	Israel , I will teach you . My words will be like gentle rain on tender young plants , or like dew on the grass .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	3	Join with me in praising the wonderful name of the Lord our God .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	4	The Lord is a mighty rock , [ a ] and he never does wrong . God can always be trusted to bring justice .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	5	But you lie and cheat and are unfaithful to him . You have disgraced yourselves and are no longer worthy to be his children . [ b ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	6	Israel , the Lord is your Father , the one who created you , but you repaid him by being foolish .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	7	Think about past generations . Ask your parents or any of your elders . They will tell you
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	8	( A ) that God Most High gave land to every nation . He assigned a guardian angel to each of them , [ c ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	9	but the Lord himself takes care of Israel . [ d ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	10	Israel , the Lord discovered you in a barren desert filled with howling winds . God became your fortress , protecting you as though you were his own eyes .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	11	The Lord was like an eagle teaching its young to fly , always ready to swoop down and catch them on its back .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	12	Israel , the Lord led you , and without the aid of a foreign god ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	13	he helped you capture the land . Your fields were rich with grain . Olive trees grew in your stony soil , and honey was found among the rocks .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	14	Your flocks and herds produced milk and yogurt , and you got choice meat from your sheep and goats that grazed in Bashan . Your wheat was the finest , and you drank the best wine .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	15	Israel , [ e ] you grew fat and rebelled against God , your Creator you rejected the Mighty Rock , [ f ] your only place of safety .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	16	You made God jealous and angry by worshiping disgusting idols and foreign gods .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	17	( B ) You offered sacrifices to demons , those useless gods [ g ] that never helped you , new gods that your ancestors never worshiped .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	18	You turned away from God , your Creator ; you forgot the Mighty Rock , [ h ] the source of your life .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	19	You were the Lord 's children , but you made him angry . Then he rejected you
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	20	and said , “ You are unfaithful and ca n't be trusted . So I wo n't answer your prayers ; I 'll just watch and see what happens to you .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	21	( C ) You worshiped worthless idols , and made me jealous and angry ! Now I will send a cruel [ i ] and worthless nation to make you jealous and angry .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	22	“ My people , I will breathe out fire that sends you down to the world of the dead . It will scorch your farmlands and burn deep down under the mountains .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	23	I 'll send disaster after disaster to strike you like arrows .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	24	You 'll be struck by starvation and deadly diseases , by the fangs of wild animals and poisonous snakes .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	25	Young and old alike will be killed in the streets and terrified at home .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	26	“ I wanted to scatter you , so no one would remember that you had ever lived .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	27	But I dreaded the sound of your enemies saying , ‘ We defeated Israel with no help from the Lord. ’ ”
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	28	People of Israel , that 's what the Lord has said to you . But you do n't have good sense , and you never listen to advice .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	29	If you did , you could see where you are headed .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	30	How could one enemy soldier chase a thousand of Israel 's troops ? Or how could two of theirs pursue ten thousand of ours ? It can only happen if the Lord stops protecting Israel and lets the enemy win .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	31	Even our enemies know that only our God is a Mighty Rock . [ j ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	33	their wine is more deadly than cobra venom .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	34	But the Lord has written a list of their sins and locked it in his vault .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	35	( D ) Soon our enemies will get what they deserve [ l ] — suddenly they will slip , and total disaster will quickly follow .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	36	( E ) When only a few of the Lord 's people remain , when their strength is gone , and some of them are slaves , the Lord will feel sorry for them and give them justice .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	37	But first the Lord will say , “ You ran for safety to other gods— could n't they help you ?
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	38	You offered them wine and your best sacrifices . Ca n't those gods help you now or give you protection ?
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	39	Do n't you understand ? I am the only God ; there are no others . I am the one who takes life and gives it again . I punished you with suffering . But now I will heal you , and nothing can stop me !
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	40	“ I make this solemn promise : Just as I live forever ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	41	I will take revenge on my hateful enemies . I will sharpen my sword and let it flash like lightning .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	42	My arrows will get drunk on enemy blood ; my sword will taste the flesh and the blood of the enemy . It will kill prisoners , and cut off the heads of their leaders. ” [ m ]
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	43	( F ) Tell the heavens to celebrate and all gods to bow down to the Lord , [ n ] because he will take revenge on those hateful enemies who killed his people . He will forgive the sins of Israel and purify their land . [ o ] 44-45 Moses spoke the words of the song so that all the Israelites could hear , and Joshua [ p ] helped him . When Moses had finished ,
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	46	he said , “ Always remember this song I have taught you today . And let it be a warning that you must teach your children to obey everything written in The Book of God 's Law .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	47	The Law is n't empty words . It can give you a long life in the land that you are going to take. ” Moses Will See the Land
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	48	( G ) Later that day the Lord said to Moses :
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	49	Go up into the Abarim Mountain range here in Moab across the Jordan River valley from Jericho . And when you reach the top of Mount Nebo , you will be able to see the land of Canaan , which I am giving to Israel .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	50	Then you will die and be buried on the mountaintop , just as your brother Aaron died and was buried on Mount Hor .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	51	Both of you were unfaithful to me at Meribah Spring near Kadesh in the Zin Desert . [ q ] I am God , but there in front of the Israelites , you did not treat me with the honor and respect I deserve .
CEV	Deuteronomy	32	52	So I will give the land to the people of Israel , but you will only get to see it from a distance .

CEV	Joshua	1	1	Moses , the Lord 's servant , was dead . So the Lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun , who had been the assistant of Moses . The Lord said :
CEV	Joshua	1	2	My servant Moses is dead . Now you must lead Israel across the Jordan River into the land I 'm giving to all of you .
CEV	Joshua	1	3	( A ) Wherever you go , I 'll give you that land , as I promised Moses .
CEV	Joshua	1	4	It will reach from the Southern Desert to the Lebanon Mountains in the north , and to the northeast as far as the great Euphrates River . It will include the land of the Hittites , [ a ] and the land from here at the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea on the west .
CEV	Joshua	1	5	( B ) Joshua , I will always be with you and help you as I helped Moses , and no one will ever be able to defeat you . 6-8 ( C ) Long ago I promised the ancestors of Israel that I would give this land to their descendants . So be strong and brave ! Be careful to do everything my servant Moses taught you . Never stop reading The Book of the Law [ b ] he gave you . Day and night you must think about what it says . If you obey it completely , you and Israel will be able to take this land .
CEV	Joshua	1	9	I 've commanded you to be strong and brave . Do n't ever be afraid or discouraged ! I am the Lord your God , and I will be there to help you wherever you go . The Eastern Tribes Promise To Help

CEV	Joshua	1	11	to go through the camp and tell everyone : In a few days we will cross the Jordan River to take the land that the Lord our God is giving us . So prepare as much food as you 'll need for the march into the land .
CEV	Joshua	1	12	( D ) Joshua told the men of the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh : [ c ] 13-14 The Lord 's servant Moses said that the Lord our God has given you land here on the east side of the Jordan River , where you could live in peace . Your wives and children and your animals can stay here in the land Moses gave you . But all of you that can serve in our army must pick up your weapons and lead the men of the other tribes across the Jordan River . They are your relatives , so you must help them
CEV	Joshua	1	15	conquer the land that the Lord is giving them . The Lord will give peace to them as he has given peace to you , and then you can come back and settle here in the land that Moses promised you .
CEV	Joshua	1	16	The men answered : We 'll cross the Jordan River and help our relatives . We 'll fight anywhere you send us . 17-18 If the Lord our God will help you as he helped Moses , and if you are strong and brave , we will obey you as we obeyed Moses .

CEV	Joshua	2	2	But someone found out about them and told the king of Jericho , “ Some Israelite men came here tonight , and they are spies. ” 3-7 So the king sent soldiers to Rahab 's house to arrest the spies . Meanwhile , Rahab had taken the men up to the flat roof of her house and had hidden them under some piles of flax plants [ b ] that she had put there to dry . The soldiers came to her door and demanded , “ Let us have the men who are staying at your house . They are spies. ” She answered , “ Some men did come to my house , but I did n't know where they had come from . They left about sunset , just before it was time to close the town gate . [ c ] I do n't know where they were going , but if you hurry , maybe you can catch them. ” The guards at the town gate let the soldiers leave Jericho , but they closed the gate again as soon as the soldiers went through . Then the soldiers headed toward the Jordan River to look for the spies at the place where people cross the river .
CEV	Joshua	2	8	Rahab went back up to her roof . The spies were still awake , so she told them :
CEV	Joshua	2	9	I know that the Lord has given Israel this land . Everyone shakes with fear because of you .
CEV	Joshua	2	10	( B ) We heard how the Lord dried up the Red Sea [ d ] so you could leave Egypt . And we heard how you destroyed Sihon and Og , those two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River .
CEV	Joshua	2	11	We know that the Lord your God rules heaven and earth , and we 've lost our courage and our will to fight .
CEV	Joshua	2	12	Please promise me in the Lord 's name that you will be as kind to my family as I have been to you . Do something to show
CEV	Joshua	2	13	that you wo n't let your people kill my father and mother and my brothers and sisters and their families .
CEV	Joshua	2	14	“ Rahab , ” the spies answered , “ if you keep quiet about what we 're doing , we promise to be kind to you when the Lord gives us this land . We pray that the Lord will kill us if we do n't keep our promise ! ” [ e ]
CEV	Joshua	2	15	Rahab 's house was built into the town wall , [ f ] and one of the windows in her house faced outside the wall . She gave the spies a rope , showed them the window , and said , “ Use this rope to let yourselves down to the ground outside the wall .
CEV	Joshua	2	16	Then hide in the hills . The men who are looking for you wo n't be able to find you there . They 'll give up and come back after a few days , and you can be on your way. ” 17-20 The spies said : You made us promise to let you and your family live . We will keep our promise , but you ca n't tell anyone why we were here . You must tie this red rope on your window when we attack , and your father and mother , your brothers , and everyone else in your family must be here with you . We 'll take the blame if anyone who stays in this house gets hurt . But anyone who leaves your house will be killed , and it wo n't be our fault .
CEV	Joshua	2	21	“ I 'll do exactly what you said , ” Rahab promised . Then she sent them on their way and tied the red rope to the window .

CEV	Joshua	3	3	Early the next morning , Joshua and the Israelites packed up and left Acacia . They went to the Jordan River and camped there that night .
CEV	Joshua	3	2	Two days later [ a ] their leaders went through the camp , 3-4 shouting , “ When you see some of the priests [ b ] carrying the sacred chest , you 'll know it is time to cross to the other side . You 've never been there before , and you wo n't know the way , unless you follow the chest . But do n't get too close ! Stay about a kilometer back. ”
CEV	Joshua	3	5	Joshua told the people , “ Make yourselves acceptable [ c ] to worship the Lord , because he is going to do some amazing things for us. ”
CEV	Joshua	3	6	Then Joshua turned to the priests and said , “ Take the chest and cross the Jordan River ahead of us. ” So the priests picked up the chest by its carrying poles and went on ahead .
CEV	Joshua	3	7	The Lord told Joshua , “ Beginning today I will show the people that you are their leader , and they will know that I am helping you as I helped Moses .
CEV	Joshua	3	8	Now , tell the priests who are carrying the chest to go a little way into the river and stand there. ”
CEV	Joshua	3	9	Joshua spoke to the people : Come here and listen to what the Lord our God said he will do !
CEV	Joshua	3	10	The Canaanites , the Hittites , the Hivites , the Perizzites , the Girgashites , the Amorites , and the Jebusites control the land on the other side of the river . But the living God will be with you and will force them out of the land when you attack . And now , God is going to prove that he 's powerful enough to force them out . 11-13 Just watch the sacred chest that belongs to the Lord , the ruler of the whole earth . As soon as the priests carrying the chest step into the Jordan , the water will stop flowing and pile up as if someone had built a dam across the river . The Lord has also said that each of the twelve tribes should choose one man to represent it .
CEV	Joshua	3	14	The Israelites packed up and left camp . The priests carrying the chest walked in front ,
CEV	Joshua	3	15	until they came to the Jordan River . The water in the river had risen over its banks , as it often does in springtime . [ d ] But as soon as the feet of the priests touched the water , 16-17 the river stopped flowing , and the water started piling up at the town of Adam near Zarethan . No water flowed toward the Dead Sea , and the priests stood in the middle of the dry riverbed near Jericho while everyone else crossed over . Footnotes - 3.2 Two days later : The Hebrew text has “ At the end of three days , ” two days after they had set up camp . - 3.3,4 the priests : The Hebrew text has “ the priests , the Levites ” ; priests belonged to the tribe of Levi . - 3.5 Make yourselves acceptable : People had to do certain things to make themselves acceptable to worship the Lord ( see Leviticus 7.20,21 ; 15.2,33 ; 22.4-8 ; Deuteronomy 23.10,11 ) . - 3.15 springtime : Or “ harvest time ” ; the grain harvest was in late spring .

CEV	Joshua	4	4	Joshua chose twelve men ; then he called them together
CEV	Joshua	4	5	and said : Go to the middle of the riverbed where the sacred chest is , and pick up a large rock . Carry it on your shoulder to our camp . There are twelve of you , so there will be one rock for each tribe . 6-7 Someday your children will ask , “ Why are these rocks here ? ” Then you can tell them how the water stopped flowing when the chest was being carried across the river . These rocks will always remind our people of what happened here today .
CEV	Joshua	4	8	The men followed the instructions that the Lord had given Joshua . They picked up twelve rocks , one for each tribe , and carried them to the camp , where they put them down .
CEV	Joshua	4	9	Joshua set up a monument next to the place where the priests were standing . This monument was also made of twelve large rocks , and it is still there in the middle of the river . The People of Israel Set Up Camp at Gilgal 10-13 The army got ready for battle and crossed the Jordan with everyone else . They marched quickly past the sacred chest [ b ] and into the desert near Jericho . Forty thousand soldiers from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh [ c ] led the way , as Moses had ordered . [ d ] The priests stayed right where they were until the people had followed the orders that the Lord had given Moses and Joshua . Then they watched as the priests carried the chest the rest of the way across . 14-18 “ Joshua , ” the Lord said , “ tell the priests to come up from the Jordan and bring the chest with them. ” So Joshua went over to the priests and told them what the Lord had said . And as soon as the priests carried the chest past the highest place that the floodwaters of the Jordan had reached , the river flooded its banks again . That 's how the Lord showed the Israelites that Joshua was their leader . [ e ] For the rest of Joshua 's life , they respected him as they had respected Moses .
CEV	Joshua	4	19	It was the tenth day of the first month [ f ] of the year when Israel crossed the Jordan River . They set up camp at Gilgal , which was east of the land controlled by Jericho .
CEV	Joshua	4	20	The men who had carried the twelve rocks from the Jordan brought them to Joshua , and they made them into a monument .
CEV	Joshua	4	21	Then Joshua told the people : Years from now your children will ask you why these rocks are here . 22-23 Tell them , “ The Lord our God dried up the Jordan River so we could walk across . He did the same thing here for us that he did for our people at the Red Sea , [ g ]

CEV	Joshua	5	5	The Amorite kings west of the Jordan River and the Canaanite kings along the Mediterranean Sea lost their courage and their will to fight , when they heard how the Lord had dried up the Jordan River to let Israel go across . Israel Gets Ready To Celebrate Passover
CEV	Joshua	5	2	While Israel was camped at Gilgal , the Lord said , “ Joshua , make some flint knives [ a ] and circumcise the rest of the Israelite men and boys. ” [ b ]
CEV	Joshua	5	3	Joshua made the knives , then circumcised those men and boys at Haaraloth Hill . [ c ] 4-7 ( A ) This had to be done , because none of Israel 's baby boys had been circumcised during the
CEV	Joshua	5	40	years . It was about the size of a small seed , and it appeared on the ground during the night , except on the Sabbath . It was gathered early in the morning , ground up , and then baked or boiled ( see Exodus 16.13-36 ; Numbers 11.4-9 ) . - 5.11,12 roasted grain : Roasted grain was made by cooking the grain in a dry pan or on a flat rock , or by holding a bunch of grain stalks over a fire . - 5.11,12 thin bread : Bread made without yeast . Israelites were not supposed to eat bread made with yeast for the week following Passover . That week is called the Festival of Thin Bread ( see Exodus 12.14-20 ; 13.3-7 ) . Copyright ©
CEV	Joshua	5	8	Everyone who had been circumcised needed time to heal , and they stayed in camp .
CEV	Joshua	5	9	The Lord told Joshua , “ It was a disgrace for my people to be slaves in Egypt , but now I have taken away that disgrace. ” So the Israelites named the place Gilgal , [ d ] and it still has that name .
CEV	Joshua	5	10	( B ) Israel continued to camp at Gilgal in the desert near Jericho , and on the fourteenth day of the same month , [ e ] they celebrated Passover . 11-12 ( C ) The next day , God stopped sending the Israelites manna [ f ] to eat each morning , and they started eating food grown in the land of Canaan . They ate roasted grain [ g ] and thin bread [ h ] made of the barley they had gathered from nearby fields . Israel Captures Jericho
CEV	Joshua	5	13	One day , Joshua was near Jericho when he saw a man standing some distance in front of him . The man was holding a sword , so Joshua walked up to him and asked , “ Are you on our side or on our enemies ' side ? ”
CEV	Joshua	5	14	“ Neither , ” he answered . “ I am here because I am the commander of the Lord 's army. ” Joshua fell to his knees and bowed down to the ground . “ I am your servant , ” he said . “ Tell me what to do. ”
CEV	Joshua	5	15	“ Take off your sandals , ” the commander answered . “ This is a holy place. ” So Joshua took off his sandals .

CEV	Joshua	6	6	Joshua called the priests together and said , “ Take the chest and tell seven priests to carry trumpets and march ahead of it. ” 7-10 Next , he gave the army their orders : “ March slowly around Jericho . A few of you will go ahead of the chest to guard it , but most of you will follow it . Do n't shout the battle cry or yell or even talk until the day I tell you to . Then let out a shout ! ” As soon as Joshua finished giving the orders , the army started marching . One group of soldiers led the way , with seven priests marching behind them and blowing trumpets . Then came the priests carrying the chest , followed by the rest of the soldiers .
CEV	Joshua	6	4	Take along the sacred chest and tell seven priests to walk in front of it , carrying trumpets . [ a ] But on the seventh day , march slowly around the town seven times while the priests blow their trumpets .
CEV	Joshua	6	5	Then the priests will blast on their trumpets , and everyone else will shout . The wall will fall down , and your soldiers can go straight in from every side .
CEV	Joshua	6	11	They obeyed Joshua 's orders and carried the chest once around the town before returning to camp for the night . 12-14 Early the next morning , Joshua and everyone else started marching around Jericho in the same order as the day before . One group of soldiers was in front , followed by the seven priests with trumpets and the priests who carried the chest . The rest of the army came next . The seven priests blew their trumpets while everyone marched slowly around Jericho and back to camp . They did this once a day for six days .
CEV	Joshua	6	15	On the seventh day , the army got up at daybreak . They marched slowly around Jericho the same as they had done for the past six days , except on this day they went around seven times .
CEV	Joshua	6	16	Then the priests blew the trumpets , and Joshua yelled : Get ready to shout ! The Lord will let you capture this town .
CEV	Joshua	6	17	But you must destroy it and everything in it , to show that it now belongs to the Lord . [ b ] The woman Rahab helped the spies we sent , [ c ] so protect her and the others who are inside her house . But kill everyone else in the town . 18-19 The silver and gold and everything made of bronze and iron belong to the Lord and must be put in his treasury . Be careful to follow these instructions , because if you see something you want and take it , the Lord will destroy Israel . And it will be all your fault . [ d ]
CEV	Joshua	6	20	( A ) The priests blew their trumpets again , and the soldiers shouted as loud as they could . The walls of Jericho fell flat . Then the soldiers rushed up the hill , went straight into the town , and captured it . 21-25 ( B ) They killed everyone , men and women , young and old , everyone except Rahab and the others in her house . They even killed every cow , sheep , and donkey . Joshua said to the two men who had been spies , “ Rahab kept you safe when I sent you to Jericho . We promised to protect her and her family , and we will keep that promise . Now go into her house and bring them out. ” The two men went into Rahab 's house and brought her out , along with her father and mother , her brothers , and her other relatives . Rahab and her family had to stay in a place just outside the Israelite army camp . [ e ] But later they were allowed to live among the Israelites , and her descendants still do . The Israelites took the silver and gold and the things made of bronze and iron and put them with the rest of the treasure that was kept at the Lord 's house . [ f ] Finally , they set fire to Jericho and everything in it .
CEV	Joshua	6	26	( C ) After Jericho was destroyed , Joshua warned the people , “ Someday a man will rebuild Jericho , but the Lord will put a curse on him , and the man 's oldest son will die when he starts to build the town wall . And by the time he finishes the wall and puts gates in it , all his children will be dead. ” [ g ]

CEV	Joshua	7	7	Then Joshua said : Our Lord , did you bring us across the Jordan River just so the Amorites could destroy us ? This would n't have happened if we had agreed to stay on the other side of the Jordan .
CEV	Joshua	7	2	While Israel was still camped near Jericho , Joshua sent some spies with these instructions : “ Go to the town of Ai [ d ] and find out whatever you can about the region around the town. ” The spies left and went to Ai , which is east of Bethel and near Beth-Aven .
CEV	Joshua	7	3	They went back to Joshua and reported , “ You do n't need to send the whole army to attack Ai—2,000 or 3,000 troops will be enough . Why bother the whole army for a town that small ? ” 4-5 Joshua sent about 3,000 soldiers to attack Ai . But the men of Ai fought back and chased the Israelite soldiers away from the town gate and down the hill to the stone quarries . [ e ] Thirty-six Israelite soldiers were killed , and the Israelite army felt discouraged .
CEV	Joshua	7	6	Joshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes and put dirt on their heads to show their sorrow . They lay facedown on the ground in front of the sacred chest until sunset .
CEV	Joshua	7	8	I do n't even know what to say to you , since Israel 's army has turned and run from the enemy .
CEV	Joshua	7	9	Everyone will think you were n't strong enough to protect your people . Now the Canaanites and everyone else who lives in the land will surround us and wipe us out .
CEV	Joshua	7	10	The Lord answered : Stop lying there on the ground ! Get up !
CEV	Joshua	7	11	I said everything in Jericho belonged to me and had to be destroyed . But the Israelites have kept some of the things for themselves . They stole from me and hid what they took . Then they lied about it .
CEV	Joshua	7	12	What they stole was supposed to be destroyed , and now Israel itself must be destroyed . I can not help you anymore until you do exactly what I have said . That 's why Israel turns and runs from its enemies instead of standing up to them .
CEV	Joshua	7	13	Tell the people of Israel , “ Tomorrow you will meet with the Lord your God , so make yourselves acceptable to worship him . The Lord says that you have taken things that should have been destroyed . You wo n't be able to stand up to your enemies until you get rid of those things .
CEV	Joshua	7	14	“ Tomorrow morning everyone must gather near the place of worship . You will come forward tribe by tribe , and the Lord will show which tribe is guilty . Next , the clans in that tribe must come forward , and the Lord will show which clan is guilty . The families in that clan must come , and the Lord will point out the guilty family . Finally , the men in that family must come ,
CEV	Joshua	7	15	and the Lord will show who stole what should have been destroyed . That man must be put to death , his body burned , and his possessions thrown into the fire . He has done a terrible thing by breaking the sacred agreement that the Lord made with Israel. ”
CEV	Joshua	7	16	Joshua got up early the next morning and brought each tribe to the place of worship , where the Lord showed that the Judah tribe was guilty .
CEV	Joshua	7	17	Then Joshua brought the clans of Judah to the Lord , and the Lord showed that the Zerah clan was guilty . One by one he brought the leader of each family in the Zerah clan to the Lord , and the Lord showed that Zabdi 's family was guilty .
CEV	Joshua	7	18	Finally , Joshua brought each man in Zabdi 's family to the Lord , and the Lord showed that Achan was the guilty one .
CEV	Joshua	7	19	“ Achan , ” Joshua said , “ the Lord God of Israel has decided that you are guilty . So tell me what you did , and do n't try to hide anything. ”
CEV	Joshua	7	20	“ It 's true , ” Achan answered . “ I sinned and disobeyed the Lord God of Israel . 21-22 While we were in Jericho , I saw a beautiful Babylonian robe ,
CEV	Joshua	7	200	pieces of silver , and a gold bar that weighed the same as
CEV	Joshua	7	50	pieces of gold . I wanted them for myself , so I took them . I dug a hole under my tent and hid the silver , the gold , and the robe. ” Joshua told some people to run to Achan 's tent , where they found the silver , the gold , and the robe .
CEV	Joshua	7	23	They brought them back and put them in front of the sacred chest , so Joshua and the rest of the Israelites could see them .
CEV	Joshua	7	24	Then everyone took Achan and the things he had stolen to Trouble Valley . [ f ] They also took along his sons and daughters , his cattle , donkeys , and sheep , his tent , and everything else that belonged to him .
CEV	Joshua	7	25	Joshua said , “ Achan , you caused us a lot of trouble . Now the Lord is paying you back with the same kind of trouble. ” The people of Israel then stoned to death Achan and his family . They made a fire and burned the bodies , together with what Achan had stolen , and all his possessions .
CEV	Joshua	7	26	They covered the remains with a big pile of rocks , which is still there . Then the Lord stopped being angry with Israel . That 's how the place came to be called Trouble Valley . Footnotes - 7.1 belonged to him : See the note at 6.17 . - 7.1 Achan : The Hebrew text has “ Achan , son of Carmi , grandson of Abdi , and great-grandson of Zerah. ” - 7.1 the Lord was angry … disobeyed him : Even though only one person had disobeyed , it meant that the Lords instructions to the people of Israel had not been followed , and the whole nation was held responsible . - 7.2 of Ai : Or “ called The Ruins. ” - 7.4,5 stone quarries : Or “ Shebarim. ” - 7.24 Trouble Valley : Or “ Achor Valley. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Joshua	8	8	Then set it on fire , as the Lord has told us to do . Those are your orders ,
CEV	Joshua	8	7	you come out of hiding . The Lord our God will help you capture the town .
CEV	Joshua	8	9	now go ! The 30,000 soldiers went to a place on the west side of Ai , between Ai and Bethel , where they could hide and wait to attack . That night , Joshua stayed in camp with the rest of the army .
CEV	Joshua	8	10	Early the next morning he got his troops ready to move out , and he and the other leaders of Israel led them to Ai .
CEV	Joshua	8	11	They set up camp in full view of the town , across the valley to the north .
CEV	Joshua	8	12	Joshua had already sent 5,000 soldiers to the west side of the town to hide and wait to attack .
CEV	Joshua	8	13	Now all his troops were in place . Part of the army was in the camp to the north of Ai , and the others were hiding to the west , ready to make a surprise attack . That night , Joshua went into the valley . [ a ] 14-15 The king of Ai saw Joshua 's army , so the king and his troops hurried out early the next morning to fight them . Joshua and his army pretended to be beaten , and they let the men of Ai chase them toward the desert . The king and his army were facing the Jordan valley as Joshua had planned . The king did not realize that some Israelite soldiers were hiding behind the town . 16-17 So he called out every man in Ai to go after Joshua 's troops . They all rushed out to chase the Israelite army , and they left the town gates wide open . Not one man was left in Ai or in Bethel . [ b ] Joshua let the men of Ai chase him and his army farther and farther away from Ai .
CEV	Joshua	8	18	Finally , the Lord told Joshua , “ Point your sword [ c ] at the town of Ai , because now I am going to help you defeat it ! ” As soon as Joshua pointed his sword at the town ,
CEV	Joshua	8	19	the soldiers who had been hiding jumped up and ran into the town . They captured it and set it on fire . 20-21 When Joshua and his troops saw smoke rising from the town , they knew that the other part of their army had captured it . So they turned and attacked . The men of Ai looked back and saw smoke rising from their town . But they could not escape , because the soldiers they had been chasing had suddenly turned and started fighting . 22-24 Meanwhile , the other Israelite soldiers had come from the town and attacked the men of Ai from the rear . The Israelites captured the king of Ai and brought him to Joshua . They also chased the rest of the men of Ai into the desert and killed them . [ d ] The Israelite army went back to Ai and killed everyone there . 25-26 Joshua kept his sword pointed at the town of Ai until every last one of Ai 's 12,000 people was dead .
CEV	Joshua	8	27	But the Israelites took the animals and the other possessions of the people of Ai , because this was what the Lord had told Joshua to do . 28-29 Joshua made sure every building in Ai was burned to the ground . He told his men to kill the king of Ai and hang his body on a tree . Then at sunset he told the Israelites to take down the body , [ e ] throw it in the gateway of the town , and cover it with a big pile of rocks . Those rocks are still there , and the town itself has never been rebuilt . Joshua Reads the Blessings and Curses ( Deuteronomy 27.1-26 ) 30-32 ( A ) One day , Joshua led the people of Israel to Mount Ebal , where he told some of his men , “ Build an altar for offering sacrifices to the Lord . And use stones that have never been cut with iron tools , [ f ] because that is what Moses taught in The Book of the Law. ” [ g ] Joshua offered sacrifices to please the Lord [ h ] and to ask his blessing . [ i ] Then with the Israelites still watching , he copied parts of The Book of the Law [ j ] of Moses onto stones . 33-35 ( B ) Moses had said that everyone in Israel was to go to the valley between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim , where they were to be blessed . So everyone went there , including the foreigners , the leaders , officials , and judges . Half of the people stood on one side of the valley , and half on the other side , with the priests from the Levi tribe standing in the middle with the sacred chest . Then in a loud voice , Joshua read the blessings and curses from The Book of the Law [ k ] of Moses .

CEV	Joshua	9	3	The people of Gibeon had also heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai .
CEV	Joshua	9	4	So they decided that some of their men should pretend to be messengers to Israel from a faraway country . [ a ] The men put worn-out bags on their donkeys and found some old wineskins that had cracked and had been sewn back together .

We ca n't make a peace treaty with you if you live nearby. ” [ b ] The Gibeonites [ c ] said , “ If you make a peace treaty with us , we will be your servants. ” “ Who are you ? ” Joshua asked . “ Where do you come from ? ” They answered :

CEV	Joshua	9	14	The Israelites tried some of the food , [ d ] but they did not ask the Lord if he wanted them to make a treaty .
CEV	Joshua	9	15	So Joshua made a peace treaty with the messengers and promised that Israel would not kill their people . Israel 's leaders swore that Israel would keep this promise . 16-17 A couple of days later , [ e ] the Israelites found out that these people actually lived in the nearby towns of Gibeon , Chephirah , Beeroth , and Kiriath-Jearim . [ f ] So the Israelites left the place where they had camped and arrived at the four towns two days later . [ g ]
CEV	Joshua	9	18	But they did not attack the towns , because the Israelite leaders had sworn in the name of the Lord that they would let these people live . The Israelites complained about their leaders ' decision not to attack , 19-21 but the leaders reminded them , “ We promised these people in the name of the Lord God of Israel that we would let them live , so we must not harm them . If we break our promise , God will punish us . We 'll let them live , but we 'll make them cut wood and carry water for our people. ”
CEV	Joshua	9	22	Joshua told some of his soldiers , “ I want to meet with the Gibeonite leaders . Bring them here. ” When the Gibeonites came , Joshua said , “ You live close to us . Why did you lie by claiming you lived far away ?
CEV	Joshua	9	23	So now you are under a curse , and from now on your people will have to send workers to cut wood and carry water for the place of worship. ” [ h ]
CEV	Joshua	9	24	The Gibeonites answered , “ The Lord your God told his servant Moses that you were to kill everyone who lives here and take their land for yourselves . We were afraid you would kill us , and so we tricked you into making a peace treaty . But we agreed to be your servants ,
CEV	Joshua	9	25	and you are strong enough to do anything to us that you want . We just ask you to do what seems right. ”
CEV	Joshua	9	26	Joshua did not let the Israelites kill the Gibeonites ,
CEV	Joshua	9	27	but he did tell the Gibeonites that they would have to be servants of the nation of Israel . They would have to cut firewood and bring it for the priests to use for burning sacrifices on the Lord 's altar , wherever the Lord decided the altar would be . The Gibeonites would also have to carry water for the priests . And that is still the work of the Gibeonites .

CEV	Joshua	10	10	The Lord made the enemy panic , and the Israelites started killing them right and left . They [ b ] chased the Amorite troops up the road to Beth-Horon and kept on killing them , until they reached the towns of Azekah and Makkedah . [ c ]
CEV	Joshua	10	2	This frightened Adonizedek and his people . They knew that Gibeon was a large town , as big as the towns that had kings , and even bigger than the town of Ai had been . And all of the men of Gibeon were warriors .
CEV	Joshua	10	3	So Adonizedek sent messages to the kings of four other towns : King Hoham of Hebron , King Piram of Jarmuth , King Japhia of Lachish , and King Debir of Eglon . The messages said ,
CEV	Joshua	10	4	“ The Gibeonites have signed a peace treaty with Joshua and the Israelites . Come and help me attack Gibeon ! ”
CEV	Joshua	10	5	When these five Amorite kings called their armies together and attacked Gibeon ,
CEV	Joshua	10	6	the Gibeonites sent a message to the Israelite camp at Gilgal : “ Joshua , please come and rescue us ! The Amorite kings from the hill country have joined together and are attacking us . We are your servants , so do n't let us down . Please hurry ! ”
CEV	Joshua	10	7	Joshua and his army , including his best warriors , left Gilgal .
CEV	Joshua	10	8	“ Joshua , ” the Lord said , “ do n't be afraid of the Amorites . They will run away when you attack , and I will help you defeat them. ”
CEV	Joshua	10	9	Joshua marched all night from Gilgal to Gibeon and made a surprise attack on the Amorite camp .
CEV	Joshua	10	11	And while these troops were going down through Beth-Horon Pass , [ d ] the Lord made huge hailstones fall on them all the way to Azekah . More of the enemy soldiers died from the hail than from the Israelite weapons . 12-13 ( A ) The Lord was helping the Israelites defeat the Amorites that day . So about noon , Joshua prayed to the Lord loud enough for the Israelites to hear : “ Our Lord , make the sun stop in the sky over Gibeon , and the moon stand still over Aijalon Valley. ” [ e ] So the sun and the moon stopped and stood still until Israel defeated its enemies . This poem can be found in The Book of Jashar . [ f ] The sun stood still and did n't go down for about a whole day .
CEV	Joshua	10	14	Never before and never since has the Lord done anything like that for someone who prayed . The Lord was really fighting for Israel .
CEV	Joshua	10	15	After the battle , Joshua and the Israelites went back to their camp at Gilgal . Joshua Kills the Five Enemy Kings
CEV	Joshua	10	16	While the enemy soldiers were running from the Israelites , the five enemy kings ran away and hid in a cave near Makkedah .
CEV	Joshua	10	17	Joshua 's soldiers told him , “ The five kings have been found in a cave near Makkedah. ”
CEV	Joshua	10	18	Joshua answered , “ Roll some big stones over the mouth of the cave and leave a few soldiers to guard it .
CEV	Joshua	10	19	But you and everyone else must keep going after the enemy troops , because they will be safe if they reach their walled towns . Do n't let them get away ! The Lord our God is helping us get rid of them. ”
CEV	Joshua	10	20	So Joshua and the Israelites almost wiped out the enemy soldiers . Only a few safely reached their walled towns .
CEV	Joshua	10	21	The Israelite army returned to their camp at Makkedah , where Joshua was waiting for them . No one around there dared say anything bad about the Israelites .
CEV	Joshua	10	22	Joshua told his soldiers , “ Now , move the rocks from the entrance to the cave and bring those five kings to me. ”
CEV	Joshua	10	23	The soldiers opened the entrance to the cave and brought out the kings of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish , and Eglon .
CEV	Joshua	10	24	After Joshua had called the army together , he forced the five kings to lie down on the ground . Then he called his officers forward and told them , “ You fought these kings along with me , so put your feet on their necks. ” The officers did this ,
CEV	Joshua	10	25	and Joshua continued , “ Do n't ever be afraid or discouraged . Be brave and strong . This is what the Lord will do to all your enemies. ”
CEV	Joshua	10	26	Joshua killed the five kings and told his men to hang each body on a tree . Then at sunset
CEV	Joshua	10	27	he told some of his troops , “ Take the bodies down and throw them into the cave where the kings were found . Cover the entrance to the cave with big rocks. ” Joshua 's troops obeyed his orders , and those rocks are still there . Joshua Continues the Fighting
CEV	Joshua	10	28	Later that day , Joshua captured Makkedah and killed its king and everyone else in the town , just as he had done at Jericho .
CEV	Joshua	10	29	Joshua and his army left Makkedah and attacked the town of Libnah .
CEV	Joshua	10	30	The Lord let them capture the town and its king , and they killed the king and everyone else , just as they had done at Jericho .
CEV	Joshua	10	31	Joshua then led his army to Lachish , and they set up camp around the town . They attacked ,
CEV	Joshua	10	32	and the next day the Lord let them capture the town . They killed everyone , as they had done at Libnah .
CEV	Joshua	10	33	King Horam of Gezer arrived to help Lachish , but Joshua and his troops attacked and destroyed him and his army .
CEV	Joshua	10	34	From Lachish , Joshua took his troops to Eglon , where they set up camp surrounding the town . They attacked ,
CEV	Joshua	10	35	captured it that same day , then killed everyone , as they had done at Lachish .
CEV	Joshua	10	36	Joshua and his army left Eglon and attacked Hebron .
CEV	Joshua	10	37	They captured the town and the nearby villages , then killed everyone , including the king . They destroyed Hebron in the same way they had destroyed Eglon .
CEV	Joshua	10	38	Joshua and the Israelite army turned and attacked Debir .

CEV	Joshua	11	11	and everyone else , then they set the town on fire . 12-15 Joshua captured all the towns where the enemy kings had ruled . These towns were built on small hills , [ i ] and Joshua did not set fire to any of these towns , except Hazor . The Israelites kept the animals and everything of value from these towns , but they killed everyone who lived in them , including their kings . That 's what the Lord had told his servant Moses to do , that 's what Moses had told Joshua to do , and that 's exactly what Joshua did .
CEV	Joshua	11	2	the kings in the northern hill country and in the Jordan River valley south of Lake Galilee , [ a ] and the kings in the foothills and in Naphath-Dor to the west .
CEV	Joshua	11	3	He sent messages to the Canaanite kings in the east and the west , to the Amorite , Hittite , Perizzite , and Jebusite kings in the hill country , and to the Hivite kings in the region of Mizpah , near the foot of Mount Hermon . [ b ] 4-5 The kings and their armies went to Merom Pond , [ c ] where they set up camp , and got ready to fight Israel . It seemed as though there were more soldiers and horses and chariots than there are grains of sand on a beach .
CEV	Joshua	11	6	The Lord told Joshua : Do n't let them frighten you ! I 'll help you defeat them , and by this time tomorrow they will be dead . When you attack , the first thing you have to do is to cripple their horses . Then after the battle is over , [ d ] burn their chariots .
CEV	Joshua	11	7	Joshua and his army made a surprise attack against the enemy camp at Merom Pond [ e ] 8-9 and crippled the enemies ' horses . [ f ] Joshua followed the Lord 's instructions , and the Lord helped Israel defeat the enemy . The Israelite army even chased enemy soldiers as far as Misrephoth-Maim to the northwest , [ g ] the city of Sidon to the north , and Mizpeh Valley to the northeast . [ h ] None of the enemy soldiers escaped alive . The Israelites came back after the battle and burned the enemy 's chariots .
CEV	Joshua	11	10	Up to this time , the king of Hazor had controlled the kingdoms that had joined together to attack Israel , so Joshua led his army back and captured Hazor . They killed its king
CEV	Joshua	11	16	Joshua and his army took control of the northern and southern hill country , the foothills to the west , the Southern Desert , the whole region of Goshen , [ j ] and the Jordan River valley . 17-18 They took control of the land from Mount Halak near the country of Edom in the south to Baal-Gad in Lebanon Valley at the foot of Mount Hermon in the north . Joshua and his army were at war with the kings in this region for a long time , but finally they captured and put to death the last king . 19-20 ( A ) The Lord had told Moses that he wanted the towns in this region destroyed and their people killed without mercy . That 's why the Lord made the people in the towns stubborn and determined to fight Israel . The only town that signed a peace treaty with Israel was the Hivite town of Gibeon . The Israelite army captured the rest of the towns in battle .
CEV	Joshua	11	21	During this same time , Joshua and his army killed the Anakim [ k ] from the northern and southern hill country . They also destroyed the towns where the Anakim had lived , including Hebron , Debir , and Anab .
CEV	Joshua	11	22	There were not any Anakim left in the regions where the Israelites lived , although there were still some in Gaza , Gath , and Ashdod . [ l ]
CEV	Joshua	11	23	That 's how Joshua captured the land , just as the Lord had commanded Moses , and Joshua divided it up among the tribes . Finally , there was peace in the land .

CEV	Joshua	12	12	( A ) Before Moses died , he and the people of Israel had defeated two kings east of the Jordan River . These kings had ruled the region from the Arnon River gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north , including the eastern side of the Jordan River valley .
CEV	Joshua	12	2	The first king that Moses and the Israelites defeated was an Amorite , King Sihon of Heshbon . [ a ] The southern border of his kingdom ran down the middle of the Arnon River gorge , taking in the town of Aroer on the northern edge of the gorge . The Jabbok River separated Sihon 's kingdom from the Ammonites on the east . Then the Jabbok turned west and became his northern border , so his kingdom included the southern half of the region of Gilead .
CEV	Joshua	12	3	Sihon also controlled the eastern side of the Jordan River valley from Lake Galilee [ b ] south to Beth-Jeshimoth and the Dead Sea . In addition to these regions , he ruled the town called Slopes of Mount Pisgah [ c ] and the land south of there at the foot of the hill .
CEV	Joshua	12	4	Next , Moses and the Israelites defeated King Og of Bashan , [ d ] who lived in the town of Ashtaroth part of each year and in Edrei the rest of the year . Og was one of the last of the Rephaim . [ e ]
CEV	Joshua	12	5	His kingdom stretched north to Mount Hermon , east to the town of Salecah , and included the land of Bashan as far west as the borders of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah . He also ruled the northern half of Gilead .
CEV	Joshua	12	6	( B ) Moses , the Lord 's servant , had led the people of Israel in defeating Sihon and Og . Then Moses gave their land to the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh . 7-8 Later , Joshua and the Israelites defeated many kings west of the Jordan River , from Baal-Gad in Lebanon Valley in the north to Mount Halak near the country of Edom in the south . This region included the hill country and the foothills , the Jordan River valley and its western slopes , and the Southern Desert . Joshua and the Israelites took this land from the Hittites , the Amorites , the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . Joshua divided up the land among the tribes of Israel . The Israelites defeated the kings of the following towns west of the Jordan River : 9-24 Jericho , Ai near Bethel , Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish , Eglon , Gezer , Debir , Geder , Hormah , Arad , Libnah , Adullam , Makkedah , Bethel , Tappuah , Hepher , Aphek , Lasharon , [ f ] Madon , Hazor , Shimron-Meron , Achshaph , Taanach , Megiddo , Kedesh , Jokneam on Mount Carmel , Dor in Naphath-Dor , Goiim in Galilee , [ g ] and Tirzah .

CEV	Joshua	13	13	However , the Israelites did not force the people of Geshur and Maacah to leave , and they still live there among the Israelites . Why Moses Did Not Give Land to the Levi Tribe
CEV	Joshua	13	8	( B ) Moses had already given land east of the Jordan River to the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and half of Manasseh .
CEV	Joshua	13	9	This region stretched north from the town in the middle of the Arnon River valley , and included the town of Aroer on the northern edge of the valley . It covered the flatlands of Medeba north of Dibon ,
CEV	Joshua	13	10	and took in the towns that had belonged to Sihon , the Amorite king of Heshbon . Some of these towns were as far east as the Ammonite border . 11-12 Geshur and Maacah were part of this region , and so was the whole territory that King Og had ruled , that is , Gilead , Mount Hermon , and all of Bashan as far east as Salecah . Og had lived in Ashtaroth part of each year , and he had lived in Edrei the rest of the year . Og had been one of the last of the Rephaim , [ h ] but Moses had defeated Sihon and Og and their people [ i ] and had forced them to leave their land .
CEV	Joshua	13	14	( C ) Moses did not give any land to the Levi tribe , because the Lord God of Israel had told them , “ Instead of land , you will receive the sacrifices offered at my altar. ” The Land Moses Gave to the Reuben Tribe

CEV	Joshua	13	24	Moses also gave land to each of the clans in the Gad tribe .
CEV	Joshua	13	25	It included the town of Jazer , and in the Gilead region their territory took in the land and towns as far east as the town of Aroer [ j ] just west of Rabbah . [ k ] This was about half of the land that had once belonged to the Ammonites .
CEV	Joshua	13	26	The land given to Gad stretched from Heshbon in the south to Ramath-Mizpeh and Betonim in the north , and even further north to Mahanaim and Lidebor . [ l ]
CEV	Joshua	13	27	Gad also received the eastern half of the Jordan River valley , which had been ruled by King Sihon of Heshbon . This territory stretched as far north as Lake Galilee , [ m ] and included the towns of Beth-Haram , Beth-Nimrah , Succoth , and Zaphon .
CEV	Joshua	13	28	These regions with their towns and villages were given to the Gad tribe . The Land Moses Gave to Half the Manasseh Tribe
CEV	Joshua	13	29	Moses gave land east of the Jordan River to half of the clans from the Manasseh tribe . 30-31 Their land started at Mahanaim and took in the region that King Og of Bashan had ruled , including Ashtaroth and Edrei , the two towns where he had lived . The villages where the Jair clan settled were part of Manasseh 's land , and so was the northern half of the region of Gilead . The clans of this half of Manasseh had
CEV	Joshua	13	60	towns in all . The Manasseh tribe is sometimes called the Machir tribe , after Manasseh 's son Machir .
CEV	Joshua	13	32	That was how Moses divided up the Moab Plains to the east of Jericho on the other side of the Jordan River , so these two and a half tribes would have land of their own .

CEV	Joshua	14	14	And Hebron still belongs to Caleb 's descendants , because he was faithful to the Lord God of Israel .
CEV	Joshua	14	6	( B ) One day while the Israelites were still camped at Gilgal , Caleb the son of Jephunneh went to talk with Joshua . Caleb belonged to the Kenaz clan , and many other people from the Judah tribe went with Caleb . He told Joshua : You know that back in Kadesh-Barnea the Lord talked to his prophet Moses about you and me .
CEV	Joshua	14	7	( C ) I was
CEV	Joshua	14	40	years old at the time Moses sent me from Kadesh-Barnea into Canaan as a spy . When I came back and told him about the land , everything I said was true .
CEV	Joshua	14	8	The other spies said things that made our people afraid , but I completely trusted the Lord God .
CEV	Joshua	14	9	( D ) The same day I came back , Moses told me , “ Since you were faithful to the Lord God , I promise that the places where you went as a spy will belong to you and your descendants forever. ”
CEV	Joshua	14	10	Joshua , it was
CEV	Joshua	14	45	years ago that the Lord told Moses to make that promise , and now I am
CEV	Joshua	14	85	. Even though Israel has moved from place to place in the desert , the Lord has kept me alive all this time as he said he would .
CEV	Joshua	14	11	I 'm just as strong today as I was then , and I can still fight as well in battle .
CEV	Joshua	14	12	So I 'm asking you for the hill country that the Lord promised me that day . You were there . You heard the other spies talk about that part of the hill country and the large , walled towns where the Anakim [ b ] live . But maybe the Lord will help me take their land , just as he promised .
CEV	Joshua	14	13	Joshua prayed that God would help Caleb , then he gave Hebron to Caleb and his descendants .

CEV	Joshua	15	2	Judah 's southern border started at the south end of the Dead Sea .
CEV	Joshua	15	3	As it went west from there , it ran south of Scorpion Pass [ a ] to Zin , and then came up from the south to Kadesh-Barnea . It continued past Hezron up to Addar , turned toward Karka ,

CEV	Joshua	16	16	1-4 Ephraim and Manasseh are the two tribes descended from Joseph , and the following is a description of the land they received . The southern border of their land started at the Jordan River east of the spring at Jericho . From there it went west through the desert up to the hill country around Bethel . From Bethel it went to Luz and then [ a ] to the border of the Archites in Ataroth . [ b ] It continued west down to the land that belonged to the Japhlet clan , then went on to Lower Beth-Horon , Gezer , and the Mediterranean Sea .
CEV	Joshua	16	5	The following is a description of the land that was divided among the clans of the Ephraim tribe . Their southern border started at Ataroth-Addar and went west to Upper Beth-Horon 6-8 and the Mediterranean Sea . Their northern border started on the east at Janoah , curved a little to the north , then came back south to Michmethath and Tappuah , where it followed the Kanah Gorge west to the Mediterranean Sea . The eastern border started on the north near Janoah and went between Janoah on the southwest and Taanath-Shiloh on the northeast . Then it went south to Ataroth , Naarah , and on as far as the edge of the land that belonged to Jericho . At that point it turned east and went to the Jordan River . The clans of Ephraim received this region as their tribal land .
CEV	Joshua	16	9	Ephraim also had some towns and villages that were inside Manasseh 's tribal land .
CEV	Joshua	16	10	( A ) Ephraim could not force the Canaanites out of Gezer , so there are still some Canaanites who live there among the Israelites . But now these Canaanites have to work as slaves for the Israelites . Copyright ©

CEV	Joshua	17	17	“ Your tribes do have a lot of people , ” Joshua admitted . “ I 'll give you more land . Your tribes are powerful ,
CEV	Joshua	17	7	The land of the Manasseh tribe went from its northern border with the Asher tribe south to Michmethath , which is to the east of Shechem . The southern border started there , but curved even farther south to include the people who lived around Tappuah Spring . [ c ]
CEV	Joshua	17	8	The town of Tappuah was on Manasseh 's border with Ephraim . Although the land around Tappuah belonged to Manasseh , the town itself belonged to Ephraim . 9-10 Then the border went west to the Kanah Gorge and ran along the northern edge of the gorge to the Mediterranean Sea . The land south of the gorge belonged to Ephraim . And even though there were a few towns that belonged to Ephraim north of the gorge , the land north of the gorge belonged to Manasseh . The western border of Manasseh was the Mediterranean Sea , and the tribe shared a border with the Asher tribe on the northwest and with the Issachar tribe on the northeast .
CEV	Joshua	17	11	Manasseh was supposed to have the following towns with their surrounding villages inside the borders of Issachar 's and Asher 's tribal lands : Beth-Shan , Ibleam , Endor , Taanach , Megiddo , and Dor , which is also called Naphath . [ d ]
CEV	Joshua	17	12	( B ) But the people of Manasseh could not capture these towns , so the Canaanites kept on living in them .
CEV	Joshua	17	13	When the Israelites grew stronger , they made the Canaanites in these towns work as their slaves , though they never did force them to leave . Joseph 's Descendants Ask for More Land
CEV	Joshua	17	14	One day the Joseph tribes [ e ] came to Joshua and asked , “ Why did n't you give us more land ? The Lord has always been kind to us , and we have too many people for this small region. ”
CEV	Joshua	17	15	Joshua replied , “ If there 's not enough room for you in the hill country of Ephraim , then go into the forest that belonged to the Perizzites and the Rephaim . [ f ] Clear out the trees and make more room for yourselves there. ”
CEV	Joshua	17	16	“ Even if we do that , ” they answered , “ there still wo n't be enough land for us in the hill country . And we ca n't move down into Jezreel Valley , because the Canaanites who live in Beth-Shan and in other parts of the valley have iron chariots. ”
CEV	Joshua	17	18	so you can have the rest of the hill country , but it 's a forest , and you 'll have to cut down the trees and clear the land . You can also have Jezreel Valley . Even though the Canaanites there are strong and have iron chariots , you can force them to leave the valley. ” Footnotes - 17.1-6 The Lord told Moses … relatives : See Numbers 27.1-11 ; 36.1-12 . - 17.1-6 the clans that were descendants of Zelophehad 's five daughters … Hepher 's brothers : Or “ Zelophehad 's five daughters went to the priest Eleazar , Joshua , and the leaders of Israel .

CEV	Joshua	18	18	The border ran along the hillside north of Beth-Arabah , [ j ] then down into the Jordan River valley .
CEV	Joshua	18	2	There were still seven tribes without any land , 3-7 so Joshua told the people : The Judah tribe has already settled in its land in the south , and the Joseph tribes [ b ] have settled in their land in the north . The tribes of Gad , Reuben , and East Manasseh already have the land that the Lord 's servant Moses gave them east of the Jordan River . And the people of Levi wo n't receive land like the other tribes . Instead , they will serve the Lord as priests . But the rest of you have n't done a thing to take over any land . The Lord God who was worshiped by your ancestors has given you the land , and now it 's time to go ahead and settle there . Seven tribes still do n't have any land . Each of these tribes should choose three men , and I 'll send them to explore the remaining land . They will divide it into seven regions , write a description of each region , and bring these descriptions back to me . I will find out [ c ] from the Lord our God what region each tribe should get .
CEV	Joshua	18	8	Just before the men left camp , Joshua repeated their orders : “ Explore the land and write a description of it . Then come back to Shiloh , and I will find out from the Lord how to divide the land. ”
CEV	Joshua	18	9	The men left and went across the land , dividing it into seven regions . They wrote down a description of each region , town by town , and returned to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh .
CEV	Joshua	18	10	Joshua found out from the Lord how to divide the land , and he told the tribes what the Lord had decided . Benjamin 's Land
CEV	Joshua	18	11	Benjamin was the first tribe chosen to receive land . The region for its clans lay between the Judah tribe on the south and the Joseph tribes [ d ] on the north .
CEV	Joshua	18	12	Benjamin 's northern border started at the Jordan River and went up the ridge north of Jericho , then on west into the hill country as far as the Beth-Aven Desert . 13-14 From there it went to Luz , which is now called Bethel . The border ran along the ridge south of Luz , then went to Ataroth-Orech [ e ] and on as far as the mountain south of Lower Beth-Horon . At that point it turned south and became the western border . It went as far south as Kiriath-Baal , a town in Judah now called Kiriath-Jearim .
CEV	Joshua	18	15	Benjamin 's southern border started at the edge of Kiriath-Jearim and went east to the ruins [ f ] and on to Nephtoah Spring .
CEV	Joshua	18	16	From there it went to the bottom of the hill at the northern end of Rephaim Valley . The other side of this hill faces Hinnom Valley , which is on the land that slopes south from Jerusalem . [ g ] The border went down through Hinnom Valley until it reached Enrogel .
CEV	Joshua	18	17	At Enrogel the border curved north and went to Enshemesh and on east to Geliloth , [ h ] which is across the valley from Adummim Pass . Then it went down to the Monument of Bohan , [ i ] who belonged to the Reuben tribe .
CEV	Joshua	18	19	Inside the valley it went south as far as the northern hillside of Beth-Hoglah . The last section of the border went from there to the northern end of the Dead Sea , [ k ] at the mouth of the Jordan River .
CEV	Joshua	18	20	The Jordan River itself was Benjamin 's eastern border . These were the borders of Benjamin 's tribal land , where the clans of Benjamin lived . 21-24 One region of Benjamin 's tribal land had twelve towns with their surrounding villages . Those towns were Jericho , Beth-Hoglah , Emek-Keziz , Beth-Arabah , Zemaraim , Bethel , Avvim , Parah , Ophrah , Chephar-Ammoni , Ophni , and Geba . 25-28 In the other region there were the following

Later , when enemies [ y ] forced them to leave their tribal land , they went to the town of Leshem . They attacked the town , captured it , and killed the people who lived there . Then they settled there themselves and renamed the town Dan after their ancestor . Joshua 's Land 49-51 The Israelites were still gathered in Shiloh in front of the sacred tent , [ z ] when Eleazar the priest , Joshua , and the family leaders of Israel finished giving out the land to the tribes .

CEV	Joshua	19	9	Simeon 's tribal land was actually inside Judah 's territory . Judah had received too much land for the number of people in its tribe , so part of Judah 's land was given to Simeon .

It went east to the edge of the land that belongs to the town of Dabbesheth , and continued on to Maralah and Sarid . It took in the land that belongs to Chislothtabor , then ended at Daberath .

CEV	Joshua	20	20	( A ) One day the Lord told Joshua :
CEV	Joshua	20	2	When Moses was still alive , I commanded him to tell the Israelites about the Safe Towns . Now you tell them that it is time to set up these towns . 3-4 If a person accidentally kills someone and the victim 's relatives say it was murder , they might try to take revenge . [ a ] Anyone accused of murder can run to one of the Safe Towns and be safe from the victim 's relatives . The one needing protection will stand at the entrance to the town gate and explain to the town leaders what happened . Then the leaders will bring that person in and provide a place to live in their town .
CEV	Joshua	20	5	One of the victim 's relatives might come to the town , looking for revenge . But the town leaders must not simply hand over the person accused of murder . After all , the accused and the victim had been neighbors , not enemies .
CEV	Joshua	20	6	The citizens of that Safe Town must come together and hold a trial . They may decide that the victim was killed accidentally and that the accused is not guilty of murder . Everyone found not guilty [ b ] must still live in the Safe Town until the high priest dies . Then they can go back to their own towns and their homes that they had to leave behind .
CEV	Joshua	20	7	The Israelites decided that the following three towns west of the Jordan River would be Safe Towns : Kedesh in Galilee in Naphtali 's hill country , Shechem in Ephraim 's hill country , and Kiriath-Arba in Judah 's hill country . Kiriath-Arba is now called Hebron .
CEV	Joshua	20	8	The Israelites had already decided on the following three towns east of the Jordan River : Bezer in the desert flatlands of Reuben , Ramoth in Gilead , which was a town that belonged to Gad , and Golan in Bashan , which belonged to Manasseh .
CEV	Joshua	20	9	These Safe Towns were set up , so that if Israelites or even foreigners who lived in Israel accidentally killed someone , they could run to one of these towns . There they would be safe until a trial could be held , even if one of the victim 's relatives came looking for revenge . Footnotes - 20.3,4 revenge : At this time in Israel 's history , the clan could appoint a close male relative to find and kill a person who had killed a member of their clan . - 20.6 not guilty : If the person was found to be guilty of murder , the citizens of the Safe Town were to let the victim 's relatives kill the murderer ( see Deuteronomy 19.11-13 ) .

CEV	Joshua	21	21	1-2 ( A ) While the Israelites were still camped at Shiloh in the land of Canaan , the family leaders of the Levi tribe went to speak to the priest Eleazar , Joshua , and the family leaders of the other Israelite tribes . The leaders of Levi said , “ The Lord told Moses that you have to give us towns and provide pastures for our animals. ” [ a ]
CEV	Joshua	21	3	Since the Lord had said this , the leaders of the other Israelite tribes agreed to give some of the towns and pastures from their tribal lands to Levi .
CEV	Joshua	21	4	The leaders asked the Lord to show them [ b ] in what order the clans of Levi would be given towns , and which towns each clan would receive . The Kohath clans were first . The descendants of Aaron , Israel 's first priest , [ c ] were given
CEV	Joshua	21	13	towns and the pastureland around them . Two of these towns were from the tribe of East Manasseh , four from Issachar , four from Asher , and three from Naphtali .

CEV	Joshua	21	43	The Lord gave the Israelites the land he had promised their ancestors , and they captured it and settled in it .

CEV	Joshua	22	22	The Lord is the greatest God ! We ask him to be our witness , because he knows whether or not we were rebellious or unfaithful when we built that altar . If we were unfaithful , then we pray that God wo n't rescue us today . Let us tell you why we built that altar ,
CEV	Joshua	22	4	The Lord promised to give peace to your relatives , and that 's what he has done . Now it 's time for you to go back to your own homes in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan River .
CEV	Joshua	22	5	Moses taught you to love the Lord your God , to be faithful to him , and to worship and obey him with your whole heart and with all your strength . So be very careful to do everything Moses commanded . 6-9 You 've become rich from what you 've taken from your enemies . You have big herds of cattle , lots of silver , gold , bronze , and iron , and plenty of clothes . Take everything home with you and share with the people of your tribe . I pray that God will be kind to you . You are now free to go home . The tribes of Reuben and Gad started back to Gilead , their own land . Moses had given the land of Bashan to the East Manasseh tribe , so they started back along with Reuben and Gad . God had told Moses that these two and a half tribes should conquer Gilead and Bashan , and they had done so . Joshua had given land west of the Jordan River to the other half of the Manasseh tribe , so they stayed at Shiloh in the land of Canaan with the rest of the Israelites . 10-11 The tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh reached the western side of the Jordan River valley [ a ] and built a huge altar there beside the river . When the rest of the Israelites heard what these tribes had done , [ b ]
CEV	Joshua	22	12	the Israelite men met at Shiloh to get ready to attack the two and a half tribes .
CEV	Joshua	22	13	But first they sent a priest , Phinehas the son of Eleazar , to talk with the two and a half tribes .
CEV	Joshua	22	14	Each of the ten tribes at Shiloh sent the leader of one of its families along with Phinehas .
CEV	Joshua	22	15	Phinehas and these leaders went to Gilead and met with the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh . They said :
CEV	Joshua	22	16	( B ) All of the Lord 's people have gathered together and have sent us to find out why you are unfaithful to our God . You have turned your backs on the Lord by building that altar . Why are you rebelling against him ?
CEV	Joshua	22	17	( C ) Was n't our people 's sin at Peor [ c ] terrible enough for you ? The Lord punished us by sending a horrible sickness that killed many of us , and we still suffer because of that sin . [ d ]
CEV	Joshua	22	18	Now you are turning your backs on the Lord again . If you do n't stop rebelling against the Lord at once , he will be angry with the whole nation .
CEV	Joshua	22	19	If you do n't think your land is a fit place to serve God , then move across the Jordan and live with us in the Lord 's own land , where his sacred tent is located . But do n't rebel against the Lord our God or against us by building another altar besides the Lord 's own altar . [ e ]
CEV	Joshua	22	20	( D ) Do n't you remember what happened when Achan was unfaithful [ f ] and took some of the things that belonged to God ? This made God angry with the entire nation . Achan died because he sinned , but he also caused the death of many others .
CEV	Joshua	22	21	The tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh answered :
CEV	Joshua	22	23	and we ask the Lord to punish us if we are lying . We did n't build it so we could turn our backs on the Lord . We did n't even build it so we could offer animal or grain sacrifices to please the Lord or ask his blessing . 24-25 We built that altar because we were worried . Someday your descendants might tell our descendants , “ The Lord made the Jordan River the boundary between us Israelites and you people of Reuben and Gad . The Lord is Israel 's God , but you 're not part of Israel , so you ca n't take part in worshiping the Lord. ” Your descendants might say that and try to make our descendants stop worshiping and obeying the Lord .
CEV	Joshua	22	26	That 's why we decided to build the altar . It is n't for offering sacrifices , not even sacrifices to please the Lord . [ g ] 27-29 To build another altar for offering sacrifices would be the same as turning our backs on the Lord and rebelling against him . We could never do that ! No , we built the altar to remind us and you and the generations to come that we will worship the Lord . And so we will keep bringing our sacrifices to the Lord 's altar , there in front of his sacred tent . Now your descendants will never be able to say to our descendants , “ You ca n't worship the Lord. ” But if they do say this , our descendants can answer back , “ Look at this altar our ancestors built ! It 's like the Lord 's altar , but it is n't for offering sacrifices . It 's here to remind us and you that we belong to the Lord , just as much as you do. ” 30-31 Phinehas and the clan leaders were pleased when they heard the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh explain why they had built the altar . Then Phinehas told them , “ Today we know that the Lord is helping us . You have not been unfaithful to him , and this means that the Lord will not be angry with us. ”
CEV	Joshua	22	32	Phinehas and the clan leaders left Gilead and went back to Canaan to tell the Israelites about their meeting with the Reuben and Gad tribes .
CEV	Joshua	22	33	The Israelites were happy and praised God . There was no more talk about going to war and wiping out the tribes of Reuben and Gad .
CEV	Joshua	22	34	The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar “ A Reminder to Us All That the Lord Is Our God. ” [ h ] Footnotes - 22.10,11 western … valley : Or “ the town of Geliloth , which is in the land of Canaan near the Jordan River. ” - 22.10,11 built a huge altar … tribes had done : According to Deuteronomy 12.5-14 , the Lord wanted the Israelites to have only one altar for offering sacrifices .

CEV	Joshua	23	23	The Lord let Israel live in peace with its neighbors for a long time , and Joshua lived to a ripe old age .
CEV	Joshua	23	2	One day he called a meeting of the leaders of the tribes of Israel , including the old men , the judges , and the officials . Then he told them : I am now very old .
CEV	Joshua	23	3	You have seen how the Lord your God fought for you and helped you defeat the nations who lived in this land . 4-5 There are still some nations left , but the Lord has promised you their land . So when you attack them , he will make them run away . I have already divided their land among your tribes , as I did with the land of the nations I defeated between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea .
CEV	Joshua	23	6	Be sure that you carefully obey everything written in The Book of the Law [ a ] of Moses and do exactly what it says .
CEV	Joshua	23	7	Do n't have anything to do with the nations that live around you . Do n't worship their gods or pray to their idols or make promises in the names of their gods .
CEV	Joshua	23	8	Be as faithful to the Lord as you have always been .
CEV	Joshua	23	9	When you attacked powerful nations , the Lord made them run away , and no one has ever been able to stand up to you .
CEV	Joshua	23	10	( A ) Any one of you can defeat a thousand enemy soldiers , because the Lord God fights for you , just as he promised .
CEV	Joshua	23	11	Be sure to always love the Lord your God . 12-13 Do n't ever turn your backs on him by marrying people from the nations that are left in the land . Do n't even make friends with them . I tell you that if you are friendly with those nations , the Lord wo n't chase them away when you attack . Instead , they 'll be like a trap for your feet , a whip on your back , and thorns in your eyes . And finally , none of you will be left in this good land that the Lord has given you .
CEV	Joshua	23	14	I will soon die , as everyone must . But deep in your hearts you know that the Lord has kept every promise he ever made to you . Not one of them has been broken . 15-16 Yes , when the Lord makes a promise , he does what he has promised . But when he makes a threat , he will also do what he has threatened . The Lord is our God . He gave us this wonderful land and made an agreement with us that we would worship only him . But if you worship other gods , it will make the Lord furious . He will start getting rid of you , and soon not one of you will be left in this good land that he has given you . Footnotes - 23.6 Law : See the note at 8.30-32 . Copyright ©

CEV	Joshua	24	24	The people said , “ The Lord is our God , and we will worship and obey only him. ”
CEV	Joshua	24	2	( A ) Then Joshua told everyone to listen to this message from the Lord , the God of Israel : Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates River , and they worshiped other gods . This continued until the time of your ancestor Terah and his two sons , Abraham and Nahor .
CEV	Joshua	24	3	( B ) But I brought Abraham across the Euphrates River and led him through the land of Canaan . I blessed him by giving him Isaac , the first in a line of many descendants .
CEV	Joshua	24	4	( C ) Then I gave Isaac two sons , Jacob and Esau . I gave Esau the hill country of Mount Seir , but your ancestor Jacob and his children went to live in Egypt . 5-6 ( D ) Later I sent Moses and his brother Aaron to help your people , and I made all those horrible things happen to the Egyptians . I brought your ancestors out of Egypt , but the Egyptians got in their chariots and on their horses and chased your ancestors , catching up with them at the Red Sea . [ b ]
CEV	Joshua	24	7	Your people cried to me for help , so I put a dark cloud between them and the Egyptians . Then I opened up the sea and let your people walk across on dry ground . But when the Egyptians tried to follow , I commanded the sea to swallow them , and they drowned while you watched . You lived in the desert for a long time ,
CEV	Joshua	24	8	( E ) then I brought you into the land east of the Jordan River . The Amorites were living there , and they fought you . But with my help , you defeated them , wiped them out , and took their land .
CEV	Joshua	24	9	( F ) King Balak decided that his nation Moab would go to war against you , so he asked Balaam [ c ] to come and put a curse on you .
CEV	Joshua	24	10	But I would n't listen to Balaam , and I rescued you by making him bless you instead of curse you .
CEV	Joshua	24	11	( G ) You crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho . The rulers of Jericho fought you , and so did the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . I helped you defeat them all .
CEV	Joshua	24	12	( H ) Your enemies ran from you , but not because you had swords and bows and arrows . I made your enemies panic and run away , as I had done with the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River .
CEV	Joshua	24	13	( I ) You did n't have to work for this land—I gave it to you . Now you live in towns you did n't build , and you eat grapes and olives from vineyards and trees you did n't plant .
CEV	Joshua	24	14	Then Joshua told the people : Worship the Lord , obey him , and always be faithful . Get rid of the idols your ancestors worshiped when they lived on the other side of the Euphrates River and in Egypt .
CEV	Joshua	24	15	But if you do n't want to worship the Lord , then choose here and now ! Will you worship the same idols your ancestors did ? Or since you 're living on land that once belonged to the Amorites , maybe you 'll worship their gods . I wo n't . My family and I are going to worship and obey the Lord !
CEV	Joshua	24	16	The people answered : We could never worship other gods or stop worshiping the Lord .
CEV	Joshua	24	17	The Lord is our God . We were slaves in Egypt as our ancestors had been , but we saw the Lord work miracles to set our people free and to bring us out of Egypt . Even though other nations were all around us , the Lord protected us wherever we went .
CEV	Joshua	24	18	And when we fought the Amorites and the other nations that lived in this land , the Lord made them run away . Yes , we will worship and obey the Lord , because the Lord is our God .
CEV	Joshua	24	19	Joshua said : The Lord is fearsome ; he is the one true God , and I do n't think you are able to worship and obey him in the ways he demands . You would have to be completely faithful , and if you sin or rebel , he wo n't let you get away with it .
CEV	Joshua	24	20	If you turn your backs on the Lord and worship the gods of other nations , the Lord will turn against you . He will make terrible things happen to you and wipe you out , even though he had been good to you before .
CEV	Joshua	24	21	But the people shouted , “ We wo n't worship any other gods . We will worship and obey only the Lord ! ”
CEV	Joshua	24	22	Joshua said , “ You have heard yourselves say that you will worship and obey the Lord . Is n't that true ? ” “ Yes , it 's true , ” they answered .
CEV	Joshua	24	23	Joshua said , “ But you still have some idols , like those the other nations worship . Get rid of your idols ! You must decide once and for all that you really want to obey the Lord God of Israel. ”
CEV	Joshua	24	25	Joshua helped Israel make an agreement with the Lord that day at Shechem . Joshua made laws for Israel
CEV	Joshua	24	26	and wrote them down in The Book of the Law of God . [ d ] Then he set up a large stone under the oak tree at the place of worship in Shechem
CEV	Joshua	24	27	and told the people , “ Look at this stone . It has heard everything that the Lord has said to us . Our God can call this stone as a witness if we ever reject him. ”
CEV	Joshua	24	28	Joshua sent everyone back to their homes . Joshua , Joseph , and Eleazar Are Buried
CEV	Joshua	24	29	Not long afterwards , the Lord 's servant Joshua died at the age of
CEV	Joshua	24	110	.
CEV	Joshua	24	30	( J ) The Israelites buried him in his own land at Timnath-Serah , north of Mount Gaash in the hill country of Ephraim .
CEV	Joshua	24	31	As long as Joshua lived , Israel worshiped and obeyed the Lord . There were other leaders old enough to remember everything that the Lord had done for Israel . And for as long as these men lived , Israel continued to worship and obey the Lord .
CEV	Joshua	24	32	( K ) When the people of Israel left Egypt , they brought the bones of Joseph along with them . They took the bones to the town of Shechem and buried them in the field that Jacob had bought for
CEV	Joshua	24	100	pieces of silver [ e ] from Hamor , the founder of Shechem . The town and the field both [ f ] became part of the land belonging to the descendants of Joseph .

CEV	Judges	1	1	After the death of Joshua , the Israelites asked the Lord , “ Which of our tribes should attack the Canaanites first ? ”
CEV	Judges	1	2	“ Judah ! ” the Lord answered . “ I 'll help them take the land. ”
CEV	Judges	1	3	The people of Judah went to their relatives , the Simeon tribe , and said , “ Canaanites live in the land God gave us . Help us fight them , and we will help you. ” Troops from Simeon came to help Judah . 4-5 Together they attacked an army of 10,000 Canaanites and Perizzites at Bezek , and the Lord helped Judah defeat them . During the battle , Judah 's army found out where the king of Bezek [ a ] was , and they attacked there .
CEV	Judges	1	6	The king tried to escape , but soldiers from Judah caught him . They cut off his thumbs and big toes ,
CEV	Judges	1	7	and he said , “ I 've cut off the thumbs and big toes of
CEV	Judges	1	70	kings and made those kings crawl around under my table for scraps of food . Now God is paying me back. ” The army of Judah took the king of Bezek along with them to Jerusalem , where he died .
CEV	Judges	1	8	They attacked Jerusalem , [ b ] captured it , killed everyone who lived there , and then burned it to the ground .
CEV	Judges	1	9	Judah 's army fought the Canaanites who lived in the hill country , the Southern Desert , and the foothills to the west .
CEV	Judges	1	10	After that , they attacked the Canaanites who lived at Hebron , defeating the three clans called [ c ] Sheshai , Ahiman , and Talmai . At that time , Hebron was called Kiriath-Arba .
CEV	Judges	1	11	From Hebron , Judah 's army went to attack Debir , which at that time was called Kiriath-Sepher .
CEV	Judges	1	12	Caleb [ d ] told his troops , “ The man who captures Kiriath-Sepher can marry my daughter Achsah. ”
CEV	Judges	1	13	Caleb 's nephew Othniel captured Kiriath-Sepher , so Caleb let him marry Achsah . Othniel was the son of Caleb 's younger brother Kenaz . [ e ]
CEV	Judges	1	14	Right after the wedding , Achsah started telling Othniel that he [ f ] ought to ask her father for a field . She went to see her father , and while she was getting down from [ g ] her donkey , Caleb asked , “ What 's bothering you ? ”
CEV	Judges	1	15	She answered , “ I need your help . The land you gave me is in the Southern Desert , so please give me some spring-fed ponds for a water supply. ” Caleb gave her a couple of small ponds named Higher Pond and Lower Pond . [ h ]
CEV	Judges	1	16	The people who belonged to the Kenite clan were the descendants of the father-in-law of Moses . They left Jericho [ i ] with the people of Judah and settled near Arad in the Southern Desert of Judah not far from the Amalekites . [ j ]
CEV	Judges	1	17	Judah 's army helped Simeon 's army attack the Canaanites who lived at Zephath . They completely destroyed [ k ] the town and renamed it Hormah . [ l ] 18-19 The Lord helped the army of Judah capture Gaza , Ashkelon , Ekron , and the land near those towns . They also took the hill country . But the people who lived in the valleys had iron chariots , so Judah was not able to make them leave or to take their land .
CEV	Judges	1	20	( A ) The tribe of Judah gave the town of Hebron to Caleb , as Moses had told them to do . Caleb defeated the three Anakim [ m ] clans [ n ] and took over the town . The Benjamin Tribe Does Not Capture Jerusalem

Israel Does Not Get Rid of All the Canaanites 27-28 ( C ) Canaanites lived in the towns of Beth-Shan , Taanach , Dor , Ibleam , Megiddo , and all the villages nearby .

Even though Joshua was gone , the Israelites were faithful to the Lord during the lifetime of those men who had been leaders with Joshua and who had seen the wonderful things the Lord had done for Israel .
CEV	Judges	2	10	After a while the people of Joshua 's generation died , and the next generation did not know the Lord or any of the things he had done for Israel . 11-13 The Lord had brought their ancestors out of Egypt , and they had worshiped him . But now the Israelites stopped worshiping the Lord and worshiped the idols of Baal and Astarte , as well as the idols of other gods from nearby nations . The Lord was so angry 14-15 with the Israelites that he let other nations raid Israel and steal their crops and other possessions . Enemies were everywhere , and the Lord always let them defeat Israel in battle . The Lord had warned Israel he would do this , and now the Israelites were miserable . The Lord Chooses Leaders for Israel
CEV	Judges	2	16	From time to time , the Lord would choose special leaders known as judges . [ d ] These judges would lead the Israelites into battle and defeat the enemies that made raids on them .
CEV	Judges	2	17	In years gone by , the Israelites had been faithful to the Lord , but now they were quick to be unfaithful and to refuse even to listen to these judges . The Israelites disobeyed the Lord , and instead of worshiping him , they worshiped other gods .
CEV	Judges	2	18	When enemies made life miserable for the Israelites , the Lord felt sorry for them . He would choose a judge and help that judge rescue Israel from its enemies . The Lord was kind to Israel as long as that judge lived .
CEV	Judges	2	19	But afterwards , the Israelites would become even more sinful than their ancestors had been . The Israelites were stubborn—they simply would not stop worshiping other gods or following their teachings . The Lord Lets Enemies Test Israel
CEV	Judges	2	20	The Lord was angry with Israel and said : The Israelites have broken the agreement I made with their ancestors . They wo n't obey me ,
CEV	Judges	2	21	so I 'll stop helping them defeat their enemies . Israel still had a lot of enemies when Joshua died ,
CEV	Judges	2	22	and I 'm going to let those enemies stay . I 'll use them to test Israel , because then I can find out if Israel will worship and obey me as their ancestors did .

They put Ehud in charge of taking the taxes to King Eglon , but before Ehud went , he made a double-edged dagger . Ehud was left-handed , so he strapped the dagger to his right thigh , where it was hidden under his robes . 17-18 Ehud and some other Israelites took the taxes to Eglon , who was a very fat man . As soon as they gave the taxes to Eglon , Ehud said it was time to go home . 19-20 Ehud went with the other Israelites as far as the statues [ f ] at Gilgal . [ g ] Then he turned back and went upstairs to the room [ h ] where Eglon had his throne . Ehud said , “ Your Majesty , I need to talk with you in private. ” Eglon replied , “ Do n't say anything yet ! ” His officials left the room , and Eglon stood up as Ehud came closer . “ Yes , ” Ehud said , “ I have a message for you from God ! ”
CEV	Judges	3	21	Ehud pulled out the dagger with his left hand and shoved it so far into Eglon 's stomach 22-23 that even the handle was buried in his fat . Ehud left the dagger there . Then after closing and locking the doors to the room , he climbed through a window onto the porch [ i ]
CEV	Judges	3	24	and left . When the king 's officials came back and saw that the doors were locked , they said , “ The king is probably inside relieving himself. ”

[ j ] Ehud went to the town of Seirah 27-28 in the hill country of Ephraim and started blowing a trumpet as a signal to call the Israelites together . When they came , he shouted , “ Follow me ! The Lord will help us defeat the Moabites. ” The Israelites followed Ehud down to the Jordan valley , and they captured the places where people cross the river on the way to Moab . They would not let anyone go across ,

CEV	Judges	4	4	Deborah the wife of Lappidoth was a prophet and a leader [ a ] of Israel during those days .
CEV	Judges	4	2	So the Lord let the Canaanite King Jabin of Hazor conquer Israel . Sisera , the commander of Jabin 's army , lived in Harosheth-Ha-Goiim .
CEV	Judges	4	3	Jabin 's army had
CEV	Judges	4	900	iron chariots ready . Then he led his army away from Harosheth-Ha-Goiim to the Kishon River .
CEV	Judges	4	20	“ Stand at the entrance to the tent , ” Sisera told her . “ If someone comes by and asks if anyone is inside , tell them ‘ No. ’ ”
CEV	Judges	4	5	She would sit under Deborah 's Palm Tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim , where Israelites would come and ask her to settle their legal cases .
CEV	Judges	4	6	One day , Barak the son of Abinoam was in Kedesh in Naphtali , and Deborah sent word for him to come and talk with her . When he arrived , she said : I have a message for you from the Lord God of Israel ! You are to get together an army of 10,000 men from the Naphtali and Zebulun tribes and lead them to Mount Tabor .
CEV	Judges	4	7	The Lord will trick Sisera into coming out to fight you at the Kishon River . Sisera will be leading King Jabin 's army as usual , and they will have their chariots , but the Lord has promised to help you defeat them .
CEV	Judges	4	8	“ I 'm not going unless you go ! ” Barak told her .
CEV	Judges	4	9	“ All right , I 'll go ! ” she replied . “ But I 'm warning you that the Lord is going to let a woman defeat Sisera , and no one will honor you for winning the battle. ” Deborah and Barak left for Kedesh ,
CEV	Judges	4	10	where Barak called together the troops from Zebulun and Naphtali . Ten thousand soldiers gathered there , and Barak led them out from Kedesh . Deborah went too .
CEV	Judges	4	11	At this time , Heber of the Kenite clan was living near the village of Oak in Zaanannim , [ b ] not far from Kedesh . The Kenites were descendants of Hobab , the father-in-law of Moses , but Heber had moved and had set up his tents away from the rest of the clan .
CEV	Judges	4	12	When Sisera learned that Barak had led an army to Mount Tabor ,
CEV	Judges	4	13	he called his troops together and got all
CEV	Judges	4	14	Deborah shouted , “ Barak , it 's time to attack Sisera ! Because today the Lord is going to help you defeat him . In fact , the Lord has already gone on ahead to fight for you. ” Barak led his 10,000 troops down from Mount Tabor .
CEV	Judges	4	15	And during the battle , the Lord confused Sisera , his chariot drivers , and his whole army . Everyone was so afraid of Barak and his army , that even Sisera jumped down from his chariot and tried to escape .
CEV	Judges	4	16	Barak 's forces went after Sisera 's chariots and army as far as Harosheth-Ha-Goiim . Sisera 's entire army was wiped out .
CEV	Judges	4	17	Only Sisera escaped . He ran to Heber 's camp , because Heber and his family had a peace treaty with the king of Hazor . Sisera went to the tent that belonged to Jael , Heber 's wife .
CEV	Judges	4	18	She came out to greet him and said , “ Come in , sir ! Please come on in . Do n't be afraid. ” After they had gone inside , Sisera lay down , and Jael covered him with a blanket .
CEV	Judges	4	19	“ Could I have a little water ? ” he asked . “ I 'm thirsty. ” Jael opened a leather bottle and poured him some milk , then she covered him back up .
CEV	Judges	4	21	Sisera was exhausted and soon fell fast asleep . Jael took a hammer and drove a tent-peg through his head into the ground , and he died .
CEV	Judges	4	22	Meanwhile , Barak had been following Sisera , and Jael went out to meet him . “ The man you 're looking for is inside , ” she said . “ Come in and I 'll show him to you. ” They went inside , and there was Sisera—dead and stretched out with a tent-peg through his skull .
CEV	Judges	4	23	That same day God defeated the Canaanite King Jabin while the Israelites looked on , and his army was no longer powerful enough to attack the Israelites .

CEV	Judges	6	6	""
CEV	Judges	6	1	Then once again the Israelites started disobeying the Lord , so he let the nation of Midian control Israel for seven years .
CEV	Judges	6	2	The Midianites were so cruel that many Israelites ran to the mountains and hid in caves .
CEV	Judges	6	3	Every time the Israelites planted crops , the Midianites invaded Israel together with the Amalekites and other eastern nations . 4-5 They rode in on their camels , set up their tents , and then let their livestock eat the crops as far as the town of Gaza . The Midianites stole food , sheep , cattle , and donkeys . Like a swarm of locusts , [ a ] they could not be counted , and they ruined the land wherever they went . 6-7 The Midianites took almost everything that belonged to the Israelites , and the Israelites begged the Lord for help . 8-9 Then the Lord sent a prophet to them with this message : I am the Lord God of Israel , so listen to what I say . You were slaves in Egypt , but I set you free and led you out of Egypt into this land . And when nations here made life miserable for you , I rescued you and helped you get rid of them and take their land .
CEV	Judges	6	10	I am your God , and I told you not to worship Amorite gods , even though you are living in the land of the Amorites . But you refused to listen . The Lord Chooses Gideon
CEV	Judges	6	11	One day an angel from the Lord went to the town of Ophrah and sat down under the big tree that belonged to Joash , a member of the Abiezer clan . Joash 's son Gideon was nearby , threshing grain in a shallow pit , where he could not be seen by the Midianites .
CEV	Judges	6	12	The angel appeared and spoke to Gideon , “ The Lord is helping you , and you are a strong warrior. ”
CEV	Judges	6	13	Gideon answered , “ Please do n't take this wrong , but if the Lord is helping us , then why have all of these awful things happened ? We 've heard how the Lord performed miracles and rescued our ancestors from Egypt . But those things happened long ago . Now the Lord has abandoned us to the Midianites. ”
CEV	Judges	6	14	Then the Lord himself said , “ Gideon , you will be strong , because I am giving you the power to rescue Israel from the Midianites. ”
CEV	Judges	6	15	Gideon replied , “ But how can I rescue Israel ? My clan is the weakest one in Manasseh , and everyone else in my family is more important than I am. ”
CEV	Judges	6	16	“ Gideon , ” the Lord answered , “ you can rescue Israel because I am going to help you ! Defeating the Midianites will be as easy as beating up one man. ”
CEV	Judges	6	17	Gideon said , “ It 's hard to believe that I 'm actually talking to the Lord . Please do something so I 'll know that you really are the Lord .
CEV	Judges	6	18	And wait here until I bring you an offering. ” “ All right , I 'll wait , ” the Lord answered .
CEV	Judges	6	19	Gideon went home and killed a young goat , then started boiling the meat . Next , he opened a big sack of flour and made it into thin bread . [ b ] When the meat was done , he put it in a basket and poured the broth into a clay cooking pot . He took the meat , the broth , and the bread and placed them under the big tree .
CEV	Judges	6	20	God 's angel said , “ Gideon , put the meat and the bread on this rock , and pour the broth over them. ” Gideon did as he was told .
CEV	Judges	6	21	The angel was holding a walking stick , and he touched the meat and the bread with the end of the stick . Flames jumped from the rock and burned up the meat and the bread . When Gideon looked , the angel was gone .
CEV	Judges	6	22	Gideon realized that he had seen one of the Lord 's angels . “ Oh ! ” he moaned . “ Now I 'm going to die. ” [ c ]
CEV	Judges	6	23	“ Calm down ! ” the Lord told Gideon . “ There 's nothing to be afraid of . You 're not going to die. ”
CEV	Judges	6	24	Gideon built an altar for worshiping the Lord and called it “ The Lord Calms Our Fears. ” It still stands there in Ophrah , a town in the territory of the Abiezer clan . Gideon Tears Down Baal 's Altar
CEV	Judges	6	25	That night the Lord spoke to Gideon again : Get your father 's second-best bull , the one that 's seven years old . Use it to pull down the altar where your father worships Baal and cut down the sacred pole [ d ] next to the altar .
CEV	Judges	6	26	Then build an altar for worshiping me on the highest part of the hill where your town is built . Use layers of stones for my altar , not just a pile of rocks . Cut up the wood from the pole , make a fire , kill the bull , and burn it as a sacrifice to me .
CEV	Judges	6	27	Gideon chose ten of his servants to help him , and they did everything God had said . But since Gideon was afraid of his family and the other people in Ophrah , he did it all at night .
CEV	Judges	6	28	When the people of the town got up the next morning , they saw that Baal 's altar had been knocked over , and the sacred pole next to it had been cut down . Then they noticed the new altar covered with the remains of the sacrificed bull .
CEV	Judges	6	29	“ Who could have done such a thing ? ” they asked . And they kept on asking , until finally someone told them , “ Gideon the son of Joash did it. ”
CEV	Judges	6	30	The men of the town went to Joash and said , “ Your son Gideon knocked over Baal 's altar and cut down the sacred pole next to it . Hand him over , so we can kill him ! ”
CEV	Judges	6	31	The crowd pushed closer and closer , but Joash replied , “ Are you trying to take revenge for Baal ? Are you trying to rescue Baal ? If you are , you will be the ones who are put to death , and it will happen before another day dawns . If Baal really is a god , let him take his own revenge on someone who tears down his altar. ”
CEV	Judges	6	32	That same day , Joash changed Gideon 's name to Jerubbaal , explaining , “ He tore down Baal 's altar , so let Baal take revenge himself. ” [ e ] Gideon Defeats the Midianites
CEV	Judges	6	33	All the Midianites , Amalekites , and other eastern nations got together and crossed the Jordan River . Then they invaded the land of Israel and set up camp in Jezreel Valley .
CEV	Judges	6	34	The Lord 's Spirit took control of Gideon , and Gideon blew a trumpet as a signal for the men in the Abiezer clan to follow him .
CEV	Judges	6	35	He also sent messengers to the tribes of Manasseh , Asher , Zebulun , and Naphtali , telling the men of these tribes to come and join his army . Then they set out toward the enemy camp . 36-37 Gideon prayed to God , “ I know that you promised to help me rescue Israel , but I need proof . Tonight I 'll spread a sheep skin on the stone floor of that threshing-place over there . If you really will help me rescue Israel , then tomorrow morning let there be dew on the skin , but let the stone floor be dry. ”
CEV	Judges	6	38	And that 's just what happened . Early the next morning , Gideon got up and checked the sheep skin . He squeezed out enough water to fill a bowl .
CEV	Judges	6	39	But Gideon prayed to God again . “ Do n't be angry with me , ” Gideon said . “ Let me try this just one more time , so I 'll really be sure you 'll help me . Only this time , let the skin be dry and the stone floor be wet. ”
CEV	Judges	6	40	That night , God made the stone floor wet with dew , but he kept the sheep skin dry .

CEV	Judges	7	10	but if you 're still afraid , you and your servant Purah should sneak down to their camp .
CEV	Judges	7	11	When you hear what the Midianites are saying , you 'll be brave enough to attack. ” Gideon and Purah worked their way to the edge of the enemy camp , where soldiers were on guard duty .
CEV	Judges	7	12	The camp was huge . The Midianites , Amalekites , and other eastern nations covered the valley like a swarm of locusts . [ d ] And it would be easier to count the grains of sand on a beach than to count their camels .
CEV	Judges	7	13	Gideon overheard one enemy guard telling another , “ I had a dream about a flat [ e ] loaf of barley bread that came tumbling into our camp . It hit the headquarters tent , [ f ] and the tent flipped over and fell to the ground. ”
CEV	Judges	7	14	The other soldier answered , “ Your dream must have been about Gideon , the Israelite commander . It means God will let him and his army defeat the Midianite army and everyone else in our camp. ”
CEV	Judges	7	15	As soon as Gideon heard about the dream and what it meant , he bowed down to praise God . Then he went back to the Israelite camp and shouted , “ Let 's go ! The Lord is going to let us defeat the Midianite army. ”
CEV	Judges	7	16	Gideon divided his little army into three groups of
CEV	Judges	7	100	men , and he gave each soldier a trumpet and a large clay jar with a burning torch inside . 17-18 Gideon said , “ When we get to the enemy camp , spread out and surround it . Then wait for me to blow a signal on my trumpet . As soon as you hear it , blow your trumpets and shout , ‘ Fight for the Lord ! Fight for Gideon ! ’ ”
CEV	Judges	7	19	Gideon and his group reached the edge of the enemy camp a few hours after dark , just after the new guards had come on duty . [ g ] Gideon and his soldiers blew their trumpets and smashed the clay jars that were hiding the torches .
CEV	Judges	7	20	The rest of Gideon 's soldiers blew the trumpets they were holding in their right hands . Then they smashed the jars and held the burning torches in their left hands . Everyone shouted , “ Fight with your swords for the Lord and for Gideon ! ”
CEV	Judges	7	21	The enemy soldiers started yelling and tried to run away . Gideon 's troops stayed in their positions surrounding the camp
CEV	Judges	7	22	and blew their trumpets again . As they did , the Lord made the enemy soldiers pull out their swords and start fighting each other . The enemy army tried to escape from the camp . They ran to Acacia Tree Town , toward Zeredah , [ h ] and as far as the edge of the land that belonged to the town of Abel-Meholah near Tabbath . [ i ]
CEV	Judges	7	23	Gideon sent word for more Israelite soldiers to come from the tribes of Naphtali , Asher , and both halves of Manasseh [ j ] to help fight the Midianites .
CEV	Judges	7	24	He also sent messengers to tell all the men who lived in the hill country of Ephraim , “ Come and help us fight the Midianites ! Put guards at every spring , stream , and well , as far as Beth-Barah before the Midianites can get to them . And guard the Jordan River. ” Troops from Ephraim did exactly what Gideon had asked ,
CEV	Judges	7	25	and they even helped chase the Midianites on the east side of the Jordan River . These troops captured Raven and Wolf , [ k ] the two Midianite leaders . They killed Raven at a large rock that has come to be known as Raven Rock , and they killed Wolf near a wine-pit that has come to be called Wolf Wine-Pit .

CEV	Judges	8	8	After leaving Succoth , Gideon went to Penuel and asked the leaders there for some food . But he got the same answer as he did at Succoth .
CEV	Judges	8	1	But the men were really upset with Gideon and complained , “ When you went to war with Midian , you did n't ask us to help ! Why did you treat us like that ? ”
CEV	Judges	8	2	Gideon answered : Do n't be upset ! Even though you came later , you were able to do much more than I did . It 's just like the grape harvest : The grapes your tribe does n't even bother to pick are better than the best grapes my family can grow .
CEV	Judges	8	3	( A ) Besides , God chose you to capture Raven and Wolf . I did n't do a thing compared to you . By the time Gideon had finished talking , the men of Ephraim had calmed down and were no longer angry with him . Gideon Finishes Destroying the Midianite Army
CEV	Judges	8	4	After Gideon and his

CEV	Judges	8	5	The town of Succoth was nearby , so he went there and asked , “ Please give my troops some food . They are worn out , but we have to keep chasing Zebah and Zalmunna , the two Midianite kings. ”
CEV	Judges	8	6	The town leaders of Succoth answered , “ Why should we feed your army ? We do n't know if you really will defeat Zebah and Zalmunna. ”
CEV	Judges	8	7	“ Just wait ! ” Gideon said . “ After the Lord helps me defeat them , I 'm coming back here . I 'll make a whip out of thorns and rip the flesh from your bones. ”

CEV	Judges	8	77	names .
CEV	Judges	8	15	Gideon went to the town officials and said , “ Here are Zebah and Zalmunna . Remember how you made fun of me ? You said , ‘ We do n't know if you really will defeat those two Midianite kings . So why should we feed your worn-out army ? ’ ”
CEV	Judges	8	16	Gideon made a whip from thorn plants and used it to beat the town officials .
CEV	Judges	8	17	Afterwards he went to Penuel , where he tore down the tower and killed all the town officials . [ d ]
CEV	Judges	8	18	Then Gideon said , “ Zebah and Zalmunna , tell me about the men you killed at Tabor. ” “ They were a lot like you , ” the two kings answered . “ They were dignified , almost like royalty. ”

Gideon also took their purple robes . 27-29 Gideon returned to his home in Ophrah and had the gold made into a statue , which the Israelites soon started worshiping . They were unfaithful to God , and even Gideon and his family were trapped into worshiping the statue . [ g ] The Midianites had been defeated so badly that they were no longer strong enough to attack Israel . And so Israel was at peace for the remaining
CEV	Judges	8	21	“ What 's the matter , Gideon ? ” Zebah and Zalmunna asked . “ Do it yourself , if you 're not too much of a coward ! ” Gideon jumped up and killed them both . Then he took the gold ornaments from the necks of their camels . The Israelites Ask Gideon To Be Their King

CEV	Judges	8	24	But I will ask you to do one thing : Give me all the earrings you took from the enemy. ” The enemy soldiers had been Ishmaelites , [ f ] and they wore gold earrings .
CEV	Judges	8	25	The Israelite soldiers replied , “ Of course we will give you the earrings. ” Then they spread out a robe on the ground and tossed the earrings on it .

CEV	Judges	9	3	Abimelech 's uncles talked it over with the leaders of Shechem who agreed , “ Yes , it would be better for one of our relatives to be king. ”
CEV	Judges	9	4	Then they gave Abimelech
CEV	Judges	9	5	Abimelech and his soldiers went to his father 's home in Ophrah and brought out Gideon 's other sons to a large rock , where they murdered all
CEV	Judges	9	6	The leaders of Shechem , including the priests and the military officers , [ d ] met at the tree next to the sacred rock [ e ] in Shechem to crown Abimelech king .
CEV	Judges	9	7	Jotham heard what they were doing . So he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted down to the people who were there at the meeting : Leaders of Shechem , listen to me , and maybe God will listen to you .
CEV	Judges	9	8	Once the trees searched for someone to be king ; they asked the olive tree , “ Will you be our king ? ”
CEV	Judges	9	10	Then they asked the fig tree , “ Will you be our king ? ”
CEV	Judges	9	11	But the fig tree replied , “ I wo n't stop growing my delicious fruit , just so my branches can wave above the other trees. ”
CEV	Judges	9	12	Next they asked the grape vine , “ Will you be our king ? ”
CEV	Judges	9	13	But the grape vine replied , “ My wine brings cheer to people and gods . I wo n't stop making wine , just so my branches can wave above the other trees. ”
CEV	Judges	9	14	Finally , they went to the thornbush and asked , “ Will you be our king ? ”
CEV	Judges	9	15	The thornbush replied , “ If you really want me to be your king , then come into my shade and I will protect you . But if you 're deceiving me , I 'll start a fire that will spread out and destroy the cedars of Lebanon. ” [ f ] After Jotham had finished telling this story , he said : 16-18 My father Gideon risked his life for you when he fought to rescue you from the Midianites . Did you reward Gideon by being kind to his family ? No , you did not ! You attacked his family and killed all
CEV	Judges	9	19	So , you leaders of Shechem , if you treated Gideon and his family the way you should have , then I hope you and Abimelech will make each other very happy .
CEV	Judges	9	20	But if it was wrong to treat Gideon and his family the way you did , then I pray that Abimelech will destroy you with fire , and I pray that you will do the same to him .
CEV	Judges	9	21	Jotham ran off and went to live in the town of Beer , where he could be safe from his brother Abimelech . Abimelech Destroys Shechem
CEV	Judges	9	22	Abimelech had been a military commander of Israel for three years , 23-24 when God decided to punish him and the leaders of Shechem for killing Gideon 's
CEV	Judges	9	25	Then they sent some men to hide on the hilltops and watch for Abimelech and his troops , while they sent others to rob everyone that went by on the road . But Abimelech found out what they were doing .
CEV	Judges	9	26	One day , Gaal son of Ebed went to live in Shechem . His brothers moved there too , and soon the leaders of Shechem started trusting him .
CEV	Judges	9	27	The time came for the grape harvest , and the people of Shechem went into their vineyards and picked the grapes . They gathered the grapes and made wine . Then they went into the temple of their god and threw a big party . There was a lot of eating and drinking , and before long they were cursing Abimelech .
CEV	Judges	9	28	Gaal said : Hamor was the founder of Shechem , and one of his descendants should be our ruler . But Abimelech 's father was Gideon , so Abimelech is n't really one of us . He should n't be our king , and we should n't have to obey him or Zebul , who rules Shechem for him .
CEV	Judges	9	29	If I were the ruler of Shechem , I 'd get rid of that Abimelech . I 'd tell him , “ Get yourself an even bigger army , and we will still defeat you. ”
CEV	Judges	9	30	Zebul was angry when he found out what Gaal had said .
CEV	Judges	9	31	And so he sent some messengers to Abimelech . But they had to pretend to be doing something else , or they would not have been allowed to leave Shechem . [ h ] Zebul told the messengers to say : Gaal the son of Ebed has come to Shechem along with his brothers , and they have persuaded the people to let Gaal rule Shechem instead of you .
CEV	Judges	9	32	This is what I think you should do . Lead your army here during the night and hide in the fields .
CEV	Judges	9	33	Get up the next morning at sunrise and rush out of your hiding places to attack the town . Gaal and his followers will come out to fight you , but you will easily defeat them .
CEV	Judges	9	34	So one night , Abimelech led his soldiers to Shechem . He divided them into four groups , and they all hid near the town .
CEV	Judges	9	35	The next morning , Gaal went out and stood in the opening of the town gate . Abimelech and his soldiers left their hiding places ,
CEV	Judges	9	36	and Gaal saw them . Zebul was standing there with Gaal , and Gaal remarked , “ Zebul , that looks like a crowd of people coming down from the mountaintops. ” “ No , ” Zebul answered , “ it 's just the shadows of the mountains . It only looks like people moving. ”
CEV	Judges	9	37	“ But Zebul , look over there , ” Gaal said . “ There 's a crowd coming down from the sacred mountain , [ i ] and another group is coming along the road from the tree where people talk with the spirits of the dead. ”
CEV	Judges	9	38	Then Zebul replied , “ What good is all of your bragging now ? You were the one who said Abimelech should n't be the ruler of Shechem . Out there is the army that you made fun of . So go out and fight them ! ”
CEV	Judges	9	39	Gaal and the leaders of Shechem went out and fought Abimelech .
CEV	Judges	9	40	Soon the people of Shechem turned and ran back into the town . However , Abimelech and his troops were close behind and killed many of them along the way .
CEV	Judges	9	41	Abimelech stayed at Arumah , [ j ] and Zebul forced Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem .
CEV	Judges	9	42	The next morning , the people of Shechem were getting ready to work in their fields as usual , but someone told Abimelech about it .
CEV	Judges	9	43	Abimelech divided his army into three groups and set up an ambush in the fields near Shechem . When the people came out of the town , he and his army rushed out from their hiding places and attacked .
CEV	Judges	9	44	Abimelech and the troops with him ran to the town gate and took control of it , while two other groups attacked and killed the people who were in the fields .
CEV	Judges	9	45	He and his troops fought in Shechem all day , until they had killed everyone in town . Then he and his men tore down the houses and buildings and scattered salt [ k ] everywhere .
CEV	Judges	9	46	Earlier that day , the leaders of the temple of El Berith [ l ] at Shechem had heard about the attack . So they went into the temple fortress ,
CEV	Judges	9	47	but Abimelech found out where they were .
CEV	Judges	9	48	He led his troops to Mount Zalmon , where he took an ax and chopped off a tree branch . He lifted the branch onto his shoulder and shouted , “ Hurry ! Cut off a branch just as I did. ”
CEV	Judges	9	49	When they all had branches , they followed Abimelech back to Shechem . They piled the branches against the fortress and set them on fire , burning down the fortress and killing about 1,000 men and women .
CEV	Judges	9	50	After destroying Shechem , Abimelech went to Thebez . He surrounded the town and captured it .
CEV	Judges	9	51	But there was a tall fortress in the middle of the town , and the town leaders and everyone else went inside . Then they barred the gates and went up to the flat roof .
CEV	Judges	9	52	Abimelech and his army rushed to the fortress and tried to force their way inside . Abimelech himself was about to set the heavy wooden doors on fire ,
CEV	Judges	9	53	( A ) when a woman on the roof dropped a large rock [ m ] on his head and cracked his skull .
CEV	Judges	9	54	The soldier who carried his weapons was nearby , and Abimelech told him , “ Take out your sword and kill me . I do n't want people to say that I was killed by a woman ! ” So the soldier ran his sword through Abimelech .
CEV	Judges	9	55	And when the Israelite soldiers saw that their leader was dead , they went back home .
CEV	Judges	9	56	That 's how God punished Abimelech for killing his brothers and bringing shame on his father 's family .
CEV	Judges	9	57	God also punished the people of Shechem for helping Abimelech . [ n ] Everything happened just as Jotham 's curse said it would . Footnotes - 9.1 Gideon : The Hebrew text has “ Jerubbaal , ” another name for Gideon ( see 6.32 ) . - 9.4

CEV	Judges	11	23	The messengers also told the king of Ammon that Jephthah had said : The Lord God of Israel helped his nation get rid of the Amorites and take their land . Now do you think you 're going to take over that same territory ?
CEV	Judges	11	24	If Chemosh your god [ c ] takes over a country and gives it to you , do n't you have a right to it ? And if the Lord takes over a country and gives it to us , the land is ours !
CEV	Judges	11	25	( D ) Are you better than Balak the son of Zippor ? He was the king of Moab , but he did n't quarrel with Israel or start a war with us .
CEV	Judges	11	26	For
CEV	Judges	11	300	years , Israelites have been living in Heshbon and Aroer and the nearby villages , and in the towns along the Arnon River gorge . If the land really belonged to you Ammonites , you would n't have waited until now to try to get it back .
CEV	Judges	11	27	I have n't done anything to you , but it 's certainly wrong of you to start a war . I pray that the Lord will show whether Israel or Ammon is in the right .
CEV	Judges	11	28	But the king of Ammon paid no attention to Jephthah 's message .
CEV	Judges	11	29	Then the Lord 's Spirit took control of Jephthah , and Jephthah went through Gilead and Manasseh , raising an army . Finally , he arrived at Mizpah in Gilead , where
CEV	Judges	11	30	he promised the Lord , “ If you will let me defeat the Ammonites
CEV	Judges	11	31	and come home safely , I will sacrifice to you whoever comes out to meet me first. ”
CEV	Judges	11	32	From Mizpah , Jephthah attacked the Ammonites , and the Lord helped him defeat them .
CEV	Judges	11	33	Jephthah and his army destroyed the
CEV	Judges	11	34	When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah , the first one to meet him was his daughter . She was playing a tambourine and dancing to celebrate his victory , and she was his only child .
CEV	Judges	11	35	( E ) “ Oh no ! ” Jephthah cried . Then he tore his clothes in sorrow and said to his daughter , “ I made a sacred promise to the Lord , and I must keep it . Your coming out to meet me has broken my heart. ”
CEV	Judges	11	36	“ Father , ” she said , “ you made a sacred promise to the Lord , and he let you defeat the Ammonites . Now , you must do what you promised , even if it means I must die .
CEV	Judges	11	37	But first , please let me spend two months , wandering in the hill country with my friends . We will cry together , because I can never get married and have children. ”
CEV	Judges	11	38	“ Yes , you may have two months , ” Jephthah said . She and some other girls left , and for two months they wandered in the hill country , crying because she could never get married and have children .
CEV	Judges	11	39	Then she went back to her father . He did what he had promised , and she never got married . That 's why
CEV	Judges	11	40	every year , Israelite girls walk around for four days , weeping for [ d ] Jephthah 's daughter .

CEV	Judges	12	4	But the men from Ephraim said , “ You people of Gilead are nothing more than refugees from Ephraim . You even live on land that belongs to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. ” [ a ] So Jephthah called together the army of Gilead , then they attacked and defeated the army from Ephraim .
CEV	Judges	12	5	The army of Gilead also posted guards at all the places where the soldiers from Ephraim could cross the Jordan River to return to their own land . Whenever one of the men from Ephraim would try to cross the river , the guards would say , “ Are you from Ephraim ? ” “ No , ” the man would answer , “ I 'm not from Ephraim. ”
CEV	Judges	12	6	The guards would then tell them to say “ Shibboleth , ” because they knew that people of Ephraim could say “ Sibboleth , ” but not “ Shibboleth. ” If the man said “ Sibboleth , ” the guards would grab him and kill him right there .

CEV	Judges	13	13	“ Your wife must be careful to do everything I told her , ” the Lord 's angel answered .
CEV	Judges	13	40	years .
CEV	Judges	13	2	Manoah from the tribe of Dan lived in the town of Zorah . His wife was not able to have children , 3-5 ( A ) but one day an angel from the Lord appeared to her and said : You have never been able to have any children , but very soon you will be pregnant and have a son . He will belong to God [ a ] from the day he is born , so his hair must never be cut . And even before he is born , you must not drink any wine or beer or eat any food forbidden by God 's laws . Your son will begin to set Israel free from the Philistines .
CEV	Judges	13	6	She went to Manoah and said , “ A prophet who looked like an angel of God came and talked to me . I was so frightened , that I did n't even ask where he was from . He did n't tell me his name ,
CEV	Judges	13	7	but he did say that I 'm going to have a baby boy . I 'm not supposed to drink any wine or beer or eat any food forbidden by God 's laws . Our son will belong to God for as long as he lives. ”
CEV	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah prayed , “ Our Lord , please send that prophet again and let him tell us what to do for the son we are going to have. ”
CEV	Judges	13	9	God answered Manoah 's prayer , and the angel went back to Manoah 's wife while she was resting in the fields . Manoah was n't there at the time ,
CEV	Judges	13	10	so she found him and said , “ That same man is here again ! He 's the one I saw the other day. ”
CEV	Judges	13	11	Manoah went with his wife and asked the man , “ Are you the one who spoke to my wife ? ” “ Yes , I am , ” he answered .
CEV	Judges	13	12	Manoah then asked , “ When your promise comes true , what rules must he obey and what will be his work ? ”
CEV	Judges	13	14	“ She must not eat or drink anything made from grapes . She must not drink wine or beer or eat anything forbidden by God 's laws . I told her exactly what to do. ”
CEV	Judges	13	15	“ Please , ” Manoah said , “ stay here with us for just a little while , and we 'll fix a young goat for you to eat. ”
CEV	Judges	13	16	Manoah did n't realize that he was really talking to one of the Lord 's angels . The angel answered , “ I can stay for a little while , although I wo n't eat any of your food . But if you would like to offer the goat as a sacrifice to the Lord , that would be fine. ”
CEV	Judges	13	17	Manoah said , “ Tell us your name , so we can honor you after our son is born. ”
CEV	Judges	13	18	“ No , ” the angel replied . “ You do n't need to know my name . And if you did , you could n't understand it. ”
CEV	Judges	13	19	So Manoah took a young goat over to a large rock he had chosen for an altar , and he built a fire on the rock . Then he killed the goat , and offered it with some grain as a sacrifice to the Lord . But then an amazing thing happened .
CEV	Judges	13	20	The fire blazed up toward the sky , and the Lord 's angel went up toward heaven in the fire . Manoah and his wife bowed down low when they saw what happened .
CEV	Judges	13	21	Although the angel did n't appear to them again , they realized he was one of the Lord 's angels .
CEV	Judges	13	22	Manoah said , “ We have seen an angel . [ b ] Now we 're going to die. ” [ c ]
CEV	Judges	13	23	“ The Lord is n't going to kill us , ” Manoah 's wife responded . “ The Lord accepted our sacrifice and grain offering , and he let us see something amazing . Besides , he told us that we 're going to have a son. ”
CEV	Judges	13	24	Later , Manoah 's wife did give birth to a son , and she named him Samson . As the boy grew , the Lord blessed him .

CEV	Judges	14	14	Samson said : Once so strong and mighty— now so sweet and tasty ! Three days went by , and the Philistine young men had not come up with the right answer .
CEV	Judges	14	2	When he got back home , he told his parents , “ I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah , and I want to marry her . Get her for me ! ” [ a ]
CEV	Judges	14	3	His parents answered , “ There are a lot of women in our clan and even more in the rest of Israel . Those Philistines are pagans . Why would you want to marry one of their women ? ” “ She looks good to me , ” Samson answered . “ Get her for me ! ”
CEV	Judges	14	4	At that time , the Philistines were in control of Israel , and the Lord wanted to stir up trouble for them . That 's why he made Samson desire that woman .
CEV	Judges	14	5	As Samson and his parents reached the vineyards near Timnah , a fierce young lion suddenly roared and attacked Samson .
CEV	Judges	14	6	But the Lord 's Spirit took control of Samson , and with his bare hands he tore the lion apart , as though it had been a young goat . His parents did n't know what he had done , and he did n't tell them .
CEV	Judges	14	7	When they got to Timnah , Samson talked to the woman , and he was sure that she was the one for him .
CEV	Judges	14	8	Later , [ b ] Samson returned to Timnah for the wedding . And when he came near the place where the lion had attacked , he left the road to see what was left of the lion . He was surprised to see that bees were living in the lion 's skeleton , and that they had made some honey .
CEV	Judges	14	9	He scooped up the honey in his hands and ate some of it as he walked along . When he got back to his parents , he gave them some of the honey , and they ate it too . But he did n't tell them he had found the honey in the skeleton of a lion . [ c ]
CEV	Judges	14	10	While Samson 's father went to make the final arrangements with the bride and her family , Samson threw a big party , [ d ] as grooms [ e ] usually did .

CEV	Judges	14	15	Finally , on the seventh [ f ] day of the party they went to Samson 's bride and said , “ You had better trick your husband into telling you the answer to his riddle . Have you invited us here just to rob us ? If you do n't find out the answer , we will burn you and your family to death. ”
CEV	Judges	14	16	Samson 's bride went to him and started crying in his arms . “ You must really hate me , ” she sobbed . “ If you loved me at all , you would have told me the answer to your riddle. ” “ But I have n't even told my parents the answer ! ” Samson replied . “ Why should I tell you ? ”
CEV	Judges	14	17	For the entire seven days of the party , she had been whining and trying to get the answer from him . But that seventh day she put so much pressure on Samson that he finally gave in and told her the answer . She went straight to the young men and told them .
CEV	Judges	14	18	Before sunset that day , the men of the town went to Samson with this answer : A lion is the strongest— honey is the sweetest ! Samson replied , This answer you have given me doubtless came from my bride-to-be .

CEV	Judges	15	15	Samson glanced around and spotted the jawbone of a donkey . The jawbone had not yet dried out , so it was still hard and heavy . Samson grabbed it and started hitting Philistines—he killed 1,000 of them !
CEV	Judges	15	2	“ When you left the way you did , I thought you were divorcing [ b ] her . So I arranged for her to marry one of the young men who were at your party . But my younger daughter is even prettier , and you can have her as your wife. ”
CEV	Judges	15	3	“ This time , ” Samson answered , “ I have a good reason for really hurting some Philistines. ” Samson Takes Revenge
CEV	Judges	15	4	Samson went out and caught
CEV	Judges	15	300	foxes and tied them together in pairs with oil-soaked rags around their tails .
CEV	Judges	15	5	Then Samson took the foxes into the Philistine wheat fields that were ready to be harvested . He set the rags on fire and let the foxes go . The wheat fields went up in flames , and so did the stacks of wheat that had already been cut . Even the Philistine vineyards and olive orchards burned .
CEV	Judges	15	6	Some of the Philistines started asking around , “ Who could have done such a thing ? ” “ It was Samson , ” someone told them . “ He married the daughter of that man in Timnah , but then the man gave Samson 's wife to one of the men at the wedding. ” The Philistine leaders went to Timnah and burned to death Samson 's wife and her father . [ c ]
CEV	Judges	15	7	When Samson found out what they had done , he went to them and said , “ You killed them ! And I wo n't rest until I get even with you. ”
CEV	Judges	15	8	Then Samson started hacking them to pieces with his sword . [ d ] Samson left Philistia and went to live in the cave at Etam Rock .
CEV	Judges	15	9	But it was n't long before the Philistines invaded Judah [ e ] and set up a huge army camp at Jawbone . [ f ]
CEV	Judges	15	10	The people of Judah asked , “ Why have you invaded our land ? ” The Philistines answered , “ We 've come to get Samson . We 're going to do the same things to him that he did to our people. ”
CEV	Judges	15	11	Three thousand men from Judah went to the cave at Etam Rock and said to Samson , “ Do n't you know that the Philistines rule us , and they will punish us for what you did ? ” “ I was only getting even with them , ” Samson replied . “ They did the same things to me first. ”
CEV	Judges	15	12	“ We came here to tie you up and turn you over to them , ” said the men of Judah . “ I wo n't put up a fight , ” Samson answered , “ but you have to promise not to hurt me yourselves. ” 13-14 “ We promise , ” the men said . “ We will only tie you up and turn you over to the Philistines . We wo n't kill you. ” Then they tied up his hands and arms with two brand-new ropes and led him away from Etam Rock . When the Philistines saw that Samson was being brought to their camp at Jawbone , they started shouting and ran toward him . But the Lord 's Spirit took control of Samson , and Samson broke the ropes , as though they were pieces of burnt cloth .
CEV	Judges	15	16	After the fighting was over , he made up this poem about what he had done to the Philistines : I used a donkey 's jawbone to kill a thousand men ; I beat them with this jawbone over and over again . [ g ]

CEV	Judges	16	2	The people who lived in Gaza found out he was there , and they decided to kill him at sunrise . So they went to the city gate and waited all night in the guardrooms on each side of the gate . [ a ]
CEV	Judges	16	3	But Samson got up in the middle of the night and went to the town gate . He pulled the gate doors and doorposts out of the wall and put them on his shoulders . Then he carried them all the way to the top of the hill that overlooks Hebron , [ b ] where he set the doors down , still closed and locked . Delilah Tricks Samson
CEV	Judges	16	4	Some time later , Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah , who lived in Sorek Valley .
CEV	Judges	16	5	The Philistine rulers [ c ] went to Delilah and said , “ Trick Samson into telling you what makes him so strong and what can make him weak . Then we can tie him up so he ca n't get away . If you find out his secret , we will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver. ” [ d ]
CEV	Judges	16	6	The next time Samson was at Delilah 's house , she asked , “ Samson , what makes you so strong ? How can I tie you up so you ca n't get away ? Come on , you can tell me. ”
CEV	Judges	16	7	Samson answered , “ If someone ties me up with seven new bowstrings that have never been dried , [ e ] it will make me just as weak as anyone else. ” 8-9 The Philistine rulers gave seven new bowstrings to Delilah . They also told some of their soldiers to go to Delilah 's house and hide in the room where Samson and Delilah were . If the bowstrings made Samson weak , they would be able to capture him . Delilah tied up Samson with the bowstrings and shouted , “ Samson , the Philistines are attacking ! ” Samson snapped the bowstrings , as though they were pieces of scorched string . The Philistines had not found out why Samson was so strong .
CEV	Judges	16	10	“ You lied and made me look like a fool , ” Delilah said . “ Now tell me . How can I really tie you up ? ”
CEV	Judges	16	11	Samson answered , “ Use some new ropes . If I 'm tied up with ropes that have never been used , I 'll be just as weak as anyone else. ”
CEV	Judges	16	12	Delilah got new ropes , and again some Philistines hid in the room . Then she tied up Samson 's arms and shouted , “ Samson , the Philistines are attacking ! ” Samson snapped the ropes as if they were threads .
CEV	Judges	16	13	“ You 're still lying and making a fool of me , ” Delilah said . “ Tell me how I can tie you up ! ” “ My hair is in seven braids , ” Samson replied . “ If you weave my braids into the threads on a loom and nail the loom [ f ] to a wall , then I will be as weak as anyone else. ”
CEV	Judges	16	14	While Samson was asleep , Delilah wove his braids into the threads on a loom and nailed the loom to a wall . [ g ] Then she shouted , “ Samson , the Philistines are attacking ! ” Samson woke up and pulled the loom free from its posts in the ground and from the nails in the wall . Then he pulled his hair free from the woven cloth .
CEV	Judges	16	15	“ Samson , ” Delilah said , “ you claim to love me , but you do n't mean it ! You 've made me look like a fool three times now , and you still have n't told me why you are so strong. ”
CEV	Judges	16	17	Finally , Samson told her the truth . “ I have belonged to God [ h ] ever since I was born , so my hair has never been cut . If it were ever cut off , my strength would leave me , and I would be as weak as anyone else. ”
CEV	Judges	16	18	Delilah realized that he was telling the truth . So she sent someone to tell the Philistine rulers , “ Come to my house one more time . Samson has finally told me the truth. ” The Philistine rulers went to Delilah 's house , and they brought along the silver they had promised her .
CEV	Judges	16	19	Delilah had lulled Samson to sleep with his head resting in her lap . She signaled to one of the Philistine men as she began cutting off Samson 's seven braids . And by the time she was finished , Samson 's strength was gone . Delilah tied him up

CEV	Judges	16	21	The Philistines grabbed Samson and poked out his eyes . They took him to the prison in Gaza and chained him up . Then they put him to work , turning a millstone to grind grain .
CEV	Judges	16	22	But they did n't cut his hair any more , so it started growing back .
CEV	Judges	16	23	The Philistine rulers threw a big party and sacrificed a lot of animals to their god Dagon . The rulers said : Samson was our enemy , but our god Dagon helped us capture him ! 24-25 Everyone there was having a good time , and they shouted , “ Bring out Samson—he 's still good for a few more laughs ! ” The rulers had Samson brought from the prison , and when the people saw him , this is how they praised their god : Samson ruined our crops and killed our people . He was our enemy , but our god helped us capture him . They made fun of Samson for a while , then they told him to stand near the columns that supported the roof .
CEV	Judges	16	26	A young man was leading Samson by the hand , and Samson said to him , “ I need to lean against something . Take me over to the columns that hold up the roof. ”
CEV	Judges	16	27	The Philistine rulers were celebrating in a temple packed with people and with 3,000 [ i ] more on the flat roof . They had all been watching Samson and making fun of him . [ j ]
CEV	Judges	16	28	Samson prayed , “ Please remember me , Lord God . The Philistines poked out my eyes , but make me strong one last time , so I can take revenge for at least one of my eyes ! ” [ k ]
CEV	Judges	16	29	Samson was standing between the two middle columns that held up the roof . He felt around and found one column with his right hand , and the other with his left hand .
CEV	Judges	16	30	Then he shouted , “ Let me die with the Philistines ! ” He pushed against the columns as hard as he could , and the temple collapsed with the Philistine rulers and everyone else still inside . Samson killed more Philistines when he died than he had killed during his entire life .

CEV	Judges	17	2	One day he told his mother , “ Do you remember those 1,100 pieces of silver [ b ] that were stolen from you ? I was there when you put a curse on whoever stole them . Well , I 'm the one who did it. ” His mother answered , “ I pray that the Lord will bless [ c ] you , my son. ” 3-4 Micah returned the silver to his mother , and she said , “ I give this silver to the Lord , so my son can use it to make an idol. ” Turning to her son , she said , “ Micah , now the silver belongs to you. ” But Micah handed it back to his mother .

CEV	Judges	17	6	( A ) This was before kings ruled Israel , so all the Israelites did whatever they thought was right . 7-8 One day a young Levite came to Micah 's house in the hill country of Ephraim . He had been staying with one of the clans of Judah in Bethlehem , but he had left Bethlehem to find a new place to live [ f ] where he could be a priest . [ g ]
CEV	Judges	17	9	“ Where are you from ? ” Micah asked . “ I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah , ” the man answered , “ and I 'm on my way to find a new place to live. ”
CEV	Judges	17	10	Micah said , “ Why do n't you stay here with me ? You can be my priest and tell me what God wants me to do . Every year I 'll give you ten pieces of silver and one complete set of clothes , and I 'll provide all your food. ” The young man went for a walk , 11-12 then he agreed to stay with Micah and be his priest . He lived in Micah 's house , and Micah treated him like one of his own sons .

CEV	Judges	18	18	These things happened before kings ruled Israel . The Tribe of Dan Takes Micah 's Priest and Idols About this time , the tribe of Dan was looking for a place to live . The other tribes had land , but the people of Dan did not really have any to call their own .
CEV	Judges	18	2	The tribe chose five warriors to represent their clans and told them , “ Go and find some land where we can live. ” The warriors left the area of Zorah and Eshtaol and went into the hill country of Ephraim . One night they stayed at Micah 's house ,
CEV	Judges	18	3	because they heard the young Levite talking , and they knew from his accent that he was from the south . They asked him , “ What are you doing here ? Who brought you here ? ”
CEV	Judges	18	4	The Levite replied , “ Micah hired me as his priest. ” Then he told them how well Micah had treated him .
CEV	Judges	18	5	“ Please talk to God for us , ” the men said . “ Ask God if we will be successful in what we are trying to do. ”
CEV	Judges	18	6	“ Do n't worry , ” answered the priest . “ The Lord is pleased with what you are doing. ”
CEV	Judges	18	7	The five men left and went to the town of Laish , whose people were from Sidon , [ a ] but Sidon was too far away to protect them . Even though their town had no walls , the people thought they were safe from attack . So they had not asked anyone else [ b ] for protection , which meant that the tribe of Dan could easily take over Laish . [ c ]
CEV	Judges	18	8	The five men went back to Zorah and Eshtaol , where their relatives asked , “ Did you find any land ? ” 9-10 “ Let 's go ! ” the five men said . “ We saw some very good land with enough room for all of us , and it has everything we will ever need . What are you waiting for ? Let 's attack and take it . You 'll find that the people think they 're safe , but God is giving the land to us. ”
CEV	Judges	18	11	Six hundred men from the tribe of Dan strapped on their weapons and left Zorah and Eshtaol with their families . [ d ]
CEV	Judges	18	12	One night they camped near Kiriath-Jearim in the territory of Judah , and that 's why the place just west of Kiriath-Jearim is still known as Dan 's Camp . [ e ]
CEV	Judges	18	13	Then they went into the hill country of Ephraim . When they came close to Micah 's house ,
CEV	Judges	18	14	the five men who had been spies asked the other warriors , “ Did you know that someone in this village has several idols and a sacred priestly vest ? What do you think we should do about it ? ” 15-18 The
CEV	Judges	18	600	warriors left the road and went to the house on Micah 's property where the young Levite priest lived . They stood at the gate and greeted the priest . Meanwhile , the five men who had been there before went into Micah 's house and took the sacred priestly vest and the idols . “ Hey ! ” the priest shouted . “ What do you think you 're doing ? ”
CEV	Judges	18	19	“ Quiet ! ” the men said . “ Keep your mouth shut and listen . Why do n't you come with us and be our priest , so you can tell us what God wants us to do ? You could stay here and be a priest for one man 's family , but would n't you rather be the priest for a clan or even a whole tribe of Israel ? ”
CEV	Judges	18	20	The priest really liked that idea . So he took the vest and the idols and joined the others

CEV	Judges	18	22	They had traveled for some time before Micah asked his neighbors to help him get his things back . He and his men caught up with the people of Dan
CEV	Judges	18	23	and shouted for them to stop . They turned to face him and asked , “ What 's wrong ? Why did you bring all these men ? ”
CEV	Judges	18	24	Micah answered , “ You know what 's wrong . You stole the gods [ f ] I made , and you took my priest . I do n't have anything left. ”
CEV	Judges	18	25	“ We do n't want to hear any more about it , ” the people of Dan said . “ And if you make us angry , you 'll only get yourself and your family killed. ”
CEV	Judges	18	26	After saying this , they turned and left . Micah realized there was no way he could win a fight with them , and so he went back home . The Tribe of Dan Captures Laish 27-28 The tribe of Dan took Micah 's priest and the things Micah had made , and headed for Laish , which was located in a valley controlled by the town of Beth-Rehob . Laish was defenseless , because it had no walls and was too far from Sidon for the Sidonians to help defend it . The leaders of Laish had not even asked nearby towns to help them in case of an attack . The warriors from Dan made a surprise attack on Laish , killing everyone and burning it down . Then they rebuilt the town and settled there themselves .
CEV	Judges	18	29	But they named it Dan , after one of Israel 's [ g ] sons , who was the ancestor of their tribe . 30-31 Even though the place of worship [ h ] was in Shiloh , the people of Dan set up the idol Micah had made . They worshiped the idol , and the Levite was their priest . His name was Jonathan , and he was a descendant of Gershom the son of Moses . [ i ] His descendants served as priests for the tribe of Dan , until the people of Israel were taken away as prisoners by their enemies .

CEV	Judges	19	19	We brought food for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves , so we do n't need anything except a place to sleep. ”
CEV	Judges	19	2	but she was unfaithful and went back to live with her family in Bethlehem . Four months later
CEV	Judges	19	3	her husband decided to try and talk her into coming back . So he went to Bethlehem , taking along a servant and two donkeys . He talked with his wife , and she invited him into her family 's home . Her father was glad to see him
CEV	Judges	19	4	and did not want him to leave . So the man stayed three days , eating and drinking with his father-in-law .
CEV	Judges	19	5	When everyone got up on the fourth day , the Levite started getting ready to go home . But his father-in-law said , “ Do n't leave until you have a bite to eat . You 'll need strength for your journey. ”
CEV	Judges	19	6	The two men sat down together and ate a big meal . “ Come on , ” the man 's father-in-law said . “ Stay tonight and have a good time. ”
CEV	Judges	19	7	The Levite tried to leave , but his father-in-law insisted , and he spent one more night there .
CEV	Judges	19	8	The fifth day , the man got up early to leave , but his wife 's father said , “ You need to keep up your strength ! Why do n't you leave right after lunch ? ” So the two of them started eating .
CEV	Judges	19	9	Finally , the Levite got up from the meal , so he and his wife and servant could leave . “ Look , ” his father-in-law said , “ it 's already late afternoon , and if you leave now , you wo n't get very far before dark . Stay with us one more night and enjoy yourself . Then you can get up early tomorrow morning and start home. ”
CEV	Judges	19	10	But the Levite decided not to spend the night there again . He had the saddles put on his two donkeys , then he and his wife and servant traveled as far as Jebus , which is now called Jerusalem .
CEV	Judges	19	11	It was beginning to get dark , and the man 's servant said , “ Let 's stop and spend the night in this town where the Jebusites live. ”
CEV	Judges	19	12	“ No , ” the Levite answered . “ They are n't Israelites , and I refuse to spend the night there . We 'll stop for the night at Gibeah ,
CEV	Judges	19	13	or maybe we can even reach Ramah [ c ] before dark. ”
CEV	Judges	19	14	They walked on and reached Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin just after sunset .
CEV	Judges	19	15	They left the road and went into Gibeah . But the Levite could n't find a house where anyone would let them spend the night , and they sat down in the open area just inside the town gates .
CEV	Judges	19	16	Soon an old man came in through the gates on his way home from working in the fields . Most of the people who lived in Gibeah belonged to the tribe of Benjamin , but this man was originally from the hill country of Ephraim .
CEV	Judges	19	17	He noticed that the Levite was just in town to spend the night . “ Where are you going ? ” the old man asked . “ Where did you come from ? ”
CEV	Judges	19	18	“ We 've come from Bethlehem in Judah , ” the Levite answered . “ We went there on a visit . Now we 're going to the place where the Lord is worshiped , and later we will return to our home in the hill country of Ephraim . But no one here will let us spend the night [ d ] in their home .
CEV	Judges	19	20	The old man said , “ You are welcome to spend the night in my home and to be my guest , but do n't stay out here ! ”
CEV	Judges	19	21	The old man brought them into his house and fed their donkeys . Then he and his guests washed their feet [ e ] and began eating and drinking .
CEV	Judges	19	22	( A ) They were having a good time , when some worthless men of that town surrounded the house and started banging on the door and shouting , “ A man came to your house tonight . Send him out , so we can have sex with him ! ”
CEV	Judges	19	23	The old man went outside and said , “ My friends , please do n't commit such a horrible crime against a man who is a guest in my house .
CEV	Judges	19	24	Let me send out my daughter instead . She 's a virgin . And I 'll even send out the man 's wife . [ f ] You can rape them or do whatever else you want , but please do n't do such a horrible thing to this man. ”
CEV	Judges	19	25	The men refused to listen , so the Levite grabbed his wife and shoved her outside . The men raped her and abused her all night long . Finally , they let her go just before sunrise ,
CEV	Judges	19	26	and it was almost daybreak when she went back to the house where her husband [ g ] was staying . She collapsed at the door and lay there until sunrise .
CEV	Judges	19	27	About that time , her husband woke up and got ready to leave . He opened the door and went outside , where he found his wife lying at the door with her hands on the doorstep .
CEV	Judges	19	28	“ Get up ! ” he said . “ It 's time to leave. ” But his wife did n't move . [ h ] He lifted her body onto his donkey and left .
CEV	Judges	19	29	( B ) When he got home , he took a butcher knife and cut her body into twelve pieces . Then he told some messengers , “ Take one piece to each tribe of Israel
CEV	Judges	19	30	and ask everyone if anything like this has ever happened since Israel left Egypt . Tell them to think about it , talk it over , and tell us what should be done. ” Everyone who saw a piece of the body said , “ This is horrible !

CEV	Judges	20	20	Then they left their camp and got into position to attack the army of Benjamin . The War Between Israel and Benjamin
CEV	Judges	20	4	The husband of the murdered woman answered : My wife [ a ] and I went into the town of Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night .
CEV	Judges	20	5	Later that night , the men of Gibeah surrounded the house . They wanted to kill me , but instead they raped and killed my wife .
CEV	Judges	20	6	It was a terrible thing for Israelites to do ! So I cut up her body and sent the pieces everywhere in Israel .
CEV	Judges	20	7	You are the people of Israel , and you must decide today what to do about the men of Gibeah .
CEV	Judges	20	8	The whole army was in agreement , and they said , “ None of us will go home . 9-10 We 'll send one tenth of the men from each tribe to get food for the army . And we 'll ask God [ b ] who should attack Gibeah , because those men [ c ] deserve to be punished for committing such a horrible crime in Israel. ”
CEV	Judges	20	11	Everyone agreed that Gibeah had to be punished .
CEV	Judges	20	12	The tribes of Israel sent messengers to every town and village in Benjamin . And wherever the messengers went , they said , “ How could those worthless men in Gibeah do such a disgusting thing ?
CEV	Judges	20	13	We ca n't allow such a terrible crime to go unpunished in Israel ! Hand the men over to us , and we will put them to death. ” But the people of Benjamin refused to listen to the other Israelites .
CEV	Judges	20	14	Men from towns all over Benjamin 's territory went to Gibeah and got ready to fight Israel .
CEV	Judges	20	15	The Benjamin tribe had 26,000 soldiers , not counting the
CEV	Judges	20	700	left-handed experts who could sling a rock [ d ] at a target the size of a hair and hit it every time .
CEV	Judges	20	16	In this army there were
CEV	Judges	20	17	The other Israelite tribes organized their army and found they had 400,000 experienced soldiers .
CEV	Judges	20	18	So they went to the place of worship at Bethel [ e ] and asked God , “ Which tribe should be the first to attack the people of Benjamin ? ” “ Judah , ” the Lord answered .
CEV	Judges	20	19	The next morning the Israelite army moved its camp to a place near Gibeah .
CEV	Judges	20	21	Benjamin 's soldiers came out of Gibeah and attacked , and when the day was over , 22,000 Israelite soldiers lay dead on the ground . 22-24 The people of Israel went to the place of worship and cried until sunset . Then they asked the Lord , “ Should we attack the people of Benjamin again , even though they are our relatives ? ” “ Yes , ” the Lord replied , “ attack them again ! ” The Israelite soldiers encouraged each other to be brave and to fight hard . Then the next day they went back to Gibeah and took up the same positions as they had before .
CEV	Judges	20	25	That same day , Benjamin 's soldiers came out of Gibeah and attacked , leaving another 18,000 Israelite soldiers dead on the battlefield . 26-28 The people of Israel went to the place of worship at Bethel , [ f ] where the sacred chest was being kept . They sat on the ground , crying and not eating for the rest of the day . Then about sunset , they offered sacrifices to please the Lord and to ask his blessing . [ g ] Phinehas [ h ] the priest then prayed , “ Our Lord , the people of Benjamin are our relatives . Should we stop fighting or attack them again ? ” “ Attack ! ” the Lord answered . “ Tomorrow I will let you defeat them. ”
CEV	Judges	20	29	The Israelites surrounded Gibeah , but stayed where they could not be seen .
CEV	Judges	20	30	Israelites in the fields and along the road between Gibeah and Bethel . The men of Benjamin were thinking , “ We 're mowing them down like we did before. ” The Israelites were running away , but they headed for Baal-Tamar , where they regrouped . They had set an ambush , and they were sure it would work . Ten thousand of Israel 's best soldiers had been hiding west of Gibeah , [ i ] and as soon as the men of Benjamin chased the Israelites into the countryside , these 10,000 soldiers made a surprise attack on the town gates . They dashed in and captured Gibeah , killing everyone there . Then they set the town on fire , because the smoke would be the signal for the other Israelite soldiers to turn and attack the soldiers of Benjamin . The fighting had been so heavy around the soldiers of Benjamin , that they did not know the trouble they were in . But then they looked back and saw clouds of smoke rising from the town . They looked in front and saw the soldiers of Israel turning to attack . This terrified them , because they realized that something horrible was happening . And it was horrible—over 25,000 [ j ] soldiers of Benjamin died that day , and those who were left alive knew that the Lord had given Israel the victory .
CEV	Judges	20	42	The men of Benjamin headed down the road toward the desert , trying to escape from the Israelites . But the Israelites stayed right behind them , keeping up their attack . Men even came out of the nearby towns to help kill the men of Benjamin ,
CEV	Judges	20	43	who were having to fight on all sides . The Israelite soldiers never let up their attack . [ k ] They chased and killed the warriors of Benjamin as far as a place directly east of Gibeah , [ l ]
CEV	Judges	20	44	until 18,000 of these warriors lay dead .
CEV	Judges	20	45	Some other warriors of Benjamin turned and ran down the road toward Rimmon Rock in the desert . The Israelites killed 5,000 of them on the road , then chased the rest until they had killed [ m ] 2,000 more .
CEV	Judges	20	46	Twenty-five thousand soldiers of Benjamin died that day , all of them experienced warriors .
CEV	Judges	20	47	Only
CEV	Judges	20	600	of them finally made it into the desert to Rimmon Rock , where they stayed for four months .

CEV	Judges	21	21	Wait there for the young women of Shiloh to come out and perform their dances . Then rush out and grab one of the young women , then take her home as your wife .
CEV	Judges	21	2	After the war with Benjamin , the Israelites went to the place of worship at Bethel and sat there until sunset . They cried loudly and bitterly
CEV	Judges	21	3	and prayed , “ Our Lord , you are the God of Israel . Why did you let this happen ? Now one of our tribes is almost gone. ”
CEV	Judges	21	4	Early the next morning , the Israelites built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the Lord and to ask his blessing . [ b ]
CEV	Judges	21	5	Then they asked each other , “ Did any of the tribes of Israel fail to come to the place of worship ? We made a sacred promise that anyone who did n't come to the meeting at Mizpah would be put to death. ”
CEV	Judges	21	6	The Israelites were sad about what had happened to the Benjamin tribe , and they said , “ One of our tribes was almost wiped out .
CEV	Judges	21	7	Only a few men of Benjamin were n't killed in the war . We need to get wives for them , so the tribe wo n't completely disappear . But how can we do that , after promising in the Lord 's name that we would n't let them marry any of our daughters ? ” 8-9 Again the Israelites asked , “ Did any of the tribes stay away from the meeting at Mizpah ? ” After asking around , they discovered that no one had come from Jabesh in Gilead . 10-11 So they sent 12,000 warriors with these orders : “ Attack Jabesh in Gilead and kill everyone , except the women who have never been married. ”
CEV	Judges	21	12	The warriors attacked Jabesh in Gilead , and returned to their camp at Shiloh in Canaan [ c ] with
CEV	Judges	21	400	young women .
CEV	Judges	21	13	The Israelites met and sent messengers to the men of Benjamin at Rimmon Rock , telling them that the Israelites were willing to make peace with them .
CEV	Judges	21	14	So the men of Benjamin came back from Rimmon Rock , and the Israelites let them marry the young women from Jabesh . But there were n't enough women .
CEV	Judges	21	15	The Israelites were very sad , because the Lord had almost wiped out one of their tribes .
CEV	Judges	21	16	Then their leaders said : All the women of the Benjamin tribe were killed . How can we get wives for the men of Benjamin who are left ?
CEV	Judges	21	17	If they do n't have children , one of the Israelite tribes will die out .
CEV	Judges	21	18	But we ca n't let the men of Benjamin marry any of our daughters . We made a sacred promise not to do that , and if we break our promise , we will be under our own curse .
CEV	Judges	21	19	Then someone suggested , “ What about the Lord 's Festival that takes place each year in Shiloh ? It 's held north of Bethel , south of Lebonah , and just east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem. ”
CEV	Judges	21	20	The leaders told the men of Benjamin who still did not have wives : Go to Shiloh and hide in the vineyards near the festival .
CEV	Judges	21	22	If the fathers or brothers of these women complain about this , we 'll say , “ Be kind enough to let those men keep your daughter . After all , we could n't get enough wives for all the men of Benjamin in the battle at Jabesh . And because you did n't give them permission to marry your daughters , you wo n't be under the curse we earlier agreed on. ” [ d ]
CEV	Judges	21	23	The men of Benjamin went to Shiloh and hid in the vineyards . The young women soon started dancing , and each man grabbed one of them and carried her off . Then the men of Benjamin went back to their own land and rebuilt their towns and started living in them again .
CEV	Judges	21	24	Afterwards , the rest of the Israelites returned to their homes and families . Israel Was Not Ruled by a King

CEV	Ruth	1	1	1-2 Before Israel was ruled by kings , Elimelech from the clan of Ephrath lived in the town of Bethlehem . His wife was named Naomi , and their two sons were Mahlon and Chilion .

CEV	Ruth	1	12	You must go back home , because I am too old to marry again . Even if I got married tonight and later had more sons ,
CEV	Ruth	1	13	would you wait for them to become old enough to marry ? No , my daughters ! Life is harder for me than it is for you , because the Lord has turned against me. ” [ c ]
CEV	Ruth	1	14	They cried again . Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye , but Ruth held on to her .
CEV	Ruth	1	15	Naomi then said to Ruth , “ Look , your sister-in-law is going back to her people and to her gods ! Why do n't you go with her ? ”

CEV	Ruth	2	2	1-3 ( A ) One day , Ruth said to Naomi , “ Let me see if I can find someone who will let me pick up the grain left in the fields by the harvest workers. ” [ a ] Naomi answered , “ Go ahead , my daughter. ” So immediately Ruth went out to pick up grain in a field . She did n't know it was owned by Boaz , a relative of Naomi 's husband Elimelech , as well as a rich and important man .
CEV	Ruth	2	4	When Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and went out to his field , he said to the harvest workers , “ The Lord bless you ! ” They replied , “ And may the Lord bless you ! ”
CEV	Ruth	2	5	Then Boaz asked the man in charge of the harvest workers , “ Who is that young woman ? ”
CEV	Ruth	2	6	The man answered , “ She is the one who came back from Moab with Naomi .
CEV	Ruth	2	7	She asked if she could pick up grain left by the harvest workers , and she has been working all morning without a moment 's rest. ” [ b ]
CEV	Ruth	2	8	Boaz went over to Ruth and said , “ I think it would be best for you not to pick up grain in anyone else 's field . Stay here with the women
CEV	Ruth	2	9	and follow along behind them , as they gather up what the men have cut . I have warned the men not to bother you , and whenever you are thirsty , you can drink from their water jars. ”
CEV	Ruth	2	10	Ruth bowed down to the ground and said , “ You know I come from another country . Why are you so good to me ? ”
CEV	Ruth	2	11	Boaz answered , “ I 've heard how you 've helped your mother-in-law ever since your husband died . You even left your own father and mother to come and live in a foreign land among people you do n't know .
CEV	Ruth	2	12	I pray that the Lord God of Israel will reward you for what you have done . And now that you have come to him for protection , I pray that he will bless you. ”
CEV	Ruth	2	13	Ruth replied , “ Sir , it 's good of you to speak kindly to me and make me feel so welcome . I 'm not even one of your servants. ”
CEV	Ruth	2	14	At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth , “ Come , eat with us . Have some bread and dip it in the sauce. ” At once she sat down with the workers , and Boaz handed her some roasted grain . Ruth ate all she wanted and had some left over .
CEV	Ruth	2	15	When Ruth left to start picking up grain , Boaz told his men , “ Do n't stop her , even if she picks up grain from where it is stacked .
CEV	Ruth	2	16	Be sure to pull out some stalks of grain from the bundles and leave them on the ground for her . And do n't speak harshly to her ! ”
CEV	Ruth	2	17	Ruth worked in the field until evening . Then after she had pounded the grain off the stalks , she had a large basket full of grain .
CEV	Ruth	2	18	She took the grain to town and showed Naomi how much she had picked up . Ruth also gave her the food left over from her lunch .
CEV	Ruth	2	19	Naomi said , “ Where did you work today ? Whose field was it ? God bless the man who treated you so well ! ” Then Ruth told her that she had worked in the field of a man named Boaz .
CEV	Ruth	2	20	( B ) “ The Lord bless Boaz ! ” Naomi replied . “ He [ c ] has shown that he is still loyal to the living and to the dead . Boaz is a close relative , one of those who is supposed to look after us. ”
CEV	Ruth	2	21	Ruth told her , “ Boaz even said I could stay in the field with his workers until they had finished harvesting all his grain. ”
CEV	Ruth	2	22	Naomi replied , “ My daughter , it 's good that you can pick up grain alongside the women who work in his field . Who knows what might happen to you in someone else 's field ! ”
CEV	Ruth	2	23	And so , Ruth stayed close to the women , while picking up grain in his field . Ruth worked in the fields until the barley and wheat were harvested . And all this time she lived with Naomi . Copyright ©

CEV	Ruth	3	3	Now take a bath and put on some perfume , then dress in your best clothes . Go where he is working , but do n't let him see you until he has finished eating and drinking .
CEV	Ruth	3	2	You have been picking up grain alongside the women who work for Boaz , and you know he is a relative of ours . Tonight he will be threshing the grain .
CEV	Ruth	3	4	Watch where he goes to spend the night , then when he is asleep , lift the cover and lie down at his feet . [ a ] He will tell you what to do .
CEV	Ruth	3	5	Ruth answered , “ I 'll do whatever you say. ”
CEV	Ruth	3	6	She went out to the place where Boaz was working and did what Naomi had told her .
CEV	Ruth	3	7	After Boaz finished eating and drinking and was feeling happy , he went over and fell asleep near the pile of grain . Ruth slipped over quietly . She lifted the cover and lay down near his feet .
CEV	Ruth	3	8	In the middle of the night , Boaz suddenly woke up and was shocked to see a woman lying at his feet .
CEV	Ruth	3	9	“ Who are you ? ” he asked . “ Sir , I am Ruth , ” she answered , “ and you are the relative who is supposed to take care of me . So spread the edge of your cover over me. ” [ b ]
CEV	Ruth	3	10	Boaz replied : The Lord bless you ! This shows how truly loyal you are to your family . You could have looked for a younger man , either rich or poor , but you did n't .
CEV	Ruth	3	11	Do n't worry , I 'll do what you have asked . You are respected by everyone in town .
CEV	Ruth	3	12	( A ) It 's true that I am one of the relatives who is supposed to take care of you , but there is someone who is an even closer relative .
CEV	Ruth	3	13	Stay here until morning , then I will find out if he is willing to look after you . If he is n't , I promise by the living God to do it myself . Now go back to sleep until morning .
CEV	Ruth	3	14	Ruth lay down again , but she got up before daylight , because Boaz did not want anyone to know she had been there .
CEV	Ruth	3	15	Then he told her to spread out her cape . And he filled it with grain and placed it on her shoulder . When Ruth got back to town ,
CEV	Ruth	3	16	Naomi asked her [ c ] what had happened , and Ruth told her everything .
CEV	Ruth	3	17	She also said , “ Boaz gave me this grain , because he did n't want me to come back without something for you. ”
CEV	Ruth	3	18	Naomi replied , “ Just be patient and do n't worry about what will happen . He wo n't rest until everything is settled today ! ” Copyright ©

CEV	Ruth	4	4	I 'm telling you about this , since you are his closest relative and have the right to buy the property . If you want it , you can buy it now . These ten men and the others standing here can be witnesses . But if you do n't want the property , let me know , because I am next in line . The man replied , “ I 'll buy it ! ”
CEV	Ruth	4	2	Then Boaz got ten of the town leaders and also asked them to sit down . After they had sat down ,
CEV	Ruth	4	3	he said to the man : Naomi has come back from Moab and is selling the land that belonged to her husband Elimelech .
CEV	Ruth	4	5	“ If you do buy it from Naomi , ” Boaz told him , “ you must also marry Ruth . Then if you have a son by her , the property will stay in the family of Ruth 's first husband. ”
CEV	Ruth	4	6	The man answered , “ If that 's the case , I do n't want to buy it ! That would make problems with the property I already own . [ a ] You may buy it yourself , because I can not . ”
CEV	Ruth	4	7	( A ) To make a sale legal in those days , one person would take off a sandal and give it to the other .
CEV	Ruth	4	8	So after the man had agreed to let Boaz buy the property , he took off one of his sandals and handed it to Boaz .
CEV	Ruth	4	9	Boaz told the town leaders and everyone else : All of you are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi the property that belonged to Elimelech and his two sons , Chilion and Mahlon .
CEV	Ruth	4	10	( B ) You are also witnesses that I have agreed to marry Mahlon 's widow Ruth , the Moabite woman . This will keep the property in his family 's name , and he will be remembered in this town .
CEV	Ruth	4	11	( C ) The town leaders and the others standing there said : We are witnesses to this . And we pray that the Lord will give your wife many children , just as he did Leah and Rachel , the wives of Jacob . May you be a rich man in the tribe of Ephrath and an important man in Bethlehem .
CEV	Ruth	4	12	( D ) May the children you have by this young woman make your family as famous as the family of Perez , [ b ] the son of Tamar and Judah .
CEV	Ruth	4	13	Boaz married Ruth , and the Lord blessed her with a son .
CEV	Ruth	4	14	After his birth , the women said to Naomi : Praise the Lord ! Today he has given you a grandson to take care of you . We pray that the boy will grow up to be famous everywhere in Israel .

I commanded everyone to bring their sacrifices here where I live , and I allowed you and your family to keep those that were not offered to me on the altar . But you honor your sons instead of me !

CEV	1%20Samuel	4	1	Then Samuel would speak to the whole nation of Israel . The Philistines Capture the Sacred Chest One day the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines . They set up camp near Ebenezer , and the Philistines camped at Aphek .
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	4	( A ) The army sent some soldiers to bring back the sacred chest from Shiloh , because the Lord All-Powerful has his throne on the winged creatures on top of the chest . As Eli 's two sons , Hophni and Phinehas ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	2	The Philistines made a fierce attack . They defeated the Israelites and killed about 4,000 of them .
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	3	The Israelite army returned to their camp , and the leaders said , “ Why did the Lord let us lose to the Philistines today ? Let 's get the sacred chest where the Lord 's agreement with Israel is kept . Then the Lord [ a ] will help us and rescue us from our enemies. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	5	brought the chest into camp , the army cheered so loudly that the ground shook .
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	6	The Philistines heard the noise and said , “ What are those Hebrews shouting about ? ” When the Philistines learned that the sacred chest had been brought into the camp ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	7	they were scared to death and said : The gods have come into their camp . Now we 're in real trouble ! Nothing like this has ever happened to us before .
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	8	We 're in big trouble ! Who can save us from these powerful gods ? They 're the same gods who made all those horrible things happen to the Egyptians in the desert .
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	9	Philistines , be brave and fight hard ! If you do n't , those Hebrews will rule us , just as we 've been ruling them . Fight and do n't be afraid .

CEV	1%20Samuel	4	11	Hophni and Phinehas were killed , and the sacred chest was captured . Eli Dies
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	12	That same day a soldier from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefront to Shiloh . He had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head to show his sorrow .
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	13	He went into town and told the news about the battle , and everyone started crying . Eli was afraid that something might happen to the sacred chest . So he was sitting on his chair beside the road , just waiting . 14-15 He was
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	98	years old and blind , but he could hear everyone crying , and he asked , “ What 's all that noise ? ” The soldier hurried over and told Eli ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	16	“ I escaped from the fighting today and ran here. ” “ Young man , what happened ? ” Eli asked .
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	17	“ Israel ran away from the Philistines , ” the soldier answered . “ Many of our people were killed , including your two sons , Hophni and Phinehas . But worst of all , the sacred chest was captured. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	18	Eli was still sitting on a chair beside the wall of the town gate . And when the man said that the Philistines had taken the sacred chest , Eli fell backwards . He was a very heavy old man , and the fall broke his neck and killed him . He had been a leader [ b ] of Israel for
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	40	years .
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	19	The wife of Phinehas was about to give birth . And soon after she heard that the sacred chest had been captured and that her husband and his father had died , her baby came . The birth was very hard ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	4	20	and she was dying . But the women taking care of her said , “ Do n't be afraid—it 's a boy ! ” She did n't pay any attention to them . 21-22 Instead she kept thinking about losing her husband and her father-in-law . So she said , “ My son will be named Ichabod , [ c ] because the glory of Israel left our country when the sacred chest was captured. ” Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Samuel	5	5	This is why the priests and everyone else step over that part of the doorway when they enter the temple of Dagon in Ashdod .
CEV	1%20Samuel	5	2	They brought it into the temple of their god Dagon and put it next to the statue of Dagon , which they worshiped .
CEV	1%20Samuel	5	3	When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning , they found the statue lying facedown on the floor in front of the sacred chest . They put the statue back where it belonged .
CEV	1%20Samuel	5	4	But early the next morning , it had fallen over again and was lying facedown on the floor in front of the chest . The body of the statue was still in one piece , but its head and both hands had broken off and were lying on the stone floor in the doorway .
CEV	1%20Samuel	5	6	The Lord caused a lot of trouble for the people of Ashdod and their neighbors . He made sores break out all over their bodies , [ a ] and everyone was in a panic . [ b ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	5	7	Finally , they said , “ The God of Israel did this . He is the one who caused all this trouble for us and our god Dagon . We 've got to get rid of this chest. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	5	8	The people of Ashdod invited all the Philistine rulers to come to Ashdod , and they asked them , “ What can we do with the sacred chest that belongs to the God of Israel ? ” “ Send it to Gath , ” the rulers answered . But after they took it there ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	5	9	the Lord made sores break out on everyone in town . The people of Gath were frightened ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	5	10	so they sent the sacred chest to Ekron . But before they could take it through the town gates , the people of Ekron started screaming , “ They 've brought the sacred chest that belongs to the God of Israel ! It will kill us and our families too ! ” The Philistines Send Back the Sacred Chest
CEV	1%20Samuel	5	11	The people of Ekron called for another meeting of the Philistine rulers and told them , “ Send this chest back where it belongs . Then it wo n't kill us. ” Everyone was in a panic , because God was causing a lot of people to die ,

CEV	1%20Samuel	6	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	6	Do n't be like the Egyptians and their king . They were stubborn , but when Israel 's God was finished with them , they had to let Israel go .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	2	the Philistines called in their priests and fortunetellers , and asked , “ What should we do with this sacred chest ? Tell us how to send it back where it belongs ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	3	“ Do n't send it back without a gift , ” the priests and fortunetellers answered . “ Send along something to Israel 's God to make up for taking the chest in the first place . Then you will be healed , and you will find out why the Lord was causing you so much trouble. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	4	“ What should we send ? ” the Philistines asked . The priests and fortunetellers answered : There are five Philistine rulers , and they all have the same disease that you have .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	5	So make five gold models of the sores and five gold models of the rats that are wiping out your crops . If you honor the God of Israel with this gift , maybe he will stop causing trouble for you and your gods and your crops .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	7	Get a new cart and two cows that have young calves and that have never pulled a cart . Hitch the cows to the cart , but take the calves back to their barn .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	8	Then put the chest on the cart . Put the gold rats and sores into a bag and put it on the cart next to the chest . Then send it on its way .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	9	Watch to see if the chest goes on up the road to the Israelite town of Beth-Shemesh . If it goes back to its own country , you will know that it was the Lord who made us suffer so badly . But if the chest does n't go back to its own country , then the Lord had nothing to do with the disease that hit us—it was simply bad luck .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	10	The Philistines followed their advice . They hitched up the two cows to the cart , but they kept their calves in a barn .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	11	Then they put the chest on the cart , along with the bag that had the gold rats and sores in it .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	12	The cows went straight up the road toward Beth-Shemesh , mooing as they went . The Philistine rulers followed them until they got close to Beth-Shemesh .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	13	The people of Beth-Shemesh were harvesting their wheat [ b ] in the valley . When they looked up and saw the chest , they were so happy that they stopped working and started celebrating . 14-15 The cows left the road and pulled the cart into a field that belonged to Joshua from Beth-Shemesh , and they stopped beside a huge rock . Some men from the tribe of Levi were there . So they took the chest off the cart and placed it on the rock , and then they did the same thing with the bag of gold rats and sores . A few other people chopped up the cart and made a fire . They killed the cows and burned them as sacrifices to the Lord . After that , they offered more sacrifices .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	16	When the five rulers of the Philistines saw what had happened , they went back to Ekron that same day .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	17	That is how the Philistines sent gifts to the Lord to make up for taking the sacred chest . They sent five gold sores , one each for their towns of Ashdod , Gaza , Ashkelon , Gath , and Ekron .
CEV	1%20Samuel	6	18	They also sent one gold rat for each walled town and for every village that the five Philistine rulers controlled . The huge stone [ c ] where the Levites set the chest is still there in Joshua 's field as a reminder of what happened . The Sacred Chest Is Sent to Kiriath-Jearim

CEV	1%20Samuel	7	3	One day , Samuel told all the people of Israel , “ If you really want to turn back to the Lord , then prove it . Get rid of your foreign idols , including the ones of the goddess Astarte . Turn to the Lord with all your heart and worship only him . Then he will rescue you from the Philistines. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	7	4	The people got rid of their idols of Baal and Astarte and began worshiping only the Lord .
CEV	1%20Samuel	7	5	Then Samuel said , “ Tell everyone in Israel to meet together at Mizpah , and I will pray to the Lord for you. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	7	6	The Israelites met together at Mizpah with Samuel as their leader . They drew water from the well and poured it out as an offering to the Lord . On that same day they went without eating to show their sorrow , and they confessed they had been unfaithful to the Lord . The Philistines Attack Israel
CEV	1%20Samuel	7	8	“ Do n't stop praying ! ” they told Samuel . “ Ask the Lord our God to rescue us. ” 9-10 ( B ) Samuel begged the Lord to rescue Israel , then he sacrificed a young lamb to the Lord . Samuel had not even finished offering the sacrifice when the Philistines started to attack . But the Lord answered his prayer and made thunder crash all around them . The Philistines panicked and ran away .
CEV	1%20Samuel	7	11	The men of Israel left Mizpah and went after them as far as the hillside below Beth-Car , killing every enemy soldier they caught . 12-13 The Philistines were so badly beaten that it was quite a while before they attacked Israel again . After the battle , Samuel set up a monument between Mizpah and the rocky cliffs . He named it “ Help Monument ” [ b ] to remind Israel how much the Lord had helped them . For as long as Samuel lived , the Lord helped Israel fight the Philistines .

CEV	1%20Samuel	8	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	8	Ever since the day I rescued my people from Egypt , they have turned from me to worship idols . Now they are turning away from you .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	3	But they were not like their father . They were dishonest and accepted bribes to give unfair decisions .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	4	One day the nation 's leaders came to Samuel at Ramah
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	5	( A ) and said , “ You are an old man . You set a good example for your sons , but they have n't followed it . Now we want a king to be our leader , just like all the other nations . Choose one for us ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	6	Samuel was upset to hear the leaders say they wanted a king , so he prayed about it .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	7	The Lord answered : Samuel , do everything they want you to do . I am really the one they have rejected as their king .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	9	Do everything they ask , but warn them and tell them how a king will treat them .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	10	Samuel told the people who were asking for a king what the Lord had said :
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	11	If you have a king , this is how he will treat you . He will force your sons to join his army . Some of them will ride in his chariots , some will serve in the cavalry , and others will run ahead of his own chariot . [ a ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	12	Some of them will be officers in charge of 1,000 soldiers , and others will be in charge of
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	50	. Still others will have to farm the king 's land and harvest his crops , or make weapons and parts for his chariots .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	13	Your daughters will have to make perfume or do his cooking and baking .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	14	The king will take your best fields , as well as your vineyards , and olive orchards and give them to his own officials .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	15	He will also take a tenth of your grain and grapes and give it to his officers and officials .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	16	The king will take your slaves and your best young men and your donkeys and make them do his work .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will also take a tenth of your sheep and goats . You will become the king 's slaves ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	18	and you will finally cry out for the Lord to save you from the king you wanted . But the Lord wo n't answer your prayers . 19-20 The people would not listen to Samuel . “ No ! ” they said . “ We want to be like other nations . We want a king to rule us and lead us in battle. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	21	Samuel listened to them and then told the Lord exactly what they had said .
CEV	1%20Samuel	8	22	“ Do what they want , ” the Lord answered . “ Give them a king. ” Samuel told the people to go back to their homes . Footnotes - 8.11 others … chariot : These men were probably his bodyguards . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Samuel	9	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	9	Kish was a wealthy man who belonged to the tribe of Benjamin . His father was Abiel , his grandfather was Zeror , his great-grandfather was Becorath , and his great-great-grandfather was Aphiah .
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	2	Kish had a son named Saul , who was better looking and more than a head taller than anyone else in all Israel .
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	3	Kish owned some donkeys , but they had run off . So he told Saul , “ Take one of the servants and go look for the donkeys. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	4	Saul and the servant went through the hill country of Ephraim and the territory of Shalishah , but they could not find the donkeys . Then they went through the territories of Shaalim and Benjamin , but still there was no sign of the donkeys .
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	5	Finally they came to the territory where the clan of Zuph [ a ] lived . “ Let 's go back home , ” Saul told his servant . “ If we do n't go back soon , my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	6	“ Wait ! ” the servant answered . “ There 's a man of God who lives in a town near here . He 's amazing ! Everything he says comes true . Let 's talk to him . Maybe he can tell us where to look. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	7	Saul said , “ How can we talk to the prophet when I do n't have anything to give him ? We do n't even have any bread left in our sacks . What can we give him ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	8	“ I have a small piece of silver , ” the servant answered . “ We can give him that , and then he will tell us where to look for the donkeys. ” 9-10 “ Great ! ” Saul replied . “ Let 's go to the man who can see visions ! ” He said this because in those days God would answer questions by giving visions to prophets . Saul and his servant went to the town where the prophet lived .
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	11	As they were going up the hill to the town , they met some young women coming out to get water , [ b ] and the two men said to them , “ We 're looking for the man who can see visions . Is he in town ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	12	“ Yes , he is , ” they replied . “ He 's in town today because there 's going to be a sacrifice and a sacred meal at the place of worship . In fact , he 's just ahead of you . Hurry
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	13	and you should find him right inside the town gate . He 's on his way out to the place of worship to eat with the invited guests . They ca n't start eating until he blesses the sacrifice . If you go now , you should find him. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	14	They went to the town , and just as they were going through the gate , Samuel was coming out on his way to the place of worship .
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	15	The day before Saul came , the Lord had told Samuel ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	16	“ I 've seen how my people are suffering , and I 've heard their call for help . About this time tomorrow I 'll send you a man from the tribe of Benjamin , who will rescue my people from the Philistines . I want you to pour olive oil [ c ] on his head to show that he will be their leader. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	17	Samuel looked at Saul , and the Lord told Samuel , “ This is the man I told you about . He 's the one who will rule Israel. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	18	Saul went over to Samuel in the gateway and said , “ A man who can see visions lives here in town . Could you tell me the way to his house ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	19	“ I am the one who sees visions ! ” Samuel answered . “ Go on up to the place of worship . You will eat with me today , and in the morning I 'll answer your questions .
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	20	Do n't worry about your donkeys that ran off three days ago . They 've already been found . Everything of value in Israel now belongs to you and your family. ” [ d ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	21	“ Why are you telling me this ? ” Saul asked . “ I 'm from Benjamin , the smallest tribe in Israel , and my clan is the least important in the tribe. ” Saul Eats with Samuel and Stays at His House
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	22	Samuel took Saul and his servant into the dining room at the place of worship . About
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	30	people were there for the dinner , but Samuel gave Saul and his servant the places of honor . 23-24 Then Samuel told the cook , “ I gave you the best piece of meat and told you to set it aside . Bring it here now. ” The cook brought the meat over and set it down in front of Saul . “ This is for you , ” Samuel told him . “ Go ahead and eat it . I had this piece saved especially for you , and I invited these guests to eat with you. ” After Saul and Samuel had finished eating ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	25	they went down from the place of worship and back into town . A bed was set up for Saul on the flat roof [ e ] of Samuel 's house ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	26	and Saul slept there . About sunrise the next morning , [ f ] Samuel called up to Saul on the roof , “ Time to get up ! I 'll help you get started on your way. ” Saul got up . He and Samuel left together
CEV	1%20Samuel	9	27	and had almost reached the edge of town when Samuel stopped and said , “ Tell your servant go on .

CEV	1%20Samuel	10	11	Some people who had known Saul for a long time saw that he was speaking and behaving like a prophet . They said to each other , “ What 's happened ? How can Saul be a prophet ? ”

CEV	1%20Samuel	13	13	“ That was stupid ! ” Samuel said . “ You did n't obey the Lord your God . If you had obeyed him , someone from your family would always have been king of Israel .
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	2	Then [ b ] he chose 3,000 men from Israel to be full-time soldiers and sent everyone else [ c ] home . Two thousand of these troops stayed with him in the hills around Michmash and Bethel . The other 1,000 were stationed with Jonathan [ d ] at Gibeah [ e ] in the territory of Benjamin .
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	3	Jonathan led an attack on the Philistine army camp at Geba . [ f ] The Philistine camp was destroyed , but [ g ] the other Philistines heard what had happened . Then Saul told his messengers , “ Go to every village in the country . Give a signal with the trumpet , and when the people come together , tell them what has happened. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	4	The messengers then said to the people of Israel , “ Saul has destroyed the Philistine army camp at Geba . [ h ] Now the Philistines really hate Israel , so every town and village must send men to join Saul 's army at Gilgal. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	5	The Philistines called their army together to fight Israel . They had 3,000 [ i ] chariots , 6,000 cavalry , and as many foot soldiers as there are grains of sand on the beach . They went to Michmash and set up camp there east of Beth-Aven . [ j ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	6	The Israelite army realized that they were outnumbered and were going to lose the battle . Some of the Israelite men hid in caves or in clumps of bushes , [ k ] and some ran to places where they could hide among large rocks . Others hid in tombs [ l ] or in deep dry pits .
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	7	Still others [ m ] went to Gad and Gilead on the other side of the Jordan River . Saul stayed at Gilgal . His soldiers were shaking with fear ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	8	( A ) and they were starting to run off and leave him . Saul waited there seven days , just as Samuel had ordered him to do , [ n ] but Samuel did not come .
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	9	Finally , Saul commanded , “ Bring me some animals , so we can offer sacrifices to please the Lord and ask for his help. ” Saul killed one of the animals ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	10	and just as he placed it on the altar , Samuel arrived . Saul went out to welcome him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	11	“ What have you done ? ” Samuel asked . Saul answered , “ My soldiers were leaving in all directions , and you did n't come when you were supposed to . The Philistines were gathering at Michmash ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	12	and I was worried that they would attack me here at Gilgal . I had n't offered a sacrifice to ask for the Lord 's help , so I forced myself to offer a sacrifice on the altar fire. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	14	( B ) But no , you disobeyed , and so the Lord wo n't choose anyone else from your family to be king . In fact , he has already chosen the one he wants to be the next leader of his people. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	15	Then Samuel left Gilgal . Part of Saul 's army had not deserted him , and he led them to Gibeah in Benjamin to join his other troops . Then he counted them [ o ] and found that he still had

CEV	1%20Samuel	13	18	Another patrol would go west along the road to Beth-Horon . A third patrol would go east toward the desert on the road to the ridge that overlooks Zeboim Valley .
CEV	1%20Samuel	13	19	The Philistines would not allow any Israelites to learn how to make iron tools . “ If we allowed that , ” they said , “ those worthless Israelites would make swords and spears. ” 20-21 Whenever the Israelites wanted to get an iron point put on a cattle prod , [ p ] they had to go to the Philistines . Even if they wanted to sharpen plow-blades , picks , axes , sickles , [ q ] and pitchforks [ r ] they still had to go to them . And the Philistines charged high prices .

Ahijah was serving as priest , and one of his jobs was to get answers from the Lord for Saul . Ahijah 's father was Ahitub , and his father 's brother was Ichabod . Ahijah 's grandfather was Phinehas , and his great-grandfather Eli had been the Lord 's priest at Shiloh . One day , Jonathan told the soldier who carried his weapons that he wanted to attack the Philistine camp on the other side of the valley . So they slipped out of the Israelite camp without anyone knowing it . Jonathan did n't even tell his father he was leaving . 4-5 Jonathan decided to get to the Philistine camp by going through the pass that led between Shiny Cliff and Michmash to the north and Thornbush Cliff [ d ] and Geba to the south .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	6	Jonathan and the soldier who carried his weapons talked as they went toward the Philistine camp . “ It 's just the two of us against all those godless men , ” Jonathan said . “ But the Lord can help a few soldiers win a battle just as easily as he can help a whole army . Maybe the Lord will help us win this battle. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	7	“ Do whatever you want , ” the soldier answered . “ I 'll be right there with you. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	8	“ This is what we will do , ” Jonathan said . “ We will go across and let them see us .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they agree to come down the hill and fight where we are , then we wo n't climb up to their camp .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	10	But we will go if they tell us to come up the hill and fight . That will mean the Lord is going to help us win. ” 11-12 Jonathan and the soldier stood at the bottom of the hill where the Philistines could see them . The Philistines said , “ Look ! Those worthless Israelites have crawled out of the holes where they 've been hiding. ” Then they yelled down to Jonathan and the soldier , “ Come up here , and we will teach you a thing or two ! ” Jonathan turned to the soldier and said , “ Follow me ! The Lord is going to let us win. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	13	Jonathan crawled up the hillside with the soldier right behind him . When they got to the top , Jonathan killed the Philistines who attacked from the front , and the soldier killed those who attacked from behind . [ e ]

CEV	1%20Samuel	14	15	The whole Philistine army panicked—those in camp , those on guard duty , those in the fields , and those on raiding patrols . All of them were afraid and confused . Then God sent an earthquake , and the ground began to tremble . [ g ] Israel Defeats the Philistines
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	16	Saul 's lookouts at Geba [ h ] saw that the Philistine army was running in every direction , like melted wax .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	17	Saul told his officers , “ Call the roll and find out who left our camp. ” When they had finished , they found out that Jonathan and the soldier who carried his weapons were missing .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	18	At that time , Ahijah was serving as priest for the army of Israel , and Saul told him , “ Come over here ! Let 's ask God what we should do. ” [ i ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	19	Just as Saul finished saying this , he could see that the Philistine army camp was getting more and more confused , and he said , “ Ahijah , never mind ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	21	There were also some hired soldiers [ j ] in the Philistine camp , who now switched to Israel 's side and fought for Saul and Jonathan .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	22	Many Israelites had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim . And when they heard that the Philistines were running away , they came out of hiding and joined in chasing the Philistines . 23-24 So the Lord helped Israel win the battle that day . Saul 's Curse on Anyone Who Eats Saul had earlier told his soldiers , “ I want to get even with those Philistines by sunset . If any of you eat before then , you will be under a curse ! ” So he made them swear not to eat . By the time the fighting moved past Beth-Aven , [ k ] the Israelite troops were weak from hunger . 25-26 The army and the people who lived nearby had gone into a forest , and they came to a place where honey was dripping on the ground . [ l ] But no one ate any of it , because they were afraid of being put under the curse .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	27	Jonathan did not know about Saul 's warning to the soldiers . So he dipped the end of his walking stick in the honey and ate some with his fingers . He felt stronger and more alert .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then a soldier told him , “ Your father swore that anyone who ate food today would be put under a curse , and we agreed not to eat . That 's why we 're so weak. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	29	Jonathan said , “ My father has caused you a lot of trouble . Look at me ! I ate only a little of this honey , but already I feel strong and alert .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	31	By evening the Israelite army was exhausted from killing Philistines all the way from Michmash to Aijalon . [ m ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	32	They grabbed the food they had captured from the Philistines and started eating . They even killed sheep and cows and calves right on the spot and ate the meat without draining the blood . [ n ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	33	( A ) Someone told Saul , “ Look ! The army is disobeying the Lord by eating meat before the blood drains out. ” “ You 're right , ” Saul answered . “ They are being unfaithful to the Lord ! Hurry ! Roll a big rock over here . [ o ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	34	Then tell everyone in camp to bring their cattle and lambs to me . They can kill the animals on this rock , [ p ] then eat the meat . That way no one will disobey the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it. ” That night the soldiers brought their cattle over to the big rock and killed them there .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	35	It was the first altar Saul had built for offering sacrifices to the Lord . [ q ] The Army Rescues Jonathan
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	36	Saul said , “ Let 's attack the Philistines again while it 's still dark . We can fight them all night . Let 's kill them and take everything they own ! ” The people answered , “ We will do whatever you want. ” “ Wait ! ” Ahijah the priest said . “ Let 's ask God what we should do. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	37	Saul asked God , “ Should I attack the Philistines ? Will you help us win ? ” This time God did not answer .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	38	Saul called his army officers together and said , “ We have to find out what sin has kept God from answering .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	39	I swear by the living Lord that whoever sinned must die , even if it turns out to be my own son Jonathan. ” No one said a word .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	40	Saul told his army , “ You stand on that side of the priest , and Jonathan and I will stand on the other side. ” Everyone agreed .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	41	( B ) Then Saul prayed , “ Our Lord , God of Israel , why have n't you answered me today ? Please show us who sinned . Was it my son Jonathan and I , or was it your people Israel ? ” [ r ] The answer came back that Jonathan or Saul had sinned , not the army .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	42	Saul told Ahijah , “ Now ask the Lord to decide between Jonathan and me. ” The answer came back that Jonathan had sinned .
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	43	“ Jonathan , ” Saul exclaimed , “ tell me what you did ! ” “ I dipped the end of my walking stick in some honey and ate a little . Now you say I have to die ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	44	“ Yes , Jonathan . I swear to God that you must die. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	14	45	“ No ! ” the soldiers shouted . “ God helped Jonathan win the battle for us . We wo n't let you kill him . We swear to the Lord that we wo n't let you kill him or even lay a hand on him ! ” So the army kept Saul from killing Jonathan .

CEV	1%20Samuel	15	22	“ Tell me , ” Samuel said . “ Does the Lord really want sacrifices and offerings ? No ! He does n't want your sacrifices . He wants you to obey him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	15	23	Rebelling against God or disobeying him because you are proud is just as bad as worshiping idols or asking them for advice . You refused to do what God told you , so God has decided that you can no longer be king. ”

CEV	1%20Samuel	15	26	“ No ! ” Samuel replied , “ You disobeyed the Lord , and I wo n't go back with you . Now the Lord has said that you ca n't be king of Israel any longer. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	15	27	( C ) As Samuel turned to go , Saul grabbed the edge of Samuel 's robe . It tore !

CEV	1%20Samuel	16	7	( B ) But the Lord told him , “ Samuel , do n't think Eliab is the one just because he 's tall and handsome . He is n't the one I 've chosen . People judge others by what they look like , but I judge people by what is in their hearts. ”

CEV	1%20Samuel	19	12	She helped David leave through a window and climb down to the ground . [ a ] As David ran off ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	13	Michal put a statue in his bed . She put goat hair on its head and dressed it in some of David 's clothes .
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	14	The next morning , Saul sent guards to arrest David . But Michal told them , “ David is sick. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	15	Saul sent the guards back and told them , “ Bring David to me—bed and all—so I can kill him. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	16	When the guards went in , all they found in the bed was the statue with the goat hair on its head .
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	17	“ Why have you tricked me this way ? ” Saul asked Michal . “ You helped my enemy get away ! ” She answered , “ He said he would kill me if I did n't help him escape ! ” Samuel Helps David Escape
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	18	Meanwhile , David went to Samuel at Ramah and told him what Saul had done . Then Samuel and David went to Prophets Village [ b ] and stayed there .
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	20	Saul sent a few soldiers to bring David back . They went to Ramah and found Samuel in charge of a group of prophets who were all prophesying . Then the Spirit of God took control of the soldiers and they started prophesying too .
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	21	When Saul heard what had happened , he sent some more soldiers , but they prophesied just like the first group . He sent a third group of soldiers , but the same thing happened to them .
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	22	Finally , Saul left for Ramah himself . He went as far as the deep pit [ c ] at the town of Secu , and he asked , “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” “ At Prophets Village in Ramah , ” the people answered .
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	23	Saul left for Ramah . But as he walked along , the Spirit of God took control of him , and he started prophesying . Then , when he reached Prophets Village ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	19	24	( B ) he stripped off his clothes and prophesied in front of Samuel . He dropped to the ground and lay there naked all that day and night . That 's how the saying started , “ Is Saul now a prophet ? ” Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Samuel	20	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	20	I 'll shoot three arrows at a target off to the side of the rock ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	2	“ My father ca n't be trying to kill you ! He never does anything without telling me about it . Why would he hide this from me ? It ca n't be true ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	3	“ Jonathan , I swear it 's true ! But your father knows how much you like me , and he did n't want to break your heart . That 's why he did n't tell you . I swear by the living Lord and by your own life that I 'm only one step ahead of death. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	4	Then Jonathan said , “ Tell me what to do , and I 'll do it. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	5	( A ) David answered : Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival , [ a ] and I 'm supposed to eat dinner with your father . But instead , I 'll hide in a field until the evening of the next day .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	6	If Saul wonders where I am , tell him , “ David asked me to let him go to his hometown of Bethlehem , so he could take part in a sacrifice his family makes there every year. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	7	If your father says it 's all right , then I 'm safe . But if he gets angry , you 'll know he wants to harm me .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	8	Be kind to me . After all , it was your idea to promise the Lord that we would always be loyal friends . If I 've done anything wrong , kill me yourself , but do n't hand me over to your father .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	9	“ Do n't worry , ” Jonathan said . “ If I find out that my father wants to kill you , I 'll certainly let you know. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	10	“ How will you do that ? ” David asked .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	11	“ Let 's go out to this field , and I 'll tell you , ” Jonathan answered . When they got there ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	12	Jonathan said : I swear by the Lord God of Israel , that two days from now I 'll know what my father is planning . Of course I 'll let you know if he 's friendly toward you .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	13	But if he wants to harm you , I promise to tell you and help you escape . And I ask the Lord to punish me severely if I do n't keep my promise . I pray that the Lord will bless you , just as he used to bless my father . 14-15 ( B ) Someday the Lord will wipe out all of your enemies . Then if I 'm still alive , please be as kind to me as the Lord has been . But if I 'm dead , be kind to my family .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	16	Jonathan and David made an agreement that even David 's descendants would have to keep . [ b ] Then Jonathan said , “ I pray that the Lord will take revenge on your descendants if they break our promise. ” [ c ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	17	Jonathan thought as much of David as he did of himself , so he asked David to promise once more that he would be a loyal friend .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	18	After this Jonathan said : Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival , and people will wonder where you are , because your place at the table will be empty .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	19	By the day after tomorrow , everyone will think you 've been gone a long time . [ d ] Then go to the place where you hid before and stay beside Going-Away Rock . [ e ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	21	and send my servant to find the arrows . You 'll know if it 's safe to come out by what I tell him . If it is safe , I swear by the living Lord that I 'll say , “ The arrows are on this side of you ! Pick them up ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if it is n't safe , I 'll say to the boy , “ The arrows are farther away ! ” This will mean that the Lord wants you to leave , and you must go .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	23	But he will always watch us to make sure that we keep the promise we made to each other .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	24	So David hid there in the field . During the New Moon Festival , Saul sat down to eat
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	25	by the wall , just as he always did . Jonathan sat across from him , [ f ] and Abner sat next to him . But David 's place was empty .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	26	Saul did n't say anything that day , because he was thinking , “ Something must have happened to make David unfit to be at the Festival . [ g ] Yes , something must have happened. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	27	The day after the New Moon Festival , when David 's place was still empty , Saul asked Jonathan , “ Why has n't that son of Jesse come to eat with us ? He was n't here yesterday , and he still is n't here today ! ” 28-29 Jonathan answered , “ The reason David has n't come to eat with you is that he begged me to let him go to Bethlehem . He said , ‘ Please let me go . My family is offering a sacrifice , and my brother told me I have to be there . Do me this favor and let me slip away to see my brothers. ’ ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	30	Saul was furious with Jonathan and yelled , “ You 're no son of mine , you traitor ! I know you 've chosen to be loyal to that son of Jesse . You should be ashamed of yourself ! And your own mother should be ashamed that you were ever born .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	31	You 'll never be safe , and your kingdom will be in danger as long as that son of Jesse is alive . Turn him over to me now ! He deserves to die ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	32	“ Why do you want to kill David ? ” Jonathan asked . “ What has he done ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	33	Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and tried to kill him . Then Jonathan was sure that his father really did want to kill David .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	34	Jonathan was angry and hurt that his father had insulted David [ h ] so terribly . He got up , left the table , and did n't eat anything all that day .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	35	In the morning , Jonathan went out to the field to meet David . He took a servant boy along
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	36	and told him , “ When I shoot the arrows , you run and find them for me. ” The boy started running , and Jonathan shot an arrow so that it would go beyond him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	37	When the boy got near the place where the arrow had landed , Jonathan shouted , “ Is n't the arrow on past you ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	38	Jonathan shouted to him again , “ Hurry up ! Do n't stop ! ” The boy picked up the arrows and brought them back to Jonathan ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	39	but he had no idea about what was going on . Only Jonathan and David knew .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	40	Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him , “ Take these back into town. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	41	After the boy had gone , David got up from beside the mound [ i ] and bowed very low three times . Then he and Jonathan kissed [ j ] each other and cried , but David cried louder .
CEV	1%20Samuel	20	42	Jonathan said , “ Take care of yourself . And remember , we each have asked the Lord to watch and make sure that we and our descendants keep our promise forever. ” David left and Jonathan went back to town .

CEV	1%20Samuel	21	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	21	( A ) David went to see Ahimelech , a priest who lived in the town of Nob . Ahimelech was trembling with fear as he came out to meet David . “ Why are you alone ? ” Ahimelech asked . “ Why is n't anyone else with you ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	2	“ I 'm on a mission for King Saul , ” David answered . “ He ordered me not to tell anyone what the mission is all about , so I ordered my soldiers to stay somewhere else .
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	3	Do you have any food you can give me ? Could you spare five loaves of bread ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	4	“ The only bread I have is the sacred bread , ” the priest told David . “ You can have it if your soldiers did n't sleep with women last night. ” [ a ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	5	“ Of course we did n't sleep with women , ” David answered . “ I never let my men do that when we 're on a mission . They have to be acceptable to worship God even when we 're on a regular mission , and today we 're on a special mission. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	6	( B ) The only bread the priest had was the sacred bread that he had taken from the place of worship after putting out the fresh loaves . So he gave it to David .
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	7	It so happened that one of Saul 's officers was there , worshiping the Lord that day . His name was Doeg the Edomite , [ b ] and he was the strongest of [ c ] Saul 's shepherds .
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	8	David asked Ahimelech , “ Do you have a spear or a sword ? I had to leave so quickly on this mission for the king that I did n't bring along my sword or any other weapons. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	9	( C ) The priest answered , “ The only sword here is the one that belonged to Goliath the Philistine . You were the one who killed him in Elah Valley , and so you can take his sword if you want to . It 's wrapped in a cloth behind the statue. ” “ It 's the best sword there is , ” David said . “ I 'll take it ! ” David Tries To Find Safety in Gath
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	10	David kept on running from Saul that day until he came to Gath , [ d ] where he met with King Achish .
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	11	( D ) The officers of King Achish were also there , and they asked Achish , “ Is n't David a king back in his own country ? Do n't the Israelites dance and sing , ‘ Saul has killed a thousand enemies ; David has killed ten thousand ’ ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	12	( E ) David thought about what they were saying , and it made him afraid of Achish .
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	13	( F ) So right there in front of everyone , he pretended to be insane . He acted confused and started making scratches on the doors of the town gate , while drooling in his beard .
CEV	1%20Samuel	21	14	“ Look at him ! ” Achish said to his officers . “ You can see he 's crazy . Why did you bring him to me ?

CEV	1%20Samuel	22	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	22	David answered , “ That day when I saw Doeg , I knew he would tell Saul ! Your family died because of me .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	2	A lot of other people joined him too . Some were in trouble , others were angry or in debt , and David was soon the leader of
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	400	men .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	3	David left Adullam Cave and went to the town of Mizpeh in Moab , where he talked with the king of Moab . “ Please , ” David said , “ let my father and mother stay with you until I find out what God will do with me. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	4	So he brought his parents to the king of Moab , and they stayed with him while David was in hiding .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	5	One day the prophet Gad told David , “ Do n't stay here ! Go back to Judah. ” David then left and went to Hereth Forest . Saul Kills the Priests of the Lord
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	6	Saul was sitting under a small tree on top of the hill at Gibeah when he heard that David and his men had been located . Saul was holding his spear , and his officers were standing in front of him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	7	He told them : Listen to me ! You belong to the Benjamin tribe , [ a ] so if that son of Jesse ever becomes king , he wo n't give you fields or vineyards . He wo n't make you officers in charge of thousands or hundreds as I have done .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	8	But you 're all plotting against me ! Not one of you told me that my own son Jonathan had made an agreement with him . Not one of you cared enough to tell me that Jonathan had helped one of my officers [ b ] rebel . Now that son of Jesse is trying to ambush me .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	9	( B ) Doeg the Edomite was standing with the other officers and spoke up , “ When I was in the town of Nob , I saw that son of Jesse . He was visiting the priest Ahimelech the son of Ahitub .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	10	Ahimelech talked to the Lord for him , then gave him food and the sword that had belonged to Goliath the Philistine. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	11	Saul sent a message to Ahimelech and his whole family of priests at Nob , ordering them to come to him . When they came ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	12	Saul told them , “ Listen to me , you son of Ahitub. ” “ Certainly , Your Majesty , ” Ahimelech answered .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	13	Saul demanded , “ Why did you plot against me with that son of Jesse ? You helped him rebel against me by giving him food and a sword , and by talking with God for him . Now he 's trying to ambush me ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	14	“ Your Majesty , none of your officers is more loyal than David ! ” Ahimelech replied . “ He 's your son-in-law and the captain of your bodyguard . Everyone in your family respects him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	15	This is n't the first time I 've talked with God for David , and it 's never made you angry before ! Please do n't accuse me or my family like this . I have no idea what 's going on ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	16	“ Ahimelech , ” Saul said , “ you and your whole family are going to die. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	17	Saul shouted to his bodyguards , “ These priests of the Lord helped David ! They knew he was running away , but they did n't tell me . Kill them ! ” But the king 's officers would not attack the priests of the Lord .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	18	Saul turned to Doeg , who was from Edom , and said , “ Kill the priests ! ” On that same day , Doeg killed
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	85	priests .
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	19	Then he attacked the town of Nob , where the priests had lived , and he killed everyone there—men , women , children , and babies . He even killed their cattle , donkeys , and sheep . Only Abiathar Escapes from Nob
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	20	Ahimelech 's son Abiathar was the only one who escaped . He ran to David
CEV	1%20Samuel	22	21	and told him , “ Saul has murdered the Lord 's priests at Nob ! ”

CEV	1%20Samuel	23	23	Find out where all his hiding places are and come back when you 're sure . Then I 'll go with you . If he is still in the area , or anywhere among the clans of Judah , I 'll find him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	2	David asked the Lord , “ Should I attack these Philistines ? ” “ Yes , ” the Lord answered . “ Attack them and rescue Keilah. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David 's men said , “ Look , even here in Judah we 're afraid of the Philistines . We will be terrified if we try to fight them at Keilah ! ” [ a ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	4	David asked the Lord about it again . “ Leave at once , ” the Lord answered . “ I will give you victory over the Philistines at Keilah. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	5	David and his men went there and fiercely attacked the Philistines . They killed many of them , then led away their cattle , and rescued the people of Keilah . 6-8 Meanwhile , Saul heard that David was in Keilah . “ God has let me catch David , ” Saul said . “ David is trapped inside a walled town where the gates can be locked. ” Saul decided to go there and surround the town , in order to trap David and his men . He sent messengers who told the towns and villages , “ Send men to serve in Saul 's army ! ” By this time , Abiathar had joined David in Keilah and had brought along everything he needed to get answers from God .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	9	David heard about Saul 's plan to capture him , and he told Abiathar , “ Let 's ask God what we should do. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	10	David prayed , “ Lord God of Israel , I was told that Saul is planning to come here . What should I do ? Suppose he threatens to destroy the town because of me .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	11	Would the leaders of Keilah turn me over to Saul ? Or is he really coming ? Please tell me , Lord. ” “ Yes , he will come , ” the Lord answered .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	12	David asked , “ Would the leaders of Keilah hand me and my soldiers over to Saul ? ” “ Yes , they would , ” the Lord answered .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	13	David and his
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	600	men got out of there fast and started moving from place to place . Saul heard that David had left Keilah , and he decided not to go after him . Jonathan Says David Will Be King
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	14	David stayed in hideouts in the hill country of Ziph Desert . Saul kept searching , but God never let Saul catch him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	15	One time , David was at Horesh in Ziph Desert . He was afraid because [ b ] Saul had come to the area to kill him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	16	But Jonathan went to see David , and God helped him encourage David .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	17	“ Do n't be afraid , ” Jonathan said . “ My father Saul will never get his hands on you . In fact , you 're going to be the next king of Israel , and I 'll be your highest official . Even my father knows it 's true. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	18	( A ) They both promised the Lord that they would always be loyal to each other . Then Jonathan went home , but David stayed at Horesh . David Escapes from Saul
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	19	( B ) Some people from the town of Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and said , “ Your Majesty , David has a hideout not far from us ! It 's near Horesh , somewhere on Mount Hachilah south of Jeshimon . [ c ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	20	If you come , we will help you catch him. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	21	Saul told them : You 've done me a big favor , and I pray that the Lord will bless you .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	22	Now please do just a little more for me . Find out exactly where David is , as well as where he goes , and who has seen him there . I 've been told that he 's very tricky .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	24	The people from Ziph went back ahead of Saul , and they found out that David and his men were still south of Jeshimon in the Maon Desert .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	25	Saul and his army set out to find David . But David heard that Saul was coming , and he went to a place called The Rock , one of his hideouts in Maon Desert . Saul found out where David was and started closing in on him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	26	Saul was going around a hill on one side , and David and his men were on the other side , trying to get away . Saul and his soldiers were just about to capture David and his men ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	27	when a messenger came to Saul and said , “ Come quickly ! The Philistines are attacking Israel and taking everything. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	23	28	Saul stopped going after David and went back to fight the Philistines . That 's why the place is called “ Escape Rock. ”

CEV	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	24	When Saul got back from fighting off the Philistines , he heard that David was in the desert around En-Gedi .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	2	Saul led 3,000 of Israel 's best soldiers out to look for David and his men near Wild Goat Rocks at En-Gedi .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	3	( A ) There were some sheep pens along the side of the road , and one of them was built around the entrance to a cave . Saul went into the cave to relieve himself . David and his men were hiding at the back of the cave .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	4	They whispered to David , “ The Lord told you he was going to let you defeat your enemies and do whatever you want with them . This must be the day the Lord was talking about. ” David sneaked over and cut off a small piece [ a ] of Saul 's robe , but Saul did n't notice a thing .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	5	Afterwards , David was sorry that he had even done that , 6-7 ( B ) and he told his men , “ Stop talking foolishly . We 're not going to attack Saul . He 's my king , and I pray that the Lord will keep me from doing anything to harm his chosen king. ” Saul left the cave and started down the road .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	8	Soon , David also got up and left the cave . “ Your Majesty ! ” he shouted from a distance . Saul turned around to look . David bowed down very low
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	9	and said : Your Majesty , why do you listen to people who say that I 'm trying to harm you ?
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	10	You can see for yourself that the Lord gave me the chance to catch you in the cave today . Some of my men wanted to kill you , but I would n't let them do it . I told them , “ I will not harm the Lord 's chosen king ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	11	Your Majesty , look at what I 'm holding . You can see that it 's a piece of your robe . If I could cut off a piece of your robe , I could have killed you . But I let you live , and that should prove I 'm not trying to harm you or to rebel . I have n't done anything to you , and yet you keep trying to ambush and kill me .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	12	I 'll let the Lord decide which one of us has done right . I pray that the Lord will punish you for what you 're doing to me , but I wo n't do anything to you .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	13	An old proverb says , “ Only evil people do evil things , ” and so I wo n't harm you .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	14	( C ) Why should the king of Israel be out chasing me , anyway ? I 'm as worthless as a dead dog or a flea .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	15	I pray that the Lord will help me escape and show that I am in the right .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	16	“ David , my son—is that you ? ” Saul asked . Then he started crying
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	17	and said : David , you 're a better person than I am . You treated me with kindness , even though I 've been cruel to you .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	18	You 've told me how you were kind enough not to kill me when the Lord gave you the chance .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	19	If you really were my enemy , you would n't have let me leave here alive . I pray that the Lord will give you a big reward for what you did today .
CEV	1%20Samuel	24	20	I realize now that you will be the next king , and a powerful king at that .

CEV	1%20Samuel	25	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	25	Do n't pay any attention to that good-for-nothing Nabal . His name means “ fool , ” and it really fits him ! I did n't see the men you sent , 26-27 but please take this gift of food that I 've brought and share it with your followers . The Lord has kept you from taking revenge and from killing innocent people . But I hope your enemies and anyone else who wants to harm you will end up like Nabal . I swear this by the living Lord and by your life .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	4	One day , Nabal was in Carmel where his servants were cutting the wool from his sheep . David was in the desert when he heard about it . 5-6 So he sent ten men to Carmel with this message for Nabal : I hope that you and your family are healthy and that all is going well for you .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	7	I 've heard that you are cutting the wool from your sheep . When your shepherds were with us in Carmel , we did n't harm them , and nothing was ever stolen from them .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask your shepherds , and they 'll tell you the same thing . My servants are your servants , and you are like a father to me . This is a day for celebrating , [ e ] so please be kind and share some of your food with us .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	9	David 's men went to Nabal and gave him David 's message , then they waited for Nabal 's answer .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	10	This is what he said : Who does this David think he is ? That son of Jesse is just one more slave on the run from his master , and there are too many of them these days .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	11	What makes you think I would take my bread , my water , and the meat that I 've had cooked for my own servants [ f ] and give it to you ? Besides , I 'm not sure that David sent you ! [ g ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	12	The men returned to their camp and told David everything Nabal had said .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	13	“ Everybody get your swords ! ” David ordered . They all strapped on their swords . Two hundred men stayed behind to guard the camp , but the other
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	400	followed David . 14-16 Meanwhile , one of Nabal 's servants told Abigail : David 's men were often nearby while we were taking care of the sheep in the fields . They were very good to us , they never hurt us , and nothing was ever stolen from us while they were nearby . With them around day or night , we were as safe as we would have been inside a walled city . David sent some messengers from the desert to wish our master well , but he shouted insults at them .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	17	He 's a bully who wo n't listen to anyone . Is n't there something you can do ? Please think of something ! Or else our master and his family and everyone who works for him are all doomed .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	18	Abigail quickly got together
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	200	handfuls of dried figs . She loaded all the food on donkeys
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	100	handfuls of raisins , and
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	19	and told her servants , “ Take this on ahead , and I 'll catch up with you. ” She did n't tell her husband Nabal what she was doing .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	20	Abigail was riding her donkey on the path that led around the hillside , when suddenly she met David and his men heading straight at her .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	21	David had just been saying , “ I surely wasted my time guarding Nabal 's things in the desert and keeping them from being stolen ! I was good to him , and now he pays me back with insults .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	22	I swear that by morning , there wo n't be a man or boy left from his family or his servants ' families . I pray that God will punish me [ h ] if I do n't do it ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	23	Abigail quickly got off her donkey and bowed down in front of David .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	24	Then she said : Sir , please let me explain !
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	28	Please forgive me if I say a little more . The Lord will always protect you and your family , because you fight for him . I pray that you wo n't ever do anything evil as long as you live .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	29	The Lord your God will keep you safe when your enemies try to kill you . But he will snatch away their lives quicker than you can throw a rock from a sling .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	30	The Lord has promised to do many good things for you , even to make you the ruler of Israel . The Lord will keep his promises to you ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	31	and now your conscience will be clear , because you wo n't be guilty of taking revenge and killing innocent people . When the Lord does all those good things for you , please remember me .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	32	David told her : I praise the Lord God of Israel ! He must have sent you to meet me today .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	33	And you should also be praised . Your good sense kept me from taking revenge and killing innocent people .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	34	If you had n't come to meet me so quickly , every man and boy in Nabal 's family and in his servants ' families would have been killed by morning . I swear by the living Lord God of Israel who protected you that this is the truth .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	35	David accepted the food Abigail had brought . “ Do n't worry , ” he said . “ You can go home now . I 'll do what you asked. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	36	Abigail went back home and found Nabal throwing a party fit for a king . He was very drunk and feeling good , so she did n't tell him anything that night .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	37	But when he sobered up the next morning , Abigail told him everything that had happened . Nabal had a heart attack , and he lay in bed as still as a stone .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	38	Ten days later , the Lord took his life . 39-40 David heard that Nabal had died . “ I praise the Lord ! ” David said . “ He has judged Nabal guilty for insulting me . The Lord kept me from doing anything wrong , and he made sure that Nabal hurt only himself with his own evil. ” David and Abigail Are Married Abigail was still at Carmel . So David sent messengers to ask her if she would marry him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	41	She bowed down and said , “ I would willingly be David 's slave and wash his servants ' feet. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	42	Abigail quickly got ready and went back with David 's messengers . She rode on her donkey , while five of her servant women walked alongside . She and David were married as soon as she arrived .
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	43	David had earlier married Ahinoam from the town of Jezreel , so both she and Abigail were now David 's wives . [ i ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	25	44	( A ) Meanwhile , Saul had arranged for Michal [ j ] to marry Palti the son of Laish , who came from the town of Gallim .

CEV	1%20Samuel	26	26	( A ) Once again , [ a ] some people from Ziph went to Gibeah to talk with Saul . “ David has a hideout on Mount Hachilah near Jeshimon out in the desert , ” they told him .

CEV	1%20Samuel	26	3	Saul set up camp on Mount Hachilah , which is across the road from Jeshimon . But David was hiding out in the desert . When David heard that Saul was following him ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	4	he sent some spies to find out if it was true .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	5	Then he sneaked up to Saul 's camp . He noticed that Saul and his army commander Abner the son of Ner were sleeping in the middle of the camp , with soldiers sleeping all around them .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	6	David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab 's brother Abishai , [ b ] “ Which one of you will go with me into Saul 's camp ? ” “ I will ! ” Abishai answered .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	7	That same night , David and Abishai crept into the camp . Saul was sleeping , and his spear was stuck in the ground not far from his head . Abner and the soldiers were sound asleep all around him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	8	Abishai whispered , “ This time God has let you get your hands on your enemy ! I 'll pin him to the ground with one thrust of his own spear. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	9	“ Do n't kill him ! ” David whispered back . “ The Lord will punish anyone who kills his chosen king .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	10	As surely as the Lord lives , the Lord will kill Saul , or Saul will die a natural death or be killed in battle .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	11	( B ) But I pray that the Lord will keep me from harming his chosen king . Let 's grab his spear and his water jar and get out of here ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	12	David took the spear and the water jar , then left the camp . None of Saul 's soldiers knew what had happened or even woke up—the Lord had made all of them fall sound asleep .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	13	David and Abishai crossed the valley and went to the top of the next hill , where they were at a safe distance .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	14	“ Abner ! ” David shouted toward Saul 's army . “ Can you hear me ? ” Abner shouted back . “ Who dares disturb the king ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	15	“ Abner , what kind of a man are you ? ” David replied . “ Are n't you supposed to be the best soldier in Israel ? Then why did n't you protect your king ? Anyone who went into your camp could have killed him tonight . [ c ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	16	You 're a complete failure ! I swear by the living Lord that you and your men deserve to die for not protecting the Lord 's chosen king . Look and see if you can find the king 's spear and the water jar that were near his head. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	17	Saul could tell it was David 's voice , and he called out , “ David , my son ! Is that you ? ” “ Yes it is , Your Majesty .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	18	Why are you hunting me down ? Have I done something wrong , or have I committed a crime ?
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	19	Please listen to what I have to say . If the Lord has turned you against me , maybe a sacrifice will make him change his mind . But if some people have turned you against me , I hope the Lord will punish them ! They have forced me to leave the land that belongs to the Lord and have told me to worship foreign gods . [ d ]
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	20	Do n't let me die in a land far away from the Lord . I 'm no more important than a flea ! Why should the king of Israel hunt me down as if I were a bird in the mountains ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	21	“ David , you had the chance to kill me today . But you did n't . I was very wrong about you . It was a terrible mistake for me to try to kill you . I 've acted like a fool , but I 'll never try to harm you again . You 're like a son to me , so please come back. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	22	“ Your Majesty , here 's your spear ! Let one of your soldiers come and get it .
CEV	1%20Samuel	26	23	The Lord put you in my power today , but you are his chosen king and I would n't harm you . The Lord rewards people who are faithful and live right .

CEV	1%20Samuel	27	1	but he thought to himself , “ One of these days , Saul is going to kill me . The only way to escape from him is to go to Philistia . Then I 'll be outside of Israel , and Saul will give up trying to catch me. ” 2-3 David and his
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	27	""
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	600	men went across the border to stay in Gath with King Achish the son of Maoch . His men brought their families with them . David brought his wife Ahinoam whose hometown was Jezreel , and he also brought his wife Abigail who had been married to Nabal from Carmel .
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	4	When Saul found out that David had run off to Gath , he stopped trying to catch him .
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	5	One day , David was talking with Achish and said , “ If you are happy with me , then let me live in one of the towns in the countryside . I 'm not important enough to live here with you in the royal city. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	6	Achish gave David the town of Ziklag that same day , and Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since .
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	7	David was in Philistia for a year and four months .
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	8	The Geshurites , the Girzites , and the Amalekites lived in the area from Telam to Shur [ a ] and on as far as Egypt , and David often attacked their towns .
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	9	Whenever David and his men attacked a town , they took the sheep , cattle , donkeys , camels , and the clothing , and killed everyone who lived there . After he returned from a raid , David always went to see Achish ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	10	who would ask , “ Where did you attack today ? ” [ b ] David would answer , “ Oh , we attacked some desert town that belonged to the Judah tribe. ” Sometimes David would say , “ Oh , we attacked a town in the desert where the Jerahmeel clan lives ” or “ We attacked a town in the desert where the Kenites [ c ] live. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	11	That 's why David killed everyone in the towns he attacked . He thought , “ If I let any of them live , they might come to Gath and tell what I 've really been doing. ” David made these raids all the time he was in Philistia .
CEV	1%20Samuel	27	12	But Achish trusted David and thought , “ David 's people must be furious with him .

CEV	1%20Samuel	28	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	28	1-3 ( A ) Samuel had died some time earlier , [ a ] and people from all over Israel had attended his funeral in his hometown of Ramah . Meanwhile , Saul had been trying to get rid of everyone who spoke with the spirits of the dead . [ b ] But one day the Philistines brought their soldiers together to attack Israel . Achish told David , “ Of course , you know that you and your men must fight as part of our Philistine army. ” David answered , “ That will give you a chance to see for yourself just how well we can fight ! ” “ In that case , ” Achish said , “ you and your men will always be my bodyguards. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	4	The Philistines went to Shunem and set up camp . Saul called the army of Israel together , and they set up their camp in Gilboa .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	5	Saul took one look at the Philistine army and started shaking with fear .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	6	( B ) So he asked the Lord what to do . But the Lord would not answer , either in a dream or by a priest or a prophet .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	7	Then Saul told his officers , “ Find me a woman who can talk to the spirits of the dead . I 'll go to her and find out what 's going to happen. ” His servants told him , “ There 's a woman at Endor who can talk to spirits of the dead. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	8	That night , Saul put on different clothing so nobody would recognize him . Then he and two of his men went to the woman , and asked , “ Will you bring up the ghost of someone for us ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	9	The woman said , “ Why are you trying to trick me and get me killed ? You know King Saul has killed everyone who talks to the spirits of the dead ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	10	Saul replied , “ I swear by the living Lord that nothing will happen to you because of this. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	11	( C ) “ Who do you want me to bring up ? ” she asked . “ Bring up the ghost of Samuel , ” he answered .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	12	When the woman saw Samuel , she screamed . Then she turned to Saul and said , “ You 've tricked me ! You 're the king ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	13	“ Do n't be afraid , ” Saul replied . “ Just tell me what you see. ” She answered , “ I see a spirit rising up out of the ground. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	14	“ What does it look like ? ” “ It looks like an old man wearing a robe. ” Saul knew it was Samuel , so he bowed down low .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	15	“ Why are you bothering me by bringing me up like this ? ” Samuel asked . “ I 'm terribly worried , ” Saul answered . “ The Philistines are about to attack me . God has turned his back on me and wo n't answer any more by prophets or by dreams . What should I do ? ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	16	Samuel said : If the Lord has turned away from you and is now your enemy , do n't ask me what to do .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	17	( D ) I 've already told you : The Lord has sworn to take the kingdom from you and give it to David . And that 's just what he 's doing !
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	18	( E ) When the Lord was angry with the Amalekites , he told you to destroy them , but you did n't do it . That 's why the Lord is doing this to you .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	19	Tomorrow the Lord will let the Philistines defeat Israel 's army , then you and your sons will join me down here in the world of the dead .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	20	At once , Saul collapsed and lay stretched out on the floor , terrified at what Samuel had said . He was weak because he had not eaten anything since the day before .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	21	The woman came over to Saul , and when she saw that he was completely terrified , she said , “ Your Majesty , I listened to you and risked my life to do what you asked .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	22	Now please listen to me . Let me get you a little something to eat . It will give you strength for your walk back to camp. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	23	“ No , I wo n't eat ! ” But his officers and the woman kept on urging Saul , until he finally agreed . He got up off the floor and sat on the bed .
CEV	1%20Samuel	28	24	At once the woman killed a calf that she had been fattening up . She cooked part of the meat and baked some thin bread . [ c ]

I 've never had even one complaint about him. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	29	4	The Philistine army commanders were angry and shouted : Send David back to the town you gave him . We wo n't have him going into the battle with us . He could turn and fight against us ! Saul would take David back as an officer if David brought him the heads of our soldiers .

CEV	1%20Samuel	30	1	Samuel
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	30	It took David and his men three days to reach Ziklag . But while they had been away , the Amalekites had been raiding in the desert around there . They had attacked Ziklag , burned it to the ground ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	2	and had taken away the women and children .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	3	When David and his men came to Ziklag , they saw the burned-out ruins and learned that their families had been taken captive .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	4	They started crying and kept it up until they were too weak to cry any more .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	5	( A ) David 's two wives , Ahinoam and Abigail , had been taken captive with everyone else .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	6	David was desperate . His soldiers were so upset over what had happened to their sons and daughters that they were thinking about stoning David to death . But he felt the Lord God giving him strength ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	7	( B ) and he said to the priest , “ Abiathar , let 's ask God what to do. ” Abiathar brought everything he needed to get answers from God , and he went over to David .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	8	Then David asked the Lord , “ Should I go after the people who raided our town ? Can I catch up with them ? ” “ Go after them , ” the Lord answered . “ You will catch up with them , and you will rescue your families. ” 9-10 David led his
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	600	men to Besor Gorge , but
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	200	men and asked how they were doing .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	400	men crossed the gorge .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	11	Some of David 's men found an Egyptian out in a field and took him to David . They gave the Egyptian some bread , and he ate it . Then they gave him a drink of water ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	12	some dried figs , and two handfuls of raisins . This was the first time in three days he had tasted food or water . Now he felt much better .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	13	“ Who is your master ? ” David asked . “ And where do you come from ? ” “ I 'm from Egypt , ” the young man answered . “ I 'm the servant of an Amalekite , but he left me here three days ago because I was sick .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	14	We had attacked some towns in the desert where the Cherethites live , in the area that belongs to Judah , and in the desert where the Caleb clan lives . And we burned down Ziklag. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	15	“ Will you take me to those Amalekites ? ” David asked . “ Yes , I will , if you promise with God as a witness that you wo n't kill me or hand me over to my master. ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	16	He led David to the Amalekites . They were eating and drinking everywhere , celebrating because of what they had taken from Philistia and Judah .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	17	David attacked just before sunrise the next day and fought until sunset . [ a ] Four hundred Amalekites rode away on camels , but they were the only ones who escaped .

CEV	1%20Samuel	30	19	No one was missing—young or old , sons or daughters . David brought back everything that had been stolen ,
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	20	including their livestock . David also took the sheep and cattle that the Amalekites had with them , but he kept these separate from the others . Everyone agreed that these would be David 's reward .
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	21	On the way back , David went to the
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	22	Some of David 's men were good-for-nothings , and they said , “ Those men did n't go with us to the battle , so they do n't get any of the things we took back from the Amalekites . Let them take their wives and children and go ! ”
CEV	1%20Samuel	30	23	But David said : My friends , do n't be so greedy with what the Lord has given us ! The Lord protected us and gave us victory over the people who attacked .

CEV	2%20Samuel	12	18	After the child had been sick for seven days , he died , but the officials were afraid to tell David . They said to each other , “ Even when the boy was alive , David would n't listen to us . How can we tell him his son is dead ? He might do something terrible ! ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	12	19	David noticed his servants whispering , and he knew the boy was dead . “ Did my son die ? ” he asked his servants . “ Yes , he did , ” they answered .

CEV	2%20Samuel	13	2	But Tamar was a virgin , and Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her . He was so upset about it that he made himself sick .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	13	Think of me . I 'll be disgraced forever ! And think of yourself . Everyone in Israel will say you 're nothing but trash ! Just ask the king , and he will let you marry me. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	3	Amnon had a friend named Jonadab , who was the son of David 's brother Shimeah . Jonadab always knew how to get what he wanted ,
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	4	and he said to Amnon , “ What 's the matter ? You 're the king 's son ! You should n't have to go around feeling sorry for yourself every morning. ” Amnon said , “ I 'm in love with Tamar , my brother Absalom 's sister. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	5	Jonadab told him , “ Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick . When your father comes to see you , ask him to send Tamar , so you can watch her cook something for you . Then she can serve you the food. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	6	So Amnon went to bed and pretended to be sick . When the king came to see him , Amnon said , “ Please , ask Tamar to come over . She can make some special bread [ b ] while I watch , and then she can serve it to me. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	7	David told Tamar , “ Go over to Amnon 's house and fix him some food. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	8	When she got there , he was lying in bed . She mixed the dough , made the loaves , and baked them while he watched .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	9	Then she took the bread out of the pan and put it on his plate , but he refused to eat it . Amnon said , “ Send the servants out of the house. ” After they had gone ,
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	10	he said to Tamar , “ Serve the food in my bedroom. ” Tamar picked up the bread that she had made and brought it into Amnon 's bedroom .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	11	But as she was taking it over to him , he grabbed her and said , “ Come to bed with me ! ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	12	She answered , “ No ! Please do n't force me ! This sort of thing is n't done in Israel . It 's disgusting !
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	14	But Amnon would not listen to what she said . He was stronger than she was , so he overpowered her and raped her .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	15	Then Amnon hated her even more than he had loved her before . So he told her , “ Get up and get out ! ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	16	She said , “ Do n't send me away ! That would be worse than what you have already done. ” But Amnon would not listen .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	17	He called in his servant and said , “ Throw this woman out and lock the door ! ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	18	The servant made her leave , and he locked the door behind her . The king 's unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves . [ c ]
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	19	Tamar tore the robe she was wearing and put ashes on her head . Then she covered her face with her hands and cried loudly as she walked away . Absalom Kills Amnon
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	20	Tamar 's brother Absalom said to her , “ How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you ! But since he 's your brother , do n't tell anyone what happened . Just try not to think about it. ” Tamar soon moved into Absalom 's house , but she was always sad and lonely .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	21	When David heard what had happened to Tamar , he was very angry . But Amnon was his oldest son and also his favorite , and David would not do anything to make Amnon unhappy . [ d ]
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	22	Absalom treated Amnon as though nothing had happened , but he hated Amnon for what he had done to his sister Tamar .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	23	Two years later , Absalom 's servants were cutting wool from his sheep in Baal-Hazor near the town of Ephraim , and Absalom invited all of the king 's sons to be there . [ e ]
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	24	Then he went to David and said , “ My servants are cutting the wool from my sheep . Please come and join us ! ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	25	David answered , “ No , my son , we wo n't go . It would be too expensive for you. ” Absalom tried to get him to change his mind , but David did not want to go . He only said that he hoped they would have a good time .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	26	Absalom said , “ If you wo n't go , at least let my brother Amnon come with us. ” David asked , “ Why should he go with you ? ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	27	But Absalom kept on insisting , and finally David let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom . Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king . [ f ]
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	28	But he told his servants , “ Keep an eye on Amnon . When he gets a little drunk from the wine and is feeling relaxed , I 'll give the signal . Then kill him ! I 've commanded you to do it , so do n't be afraid . Be strong and brave. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	29	Absalom 's servants killed Amnon , just as Absalom had told them . The rest of the king 's sons quickly rode away on their mules to escape from Absalom .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	30	While they were on their way to Jerusalem , someone told David , “ Absalom has killed all of your sons ! Not even one is left. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	31	David got up , and in his sorrow he tore his clothes and lay down on the ground . His servants remained standing , but they tore their clothes too .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	32	Then David 's nephew [ g ] Jonadab said , “ Your Majesty , not all of your sons were killed ! Only Amnon is dead . On the day that Amnon raped Tamar , Absalom decided to kill him .
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	33	Do n't worry about the report that all your sons were killed . Only Amnon is dead ,
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	34	and Absalom has run away. ” One of the guards noticed a lot of people coming along the hillside on the road to Horonaim . [ h ] He went and told the king , “ I saw some men coming along Horonaim Road. ” [ i ]
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	35	Jonadab said , “ Your Majesty , look ! Here come your sons now , just as I told you. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	13	36	No sooner had he said it , than David 's sons came in . They were weeping out loud , and David and all his officials cried just as loudly . 37-38 ( A ) David was sad for a long time because Amnon was dead . David Lets Absalom Come Home Absalom had run away to Geshur , where he stayed for three years with King Talmai [ j ] the son of Ammihud .

CEV	2%20Samuel	14	2	Samuel
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	14	We each must die and disappear like water poured out on the ground . But God does n't take our lives . [ b ] Instead , he figures out ways of bringing us back when we run away .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	4	The woman from Tekoa went to David . She bowed very low and said , “ Your Majesty , please help me ! ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	5	David asked , “ What 's the matter ? ” She replied : My husband is dead , and I 'm a widow .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	6	I had two sons , but they got into a fight out in a field where there was no one to pull them apart , and one of them killed the other .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	7	Now all of my relatives have come to me and said , “ Hand over your son ! We 're going to put him to death for killing his brother. ” But what they really want is to get rid of him , so they can take over our land . Please do n't let them put out my only flame of hope ! There wo n't be anyone left on this earth to carry on my husband 's name .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	8	“ Go on home , ” David told her . “ I 'll take care of this matter for you. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	9	The woman said , “ I hope your decision does n't cause any problems for you . But if it does , you can blame me. ” [ a ]
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	10	He said , “ If anyone gives you trouble , bring them to me , and it wo n't happen again ! ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	11	“ Please , ” she replied , “ swear by the Lord your God that no one will be allowed to kill my son ! ” He said , “ I swear by the living Lord that no one will touch even a hair on his head ! ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	12	Then she asked , “ Your Majesty , may I say something ? ” “ Yes , ” he answered .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	13	The woman said : Have n't you been hurting God 's people ? Your own son had to leave the country . And when you judged in my favor , it was the same as admitting that you should have let him come back .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	15	Your Majesty , I came here to tell you about my problem , because I was afraid of what someone might do to me . I decided to come to you , because I thought you could help .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	16	In fact , I knew that you would listen and save my son and me from those who want to take the land that God gave us . [ c ]
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	17	( A ) I can rest easy now that you have given your decision . You know the difference between right and wrong just like an angel of God , and I pray that the Lord your God will be with you .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	18	Then David said to the woman , “ Now I 'm going to ask you a question , and do n't try to hide the truth ! ” The woman replied , “ Please go ahead , Your Majesty. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	19	David asked , “ Did Joab put you up to this ? ” The woman answered , “ Your Majesty , I swear by your life that no one can hide the truth from you . Yes , Joab did tell me what to say ,
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	20	but only to show you the other side of this problem . You must be as wise as the angel of God to know everything that goes on in this country. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	21	David turned to Joab and said , “ It seems that I have already given my decision . Go and bring Absalom back. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	22	Joab bowed very low and said , “ Your Majesty , I thank you for giving your permission . It shows that you approve of me. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	23	Joab went to Geshur to get Absalom . But when they came back to Jerusalem ,
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	24	David told Joab , “ I do n't want to see my son Absalom . Tell him to stay away from me. ” So Absalom went to his own house without seeing his father . Absalom Was Handsome
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	25	No one in all Israel was as handsome and well-built as Absalom .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	26	His hair grew so thick and heavy that when he got it cut once a year , it weighed over two kilograms .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	27	Absalom had three sons . He also had a daughter named Tamar , who grew up to be very beautiful . Absalom Finally Sees David
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	28	Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing his father .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	29	He wanted Joab to talk to David for him . So one day he sent a message asking Joab to come over , but Joab refused . Absalom sent another message , but Joab still refused .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	30	Finally , Absalom told his servants , “ Joab 's barley field is right next to mine . Go set it on fire ! ” And they did .
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	31	Joab went to Absalom 's house and demanded , “ Why did your servants set my field on fire ? ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	32	Absalom answered , “ You did n't pay any attention when I sent for you . I want you to ask my father why he told me to come back from Geshur . I was better off there . I want to see my father now ! If I 'm guilty , let him kill me. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	14	33	Joab went to David and told him what Absalom had said . David sent for Absalom , and Absalom came . He bowed very low , and David leaned over and kissed him . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Samuel	15	2	He would get up early each morning and wait by the side of the road that led to the city gate . [ a ] Anyone who had a complaint to bring to King David would have to go that way , and Absalom would ask each of them , “ Where are you from ? ” If they said , “ I 'm from a tribe in the north , ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	15	The officials said , “ Your Majesty , we 'll do whatever you say. ” 16-17 David left behind ten of his wives [ d ] to take care of the palace , but the rest of his family and his officials and soldiers went with him . They stopped at the last house at the edge of the city .
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	50	men run in front .
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	3	Absalom would say , “ You deserve to win your case . It 's too bad the king does n't have anyone to hear complaints like yours .
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	4	I wish someone would make me the judge around here ! I would be fair to everyone. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	5	Whenever anyone came to Absalom and started bowing down , he would reach out and hug and kiss them .
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	6	That 's how he treated everyone from Israel who brought a complaint to the king . Soon everyone in Israel liked Absalom better than they liked David .
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	7	Four years [ b ] later , Absalom said to David , “ Please , let me go to Hebron . I have to keep a promise that I made to the Lord ,
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	8	when I was living with the Arameans in Geshur . I promised that if the Lord would bring me back to live in Jerusalem , I would worship him in Hebron. ” [ c ]
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	9	David gave his permission , and Absalom went to Hebron . 10-12 He took
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	200	men from Jerusalem with him , but they had no idea what he was going to do . Absalom offered sacrifices in Hebron and sent someone to Gilo to tell David 's advisor Ahithophel to come . More and more people were joining Absalom and supporting his plot . Meanwhile , Absalom had secretly sent some messengers to the northern tribes of Israel . The messengers told everyone , “ When you hear the sound of the trumpets , you must shout , ‘ Absalom now rules as king in Hebron ! ’ ” David Has To Leave Jerusalem
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	13	A messenger came and told David , “ Everyone in Israel is on Absalom 's side ! ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	14	David 's officials were in Jerusalem with him , and he told them , “ Let 's get out of here ! We 'll have to leave soon , or none of us will escape from Absalom . Hurry ! If he moves fast , he could catch us while we 're still here . Then he will kill us and everyone else in the city. ”
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	18	Then David stood there and watched while his regular troops and his bodyguards [ e ] marched past . The last group was the

CEV	2%20Samuel	15	21	Ittai answered , “ Your Majesty , just as surely as you and the Lord live , I will go where you go , no matter if it costs me my life. ”

CEV	2%20Samuel	15	23	The people of Jerusalem were crying and moaning as David and everyone with him passed by . He led them across Kidron Valley [ h ] and along the road toward the desert .
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	24	Zadok and Abiathar the priests were there along with several men from the tribe of Levi who were carrying the sacred chest . They set the chest down , and left it there until David and his followers had gone out of the city .
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	25	Then David said : Zadok , take the sacred chest back to Jerusalem . If the Lord is pleased with me , he will bring me back and let me see it and his tent again .
CEV	2%20Samuel	15	26	But if he says he is n't pleased with me , then let him do what he knows is best .

CEV	2%20Samuel	24	11	Before David even got up the next morning , the Lord had told David 's prophet Gad 12-13 to take a message to David . Gad went to David and told him : You must choose one of three ways for the Lord to punish you : Will there be seven [ e ] years when the land wo n't grow enough food for your people ? Or will your enemies chase you and make you run from them for three months ? Or will there be three days of horrible disease in your land ? Think about it and decide , because I have to give your answer to God , who sent me .
CEV	2%20Samuel	24	14	David was really frightened and said , “ It 's a terrible choice to make ! But the Lord is kind , and I 'd rather be punished by him than by anyone else. ” 15-16 So that morning , the Lord sent an angel to spread a horrible disease everywhere in Israel , from Dan to Beersheba . And before it was over , 70,000 people had died . When the angel was about to destroy Jerusalem , the Lord felt sorry for all the suffering he had caused and told the angel , “ That 's enough ! Do n't touch them. ” This happened at the threshing place that belonged to Araunah the Jebusite .
CEV	2%20Samuel	24	17	David saw the angel killing everyone and told the Lord , “ These people are like sheep with me as their shepherd . [ f ] I have sinned terribly , but they have done nothing wrong . Please , punish me and my family instead of them ! ” David Buys Araunah 's Threshing Place (

CEV	1%20Kings	1	23	Someone told David that he was there , and Nathan came in . He bowed with his face to the ground
CEV	1%20Kings	1	24	and said : Your Majesty , did you say that Adonijah would be king ?
CEV	1%20Kings	1	25	Earlier today , he sacrificed a lot of cattle , calves , and sheep . He invited the army commanders , Abiathar , and all your sons to be there . They are already eating and drinking and shouting , “ Long live King Adonijah ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	26	But he did n't invite me or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon .
CEV	1%20Kings	1	27	Did you say they could do this without telling the rest of us who would be the next king ? Solomon Becomes King
CEV	1%20Kings	1	28	David said , “ Tell Bathsheba to come here. ” She came and stood in front of him . 29-30 Then he said , “ The living Lord God of Israel has kept me safe . And so today , I will keep the promise I made to you in his name : Solomon will be the next king ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	31	Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and said , “ Your Majesty , I pray that you will live a long time ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	32	Then David said , “ Tell Zadok , Nathan , and Benaiah to come here. ” When they arrived ,
CEV	1%20Kings	1	33	he told them : Take along some of my officials and let Solomon ride my own mule to Gihon Spring .
CEV	1%20Kings	1	34	When you get there , Zadok and Nathan will pour olive oil over Solomon 's head to show that he is the new king of Israel . Then order someone to blow a trumpet and tell everyone to shout , “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	35	Bring him back here , and he will take my place as king . He is the one I have chosen to rule Israel and Judah .
CEV	1%20Kings	1	36	Benaiah answered , “ We will do it , Your Majesty . I pray that the Lord your God will let it happen .
CEV	1%20Kings	1	37	The Lord has always watched over you , and I pray that he will now watch over Solomon . May the Lord help Solomon to be an even greater king than you. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	38	Zadok , Nathan , and Benaiah left and took along the two groups of David 's special bodyguards . [ f ] Solomon rode on David 's mule as they led him to Gihon Spring .
CEV	1%20Kings	1	39	Zadok the priest brought some olive oil from the sacred tent and poured it on Solomon 's head to show that he was now king . A trumpet was blown and everyone shouted , “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	40	Then they played flutes and celebrated as they followed Solomon back to Jerusalem . They made so much noise that the ground shook .
CEV	1%20Kings	1	41	Adonijah and his guests had almost finished eating when they heard the noise . Joab also heard the trumpet and asked , “ What 's all that noise about in the city ? ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	42	Just then , Jonathan son of Abiathar came running up . “ Come in , ” Adonijah said . “ An important man like you must have some good news. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	43	Jonathan answered : No , I do n't ! David has just announced that Solomon will be king . 44-45 Solomon rode David 's own mule to Gihon Spring , and Zadok , Nathan , Benaiah , and David 's special bodyguards [ g ] went with him . When they got there , Zadok and Nathan made Solomon king . Then everyone celebrated all the way back to Jerusalem . That 's the noise you hear in the city .
CEV	1%20Kings	1	46	Solomon is now king .
CEV	1%20Kings	1	47	And listen to this ! David 's officials told him , “ We pray that your God will help Solomon to be an even greater king ! ” David was in his bed at the time , but he bowed
CEV	1%20Kings	1	48	and prayed , “ I praise you , Lord God of Israel . You have made my son Solomon king and have let me live to see it. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	49	Adonijah 's guests shook with fear when they heard this news , and they left as fast as they could .
CEV	1%20Kings	1	51	Someone told Solomon , “ Adonijah is afraid of you and is holding onto the corners of the altar . He wants you to promise that you wo n't kill him. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	52	Solomon answered , “ If Adonijah does n't cause any trouble , I wo n't hurt him . But if he does , I 'll have him killed. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	1	53	Then he sent someone to the altar to get Adonijah . After Adonijah came and bowed down , Solomon said , “ Adonijah , go home. ” Footnotes - 1.3,4 Shunem : A town in northern Israel , just north of Jezreel Valley . - 1.5,6 brother : Since Absalom was dead , Adonijah was now David 's oldest living son and would be next in line to be king . - 1.8 Shimei , Rei : Or “ Shimei his advisor. ” - 1.9 Crawling Rock : Or “ Zoheleth Rock. ” - 1.9 sacrificed … calves : This was part of a ceremony where Adonijah was made the new king . - 1.38 the two … bodyguards : The Hebrew text has “ the Cherethites and the Pelethites , ” who were foreign soldiers hired by David to be part of his bodyguard . - 1.44,45 David 's special bodyguards : See the note at 1.38 . - 1.50 the corners … for protection : The four corners of some ancient altars looked like animal horns .

CEV	1%20Kings	2	12	( E ) His son Solomon became king and took control of David 's kingdom . Adonijah Is Killed
CEV	1%20Kings	2	13	One day , Adonijah went to see Bathsheba , Solomon 's mother , and she asked , “ Is this a friendly visit ? ” “ Yes .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	14	I just want to talk with you. ” “ All right , ” she told him , “ go ahead. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	2	15	“ You know that I was king for a little while , ” Adonijah replied . “ And everyone in Israel accepted me as their ruler . But the Lord wanted my brother to be king , so now things have changed .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	16	Would you do me a favor ? ” “ What do you want ? ” Bathsheba asked .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	17	( F ) “ Please ask Solomon to let me marry Abishag . He wo n't say no to you. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	2	18	“ All right , ” she said . “ I 'll ask him. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	2	19	When Bathsheba went to see Solomon , he stood up to meet her , then bowed low . He sat back down and had another throne brought in , so his mother could sit at his right side . [ e ]
CEV	1%20Kings	2	20	Bathsheba sat down and then asked , “ Would you do me a small favor ? ” Solomon replied , “ Mother , just tell me what you want , and I will do it. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	2	21	“ Allow your brother Adonijah to marry Abishag , ” she answered .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	22	Solomon said : What ? Let my older brother marry Abishag ? You may as well ask me to let him rule the kingdom ! And why do n't you ask such favors for Abiathar and Joab ? [ f ]
CEV	1%20Kings	2	23	I swear in the name of the Lord that Adonijah will die because he asked for this ! If he does n't , I pray that God will severely punish me .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	24	The Lord made me king in my father 's place and promised that the kings of Israel would come from my family . Yes , I swear by the living Lord that Adonijah will die today .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	25	“ Benaiah , ” Solomon shouted , “ go kill Adonijah. ” So Adonijah died . Abiathar Is Sent Back Home
CEV	1%20Kings	2	26	( G ) Solomon sent for Abiathar the priest and said : Abiathar , go back home to Anathoth ! You ought to be killed too , but I wo n't do it now . When my father David was king , you were in charge of the sacred chest , and you went through a lot of hard times with my father .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	27	( H ) But I wo n't let you be a priest of the Lord anymore . And so the promise that the Lord had made at Shiloh about the family of Eli came true . [ g ] Joab Is Killed
CEV	1%20Kings	2	28	Joab had not helped Absalom try to become king , but he had helped Adonijah . So when Joab learned that Adonijah had been killed , he ran to the sacred tent and grabbed hold of the corners of the altar for protection . [ h ]
CEV	1%20Kings	2	29	When Solomon heard about this , he sent someone to ask Joab , “ Why did you run to the altar ? ” Joab sent back his answer , “ I was afraid of you , and I ran to the Lord for protection. ” [ i ] Then Solomon shouted , “ Benaiah , go kill Joab ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	2	30	Benaiah went to the sacred tent and yelled , “ Joab , the king orders you to come out ! ” “ No ! ” Joab answered . “ Kill me right here. ” Benaiah went back and told Solomon what Joab had said . 31-32 Solomon replied : Do what Joab said . Kill him and bury him ! Then my family and I wo n't be responsible for what he did to Abner the commander of Israel 's army and to Amasa the commander of Judah 's army . He killed those innocent men without my father knowing about it . Both of them were better men than Joab . Now the Lord will make him pay for those murders .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	34	Benaiah went back and killed Joab . His body was taken away and buried near his home in the desert .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	35	Solomon put Benaiah in Joab 's place as army commander , and he put Zadok in Abiathar 's place as priest . Shimei Is Killed
CEV	1%20Kings	2	36	Solomon sent for Shimei and said , “ Build a house here in Jerusalem and live in it . But whatever you do , do n't leave the city !
CEV	1%20Kings	2	37	If you ever cross Kidron Valley and leave Jerusalem , you will be killed . And it will be your own fault. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	2	38	“ That 's fair , Your Majesty , ” Shimei answered . “ I 'll do that. ” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem from then on .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	39	About three years later , two of Shimei 's servants ran off to King Achish in Gath . When Shimei found out where they were ,
CEV	1%20Kings	2	41	Someone told Solomon that Shimei had gone to Gath and was back .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	42	Solomon sent for him and said : Shimei , you promised in the name of the Lord that you would never leave Jerusalem . I warned you that you would die if you did . You agreed that this was fair , did n't you ?
CEV	1%20Kings	2	43	You have disobeyed me and have broken the promise you made to the Lord .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	44	I know you remember all the cruel things you did to my father David . Now the Lord is going to punish you for what you did .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	45	But the Lord will bless me and make my father 's kingdom strong forever .
CEV	1%20Kings	2	46	“ Benaiah , ” Solomon shouted , “ kill Shimei. ” So Shimei died . Solomon was now in complete control of his kingdom . Footnotes - 2.5 war : See

CEV	1%20Kings	3	1	Kings
CEV	1%20Kings	3	3	Solomon loved the Lord and followed his father David 's instructions , but Solomon also offered sacrifices and burned incense at the shrines .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	2	At that time , there was no temple for worshiping the Lord , and everyone offered sacrifices at the local shrines . [ b ]
CEV	1%20Kings	3	4	( A ) The most important shrine was in Gibeon , and Solomon had offered more than 1,000 sacrifices on that altar .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	5	One night while Solomon was in Gibeon , the Lord God appeared to him in a dream and said , “ Solomon , ask for anything you want , and I will give it to you. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	3	6	Solomon answered : My father David , your servant , was honest and did what you commanded . You were always loyal to him , and you gave him a son who is now king .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	7	Lord God , I 'm your servant , and you 've made me king in my father 's place . But I 'm very young and know so little about being a leader .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	8	And now I must rule your chosen people , even though there are too many of them to count .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	9	Please make me wise and teach me the difference between right and wrong . Then I will know how to rule your people . If you do n't , there is no way I could rule this great nation of yours . 10-11 God said : Solomon , I 'm pleased that you asked for this . You could have asked to live a long time or to be rich . Or you could have asked for your enemies to be destroyed . Instead , you asked for wisdom to make right decisions .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	12	So I 'll make you wiser than anyone who has ever lived or ever will live .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	13	I 'll also give you what you did n't ask for . You 'll be rich and respected as long as you live , and you 'll be greater than any other king .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	14	If you obey me and follow my commands , as your father David did , I 'll let you live a long time .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	15	Solomon woke up and realized that God had spoken to him in the dream . He went back to Jerusalem and stood in front of the sacred chest , where he offered sacrifices to please the Lord [ c ] and sacrifices to ask his blessing . [ d ] Then Solomon gave a feast for his officials . Solomon Makes a Difficult Decision
CEV	1%20Kings	3	16	One day two women [ e ] came to King Solomon ,
CEV	1%20Kings	3	17	and one of them said : Your Majesty , this woman and I live in the same house . Not long ago my baby was born at home ,
CEV	1%20Kings	3	18	and three days later her baby was born . Nobody else was there with us .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	19	One night while we were all asleep , she rolled over on her baby , and he died .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	20	Then while I was still asleep , she got up and took my son out of my bed . She put him in her bed , then she put her dead baby next to me .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	21	In the morning when I got up to feed my son , I saw that he was dead . But when I looked at him in the light , I knew he was n't my son .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	22	“ No ! ” the other woman shouted . “ He was your son . My baby is alive ! ” “ The dead baby is yours , ” the first woman yelled . “ Mine is alive ! ” They argued back and forth in front of Solomon ,
CEV	1%20Kings	3	23	until finally he said , “ Both of you say this live baby is yours .
CEV	1%20Kings	3	24	Someone bring me a sword. ” A sword was brought , and Solomon ordered ,
CEV	1%20Kings	3	25	“ Cut the baby in half ! That way each of you can have part of him. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	3	26	“ Please do n't kill my son , ” the baby 's mother screamed . “ Your Majesty , I love him very much , but give him to her . Just do n't kill him. ” The other woman shouted , “ Go ahead and cut him in half . Then neither of us will have the baby. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	3	27	Solomon said , “ Do n't kill the baby. ” Then he pointed to the first woman , “ She is his real mother . Give the baby to her. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	3	28	Everyone in Israel was amazed when they heard how Solomon had made his decision . They realized that God had given him wisdom to judge fairly .

CEV	1%20Kings	7	10	The foundation stones were huge , good stones—some of them four and a half meters long and others three and a half meters long .
CEV	1%20Kings	7	11	The cedar beams and other stones that had been cut to size were on top of these foundation stones .
CEV	1%20Kings	7	12	The walls around the palace courtyard were made out of three layers of cut stones with one layer of cedar beams , just like the front porch and the inner courtyard of the temple . Hiram Makes the Bronze Furnishings (
CEV	1%20Kings	7	2	Chronicles 4.11—5.1 ) This is a list of the bronze items that Hiram made for the Lord 's temple :

CEV	1%20Kings	8	1	Kings
CEV	1%20Kings	8	8	The poles were so long that they could be seen from right outside the most holy place , but not from anywhere else . And they stayed there from then on .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	2	Chronicles 7.4-10 ) 62-63 Solomon and the people dedicated the temple to the Lord by offering 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep as sacrifices to ask the Lord 's blessing . [ d ]
CEV	1%20Kings	8	5	Solomon and a crowd of people stood in front of the chest and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	6	The priests carried the chest into the most holy place and put it under the winged creatures ,
CEV	1%20Kings	8	7	whose wings covered both the chest and the poles used for carrying it .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	9	( B ) The only things kept in the chest were the two flat stones Moses had put there when the Lord made his agreement with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai , [ b ] after bringing them out of Egypt .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	10	( C ) Suddenly a cloud filled the temple as the priests were leaving the most holy place .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	11	The Lord 's glory was in the cloud , and the light from it was so bright that the priests could not stay inside to do their work .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	12	( D ) Then Solomon prayed : “ Our Lord , you said that you would live in a dark cloud .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	13	Now I have built a glorious temple where you can live forever. ” Solomon Speaks to the People (
CEV	1%20Kings	8	14	Solomon turned toward the people standing there . Then he blessed them 15-16 ( E ) and said : Praise the Lord God of Israel ! Long ago he brought his people out of Egypt . He did not choose a city from any tribe in Israel where his temple would be built , but he kept his promise to make my father David the king of Israel .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	17	( F ) So when David wanted to build a temple for the Lord God of Israel ,
CEV	1%20Kings	8	18	the Lord said , “ It 's good that you want to build a temple where I can be worshiped .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	19	( G ) But you 're not the one to do it . Your son will build a temple to honor me. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	8	20	The Lord has done what he promised . I am the king of Israel like my father , and I 've built a temple for the Lord our God .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	21	I 've also made a place in the temple for the sacred chest . And in that chest are the two flat stones on which is written the solemn agreement the Lord made with our ancestors when he led them out of Egypt . Solomon Prays at the Temple (
CEV	1%20Kings	8	22	Solomon stood facing the altar with everyone standing behind him . Then he lifted his arms toward heaven
CEV	1%20Kings	8	23	and prayed : Lord God of Israel , no other god in heaven or on earth is like you ! You never forget the agreement you made with your people , and you are loyal to anyone who faithfully obeys your teachings .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	24	My father David was your servant , and today you have kept every promise you made to him .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	25	( H ) Lord God of Israel , you promised my father that someone from his family would always be king of Israel , if they do their best to obey you , just as he did .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	26	Please keep this promise you made to your servant David .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	27	( I ) There 's not enough room in all of heaven for you , Lord God . How could you possibly live on earth in this temple I have built ?
CEV	1%20Kings	8	28	But I ask you to answer my prayer .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	29	( J ) This is the temple where you have chosen to be worshiped . Please watch over it day and night and listen when I turn toward it and pray .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	30	I am your servant , and the people of Israel belong to you . So whenever any of us look toward this temple and pray , answer from your home in heaven and forgive our sins .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	31	Suppose someone accuses a person of a crime , and the accused has to stand in front of the altar in your temple and say , “ I swear I am innocent ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	8	32	Listen from heaven and decide who is right . Then punish the guilty person and let the innocent one go free .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	33	( K ) Suppose your people Israel sin against you , and then an enemy defeats them . If they come to this temple and beg for forgiveness ,
CEV	1%20Kings	8	34	listen from your home in heaven . Forgive them and bring them back to the land you gave their ancestors .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	35	Suppose your people sin against you , and you punish them by holding back the rain . If they turn toward this temple and pray in your name and stop sinning ,
CEV	1%20Kings	8	36	listen from your home in heaven and forgive them . The people of Israel are your servants , so teach them to live right . And please send rain on the land you gave them to be theirs forever .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	37	Sometimes the crops may dry up or rot or be eaten by locusts [ c ] or grasshoppers , and your people will be starving . Sometimes enemies may surround their towns , or your people will become sick with deadly diseases .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	38	Listen when anyone in Israel truly feels sorry and sincerely prays with arms lifted toward your temple .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	39	You know what is in everyone 's heart . So from your home in heaven answer their prayers , according to the way they live and what is in their hearts .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	40	Then your people will worship and obey you for as long as they live in the land you gave their ancestors . 41-42 Foreigners will hear about you and your mighty power , and some of them will come to live among your people Israel . If any of them pray toward this temple ,
CEV	1%20Kings	8	43	listen from your home in heaven and answer their prayers . Then everyone on earth will worship you , just like your people Israel , and they will know that I have built this temple to honor you .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	44	Our Lord , sometimes you will order your people to attack their enemies . Then your people will turn toward this temple I have built for you in your chosen city , and they will pray to you .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	45	Answer their prayers from heaven and give them victory .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	46	Everyone sins . But when your people sin against you , suppose you get angry enough to let their enemies drag them away to foreign countries . 47-49 Later , they may feel sorry for what they did and ask your forgiveness . Answer them when they pray toward this temple I have built for you in your chosen city , here in this land you gave their ancestors . From your home in heaven , listen to their sincere prayers and do what they ask .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	50	Forgive your people no matter how much they have sinned against you . Make the enemies who defeated them be kind to them .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	51	Remember , they are the people you chose and rescued from Egypt that was like a blazing fire to them .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	52	I am your servant , and the people of Israel belong to you . So listen when any of us pray and cry out for your help .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	53	When you brought our ancestors out of Egypt , you told your servant Moses to say to them , “ From all people on earth , the Lord God has chosen you to be his very own. ” Solomon Blesses the People
CEV	1%20Kings	8	54	When Solomon finished his prayer at the altar , he was kneeling with his arms lifted toward heaven . He stood up ,
CEV	1%20Kings	8	55	turned toward the people , blessed them , and said loudly :
CEV	1%20Kings	8	56	( L ) Praise the Lord ! He has kept his promise and given us peace . Every good thing he promised to his servant Moses has happened .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	57	The Lord our God was with our ancestors to help them , and I pray that he will be with us and never abandon us .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	58	May the Lord help us obey him and follow all the laws and teachings he gave our ancestors .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	59	I pray that the Lord our God will remember my prayer day and night . May he help everyone in Israel each day , in whatever way we need it .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	60	Then every nation will know that the Lord is the only true God .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	61	Obey the Lord our God and follow his commands with all your heart , just as you are doing today . Solomon Dedicates the Temple (
CEV	1%20Kings	8	64	On that day , Solomon dedicated the courtyard in front of the temple and made it acceptable for worship . He offered the sacrifices there because the bronze altar in front of the temple was too small .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	65	Solomon and the huge crowd celebrated the Festival of Shelters at the temple for seven days . [ e ] There were people from as far away as the Egyptian Gorge in the south and Lebo-Hamath in the north .
CEV	1%20Kings	8	66	Then on the eighth day , he sent everyone home . They said goodbye and left , very happy , because of all the good things the Lord had done for his servant David and his people Israel .

CEV	1%20Kings	9	9	Then they will answer , “ We know why the Lord did this . The people of Israel rejected the Lord their God , who rescued their ancestors from Egypt , and they started worshiping other gods. ” Other Things Solomon Did (
CEV	1%20Kings	9	2	Chronicles 8.1-18 )
CEV	1%20Kings	9	3	( B ) The Lord said : I heard your prayer and what you asked me to do . This temple you have built is where I will be worshiped forever . It belongs to me , and I will never stop watching over it .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	4	You must obey me , as your father David did , and be honest and fair . Obey my laws and teachings ,
CEV	1%20Kings	9	5	( C ) and I will keep my promise to David that someone from your family will always be king of Israel .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	6	But if you or any of your descendants disobey my commands or start worshiping foreign gods ,
CEV	1%20Kings	9	7	I will no longer let my people Israel live in this land I gave them . I will desert this temple where I said I would be worshiped . Then people everywhere will think this nation is only a joke and will make fun of it .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	8	( D ) This temple will become a pile of rocks ! [ a ] Everyone who walks by will be shocked , and they will ask , “ Why did the Lord do such a terrible thing to his people and to this temple ? ”
CEV	1%20Kings	9	10	It took
CEV	1%20Kings	9	20	towns in the region of Galilee to repay him for the cedar , pine , and gold he had given Solomon .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	11	Later , Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre
CEV	1%20Kings	9	12	When Hiram went to see the towns , he did not like them .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	13	He said , “ Solomon , my friend , are these the kind of towns you want to give me ? ” So Hiram called the region Cabul because he thought it was worthless . [ b ]

CEV	1%20Kings	9	15	After Solomon 's workers had finished the temple and the palace , he ordered them to fill in the land on the east side of Jerusalem , [ c ] to build a wall around the city , and to rebuild the towns of Hazor , Megiddo , and Gezer .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	16	Earlier , the king of Egypt had captured the town of Gezer ; he burned it to the ground and killed the Canaanite people living there . Then he gave it to his daughter as a wedding present when she married Solomon .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	17	So Solomon had the town rebuilt . Solomon ordered his workers to rebuild Lower Beth-Horon ,
CEV	1%20Kings	9	18	Baalath , and Tamar in the desert of Judah .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	19	They also built towns where he could keep his supplies and his chariots and horses . Solomon ordered them to build whatever he wanted in Jerusalem , Lebanon , and anywhere in his kingdom . 20-22 Solomon did not force the Israelites to do his work . They were his soldiers , officials , leaders , commanders , chariot captains , and chariot drivers . But he did make slaves of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites who were living in Israel . These were the descendants of those foreigners the Israelites could not destroy , and they remained Israel 's slaves .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	23	Solomon appointed
CEV	1%20Kings	9	550	officers to be in charge of his workers and to watch over his building projects .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	24	Solomon 's wife , the daughter of the king of Egypt , moved from the older part of Jerusalem [ d ] to her new palace . Then Solomon had the land on the east side of Jerusalem filled in . [ e ]
CEV	1%20Kings	9	25	( E ) Three times a year , Solomon burned incense and offered sacrifices to the Lord on the altar he had built . Solomon had now finished building the Lord 's temple .
CEV	1%20Kings	9	26	He also had a lot of ships at Ezion-Geber , a town in Edom near Eloth on the Red Sea . [ f ] 27-28 King Hiram let some of his experienced sailors go to the country of Ophir [ g ] with Solomon 's own sailors , and they brought back about

CEV	1%20Kings	10	10	The Queen of Sheba gave Solomon more than four tons of gold , many jewels , and more spices than anyone had ever brought into Israel . 11-13 In return , Solomon gave her the gifts he would have given any other ruler , but he also gave her everything else she wanted . Then she and her officials went back to their own country . Solomon 's Wealth (
CEV	1%20Kings	10	2	Chronicles 9.13-28 ) King Hiram 's ships brought gold , juniper wood , and jewels from the country of Ophir . Solomon used the wood to make steps [ b ] for the temple and palace , and harps and other stringed instruments for the musicians . It was the best juniper wood anyone in Israel had ever seen .
CEV	1%20Kings	10	3	He answered every question , no matter how difficult it was . 4-5 The Queen was amazed at Solomon 's wisdom . She was breathless when she saw his palace , the food on his table , his officials , his servants in their uniforms , the people who served his food , and the sacrifices he offered at the Lord 's temple .
CEV	1%20Kings	10	6	She said : Solomon , in my own country I had heard about your wisdom and all you 've done .
CEV	1%20Kings	10	7	But I did n't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes ! And there 's so much I did n't hear about . You are wiser and richer than I was told .
CEV	1%20Kings	10	8	Your wives [ a ] and officials are lucky to be here where they can listen to the wise things you say .
CEV	1%20Kings	10	9	I praise the Lord your God . He is pleased with you and has made you king of Israel . The Lord has always loved Israel , so he has given them a king who will rule fairly and honestly .
CEV	1%20Kings	10	14	Solomon received almost

CEV	1%20Kings	11	11	and he said to Solomon : You did what you wanted and not what I told you to do . Now I 'm going to take your kingdom from you and give it to one of your officials .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	300	other women . [ a ] As Solomon got older , some of his wives led him to worship their gods . He was n't like his father David , who had worshiped only the Lord God .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	5	Solomon also worshiped Astarte the goddess of Sidon , and Milcom the disgusting god of Ammon .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	6	Solomon 's father had obeyed the Lord with all his heart , but Solomon disobeyed and did what the Lord hated .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	7	Solomon built shrines on a hill east of Jerusalem to worship Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab , and Molech the disgusting god of Ammon .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	8	In fact , he built a shrine for each of his foreign wives , so all of them could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their own gods . 9-10 The Lord God of Israel had appeared to Solomon two times and warned him not to worship foreign gods . But Solomon disobeyed and did it anyway . This made the Lord very angry ,
CEV	1%20Kings	11	12	But because David was your father , you will remain king as long as you live . I will wait until your son becomes king , then I will take the kingdom from him .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	13	When I do , I will still let him rule one tribe , because I have not forgotten that David was my servant and Jerusalem is my chosen city . Hadad Becomes an Enemy of Solomon
CEV	1%20Kings	11	14	Hadad was from the royal family of Edom , and here is how the Lord made him Solomon 's enemy : 15-16 Some time earlier , when David conquered the nation of Edom , [ b ] Joab his army commander went there to bury those who had died in battle . Joab and his soldiers stayed in Edom six months , and during that time they killed every man and boy who lived there . 17-19 Hadad was a boy at the time , but he escaped to Midian with some of his father 's officials . At Paran some other men joined them , and they went to the king of Egypt . The king liked Hadad and gave him food , some land , and a house , and even let him marry the sister of Queen Tahpenes .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	20	Hadad and his wife had a son named Genubath , and the queen let the boy grow up in the palace with her own children .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	21	When Hadad heard that David and Joab were dead , he said to the king , “ Your Majesty , please let me go back to my own country. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	11	22	“ Why ? ” asked the king . “ Do you want something I have n't given you ? ” “ No , I just want to go home. ” Rezon Becomes an Enemy of Solomon
CEV	1%20Kings	11	23	Here is how God made Rezon son of Eliada an enemy of Solomon : Rezon had run away from his master , King Hadadezer of Zobah . 24-25 He formed his own small army and became its leader after David had defeated Hadadezer 's troops . [ c ] Then Rezon and his army went to Damascus , where he became the ruler of Syria and an enemy of Israel . Both Hadad and Rezon were enemies of Israel while Solomon was king , and they caused him a lot of trouble . The Lord Makes a Promise to Jeroboam
CEV	1%20Kings	11	26	Jeroboam was from the town of Zeredah in Ephraim . His father Nebat had died , but his mother Zeruah was still alive . Jeroboam was one of Solomon 's officials , but even he rebelled against Solomon .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	27	Here is how it happened : While Solomon 's workers were filling in the land on the east side of Jerusalem [ d ] and repairing the city walls ,
CEV	1%20Kings	11	28	Solomon noticed that Jeroboam was a hard worker . So he put Jeroboam in charge of the work force from Manasseh and Ephraim . 29-30 One day when Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem , he met Ahijah , a prophet from Shiloh . No one else was anywhere around . Suddenly , Ahijah took off his new coat and ripped it into twelve pieces .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	31	Then he said : Jeroboam , take ten pieces of this coat and listen to what the Lord God of Israel says to you . “ Jeroboam , I am the Lord God , and I am about to take Solomon 's kingdom from him and give you ten tribes to rule .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	32	But Solomon will still rule one tribe , [ e ] since he is the son of David my servant , and Jerusalem is my chosen city .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	33	“ Solomon and the Israelites are not like their ancestor David . They will not listen to me , obey me , or do what is right . They have turned from me to worship Astarte the goddess of Sidon , Chemosh the god of Moab , and Milcom the god of Ammon .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	34	“ Solomon is David 's son , and David was my chosen leader , who did what I commanded . So I will let Solomon be king until he dies .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	35	Then I will give you ten tribes to rule ,
CEV	1%20Kings	11	36	but Solomon 's son will still rule one tribe . This way , my servant David will always have a descendant ruling in Jerusalem , the city where I have chosen to be worshiped .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	37	“ You will be king of Israel and will rule every nation you want .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	38	I 'll help you if you obey me . And if you do what I say , as my servant David did , I will always let someone from your family rule in Israel , just as someone from David 's family will always rule in Judah . The nation of Israel will be yours .
CEV	1%20Kings	11	39	“ I will punish the descendants of David , but not forever. ”

CEV	1%20Kings	12	3	But the people from the northern tribes of Israel sent for him . Then together they went to Rehoboam and said ,
CEV	1%20Kings	12	4	“ Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard . But if you make our work easier , we will serve you and do whatever you ask. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	12	5	“ Give me three days to think about it , ” Rehoboam replied , “ then come back for my answer. ” So the people left .
CEV	1%20Kings	12	6	Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father 's senior officials , and he asked them , “ What should I tell these people ? ”
CEV	1%20Kings	12	7	They answered , “ If you want them to serve and obey you , then you should do what they ask today . Tell them you will make their work easier. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	12	8	But Rehoboam refused their advice and went to the younger men who had grown up with him and were now his officials .
CEV	1%20Kings	12	9	He asked , “ What do you think I should say to these people who asked me to make their work easier ? ”
CEV	1%20Kings	12	10	His younger advisors said : Here 's what we think you should say to them : “ Compared to me , my father was weak . [ b ]
CEV	1%20Kings	12	11	He made you work hard , but I 'll make you work even harder . He punished you with whips , but I 'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	12	13	Rehoboam ignored the advice of the older advisors .
CEV	1%20Kings	12	14	He spoke bluntly and told them exactly what his own advisors had suggested : “ My father made you work hard , but I 'll make you work even harder . He punished you with whips , but I 'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal ! ” 15-19 ( A ) When the people realized that Rehoboam would not listen to them , they shouted : “ We do n't have to be loyal to David 's family . We can do what we want . Come on , people of Israel , let 's go home ! Rehoboam can rule his own people. ” Adoniram [ c ] was in charge of the forced labor , and Rehoboam sent him to talk to the people . But they stoned him to death . Then Rehoboam ran to his chariot and hurried back to Jerusalem . So the people from the northern tribes of Israel went home , leaving Rehoboam to rule only the people from the towns in Judah . Ever since that day , the people of Israel have opposed David 's family in Judah . All of this happened just as the Lord 's prophet Ahijah had told Jeroboam .
CEV	1%20Kings	12	20	When the Israelites heard that Jeroboam was back , they called everyone together . Then they sent for Jeroboam and made him king of Israel . Only the people from the tribe of Judah [ d ] remained loyal to David 's family . Shemaiah Warns Rehoboam (
CEV	1%20Kings	12	21	After Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem , he decided to attack Israel and take control of the whole country . So he called together 180,000 soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin .
CEV	1%20Kings	12	22	Meanwhile , God told Shemaiah the prophet
CEV	1%20Kings	12	23	to give Rehoboam and everyone from Judah and Benjamin this warning :
CEV	1%20Kings	12	24	“ Do n't go to war against the people from Israel—they are your relatives . Go home ! I am the Lord , and I made these things happen. ” Rehoboam and his army obeyed the Lord and went home . Jeroboam Makes Religious Changes
CEV	1%20Kings	12	25	Jeroboam rebuilt Shechem in Ephraim and made it a stronger town , then he moved there . He also fortified the town of Penuel . 26-27 One day , Jeroboam started thinking , “ Everyone in Israel still goes to the temple in Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord . What if they become loyal to David 's family again ? They will kill me and accept Rehoboam as their king. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	12	28	( B ) Jeroboam asked for advice and then made two gold statues of calves . He showed them to the people and said , “ Listen everyone ! You wo n't have to go to Jerusalem to worship anymore . Here are your gods [ e ] who rescued you from Egypt. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	12	29	Then he put one of the gold calves in the town of Bethel and the other in the town of Dan .
CEV	1%20Kings	12	30	The people sinned because they started going to these places to worship .
CEV	1%20Kings	12	31	Jeroboam built small places of worship at the shrines [ f ] and appointed men who were not from the tribe of Levi to serve as priests . 32-33 ( C ) He also decided to start a new festival for the Israelites on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , just like the one in Judah . [ g ] On that day , Jeroboam went to Bethel and offered sacrifices on the altar to the gold calf he had put there . Then he assigned the priests their duties .

CEV	1%20Kings	13	3	You will know that the Lord has said these things when the altar splits in half , and the ashes on it fall to the ground .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	4	Jeroboam pointed at the prophet and shouted , “ Grab him ! ” But at once , Jeroboam 's hand became stiff , and he could not move it .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	5	The altar split in half , and the ashes fell to the ground , just as the prophet had warned .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	6	“ Please pray to the Lord your God and ask him to heal my hand , ” Jeroboam begged . The prophet prayed , and Jeroboam 's hand was healed .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	7	“ Come home with me and eat something , ” Jeroboam said . “ I want to give you a gift for what you have done. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	13	8	“ No , I would n't go with you , even if you offered me half of your kingdom . I wo n't eat or drink here either .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	9	The Lord said I ca n't eat or drink anything and that I ca n't go home the same way I came. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	13	10	Then he started home down a different road . An Old Prophet from Bethel
CEV	1%20Kings	13	11	At that time an old prophet lived in Bethel , and one of his sons told him what the prophet from Judah had said and done .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	12	“ Show me which way he went , ” the old prophet said , and his sons pointed out the road .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	14	and rode off to look for the prophet from Judah . The old prophet found him sitting under an oak tree and asked , “ Are you the prophet from Judah ? ” “ Yes , I am. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	13	15	“ Come home with me , ” the old prophet said , “ and have something to eat. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	13	16	“ I ca n't go back with you , ” the prophet replied , “ and I ca n't eat or drink anything with you .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	17	The Lord warned me not to eat or drink or to go home the same way I came. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	13	18	The old prophet said , “ I 'm a prophet too . One of the Lord 's angels told me to take you to my house and give you something to eat and drink. ” The prophet from Judah did not know that the old prophet was lying ,
CEV	1%20Kings	13	19	so he went home with him and ate and drank .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	20	During the meal the Lord gave the old prophet
CEV	1%20Kings	13	21	a message for the prophet from Judah : Listen to the Lord 's message . You have disobeyed the Lord your God .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	22	He told you not to eat or drink anything here , but you came home and ate with me . And so , when you die , your body wo n't be buried in your family tomb .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	23	After the meal the old prophet got a donkey ready ,
CEV	1%20Kings	13	24	and the prophet from Judah left . Along the way , a lion attacked and killed him , and the donkey and the lion stood there beside his dead body .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	25	Some people walked by and saw the body with the lion standing there . They ran into Bethel , telling everyone what they had seen .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	26	When the old prophet heard the news , he said , “ That must be the prophet from Judah . The Lord warned him , but he disobeyed . So the Lord sent a lion to kill him. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	13	27	The old prophet told his sons to saddle his donkey , and when it was ready ,
CEV	1%20Kings	13	28	he left . He found the body lying on the road , with the donkey and lion standing there . The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	29	The old prophet picked up the body , put it on his own donkey , and took it back to Bethel , so he could bury it and mourn for the prophet from Judah .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	30	He buried the body in his own family tomb and cried for the prophet .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	31	He said to his sons , “ When I die , bury my body next to this prophet .
CEV	1%20Kings	13	32	I 'm sure that everything he said about the altar in Bethel and the shrines in Samaria will happen. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	13	33	But Jeroboam kept on doing evil things . He appointed men to be priests at the local shrines , even if they were not Levites . In fact , anyone who wanted to be a priest could be one .

CEV	1%20Kings	17	12	The widow answered , “ In the name of the living Lord your God , I swear that I do n't have any bread . All I have is a handful of flour and a little olive oil . I 'm on my way home now with these few sticks to cook what I have for my son and me . After that , we will starve to death. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	17	13	Elijah said , “ Everything will be fine . Do what you said . Go home and fix something for you and your son . But first , please make a small piece of bread and bring it to me .

CEV	1%20Kings	18	8	“ Yes . Go tell Ahab I 'm here. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	18	9	Obadiah replied : King Ahab would kill me if I told him that . And I have n't even done anything wrong .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	10	I swear to you in the name of the living Lord your God that the king has looked everywhere for you . He sent people to look in every country , and when they could n't find you , he made the leader of each country swear that you were not in that country .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	11	Do you really want me to tell him you 're here ?
CEV	1%20Kings	18	12	What if the Lord 's Spirit takes you away as soon as I leave ? When Ahab comes to get you , he wo n't find you . Then he will surely kill me . I have worshiped the Lord since I was a boy .

CEV	1%20Kings	18	15	Elijah said , “ I 'm a servant of the living Lord All-Powerful , and I swear in his name that I will meet with Ahab today. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	18	16	Obadiah left and told Ahab where to find Elijah . Ahab went to meet Elijah ,
CEV	1%20Kings	18	17	and when he saw him , Ahab shouted , “ There you are , the biggest troublemaker in Israel ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	18	19	Call together everyone from Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel . Be sure to bring along the
CEV	1%20Kings	18	450	prophets .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	400	prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel 's table .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	20	Ahab got everyone together , then they went to meet Elijah on Mount Carmel .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	21	Elijah stood in front of them and said , “ How much longer will you try to have things both ways ? If the Lord is God , worship him ! But if Baal is God , worship him ! ” The people did not say a word .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	22	Then Elijah continued : I am the Lord 's only prophet , but Baal has
CEV	1%20Kings	18	23	Bring us two bulls . Baal 's prophets can take one of them , kill it , and cut it into pieces . Then they can put the meat on the wood without lighting the fire . I will do the same thing with the other bull , and I wo n't light a fire under it either .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	24	The prophets of Baal will pray to their god , and I will pray to the Lord . The one who answers by starting the fire is God . “ That 's a good idea , ” everyone agreed .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	25	Elijah said to Baal 's prophets , “ There are more of you , so you go first . Pick out a bull and get it ready , but do n't light the fire . Then pray to your god. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	18	26	They chose their bull , then they got it ready and prayed to Baal all morning , asking him to start the fire . They danced around the altar and shouted , “ Answer us , Baal ! ” But there was no answer .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	27	At noon , Elijah began making fun of them . “ Pray louder ! ” he said . “ Baal must be a god . Maybe he 's daydreaming or using the toilet or traveling somewhere . Or maybe he 's asleep , and you have to wake him up. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	18	28	The prophets kept shouting louder and louder , and they cut themselves with swords and knives until they were bleeding . This was the way they worshiped ,
CEV	1%20Kings	18	29	and they kept it up until time for the evening sacrifice . But there was no answer of any kind .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	30	Elijah told everyone to gather around him while he repaired the Lord 's altar . 31-32 ( A ) Then he used twelve stones to build an altar in honor of the Lord . Each stone stood for one of the tribes of Israel , which was the name the Lord had given to their ancestor Jacob . Elijah dug a ditch around the altar , large enough to hold about
CEV	1%20Kings	18	33	He placed the wood on the altar , then they cut the bull into pieces and laid the meat on the wood . He told the people , “ Fill four large jars with water and pour it over the meat and the wood. ” After they did this ,
CEV	1%20Kings	18	34	he told them to do it two more times . They did exactly as he said
CEV	1%20Kings	18	35	until finally , the water ran down the altar and filled the ditch .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	36	When it was time for the evening sacrifice , Elijah prayed : Our Lord , you are the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel . Now , prove that you are the God of this nation , [ a ] and that I , your servant , have done this at your command .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	37	Please answer me , so these people will know that you are the Lord God , and that you will turn their hearts back to you . [ b ]
CEV	1%20Kings	18	38	The Lord immediately sent fire , and it burned up the sacrifice , the wood , and the stones . It scorched the ground everywhere around the altar and dried up every drop of water in the ditch .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	39	When the crowd saw what had happened , they all bowed down and shouted , “ The Lord is God ! The Lord is God ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	18	40	Just then , Elijah said , “ Grab the prophets of Baal ! Do n't let any of them get away. ” So the people captured the prophets and took them to Kishon River , where Elijah killed every one of them . It Starts To Rain
CEV	1%20Kings	18	41	Elijah told Ahab , “ Get something to eat and drink . I hear a heavy rain coming. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	18	42	( B ) Ahab left , but Elijah climbed back to the top of Mount Carmel . Then he stooped down with his face almost to the ground
CEV	1%20Kings	18	43	and said to his servant , “ Look toward the sea. ” The servant left . And when he came back , he said , “ I looked , but I did n't see anything. ” Elijah told him to look seven more times .
CEV	1%20Kings	18	44	After the seventh time the servant replied , “ I see a small cloud coming this way . But it 's no bigger than a fist. ” Elijah told him , “ Tell Ahab to get his chariot ready and start home now . Otherwise , the rain will stop him. ” 45-46 A few minutes later , it got very cloudy and windy , and rain started pouring down . So Elijah wrapped his coat around himself , and the Lord gave him strength to run all the way to Jezreel . Ahab followed in his chariot . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Kings	19	3	Elijah was afraid when he got her message , and he ran to the town of Beersheba in Judah . He left his servant there ,
CEV	1%20Kings	19	4	( A ) then walked another whole day into the desert . Finally , he came to a large bush and sat down in its shade . He begged the Lord , “ I 've had enough . Just let me die ! I 'm no better off than my ancestors. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	19	5	Then he lay down in the shade and fell asleep . Suddenly an angel woke him up and said , “ Get up and eat. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	19	6	Elijah looked around , and by his head was a jar of water and some baked bread . He sat up , ate and drank , then lay down and went back to sleep .
CEV	1%20Kings	19	7	Soon the Lord 's angel woke him again and said , “ Get up and eat , or else you 'll get too tired to travel. ”

CEV	1%20Kings	19	9	and he spent the night there in a cave . The Lord Appears to Elijah While Elijah was on Mount Sinai , the Lord asked , “ Elijah , why are you here ? ”

CEV	1%20Kings	19	11	“ Go out and stand on the mountain , ” the Lord replied . “ I want you to be there when I pass by. ” All at once , a strong wind shook the mountain and shattered the rocks . But the Lord was not in the wind . Next , there was an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake .
CEV	1%20Kings	19	12	Then there was a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire . Finally , there was a gentle breeze , [ b ]
CEV	1%20Kings	19	13	and when Elijah heard it , he covered his face with his coat . He went out and stood at the entrance to the cave . A voice asked , “ Elijah , why are you here ? ”
CEV	1%20Kings	19	14	Elijah answered , “ Lord God All-Powerful , I 've always done my best to obey you . But your people have broken their solemn promise to you . They have torn down your altars and killed all your prophets , except me . And now they are even trying to kill me ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	19	15	( C ) The Lord said : Elijah , you can go back to the desert near Damascus . And when you get there , appoint [ c ] Hazael to be king of Syria .
CEV	1%20Kings	19	16	( D ) Then appoint Jehu son of Nimshi to be king of Israel , and Elisha son of Shaphat [ d ] to take your place as my prophet .
CEV	1%20Kings	19	17	Hazael will start killing the people who worship Baal . Jehu will kill those who escape from Hazael , and Elisha will kill those who escape from Jehu .

CEV	1%20Kings	19	20	Elisha stopped plowing and ran after him . “ Let me kiss my parents goodbye , then I 'll go with you , ” he said . “ You can go , ” Elijah said . “ But remember what I 've done for you. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	19	21	Elisha left and took his oxen with him . He killed them and boiled them over a fire he had made with the wood from his plow . He gave the meat to the people who were with him , and they ate it . Then he left with Elijah and became his assistant .

CEV	1%20Kings	20	14	“ Who will fight the battle ? ” Ahab asked . The prophet answered , “ The young bodyguards who serve the district officials. ” “ But who will lead them into battle ? ” Ahab asked . “ You will ! ” the prophet replied .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	15	So Ahab called together the
CEV	1%20Kings	20	232	young soldiers and the 7,000 troops in Israel 's army , and he got them ready to fight the Syrians . Israel Defeats the Syrians 16-17 At noon , King Ahab and his Israelite army marched out of Samaria , with the young soldiers in front . King Benhadad of Syria and the
CEV	1%20Kings	20	18	“ Take them alive ! ” Benhadad ordered . “ I do n't care if they have come out to fight or to surrender. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	20	19	The young soldiers led Israel 's troops into battle ,
CEV	1%20Kings	20	21	but Ahab and his soldiers followed them and captured [ d ] their horses and chariots . Ahab and Israel 's army crushed the Syrians .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	22	Later , the prophet [ e ] went back and warned Ahab , “ Benhadad will attack you again next spring . Build up your troops and make sure you have some good plans. ” Syria Attacks Israel Again
CEV	1%20Kings	20	23	Meanwhile , Benhadad 's officials went to him and explained : Israel 's gods are mountain gods . We fought Israel 's army in the hills , and that 's why they defeated us . But if we fight them on flat land , there 's no way we can lose .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	24	Here 's what you should do . First , get rid of those
CEV	1%20Kings	20	25	Then get more soldiers , horses , and chariots , so your army will be as strong as it was before . We 'll fight Israel 's army on flat land and wipe them out . Benhadad agreed and did what they suggested .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	26	In the spring , Benhadad got his army together , and they marched to the town of Aphek to attack Israel .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	27	The Israelites also prepared to fight . They marched out to meet the Syrians , and the two armies camped across from each other . The Syrians covered the whole area , but the Israelites looked like two little flocks of goats .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	28	The prophet went to Ahab and said , “ The Syrians think the Lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys . So he has promised to help you defeat their powerful army . Then you will know that the Lord is in control. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	20	29	For seven days the two armies stayed in their camps , facing each other . Then on the seventh day the fighting broke out , and before sunset the Israelites had killed 100,000 Syrian troops .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	30	The rest of the Syrian army ran back to Aphek , but the town wall fell and crushed 27,000 of them . Benhadad also escaped to Aphek and hid in the back room of a house .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	31	His officials said , “ Your Majesty , we 've heard that Israel 's kings keep their agreements . We will wrap sackcloth around our waists , put ropes around our heads , and ask Ahab to let you live. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	20	33	Benhadad 's officials were trying to figure out what Ahab was thinking , and when he said “ brother , ” they quickly replied , “ You 're right ! You and Benhadad are like brothers. ” “ Go get him , ” Ahab said . When Benhadad came out , Ahab had him climb up into his chariot .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	34	Benhadad said , “ I 'll give back the towns my father took from your father . And you can have shops in Damascus , just as my father had in Samaria. ” Ahab replied , “ If you do these things , I 'll let you go free. ” Then they signed a peace treaty , and Ahab let Benhadad go . A Prophet Condemns Ahab
CEV	1%20Kings	20	35	About this time the Lord commanded a prophet to say to a friend , “ Hit me ! ” But the friend refused ,
CEV	1%20Kings	20	36	( A ) and the prophet told him , “ You disobeyed the Lord , and as soon as you walk away , a lion will kill you. ” The friend left , and suddenly a lion killed him .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	37	The prophet found someone else and said , “ Hit me ! ” So this man beat him up .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	38	The prophet left and put a bandage over his face to disguise himself . Then he went and stood beside the road , waiting for Ahab to pass by .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	39	When Ahab went by , the prophet shouted , “ Your Majesty , right in the heat of battle , someone brought a prisoner to me and told me to guard him . He said if the prisoner got away , I would either be killed or forced to pay 3,000 pieces of silver .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	40	But I got busy doing other things , and the prisoner escaped. ” Ahab answered , “ You will be punished just as you have said. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	20	41	The man quickly tore the bandage off his face , and Ahab saw that he was one of the prophets .
CEV	1%20Kings	20	42	The prophet said , “ The Lord told you to kill Benhadad , but you let him go . Now you will die in his place , and your people will die in place of his people. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	20	43	Ahab went back to Samaria , angry and depressed .

CEV	1%20Kings	21	21	Now you will be punished . You and every man and boy in your family will die , whether slave or free .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	2	One day , Ahab said , “ Naboth , your vineyard is near my palace . Give it to me so I can turn it into a vegetable garden . I 'll give you a better vineyard or pay whatever you want for yours. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	21	3	Naboth answered , “ This vineyard has always been in my family . I wo n't let you have it. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	21	4	So Ahab went home , angry and depressed because of what Naboth had told him . He lay on his bed , just staring at the wall and refusing to eat a thing .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	5	Jezebel his wife came in and asked , “ What 's wrong ? Why wo n't you eat ? ”
CEV	1%20Kings	21	6	“ I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or to let me give him a better one , ” Ahab replied . “ And he told me I could n't have it. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	21	7	“ Are n't you the king of Israel ? ” Jezebel asked . “ Get out of bed and eat something ! Do n't worry , I 'll get Naboth 's vineyard for you. ” 8-10 Jezebel wrote a letter to each of the leaders of the town where Naboth lived . In the letters she said : Call everyone together and tell them to go without eating [ a ] today . When they come together , give Naboth a seat at the front . Get two liars to sit facing him and swear that Naboth has cursed God and the king . Then take Naboth outside and stone him to death ! She signed Ahab 's name to the letters and sealed them with his seal . Then she sent them to the town leaders .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	11	After receiving her letters , they did exactly what she had asked .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	12	They told the people that it was a day to go without eating , and when they all came together , they seated Naboth at the front .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	13	The two liars came in and sat across from Naboth . Then they accused him of cursing God and the king , so the people dragged Naboth outside and stoned him to death .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	14	The leaders of Jezreel sent a message back to Jezebel that said , “ Naboth is dead. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	21	15	As soon as Jezebel got their message , she told Ahab , “ Now you can have the vineyard Naboth refused to sell . He 's dead. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	21	16	Ahab got up and went to take over the vineyard . Elijah Condemns Ahab
CEV	1%20Kings	21	17	The Lord said to Elijah the prophet ,
CEV	1%20Kings	21	18	“ King Ahab of Israel is in Naboth 's vineyard right now , taking it over .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	19	Go tell him that I say , ‘ Ahab , you murdered Naboth and took his property . And so , in the very spot where dogs licked up Naboth 's blood , they will lick up your blood. ’ ” When Elijah found him ,
CEV	1%20Kings	21	20	Ahab said , “ So , my enemy , you found me at last. ” Elijah answered : Yes , I did ! Ahab , you have managed to do everything the Lord hates .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	22	Your whole family will be wiped out , just like the families of King Jeroboam and King Baasha . You 've made the Lord very angry by sinning and causing the Israelites to sin .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	23	( A ) And as for Jezebel , dogs will eat her body there in Jezreel .
CEV	1%20Kings	21	24	Dogs will also eat the bodies of your relatives who die in town , and vultures will eat the bodies of those who die in the country . 25-29 When Ahab heard this , he tore his clothes in sorrow and wore sackcloth day and night . He was depressed and refused to eat . Some time later , the Lord said , “ Elijah , do you see how sorry Ahab is for what he did ? I wo n't punish his family while he is still alive . I 'll wait until his son is king. ” No one was more determined than Ahab to disobey the Lord . And Jezebel encouraged him . Worst of all , he had worshiped idols , just as the Amorites [ b ] had done before the Lord forced them out of the land and gave it to Israel . Copyright ©

CEV	1%20Kings	22	3	Ahab asked his officials , “ Why have n't we tried to get Ramoth in Gilead back from the Syrians ? It belongs to us. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	4	Then he asked Jehoshaphat , “ Would you go to Ramoth with me and attack the Syrians ? ” “ Just tell me what to do , ” Jehoshaphat answered . “ My army and horses are at your command .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	5	But first , let 's ask the Lord. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	6	Ahab sent for about
CEV	1%20Kings	22	400	prophets and asked , “ Should I attack the Syrians at Ramoth ? ” “ Yes ! ” the prophets answered . “ The Lord will help you defeat them. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	7	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Just to make sure , is there another of the Lord 's prophets we can ask ? ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	8	“ We could ask Micaiah son of Imlah , ” Ahab said . “ But I hate Micaiah . He always has bad news for me. ” “ Do n't say that ! ” Jehoshaphat replied .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	9	Then Ahab sent someone to bring Micaiah as soon as possible .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	10	All this time , Ahab and Jehoshaphat were dressed in their royal robes and were seated on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria . They were listening to the prophets tell them what the Lord had said .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	11	Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was one of the prophets . He had made some horns out of iron and shouted , “ Ahab , the Lord says you will attack the Syrians like a bull with iron horns and wipe them out ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	12	All the prophets agreed that Ahab should attack the Syrians at Ramoth , and they promised that the Lord would help him defeat them .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	13	Meanwhile , the messenger who went to get Micaiah whispered , “ Micaiah , all the prophets have good news for Ahab . Now go and say the same thing. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	14	“ I 'll say whatever the living Lord tells me to say , ” Micaiah replied .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	15	Then Micaiah went to Ahab , and Ahab asked , “ Micaiah , should I attack the Syrians at Ramoth ? ” “ Yes ! ” Micaiah answered . “ The Lord will help you defeat them. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	16	“ Micaiah , I 've told you over and over to tell me the truth ! ” Ahab shouted . “ What does the Lord really say ? ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	17	( A ) He answered , “ In a vision [ a ] I saw Israelite soldiers walking around in the hills like sheep without a shepherd to guide them . The Lord said , ‘ This army has no leader . They should go home and not fight. ’ ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	18	Ahab turned to Jehoshaphat and said , “ I told you he would bring bad news ! ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	19	( B ) Micaiah replied : Listen to this ! I also saw the Lord seated on his throne with every creature in heaven gathered around him .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	20	The Lord asked , “ Who can trick Ahab and make him go to Ramoth where he will be killed ? ” They talked about it for a while ,
CEV	1%20Kings	22	21	then finally a spirit came forward and said to the Lord , “ I can trick Ahab. ” “ How ? ” the Lord asked .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	23	This is exactly what has happened , Ahab . The Lord made all your prophets lie to you , and he knows you will soon be destroyed .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	24	Zedekiah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him on the face . Then he asked , “ Do you really think the Lord would speak to you and not to me ? ”

His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi . 43-46 Jehoshaphat obeyed the Lord , just as his father Asa had done , and during his rule he was at peace with the king of Israel . He got rid of the rest of the prostitutes [ c ] from the local shrines , but he did not destroy the shrines , and they were still used as places for offering sacrifices . Everything else Jehoshaphat did while he was king , including his brave deeds and military victories , is written in The History of the Kings of Judah .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	26	Ahab shouted , “ Arrest Micaiah ! Take him to Prince Joash and Governor Amon of Samaria .
CEV	1%20Kings	22	27	Tell them to put him in prison and to give him nothing but bread and water until I come back safely. ”
CEV	1%20Kings	22	28	Micaiah said , “ If you do come back , I was wrong about what the Lord wanted me to say. ” Then he told the crowd , “ Do n't forget what I said ! ” Ahab Dies at Ramoth (

CEV	1%20Kings	22	32	So when they saw Jehoshaphat in his robe , they thought he was Ahab and started to attack him . But when Jehoshaphat shouted out to them ,

CEV	1%20Kings	22	34	However , during the fighting a soldier shot an arrow without even aiming , and it hit Ahab where two pieces of his armor joined . He shouted to his chariot driver , “ I 've been hit ! Get me out of here ! ”

CEV	2%20Kings	1	2	Kings
CEV	2%20Kings	1	1	1-2 Soon after King Ahab of Israel died , the country of Moab rebelled against his son King Ahaziah . [ a ] One day , Ahaziah fell through the wooden slats around the porch on the flat roof of his palace in Samaria , and he was badly injured . So he sent some messengers to the town of Ekron [ b ] with orders to ask the god Baalzebub if he would get well .
CEV	2%20Kings	1	3	About the same time , an angel from the Lord sent Elijah the prophet from Tishbe to say to the king 's messengers , “ Ahaziah has rejected Israel 's own God by sending you to ask Baalzebub about his injury .
CEV	2%20Kings	1	4	Tell him that because he has done this , he 's on his deathbed ! ” And Elijah did what he was told .
CEV	2%20Kings	1	5	When the messengers returned to Ahaziah , he asked , “ Why are you back so soon ? ”
CEV	2%20Kings	1	6	“ A man met us along the road with a message for you from the Lord , ” they answered . “ The Lord wants to know why you sent us to ask Baalzebub about your injury and why you do n't believe there 's a God in Israel . The man also told us that the Lord says you 're going to die. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	1	7	“ What did the man look like ? ” Ahaziah asked .
CEV	2%20Kings	1	8	( A ) “ He was hairy [ c ] and had a leather belt around his waist , ” they answered . “ It must be Elijah ! ” replied Ahaziah .
CEV	2%20Kings	1	9	So at once he sent an army officer and
CEV	2%20Kings	1	50	servants of yours . Let us live !
CEV	2%20Kings	1	10	( B ) “ If I am a man of God , ” Elijah answered , “ God will send down fire on you and your
CEV	2%20Kings	1	11	Ahaziah sent another officer and
CEV	2%20Kings	1	12	“ If I am a man of God , ” Elijah answered , “ fire will destroy you and your
CEV	2%20Kings	1	13	Ahaziah sent a third army officer and
CEV	2%20Kings	1	14	Fire has already wiped out the other officers and their soldiers . Please do n't let it happen to me. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	1	15	The angel from the Lord said to Elijah , “ Go with him and do n't be afraid. ” So Elijah got up and went with the officer .
CEV	2%20Kings	1	16	When Elijah arrived , he told Ahaziah , “ The Lord wants to know why you sent messengers to Ekron to ask Baalzebub about your injury . Do n't you believe there 's a God in Israel ? Ahaziah , because you did that , the Lord says you will die. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	1	17	Ahaziah died , just as the Lord had said . But since Ahaziah had no sons , Joram [ g ] his brother [ h ] then became king . This happened in the second year that Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat was king of Judah . [ i ]
CEV	2%20Kings	1	18	Everything else Ahaziah did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Israel . Footnotes - 1.1,2 the country … King Ahaziah : The story of Moab 's rebellion is in 3.4-27 . - 1.1,2 Ekron : An important Philistine town about

CEV	2%20Kings	2	2	Elijah said to Elisha , “ The Lord wants me to go to Bethel , but you must stay here. ” Elisha replied , “ I swear by the living Lord and by your own life that I will stay with you no matter what ! ” And he went with Elijah to Bethel .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	3	A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha , “ Do you know that today the Lord is going to take away your master ? ” “ Yes , I do , ” Elisha answered . “ But do n't remind me of it. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	2	4	Elijah then said , “ Elisha , now the Lord wants me to go to Jericho , but you must stay here. ” Elisha replied , “ I swear by the living Lord and by your own life , that I will stay with you no matter what ! ” And he went with Elijah to Jericho .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	5	A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha , “ Do you know that today the Lord is going to take away your master ? ” “ Yes , I do , ” Elisha answered . “ But do n't remind me of it. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	2	6	Elijah then said to Elisha , “ Now the Lord wants me to go to the Jordan River , but you must stay here. ” Elisha replied , “ I swear by the living Lord and by your own life that I will never leave you ! ” So the two of them walked on together .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	7	Fifty prophets followed Elijah and Elisha from Jericho , then stood at a distance and watched as the two men walked toward the river .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	8	When they got there , Elijah took off his coat , then he rolled it up and struck the water with it . At once a path opened up through the river , and the two of them walked across on dry ground .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	9	( A ) After they had reached the other side , Elijah said , “ Elisha , the Lord will soon take me away . What can I do for you before that happens ? ” Elisha answered , “ Please give me twice as much of your power as you give the other prophets , so I can be the one who takes your place as their leader. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	2	10	“ It wo n't be easy , ” Elijah answered . “ It can happen only if you see me as I am being taken away. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	2	11	Elijah and Elisha were walking along and talking , when suddenly there appeared between them a flaming chariot pulled by fiery horses . At once , a strong wind took Elijah up into heaven .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	12	( B ) Elisha saw this and shouted , “ Israel 's cavalry and chariots have taken my master away ! ” [ a ] After Elijah had gone , Elisha tore his clothes in sorrow .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	13	Elijah 's coat had fallen off , so Elisha picked it up and walked back to the Jordan River .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	14	He struck the water with the coat and wondered , “ Will the Lord perform miracles for me as he did for Elijah ? ” As soon as Elisha did this , a dry path opened up through the water , and he walked across .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	15	When the prophets from Jericho saw what happened , they said to each other , “ Elisha now has Elijah 's power. ” They walked over to him , bowed down ,
CEV	2%20Kings	2	16	and said , “ There are
CEV	2%20Kings	2	50	strong men here with us . Please let them go look for your master . Maybe the Spirit of the Lord carried him off to some mountain or valley. ” “ No , ” Elisha replied , “ they wo n't find him. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	2	17	They kept begging until he was embarrassed to say no . He finally agreed , and the prophets sent the men out . They looked three days for Elijah but never found him .
CEV	2%20Kings	2	18	They returned to Jericho , and Elisha said , “ I told you that you would n't find him. ” Elisha Makes the Water Pure at Jericho
CEV	2%20Kings	2	19	One day the people of Jericho said , “ Elisha , you can see that our city is in a good spot . But the water from our spring is so bad that it even keeps our crops from growing. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	2	20	He replied , “ Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me. ” They brought him the bowl of salt ,
CEV	2%20Kings	2	21	and he carried it to the spring . He threw the salt into the water and said , “ The Lord has made this water pure again . From now on you 'll be able to grow crops , and no one will starve. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	2	22	The water has been fine ever since , just as Elisha said . Some Boys Make Fun of Elisha
CEV	2%20Kings	2	23	Elisha left and headed toward Bethel . Along the way some boys started making fun of him by shouting , “ Go away , baldy ! Get out of here ! ”
CEV	2%20Kings	2	24	Elisha turned around and stared at the boys . Then he cursed them in the name of the Lord . At once two bears ran out of the woods and ripped to pieces

CEV	2%20Kings	3	2	and disobeyed the Lord by doing wrong . He tore down the stone image his father had made to honor Baal , and so he was n't as sinful as his parents .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	3	But he kept doing the sinful things that Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel to do . [ c ] The Country of Moab Rebels against Israel
CEV	2%20Kings	3	4	For many years the country of Moab had been controlled by Israel and was forced to pay taxes to the kings of Israel . King Mesha of Moab raised sheep , so he paid the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	5	But soon after the death of Ahab , Mesha rebelled against Israel .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	6	One day , Joram left Samaria and called together Israel 's army .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	7	He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah , “ The king of Moab has rebelled . Will you go with me to attack him ? ” “ Yes , I will , ” Jehoshaphat answered . “ I 'm on your side , and my soldiers and horses are at your command .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	8	But which way should we go ? ” “ We will march through Edom Desert , ” Joram replied .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	9	So Joram , Jehoshaphat , and the king of Edom led their troops out . But seven days later , there was no drinking water left for them or their animals .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	10	Joram cried out , “ This is terrible ! The Lord must have led us out here to be captured by Moab 's army. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	3	11	Jehoshaphat said , “ Which of the Lord 's prophets is with us ? We can find out from him what the Lord wants us to do. ” One of Joram 's officers answered , “ Elisha son of Shaphat is here . He was one of Elijah 's closest followers. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	3	12	Jehoshaphat replied , “ He can give us the Lord 's message. ” The three kings went over to Elisha ,
CEV	2%20Kings	3	13	and he asked Joram , “ Why did you come to me ? Go talk to the prophets of the foreign gods your parents worshiped. ” [ d ] “ No , ” Joram answered . “ It was the Lord who led us out here , so that Moab 's army could capture us. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	3	14	Elisha said to him , “ I serve the Lord All-Powerful , and as surely as he lives , I swear I would n't even look at you if I did n't respect King Jehoshaphat. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	3	15	Then Elisha said , “ Send for someone who can play the harp. ” The harpist began playing , and the Lord gave Elisha this message for Joram :
CEV	2%20Kings	3	16	The Lord says that this dry riverbed will be filled with water . [ e ]
CEV	2%20Kings	3	17	You wo n't feel any wind or see any rain , but there will be plenty of water for you and your animals .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	18	That simple thing is n't all the Lord is going to do . He will also help you defeat Moab 's army .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	19	You will capture all their walled cities and important towns . You will chop down every good tree and stop up every spring of water , then ruin their fertile fields by covering them with rocks .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	20	The next morning , while the sacrifice was being offered , water suddenly started flowing from the direction of Edom , and it flooded the land .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	21	Meanwhile , the people of Moab had heard that the three kings were coming to attack them . They had called together all of their fighting men , from the youngest to the oldest , and these troops were now standing at their border , ready for battle .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	22	When they got up that morning , the sun was shining across the water , making it look red . The Moabite troops took one look
CEV	2%20Kings	3	23	and shouted , “ Look at that blood ! The armies of those kings must have fought and killed each other . Come on , let 's go take what 's left in their camp. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	3	24	But when they arrived at Israel 's camp , the Israelite soldiers came out and attacked them , until they turned and ran away . Israel 's army chased them all the way back to Moab , and even there they kept up the attack . [ f ]
CEV	2%20Kings	3	25	The Israelites destroyed the Moabite towns . They chopped down the good trees and stopped up the springs of water , then covered the fertile fields with rocks . Finally , the only city left standing was Kir-Hareseth , but soldiers armed with slings surrounded and attacked it .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	26	King Mesha of Moab saw that he was about to be defeated . So he took along
CEV	2%20Kings	3	700	soldiers with swords and tried to break through the front line where the Edomite troops were positioned . But he failed .
CEV	2%20Kings	3	27	He then grabbed his oldest son who was to be the next king and sacrificed him as an offering on the city wall . The Israelite troops were so horrified that [ g ] they left the city and went back home .

CEV	2%20Kings	4	2	“ Maybe there 's something I can do to help , ” Elisha said . “ What do you have in your house ? ” “ Sir , I have nothing but a small bottle of olive oil. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	4	go home and shut the door behind you and your sons . Then begin filling the jars with oil and set each one aside as you fill it. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	3	Elisha told her , “ Ask your neighbors for their empty jars . And after you 've borrowed as many as you can ,
CEV	2%20Kings	4	5	The woman left . Later , when she and her sons were back inside their house , the two sons brought her the jars , and she began filling them .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	6	At last , she said to one of her sons , “ Bring me another jar. ” “ We do n't have any more , ” he answered , and the oil stopped flowing from the small bottle .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	7	After she told Elisha what had happened , he said , “ Sell the oil and use part of the money to pay what you owe the man . You and your sons can live on what is left. ” Elisha Brings a Rich Woman 's Son Back to Life
CEV	2%20Kings	4	8	Once , while Elisha was in the town of Shunem , [ a ] he met a rich woman who invited him to her home for dinner . After that , whenever he was in Shunem , he would have a meal there with her and her husband .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	9	Some time later the woman said to her husband , “ I 'm sure the man who comes here so often is a prophet of God .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	10	Why do n't we build him a small room on the flat roof of our house ? We can put a bed , a table and chair , and an oil lamp in it . Then whenever he comes , he can stay with us. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	11	The next time Elisha was in Shunem , he stopped at their house and went up to his room to rest . 12-13 He said to his servant Gehazi , “ This woman has been very helpful . Have her come up here to the roof for a moment. ” She came , and Elisha told Gehazi to say to her , “ You 've gone to a lot of trouble for us , and we want to help you . Is there something we can request the king or army commander to do ? ” [ b ] The woman answered , “ With my relatives nearby , I have everything I need. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	14	“ Then what can we do for her ? ” Elisha asked Gehazi . Gehazi replied , “ I do know that her husband is old , and that she does n't have a son. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	15	“ Ask her to come here again , ” Elisha told his servant . He called for her , and she came and stood in the doorway of Elisha 's room .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	16	( A ) Elisha said to her , “ Next year at this time , you 'll be holding your own baby son in your arms. ” “ You 're a man of God , ” the woman replied . “ Please do n't lie to me. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	17	But a few months later , the woman got pregnant . She gave birth to a son , just as Elisha had promised .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	18	One day while the boy was still young , he was out in the fields with his father , where the workers were harvesting the crops .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	19	Suddenly he shouted , “ My head hurts . It hurts a lot ! ” “ Carry him back to his mother , ” the father said to his servant .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	20	loaves of bread made from the first barley that was harvested . Elisha said , “ Give it to the people so they can eat. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	21	She carried him upstairs to Elisha 's room and laid him across the bed . Then she walked out and shut the door behind her .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	22	The woman called to her husband , “ I need to see the prophet . Let me use one of the donkeys . Send a servant along with me , and let me leave now , so I can get back quickly. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	23	“ Why do you need to see him today ? ” her husband asked . “ It 's not the Sabbath or time for the New Moon Festival. ” “ That 's all right , ” she answered .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	24	She saddled the donkey and said to her servant , “ Let 's go . And do n't slow down unless I tell you to. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	25	She left at once for Mount Carmel to talk with Elisha . [ c ] When Elisha saw her coming , he said , “ Gehazi , look ! It 's the woman from Shunem .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	26	Run and meet her . And ask her if everything is all right with her and her family. ” “ Everything is fine , ” she answered Gehazi .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	27	But as soon as she got to the top of the mountain , she went over and grabbed Elisha by the feet . Gehazi started toward her to push her away , when Elisha said , “ Leave her alone ! Do n't you see how sad she is ? But the Lord has n't told me why. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	28	The woman said , “ Sir , I begged you not to get my hopes up , and I did n't even ask you for a son. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	29	“ Gehazi , get ready and go to her house , ” Elisha said . “ Take along my walking stick , and when you get there , lay it on the boy 's face . Do n't stop to talk to anyone , even if they try to talk to you. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	30	But the boy 's mother said to Elisha , “ I swear by the living Lord and by your own life that I wo n't leave without you. ” So Elisha got up and went with them .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	31	Gehazi ran on ahead and laid Elisha 's walking stick on the boy 's face , but the boy did n't move or make a sound . Gehazi ran back to Elisha and said , “ The boy did n't wake up. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	32	Elisha arrived at the woman 's house and went straight to his room , where he saw the boy 's body on his bed .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	33	He walked in , shut the door , and prayed to the Lord .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	34	( B ) Then he got on the bed and stretched out over the dead body , with his mouth on the boy 's mouth , his eyes on his eyes , and his hand on his hands . As he lay there , the boy 's body became warm .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	35	Elisha got up and walked back and forth in the room , then he went back and leaned over the boy 's body . The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes .
CEV	2%20Kings	4	36	Elisha called out to Gehazi , “ Ask the boy 's mother to come here. ” Gehazi did , and when she was at the door , Elisha said , “ You can take your son. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	37	She came in and bowed down at Elisha 's feet . Then she picked up her son and left . Elisha Makes Some Stew Taste Better
CEV	2%20Kings	4	38	Later , Elisha went back to Gilgal , where there was almost nothing to eat , because the crops had failed . One day while the prophets who lived there were meeting with Elisha , he said to his servant , “ Prepare a big pot of stew for these prophets. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	39	One of them went out into the woods to gather some herbs . He found a wild vine and picked as much of its fruit as he could carry , but he did n't know that the fruit was very sour . When he got back , he cut up the fruit and put it in the stew .

CEV	2%20Kings	4	41	“ Bring me some flour , ” Elisha said . He sprinkled the flour in the stew and said , “ Now serve it to them. ” And the stew tasted fine . Elisha Feeds One Hundred People
CEV	2%20Kings	4	42	A man from the town of Baal-Shalishah [ d ] brought Elisha some freshly cut grain and
CEV	2%20Kings	4	43	“ There 's not enough here for
CEV	2%20Kings	4	100	people , ” his servant said . “ Just give it to them , ” Elisha replied . “ The Lord has promised there will be more than enough. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	4	44	So the servant served the bread and grain to the people . They ate and still had some left over , just as the Lord had promised . Footnotes - 4.8 Shunem : A town in Israel , about

CEV	2%20Kings	5	2	One day while the Syrian troops were raiding Israel , they captured a girl , and she became a servant of Naaman 's wife .
CEV	2%20Kings	5	5	the king replied , “ Go ahead ! I will give you a letter to take to the king of Israel. ” Naaman left and took along 30,000 pieces of silver , 6,000 pieces of gold , and
CEV	2%20Kings	5	3	Some time later the girl said , “ If your husband Naaman would go to the prophet in Samaria , he would be cured of his leprosy. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	4	When Naaman told the king what the girl had said ,
CEV	2%20Kings	5	10	Elisha sent someone outside to say to him , “ Go wash seven times in the Jordan River . Then you 'll be completely cured. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	6	He also carried the letter to the king of Israel . It said , “ I am sending my servant Naaman to you . Would you cure him of his leprosy ? ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	7	When the king of Israel read the letter , he tore his clothes in fear and shouted , “ That Syrian king believes I can cure this man of leprosy ! Does he think I 'm God with power over life and death ? He must be trying to pick a fight with me. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	8	As soon as Elisha the prophet [ b ] heard what had happened , he sent the Israelite king this message : “ Why are you so afraid ? Send the man to me , so that he will know there is a prophet in Israel. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	9	Naaman left with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha 's house .
CEV	2%20Kings	5	11	But Naaman stormed off , grumbling , “ Why could n't he come out and talk to me ? I thought for sure he would stand in front of me and pray to the Lord his God , then wave his hand over my skin and cure me .
CEV	2%20Kings	5	12	What about the Abana River [ c ] or the Pharpar River ? Those rivers in Damascus are just as good as any river in Israel . I could have washed in them and been cured. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	13	His servants went over to him and said , “ Sir , if the prophet had told you to do something difficult , you would have done it . So why do n't you do what he said ? Go wash and be cured. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	14	Naaman walked down to the Jordan ; he waded out into the water and stooped down in it seven times , just as Elisha had told him . At once , he was cured , and his skin became as smooth as a child 's .
CEV	2%20Kings	5	15	Naaman and his officials went back to Elisha . Naaman stood in front of him and announced , “ Now I know that the God of Israel is the only God in the whole world . Sir , would you please accept a gift from me ? ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	16	“ I am a servant of the living Lord , ” Elisha answered , “ and I swear that I will not take anything from you. ” Naaman kept begging , but Elisha kept refusing .
CEV	2%20Kings	5	17	Finally Naaman said , “ If you wo n't accept a gift , then please let me take home as much soil as two mules can pull in a wagon . Sir , from now on I will offer sacrifices only to the Lord . [ d ]
CEV	2%20Kings	5	18	But I pray that the Lord will forgive me when I go into the temple of the god Rimmon and bow down there with the king of Syria. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	19	“ Go on home , and do n't worry about that , ” Elisha replied . Then Naaman left . Elisha Places a Curse on Gehazi After Naaman had gone only a short distance ,
CEV	2%20Kings	5	20	Gehazi said to himself , “ Elisha let that Syrian off too easy . He should have taken Naaman 's gift . I swear by the living Lord that I will talk to Naaman myself and get something from him. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	21	So he hurried after Naaman . When Naaman saw Gehazi running after him , he got out of his chariot to meet him . Naaman asked , “ Is everything all right ? ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	22	“ Yes , ” Gehazi answered . “ But my master has sent me to tell you about two young prophets from the hills of Ephraim . They came asking for help , and now Elisha wants to know if you would give them 3,000 pieces of silver and some new clothes ? ”
CEV	2%20Kings	5	23	“ Sure , ” Naaman replied . “ But why do n't you take twice that amount of silver ? ” He convinced Gehazi to take it all , then put the silver in two bags . He handed the bags and the clothes to his two servants , and they carried them for Gehazi .
CEV	2%20Kings	5	24	When they reached the hill where Gehazi lived , he took the bags from the servants and placed them in his house , then sent the men away . After they had gone ,
CEV	2%20Kings	5	25	Gehazi went in and stood in front of Elisha , who asked , “ Gehazi , where have you been ? ” “ Nowhere , sir , ” Gehazi answered .
CEV	2%20Kings	5	26	Elisha asked , “ Do n't you know that my spirit was there when Naaman got out of his chariot to talk with you ? Gehazi , you have no right to accept money or clothes , olive orchards or vineyards , sheep or cattle , or servants .
CEV	2%20Kings	5	27	Because of what you 've done , Naaman 's leprosy [ e ] will now be on you and your descendants forever ! ” Suddenly , Gehazi 's skin became white with leprosy , and he left .

CEV	2%20Kings	6	2	Why do n't we build a new meeting place near the Jordan River ? Each of us could get some wood , then we could build it. ” “ That 's a good idea , ” Elisha replied , “ get started. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	6	“ Where did it fall in ? ” Elisha asked . The prophet pointed to the place , and Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot . The ax head floated to the top of the water .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	3	“ Are n't you going with us ? ” one of the prophets asked . “ Yes , I 'll go , ” Elisha answered ,
CEV	2%20Kings	6	4	and he left with them . They went to the Jordan River and began chopping down trees .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	5	pieces of silver .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	7	“ Now get it , ” Elisha told him . And the prophet reached in and grabbed it . Elisha Stops an Invasion of the Syrian Army
CEV	2%20Kings	6	8	Time after time , when the king of Syria was at war against the Israelites , he met with his officers and announced , “ I 've decided where we will set up camp. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	9	Each time , Elisha [ a ] would send this warning to the king of Israel : “ Do n't go near there . That 's where the Syrian troops have set up camp. ” [ b ]
CEV	2%20Kings	6	10	So the king would warn the Israelite troops in that place to be on guard .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	11	The king of Syria was furious when he found out what was happening . He called in his officers and asked , “ Which one of you has been telling the king of Israel our plans ? ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	12	“ None of us , Your Majesty , ” one of them answered . “ It 's an Israelite named Elisha . He 's a prophet , so he can tell his king everything—even what you say in your own room. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	13	“ Find out where he is ! ” the king ordered . “ I 'll send soldiers to bring him here. ” They learned that Elisha was in the town of Dothan [ c ] and reported it to the king .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	14	He ordered his best troops to go there with horses and chariots . They marched out during the night and surrounded the town .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	15	kilometers north of Samaria . - 6.17 the hill : The hill on which the town was built . - 6.24 King Benhadad of Syria : This may or may not be the same Benhadad mentioned in
CEV	2%20Kings	6	16	“ Do n't be afraid , ” Elisha answered . “ There are more troops on our side than on theirs. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	17	Then he prayed , “ Lord , please help him to see. ” And the Lord let the servant see that the hill [ d ] was covered with fiery horses and flaming chariots all around Elisha .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	18	As the Syrian army came closer , Elisha prayed , “ Lord , make those soldiers blind ! ” And the Lord blinded them with a bright light .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	19	Elisha told the enemy troops , “ You 've taken the wrong road and are in the wrong town . Follow me . I 'll lead you to the man you 're looking for. ” Elisha led them straight to the capital city of Samaria .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	20	When all the soldiers were inside the city , Elisha prayed , “ Lord , now let them see again. ” The Lord let them see that they were standing in the middle of Samaria .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	21	The king of Israel saw them and asked Elisha , “ Should I kill them , sir ? ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	22	“ No ! ” Elisha answered . “ You did n't capture these troops in battle , so you have no right to kill them . Instead , give them something to eat and drink and let them return to their leader. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	23	The king ordered a huge meal to be prepared for Syria 's army , and when they finished eating , he let them go . For a while , the Syrian troops stopped invading Israel 's territory . King Benhadad of Syria Attacks Samaria
CEV	2%20Kings	6	24	Some time later , King Benhadad of Syria [ e ] called his entire army together , then they marched to Samaria and attacked .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	25	They kept up the attack until there was nothing to eat in the city . In fact , a donkey 's head cost
CEV	2%20Kings	6	80	pieces of silver , and a small bowl of pigeon droppings [ f ] cost
CEV	2%20Kings	6	26	One day as the king of Israel [ g ] was walking along the top of the city wall , a woman shouted to him , “ Please , Your Majesty , help me ! ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	27	“ Let the Lord help you ! ” the king said . “ Do you think I have grain or wine to give you ? ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	28	Then he asked , “ What 's the matter anyway ? ” The woman answered , “ Another woman and I were so hungry that we agreed to eat our sons . She said if we ate my son one day , we could eat hers the next day .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	29	( A ) So yesterday we cooked my son and ate him . But today when I went to her house to eat her son , she had hidden him. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	30	The king tore off his clothes in sorrow , and since he was on top of the city wall , the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth underneath .
CEV	2%20Kings	6	31	He said , “ I pray that God will punish me terribly , if Elisha 's head is still on his shoulders by this time tomorrow. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	32	Then he sent a messenger to Elisha . Elisha was home at the time , and the important leaders of Israel were meeting with him . Even before the king 's messenger arrived , Elisha told the leaders , “ That murderer [ h ] is sending someone to cut off my head . When you see him coming , shut the door and do n't let him in . I 'm sure the king himself will be right behind him. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	6	33	Before Elisha finished talking , the messenger [ i ] came up and said , “ The Lord has made all these terrible things happen to us . Why should I think he will help us now ? ” Footnotes - 6.9 Elisha : Hebrew “ the man of God. ” - 6.9 have set up camp : Or “ are going. ” - 6.13 Dothan : About

CEV	2%20Kings	7	2	The chief officer there with the king replied , “ I do n't believe it ! Even if the Lord sent a rainstorm , it could n't produce that much grain by tomorrow. ” “ You will see it happen , but you wo n't eat any of the food , ” Elisha warned him . The Syrian Army Stops Its Attack
CEV	2%20Kings	7	7	Elisha answered , “ I have a message for you . The Lord promises that tomorrow here in Samaria , you will be able to buy a large sack of flour or two large sacks of barley for almost nothing. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	7	3	About the same time , four men with leprosy [ a ] were just outside the gate of Samaria . They said to each other , “ Why should we sit here , waiting to die ?
CEV	2%20Kings	7	4	There 's nothing to eat in the city , so we would starve if we went inside . But if we stay out here , we will die for sure . Let 's sneak over to the Syrian army camp and surrender . They might kill us , but they might not. ” 5-8 That evening the four men got up and left for the Syrian camp . As they walked toward the camp , the Lord caused the Syrian troops to hear what sounded like the roar of a huge cavalry . The soldiers said to each other , “ Listen ! The king of Israel must have hired Hittite and Egyptian troops to attack us . Let 's get out of here ! ” So they ran out of their camp that night , leaving their tents and horses and donkeys . When the four men with leprosy reached the edge of the Syrian camp , no one was there .

He said to his officers , “ If you want me to be king , then do n't let anyone leave this town . They might go to Jezreel and tell Joram. ” Then Jehu got in his chariot and rode to Jezreel .
CEV	2%20Kings	9	17	When the guard in the watchtower at Jezreel saw Jehu and his men riding up , he shouted to the king , “ I see a large group of men coming this way. ” Joram ordered , “ Send someone out to ask them if this is a friendly visit. ”

CEV	2%20Kings	9	24	Jehu shot an arrow . It hit Joram between his shoulders , then it went through his heart and came out his chest . He fell over dead in his chariot . 25-26 ( C ) Jehu commanded his assistant Bidkar , “ Get Joram 's body and throw it in the field that Naboth once owned . Do you remember when you and I used to ride side by side behind Joram 's father Ahab ? It was then that the Lord swore to Ahab that he would be punished in the same field where he had killed Naboth and his sons . So throw Joram 's body there , just as the Lord said. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	9	27	Ahaziah saw all of this happen and tried to escape to the town of Beth-Haggan , but Jehu caught up with him and shouted , “ Kill him too ! ” So his troops shot Ahaziah with an arrow while he was on the road to Gur near Ibleam . He went as far as Megiddo , where he died .

CEV	2%20Kings	9	32	He looked up toward the window and asked , “ Is anyone up there on my side ? ” A few palace workers stuck their heads out of a window ,

CEV	2%20Kings	10	5	The prime minister , the mayor of the city , as well as the other leaders and Ahab 's supporters , sent this answer to Jehu , “ We are your servants , Your Majesty , and we will do whatever you tell us . But it 's not our place to choose someone to be king . You do what you think is best. ”

CEV	2%20Kings	10	9	The next morning , Jehu went out and stood where everyone could hear him , and he said , “ You people are not guilty of anything . I 'm the one who plotted against Joram and had him killed . But who killed all these men ?
CEV	2%20Kings	10	11	( A ) Then Jehu killed the rest of Ahab 's relatives living in Jezreel , as well as his highest officials , his priests , and his closest friends . No one in Ahab 's family was left alive in Jezreel . 12-13 Jehu left for Samaria , and along the way , he met some relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah at a place where shepherds meet . [ c ] He asked , “ Who are you ? ” “ We are relatives of Ahaziah , ” they answered . “ We 're going to visit his family. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	10	14	“ Take them alive ! ” Jehu said to his officers . So they grabbed them and led them to the well near the shepherds ' meeting place , where they killed all

CEV	2%20Kings	10	15	As Jehu went on , he saw Jehonadab son of Rechab [ d ] coming to meet him . Jehu greeted him , then said , “ Jehonadab , I 'm on your side . Are you on mine ? ” “ Yes , I am. ” “ Then give me your hand , ” Jehu answered . He helped Jehonadab into his chariot

CEV	2%20Kings	10	19	I 'm going to offer a huge sacrifice to him . So invite his prophets and priests , and be sure everyone who worships him is there . Anyone who does n't come will be killed . But this was a trick—Jehu was really planning to kill the worshipers of Baal .

CEV	2%20Kings	10	21	Jehu sent an invitation to everyone in Israel . All the worshipers of Baal came , and the temple was filled from one end to the other .

CEV	2%20Kings	10	23	Jehu and Jehonadab went into the temple , and Jehu said to the crowd , “ Look around and make sure that only the worshipers of Baal are here . No one who worships the Lord is allowed in. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	10	24	Then they began to offer sacrifices to Baal . Earlier , Jehu had ordered

CEV	2%20Kings	10	25	As soon as Jehu finished offering the sacrifice , he told the guards and soldiers , “ Come in and kill them ! Do n't let anyone escape. ” They slaughtered everyone in the crowd and threw the bodies outside . Then they went back into the temple

CEV	2%20Kings	17	5	Shalmaneser invaded Israel and attacked the city of Samaria for three years ,
CEV	2%20Kings	17	6	before capturing it in the ninth year of Hoshea 's rule . The Assyrian king [ b ] took the Israelites away to Assyria as prisoners . He forced some of them to live in the town of Halah , others to live near the Habor River in the territory of Gozan , and still others to live in towns where the Median people lived .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	7	All of this happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God , who had rescued them from Egypt , where they had been slaves . They worshiped foreign gods ,
CEV	2%20Kings	17	8	followed the customs of the nations that the Lord had forced out of Israel , and were just as sinful as the Israelite kings .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	9	Even worse , the Israelites tried to hide their sins from the Lord their God . They built their own local shrines everywhere in Israel—from small towns to large , walled cities .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	10	( A ) They also built stone images of foreign gods and set up sacred poles [ c ] for the worship of Asherah on every hill and under every shady tree .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	11	They offered sacrifices at the shrines , [ d ] just as the foreign nations had done before the Lord forced them out of Israel . They did sinful things that made the Lord very angry .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	12	Even though the Lord had commanded the Israelites not to worship idols , [ e ] they did it anyway .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	13	So the Lord made sure that every prophet warned Israel and Judah with these words : “ I , the Lord , command you to stop doing sinful things and start obeying my laws and teachings ! I gave them to your ancestors , and I told my servants the prophets to repeat them to you. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	17	14	But the Israelites would not listen ; they were as stubborn as their ancestors who had refused to worship the Lord their God .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	15	They ignored the Lord 's warnings and commands , and they rejected the solemn agreement he had made with their ancestors . They worshiped worthless idols and became worthless themselves . The Lord had told the Israelites not to do the things that the foreign nations around them were doing , but Israel became just like them .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	16	( B ) The people of Israel disobeyed all the commands of the Lord their God . They made two gold statues of calves and set up a sacred pole for Asherah ; they also worshiped the stars and the god Baal .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	18	The Lord became so furious with the people of Israel that he allowed them to be carried away as prisoners . Only the people living in Judah were left ,
CEV	2%20Kings	17	19	but they also disobeyed the Lord 's commands and acted like the Israelites .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	20	So the Lord turned his back on everyone in Israel and let them be punished and defeated until no one was left .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	21	Earlier , when the Lord took the northern tribes away from David 's family , [ f ] the people living in northern Israel chose Jeroboam son of Nebat as their king . Jeroboam caused the Israelites to sin and to stop worshiping the Lord .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	22	The people kept on sinning like Jeroboam ,
CEV	2%20Kings	17	23	until the Lord got rid of them , just as he had warned his servants the prophets . That 's why the people of Israel were taken away as prisoners to Assyria , and that 's where they remained . Foreigners Are Resettled in Israel
CEV	2%20Kings	17	24	The king of Assyria took people who were living in the cities of Babylon , Cuthah , Avva , Hamath , and Sepharvaim , and forced them to move to Israel . They took over the towns where the Israelites had lived , including the capital city of Samaria .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	25	At first these people did not worship the Lord , so he sent lions to attack them , and the lions killed some of them .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	26	A messenger told the king of Assyria , “ The people you moved to Israel do n't know how to worship the god of that country . So he sent lions that have attacked and killed some of them. ”

CEV	2%20Kings	17	28	One of the Israelite priests was chosen to go back to Israel . He lived in Bethel and taught the people how to worship the Lord .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	29	But in towns all over Israel , the different groups of people made statues of their own gods , then they placed these idols in local Israelite [ g ] shrines .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	30	The people from Babylonia made the god Succoth-Benoth ; those from Cuthah made the god Nergal ; those from Hamath made Ashima ;
CEV	2%20Kings	17	31	those from Avva made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the people from Sepharvaim sacrificed their children to their own gods Adrammelech and Anammelech . 32-33 They worshiped their own gods , just as they had before they were taken away to Israel . They also worshiped the Lord , but they chose their own people to be priests at the shrines .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	34	( D ) Everyone followed their old customs . None of them worshiped only the Lord , and they refused to obey the laws and commands that the Lord had given to the descendants of Jacob , the man he named Israel .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	35	( E ) At the time when the Lord had made his solemn agreement with the people of Israel , he told them : Do not worship any other gods ! Do not bow down to them or offer them a sacrifice .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	36	( F ) Worship only me ! I am the one who rescued you from Egypt with my mighty power . Bow down to me and offer sacrifices .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	37	Never worship any other god , always obey my laws and teachings ,
CEV	2%20Kings	17	38	and remember the solemn agreement between us . I will say it again : Do not worship any god
CEV	2%20Kings	17	39	except me . I am the Lord your God , and I will rescue you from all your enemies .
CEV	2%20Kings	17	40	But the people living in Israel ignored that command and kept on following their old customs .

CEV	2%20Kings	18	2	Chronicles 32.1-19 ; Isaiah 36.1-22 )
CEV	2%20Kings	18	18	They called out to Hezekiah , and three of his highest officials came out to meet them . One of them was Hilkiah 's son Eliakim , who was the prime minister . The other two were Shebna , assistant to the prime minister , and Joah son of Asaph , keeper of the government records .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	25	Do n't forget that it was the Lord who sent me here with orders to destroy your nation !
CEV	2%20Kings	18	29	Do n't be fooled by Hezekiah . He ca n't save you .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	3	Hezekiah obeyed the Lord , just as his ancestor David had done .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	4	( A ) He destroyed the local shrines , then tore down the images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred pole for worshiping the goddess Asherah . He also smashed the bronze snake Moses had made . The people had named it Nehushtan [ a ] and had been offering sacrifices to it .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	5	Hezekiah trusted the Lord God of Israel . No other king of Judah was like Hezekiah , either before or after him .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	6	He was completely faithful to the Lord and obeyed the laws the Lord had given to Moses for the people .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	7	The Lord helped Hezekiah , so he was successful in everything he did . He even rebelled against the king of Assyria , refusing to be his servant .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	8	Hezekiah defeated the Philistine towns as far away as Gaza—from the smallest towns to the large , walled cities .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	9	During the fourth year of Hezekiah 's rule , which was the seventh year of Hoshea 's rule in Israel , King Shalmaneser of Assyria led his troops to Samaria , the capital city of Israel . They attacked
CEV	2%20Kings	18	10	and captured it three years later , [ b ] in the sixth year of Hezekiah 's rule and the ninth year of Hoshea 's rule .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	11	The king of Assyria [ c ] took the Israelites away as prisoners ; he forced some of them to live in the town of Halah , others to live near the Habor River in the territory of Gozan , and still others to live in towns where the Median people lived .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	12	All of that happened because the people of Israel had not obeyed the Lord their God . They rejected the solemn agreement he had made with them , and they ignored everything that the Lord 's servant Moses had told them . King Sennacherib of Assyria Invades Judah (
CEV	2%20Kings	18	13	( B ) In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah 's rule in Judah , King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded the country and captured every walled city , [ d ] except Jerusalem .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	14	Hezekiah sent this message to Sennacherib , who was in the town of Lachish : “ I know I am guilty of rebellion . But I will pay you whatever you want , if you stop your attack. ” Sennacherib told Hezekiah to pay ten tons of silver and one ton of gold .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	15	So Hezekiah collected all the silver from the Lord 's temple and the royal treasury .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	16	He even stripped the gold that he had used to cover the doors and doorposts [ e ] in the temple . He gave it all to Sennacherib .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	17	The king of Assyria ordered his three highest military officers to leave Lachish and take a large army to Jerusalem . When they arrived , the officers stood on the road near the cloth makers ' shops along the canal from the upper pool .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	19	One of the Assyrian commanders told them : I have a message for Hezekiah from the great king of Assyria . Ask Hezekiah why he feels so sure of himself .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	20	Does he think he can plan and win a war with nothing but words ? Who is going to help him , now that he has turned against the king of Assyria ?
CEV	2%20Kings	18	21	Is he depending on Egypt and its king ? That 's the same as leaning on a broken stick , and it will go right through his hand .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	22	Is Hezekiah now depending on the Lord your God ? Did n't Hezekiah tear down all except one of the Lord 's altars and places of worship ? [ f ] Did n't he tell the people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place ?
CEV	2%20Kings	18	23	The king of Assyria wants to make a bet with you people . He will give you 2,000 horses , if you have enough troops to ride them .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	24	How could you even defeat our lowest ranking officer , when you have to depend on Egypt for chariots and cavalry ?
CEV	2%20Kings	18	26	Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah said , “ Sir , we do n't want the people listening from the city wall to understand what you are saying . So please speak to us in Aramaic instead of Hebrew. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	18	27	The Assyrian army commander answered , “ My king sent me to speak to everyone , not just to you leaders . These people will soon have to eat their own body waste and drink their own urine ! And so will the three of you. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	18	28	Then , in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear , he shouted in Hebrew : Listen to what the great king of Assyria says !
CEV	2%20Kings	18	30	Do n't trust him when he tells you that the Lord will protect you from the king of Assyria .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	31	Stop listening to Hezekiah ! Pay attention to my king . Surrender to him . He will let you keep your own vineyards , fig trees , and cisterns
CEV	2%20Kings	18	32	for a while . Then he will come and take you away to a country just like yours , where you can plant vineyards , raise your own grain , and have plenty of olive oil and honey . Believe me , you wo n't starve there . Hezekiah claims the Lord will save you . But do n't be fooled by him .
CEV	2%20Kings	18	33	Were any other gods able to defend their land against the king of Assyria ?
CEV	2%20Kings	18	34	What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? What about the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? Were the gods of Samaria able to protect their land against the Assyrian forces ?
CEV	2%20Kings	18	35	None of these gods kept their people safe from the king of Assyria . Do you think the Lord your God can do any better ? 36-37 Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah had been warned by King Hezekiah not to answer the Assyrian commander . So they tore their clothes in sorrow and reported to Hezekiah everything the commander had said .

CEV	2%20Kings	19	3	These are difficult and disgraceful times . Our nation is like a woman too weak to give birth , when it 's time for her baby to be born .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	4	Please pray for those of us who are left alive . The king of Assyria sent his army commander to insult the living God . Perhaps the Lord heard what he said and will do something , if you will pray .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	5	When these leaders went to Isaiah ,
CEV	2%20Kings	19	6	he told them that the Lord had this message for Hezekiah : I am the Lord . Do n't worry about the insulting things that have been said about me by these messengers from the king of Assyria .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	7	I will upset him with rumors about what 's happening in his own country . He will go back , and there I will make him die a violent death .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	8	Meanwhile , the commander of the Assyrian forces heard that his king had left the town of Lachish and was now attacking Libnah . So he went there .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	9	About this same time the king of Assyria learned that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia [ a ] was on his way to attack him . Then the king of Assyria sent some messengers with this note for Hezekiah :
CEV	2%20Kings	19	10	Do n't trust your God or be fooled by his promise to defend Jerusalem against me .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	11	You have heard how we Assyrian kings have completely wiped out other nations . What makes you feel so safe ?
CEV	2%20Kings	19	12	The Assyrian kings before me destroyed the towns of Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and everyone from Eden who lived in Telassar . What good did their gods do them ?
CEV	2%20Kings	19	13	The kings of Hamath , Arpad , Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah have all disappeared . Hezekiah Prays ( Isaiah 37.14-20 )
CEV	2%20Kings	19	14	After Hezekiah had read the note from the king of Assyria , he took it to the temple and spread it out for the Lord to see .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	15	( A ) He prayed : Lord God of Israel , your throne is above the winged creatures . [ b ] You created the heavens and the earth , and you alone rule the kingdoms of this world .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	16	But just look how Sennacherib has insulted you , the living God .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	17	It is true , our Lord , that Assyrian kings have turned nations into deserts .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	18	They destroyed the idols of wood and stone that the people of those nations had made and worshiped .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	20	Isaiah went to Hezekiah and told him that the Lord God of Israel had said : Hezekiah , I heard your prayer about King Sennacherib of Assyria .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	21	Now this is what I say to that king : The people of Jerusalem hate and make fun of you ; they laugh behind your back .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	22	Sennacherib , you cursed , shouted , and sneered at me , the holy God of Israel .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	23	You let your officials insult me , the Lord . And this is how you bragged about yourself : “ I led my chariots to the highest heights of Lebanon 's mountains . I went deep into its forest , cutting down the best cedar and cypress trees .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	24	I dried up every stream in the land of Egypt , and I drank water from wells I had dug. ”
CEV	2%20Kings	19	25	Sennacherib , now listen to me , the Lord . I planned all this long ago . And you do n't even realize that I alone am the one who decided that you would do these things . I let you make ruins of fortified cities .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	26	Their people became weak , terribly confused . They were like wild flowers or tender young grass growing on a flat roof , scorched before it matures . [ c ]
CEV	2%20Kings	19	27	I know all about you , even how fiercely angry you are with me .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	28	I have seen your pride and the tremendous hatred you have for me . Now I will put a hook in your nose , a bit in your mouth , [ d ] then I will send you back to where you came from .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	29	Hezekiah , I will tell you what 's going to happen . This year you will eat crops that grow on their own , and the next year you will eat whatever springs up where those crops grew . But the third year you will plant grain and vineyards , and you will eat what you harvest .

CEV	2%20Kings	19	35	( B ) That same night the Lord sent an angel to the camp of the Assyrians , and he killed 185,000 of them . And so the next morning , the camp was full of dead bodies .
CEV	2%20Kings	19	36	After this King Sennacherib went back to Assyria and lived in the city of Nineveh .

CEV	2%20Kings	20	8	Hezekiah asked Isaiah , “ Can you prove that the Lord will heal me , so that I can worship in his temple in three days ? ”

CEV	2%20Kings	21	4	( B ) In the temple , where only the Lord was supposed to be worshiped , Manasseh built altars for the worship of pagan gods
CEV	2%20Kings	21	5	and the stars . He placed these altars in both courts of the temple , 6-7 ( C ) and even set up the pole for Asherah there . Manasseh practiced magic and witchcraft ; he asked fortunetellers for advice and sacrificed his own son . He did many sinful things and made the Lord very angry . Years ago the Lord had told David and his son Solomon : Jerusalem is the place I prefer above all others in Israel . It belongs to me , and there I will be worshiped forever .
CEV	2%20Kings	21	8	If my people will faithfully obey all the commands in the Law of my servant Moses , I will never make them leave the land I gave to their ancestors .

CEV	2%20Kings	23	23	years old when he became king of Judah , and he ruled from Jerusalem only
CEV	2%20Kings	23	3	months . His mother Hamutal was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	4	( A ) Josiah told Hilkiah the priest , the assistant priests , and the guards at the temple door to go into the temple and bring out the things used to worship Baal , Asherah , and the stars . Josiah had these things burned in Kidron Valley just outside Jerusalem , and he had the ashes carried away to the town of Bethel .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	5	Josiah also got rid of the pagan priests at the local shrines in Judah and around Jerusalem . These were the men that the kings of Judah had appointed to offer sacrifices to Baal and to the sun , moon , and stars .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	6	Josiah had the sacred pole [ b ] for Asherah brought out of the temple and taken to Kidron Valley , where it was burned . He then had its ashes ground into dust and scattered over the public cemetery there .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	7	He had the buildings torn down where the male prostitutes [ c ] lived next to the temple , and where the women wove sacred robes [ d ] for the idol of Asherah .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	8	In almost every town in Judah , priests had been offering sacrifices to the Lord at local shrines . [ e ] Josiah brought these priests to Jerusalem and had their shrines made unfit for worship—every shrine from Geba just north of Jerusalem to Beersheba in the south . He even tore down the shrine at Beersheba that was just to the left of Joshua Gate , which was named after the highest official of the city .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	9	Those local priests could not serve at the Lord 's altar in Jerusalem , but they were allowed to eat sacred bread , [ f ] just like the priests from Jerusalem .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	10	( B ) Josiah sent some men to Hinnom Valley just outside Jerusalem with orders to make the altar there unfit for worship . That way , people could no longer use it for sacrificing their children to the god Molech .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	11	years from Jerusalem . His mother Zebidah was the daughter of Pedaiah from Rumah .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	12	( C ) Some of the kings of Judah , especially Manasseh , had built altars in the two courts of the temple and in the room that Ahaz had built on the palace roof . Josiah had these altars torn down and smashed to pieces , and he had the pieces thrown into Kidron Valley , just outside Jerusalem .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	13	( D ) After that , he closed down the shrines that Solomon had built east of Jerusalem and south of Spoil Hill to honor Astarte the disgusting goddess of Sidon , Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab , and Milcom the disgusting god of Ammon . [ h ]
CEV	2%20Kings	23	14	He tore down the stone images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred pole used in the worship of Asherah . Then he had the whole area covered with human bones . [ i ]
CEV	2%20Kings	23	15	( E ) But Josiah was not finished yet . At Bethel he destroyed the shrine and the altar that Jeroboam son of Nebat had built and that had caused the Israelites to sin . Josiah had the shrine and the Asherah pole burned and ground into dust .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	16	( F ) As he looked around , he saw graves on the hillside . He had the bones in them dug up and burned on the altar , so that it could no longer be used . This happened just as God 's prophet had said when Jeroboam was standing at the altar , celebrating a festival . [ j ] Then Josiah saw the grave of the prophet who had said this would happen
CEV	2%20Kings	23	17	Then Josiah asked. ” - 23.18 old prophet … there : See
CEV	2%20Kings	23	18	Josiah replied , “ Then leave it alone . Do n't dig up his bones. ” So they did not disturb his bones or the bones of the old prophet from Israel who had also been buried there . [ l ]
CEV	2%20Kings	23	19	Some of the Israelite kings had made the Lord angry by building pagan shrines all over Israel . So Josiah sent troops to destroy these shrines just as he had done to the one in Bethel .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	20	He killed the priests who served at them and burned their bones on the altars . After all that , Josiah went back to Jerusalem . Josiah and the People of Judah Celebrate Passover (
CEV	2%20Kings	23	21	Josiah told the people of Judah , “ Celebrate Passover in honor of the Lord your God , just as it says in The Book of God 's Law. ” [ m ]
CEV	2%20Kings	23	22	This festival had not been celebrated in this way since the time that tribal leaders ruled Israel or the kings ruled Israel and Judah .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	24	Josiah got rid of every disgusting person and thing in Judah and Jerusalem—including magicians , fortunetellers , and idols . He did his best to obey every law written in the book that the priest Hilkiah found in the Lord 's temple .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	25	years old when he was appointed king , and he ruled
CEV	2%20Kings	23	26	But the Lord was still furious with the people of Judah because Manasseh had done so many things to make him angry .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	27	The Lord said , “ I will desert the people of Judah , just as I deserted the people of Israel . I will reject Jerusalem , even though I chose it to be mine . And I will abandon this temple built to honor me. ” Josiah Dies in Battle (
CEV	2%20Kings	23	28	Everything else Josiah did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	29	During Josiah 's rule , King Neco of Egypt led his army north to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria . Josiah led his troops north to fight Neco , but when they met in battle at Megiddo , Josiah was killed . [ n ]
CEV	2%20Kings	23	30	A few of Josiah 's servants put his body in a chariot and took it back to Jerusalem , where they buried it in his own tomb . Then the people of Judah found his son Jehoahaz and poured olive oil on his head to show that he was their new king . King Jehoahaz of Judah (
CEV	2%20Kings	23	31	Jehoahaz was
CEV	2%20Kings	23	32	Jehoahaz disobeyed the Lord , just as some of his ancestors had done .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	33	King Neco of Egypt had Jehoahaz arrested and put in prison at Riblah [ o ] near Hamath . Then he forced the people of Judah to pay him 3.4 tons of silver and
CEV	2%20Kings	23	34	( H ) Neco appointed Josiah 's son Eliakim king of Judah , and changed his name to Jehoiakim . He took Jehoahaz as a prisoner to Egypt , where he died .
CEV	2%20Kings	23	35	Jehoiakim forced the people of Judah to pay higher taxes , so he could give Neco the silver and gold he demanded . King Jehoiakim of Judah (

CEV	2%20Kings	24	13	The Lord had warned [ d ] that someday the treasures would be taken from the royal palace and from the temple , including the gold objects that Solomon had made for the temple . And that 's exactly what Nebuchadnezzar ordered his soldiers to do .

CEV	2%20Kings	25	24	Gedaliah said to them , “ Everything will be fine , I promise . We do n't need to be afraid of the Babylonian rulers , if we live here peacefully and do what Nebuchadnezzar says. ”

CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	9	David became a great and strong ruler , because the Lord All-Powerful was on his side . The Three Warriors (
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	10	The Lord had promised that David would become king , and so everyone in Israel gave David their support . Certain warriors also helped keep his kingdom strong .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	300	men with his spear . He was just as famous as the Three Warriors
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	12	Another one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	13	During a battle against the Philistines at Pas-Dammim , all the Israelite soldiers ran away ,
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	14	except Eleazar , who stayed with David . They took their positions in a nearby barley field and defeated the Philistines ! The Lord gave Israel a great victory that day .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	15	One time the Three Warriors [ c ] went to meet David among the rocks at Adullam Cave . The Philistine army had set up camp in Rephaim Valley
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	16	and had taken over Bethlehem . David was in a fortress ,
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	17	and he said , “ I 'm very thirsty . I wish I had a drink of water from the well by the gate to Bethlehem. ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	18	The Three Warriors sneaked through the Philistine camp and got some water from the well near Bethlehem 's gate . They took it back to David , but he refused to drink it . Instead , he poured out the water as a sacrifice to the Lord
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	19	and said , “ Drinking this water would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives to get it for me. ” The Three Warriors did these brave deeds . The Thirty Warriors (
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	20	Joab 's brother Abishai was the leader of the Thirty Warriors , [ d ] and in one battle he killed
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	21	and was more famous than the rest of the Thirty Warriors . He was their commander , but he never became one of the Three Warriors . [ e ]
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	22	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things . One time he killed two of Moab 's best fighters , and one snowy day he went into a pit and killed a lion .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	23	Another time he killed an Egyptian who was over two meters tall and was armed with a spear . Benaiah only had a club , so he grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	24	Benaiah did things like that ; he was just as brave as the Three Warriors ,
CEV	1%20Chronicles	11	25	even though he never became one of them . And he was certainly as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors . So David made him the leader of his own bodyguard . 26-47 Here is a list of the other famous warriors : Asahel the brother of Joab ; Elhanan the son of Dodo from Bethlehem ; Shammoth from Haror ; Helez from Pelon ; Ira the son of Ikkesh from Tekoa ; Abiezer from Anathoth ; Sibbecai the Hushathite ; Ilai [ f ] the Ahohite ; Maharai from Netophah ; Heled the son of Baanah from Netophah ; Ithai the son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin ; Benaiah from Pirathon ; Hurai [ g ] from near the streams on Mount Gaash ; Abiel from Arbah ; Azmaveth from Baharum ; Eliahba from Shaalbon ; Hashem [ h ] the Gizonite ; Jonathan the son of Shagee from Harar ; Ahiam the son of Sachar the Hararite ; Eliphal the son of Ur ; Hepher from Mecherah ; Ahijah from Pelon ; Hezro from Carmel ; Naarai the son of Ezbai ; Joel the brother of Nathan ; Mibhar the son of Hagri ; Zelek from Ammon ; Naharai from Beeroth who carried Joab 's weapons ; Ira the Ithrite ; Gareb the Ithrite ; Uriah the Hittite ; Zabad the son of Ahlai ; Adina the son of Shiza , a leader in the Reuben tribe , and

CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	12	Some time earlier , David had gone to live in the town of Ziklag to escape from King Saul . While David was there , several brave warriors joined him to help fight his battles . [ a ] Warriors from the Benjamin tribe
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	2	Several of these warriors were from King Saul 's own tribe of Benjamin . They were experts at using a bow and arrows , and they could shoot an arrow or sling a stone with either hand . 3-7 Their leaders were Ahiezer and Joash , the sons of Shemaah from Gibeah . Here is a list of those men from Benjamin : Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth ; Beracah and Jehu from Anathoth ; Ishmaiah from Gibeon , who was the leader of the Thirty Warriors ; Jeremiah , Jahaziel , Johanan , and Jozabad from Gederah ; Eluzai , Jerimoth , Bealiah , Shemariah , and Shephatiah from Haruph ; Elkanah , Isshiah , Azarel , Joezer , and Jashobeam from the Korah clan ; Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor . Warriors from the Gad tribe
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	8	Men from the tribe of Gad also joined David at his fortress in the desert and served as his warriors . They were also brave soldiers—fierce as lions and quick as gazelles . They were always prepared to fight with shields and spears . 9-13 There were eleven of them , ranked in the following order : Ezer the leader , then Obadiah , Eliab , Mishmannah , Jeremiah , Attai , Eliel , Johanan , Elzabad , Jeremiah , and Machbannai .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	14	All these men were army officers ; some were high-ranking officers over a thousand troops , and others were officers over a hundred troops .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	15	Earlier , they had crossed the Jordan River when it flooded , and they chased out the people who lived in the valleys on each side of the river . Warriors from the Benjamin and Judah tribes
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	16	One time a group of men from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah went to the fortress where David was staying .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	17	David met them outside and said , “ If you are coming as friends to fight on my side , then stay and join us . But if you try to turn me over to my enemies , the God our ancestors worshiped will punish you , because I have done nothing wrong. ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	18	Amasai , who later became the leader of the Thirty Warriors , was one of these men who went to David . God 's Spirit took control of him , and he said , “ We will join you , David son of Jesse ! You and your followers will always be successful , because God fights on your side. ” So David agreed to let them stay , and he even put them in charge of his soldiers who raided enemy villages . Warriors from the Manasseh tribe
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	19	Some of the warriors who joined David were from the tribe of Manasseh . They had earlier gone with David when he agreed to fight on the side of the Philistines against King Saul . But as soon as the Philistine rulers realized that David might turn against them and rejoin Saul , they sent David away to the town of Ziklag .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	20	That 's when the following men from Manasseh joined him : Adnah , Jozabad , Jediael , Michael , Jozabad , Elihu , and Zillethai . They had all been commanders in Saul 's army
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	21	and brave soldiers , and so David made them officers in his army . They fought on his side when enemy troops attacked .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	22	of his relatives , who were also officers ; 3,000 from Benjamin , because this was Saul 's own tribe and most of the men had remained loyal to him ; 20,800 from Ephraim , who were not only brave , but also famous in their clans ; 18,000 from West Manasseh , who had been chosen to help make David king ;
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	200	leaders from Issachar , along with troops under their command—these leaders knew the right time to do what needed to be done ; 50,000 from Zebulun , who were not only loyal , but also trained to use any weapon ; 1,000 officers from Naphtali and 37,000 soldiers armed with shields and spears ; 28,600 from Dan ; 40,000 from Asher ; and 120,000 from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh , who were armed with all kinds of weapons .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	38	All of these soldiers voluntarily came to Hebron because they wanted David to become king of Israel . In fact , everyone in Israel wanted the same thing .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	39	The soldiers stayed in Hebron three days , eating and drinking what their relatives had prepared for them .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	12	40	Other Israelites from as far away as the territories of Issachar , Zebulun , and Naphtali brought cattle and sheep to slaughter for food . They also brought donkeys , camels , mules , and oxen that were loaded down with flour , dried figs and raisins , wine , and olive oil . Everyone in Israel was very happy .

CEV	1%20Chronicles	13	7	The sacred chest was still at Abinadab 's house , [ b ] and when David and the crowd arrived there , they brought the chest outside and placed it on a new ox cart . Abinadab 's sons [ c ] Uzzah and Ahio guided the cart ,

CEV	1%20Chronicles	13	9	But when they came to Chidon 's threshing place , the oxen stumbled , and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the chest to stop it from falling .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	13	10	The Lord God was very angry with Uzzah for doing this , and he killed Uzzah right there beside the chest .

CEV	1%20Chronicles	14	10	David asked God , “ Should I attack the Philistines ? Will you help me win ? ” The Lord told David , “ Yes , attack them ! I will give you victory. ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	14	11	David and his army marched to Baal-Perazim , where they attacked and defeated the Philistines . He said , “ I defeated my enemies because God broke through them like a mighty flood. ” So he named the place “ The Lord Broke Through. ” [ b ]

CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	4	But David would not change his mind . And so Joab went everywhere in Israel and Judah and counted the people . He returned to Jerusalem
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	5	and told David that the total number of men who could serve in the army was 1,100,000 in Israel and 470,000 in Judah .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	6	Joab refused to include anyone from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin , because he still disagreed with David 's orders . God Punishes Israel (
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	7	David 's order to count the people made God angry , and he punished Israel .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	8	David prayed , “ I am your servant . But what I did was stupid and terribly wrong . Please forgive me. ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	9	The Lord said to Gad , one of David 's prophets ,
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	10	“ Tell David that I will punish him in one of three ways . But he will have to choose which one it will be. ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	11	Gad went to David and told him : You must choose how the Lord will punish you :
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	12	Will there be three years when the land wo n't grow enough food for its people ? Or will your enemies constantly defeat you for three months ? Or will the Lord send a horrible disease to strike your land for three days ? Think about it and decide , because I have to give your answer to God who sent me .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	13	David was miserable and said , “ It 's a terrible choice to make ! But the Lord is kind , and I 'd rather be punished by him than by anyone else. ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	14	So the Lord sent a horrible disease on Israel , and 70,000 Israelites died .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	15	Then he sent an angel to destroy the city of Jerusalem . But just as the angel was about to do that , the Lord felt sorry for all the suffering he had caused the people , and he told the angel , “ Stop ! They have suffered enough. ” This happened at the threshing place that belonged to Araunah [ a ] the Jebusite .

CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	18	The Lord 's angel told the prophet Gad to tell David that he must go to Araunah 's threshing place and build an altar in honor of the Lord .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	19	David followed the Lord 's instructions .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	20	Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat at the time , and when they saw the angel , the four sons ran to hide .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	22	David said , “ Would you sell me your threshing place , so I can build an altar on it to the Lord ? Then this disease will stop killing the people . I 'm willing to pay whatever you say it 's worth. ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	23	Araunah answered , “ Take it , Your Majesty , and do whatever you want with it . I 'll even give you the oxen for the sacrifice and the wheat for the grain sacrifice . And you can use the threshing-boards [ c ] for the fire . It 's all yours ! ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	24	But David replied , “ No ! I want to pay you what they 're worth . I ca n't just take something from you and then offer the Lord a sacrifice that cost me nothing. ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	25	So David paid Araunah
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	600	gold coins for his threshing place .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	26	David built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the Lord [ d ] and sacrifices to ask his blessing . [ e ] David prayed , and the Lord answered him by sending fire down on the altar .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	27	Then the Lord commanded the angel to put the sword away . [ f ]
CEV	1%20Chronicles	21	28	When David saw that the Lord had answered his prayer , he offered more sacrifices there at the threshing place , 29-30 because he was afraid of the angel 's sword and did not want to go all the way to Gibeon .

CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	2	David ordered the foreigners living in Israel to come to Jerusalem . Then he assigned some to cut blocks of stone for building the temple .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	3	He got a large supply of iron to make into nails and hinges for the doors , and he provided so much bronze that it could not be weighed .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	4	He also brought an endless supply of cedar logs from the cities of Sidon and Tyre .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	5	He said , “ The temple for the Lord must be great , so that everyone in the world will know about it . But since my son Solomon is young and has no experience , I will make sure that everything is ready for the temple to be built. ” That 's why David did all these things before he died . David Instructs Solomon To Build the Temple
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	6	David sent for his son Solomon and told him to build a temple for the Lord God of Israel .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	7	( A ) He said : My son , I wanted to build a temple where the Lord my God would be worshiped .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	8	But some time ago , he told me , “ David , you have killed too many people and have fought too many battles . That 's why you are not the one to build my temple .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	9	But when your son becomes king , I will give him peace throughout his kingdom . His name will be Solomon , because during his rule I will keep Israel safe and peaceful . [ a ]
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	10	Solomon will build my temple . He will be like a son to me , and I will be like a father to him . In fact , one of his descendants will always rule in Israel. ”
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	11	Solomon , my son , I now pray that the Lord your God will be with you and keep his promise to help you build a temple for him .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	12	May he give you wisdom and knowledge , so that you can rule Israel according to his Law .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	13	( B ) If you obey the laws and teachings that the Lord gave Moses , you will be successful . Be strong and brave and do n't get discouraged or be afraid of anything .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	14	I have all the supplies you 'll need to build the temple : You have more than 3,000 tons of gold and over 34,000 tons of silver . There 's also plenty of wood , stone , and more bronze and iron than I could weigh . Ask for anything else you need .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	15	I have also assigned men who will cut and lay the stone . And there are carpenters and people who are experts in working with
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	16	gold , silver , bronze , and iron . You have plenty of workers to do the job . Now get started , and I pray that the Lord will be with you in your work .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	17	David then gave orders for the leaders of Israel to help Solomon .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	22	18	David said : The Lord our God has helped me defeat all the people who lived here before us , and he has given you peace from all your enemies . Now this land belongs to the Lord and his people .

CEV	1%20Chronicles	23	30	Every morning and evening , the Levites are to give thanks to the Lord and sing praises to him .

But Jeush and Beriah did n't have many children , so their descendants were counted as one family .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	23	12	Kohath had four sons : Amram , Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	23	13	( B ) Amram was the father of Aaron and Moses . Aaron and his descendants were chosen to be in charge of all the sacred things .

CEV	1%20Chronicles	23	27	From now on , all Levites at least
CEV	1%20Chronicles	23	28	( D ) will serve the Lord by helping Aaron 's descendants do their work at the temple , by keeping the courtyards and rooms of the temple clean , and by making sure that everything used in worship stays pure .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	23	29	They will also be in charge of the sacred loaves of bread , the flour for the grain sacrifices , the thin wafers , any offerings to be baked , and the flour mixed with olive oil . These Levites will weigh and measure these offerings .
CEV	1%20Chronicles	23	31	They must also give thanks and sing praises when sacrifices are offered on each Sabbath , as well as during New Moon Festivals and other religious feasts . There must always be enough Levites on duty at the temple to do everything that needs to be done .

CEV	1%20Chronicles	24	4	Eleazar 's descendants were divided into

CEV	1%20Chronicles	24	6	As each group was assigned their duties , Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the Levite wrote down the name of the family leader in charge of that group .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	2	8	I know that you have workers who are experts at cutting lumber in Lebanon . So would you please send me some cedar , pine , and juniper logs ? My workers will be there to help them ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	2	9	because I 'll need a lot of lumber to build such a large and glorious temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	2	10	I will pay your woodcutters 2,000 tons of wheat , the same amount of barley , 400,000 liters of wine , and that same amount of olive oil .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	2	14	His mother was from the Israelite tribe of Dan , and his father was from Tyre .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	5	1	Kings 8.1-13 ) 2-3 ( B ) The sacred chest had been kept on Mount Zion , also known as the city of David . But Solomon decided to have the chest moved to the temple while everyone was in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Shelters during the seventh month . [ a ] Solomon called together all the important leaders of Israel . 4-5 Then the priests and the Levites picked up the sacred chest , the sacred tent , and the objects used for worship , and they carried them to the temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	5	6	Solomon and a crowd of people stood in front of the chest and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	5	7	The priests carried the chest into the most holy place and put it under the winged creatures ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	5	8	whose wings covered both the chest and the poles used for carrying it .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	5	9	The poles were so long that they could be seen from just outside the most holy place , but not from anywhere else . And they stayed there from then on .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	5	10	( C ) The only things kept in the chest were the two flat stones Moses had put there when the Lord made his agreement with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai , [ b ] after bringing them out of Egypt . 11-13 ( D ) The priests of every group had gone through the ceremony to make themselves clean and acceptable to the Lord . The Levite musicians , including Asaph , Heman , Jeduthun , and their sons and relatives , were wearing robes of fine linen . They were standing on the east side of the altar , playing cymbals , small harps , and other stringed instruments . One hundred and twenty priests were with these musicians , and they were blowing trumpets . They were praising the Lord by playing music and singing : “ The Lord is good , and his love never ends. ” Suddenly a cloud filled the temple as the priests were leaving the holy place .

Solomon stood on the platform facing the altar with everyone standing behind him . Then he lifted his arms toward heaven ; he knelt down
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	3	Solomon turned toward the people standing there . Then he blessed them 4-6 ( A ) and said : Praise the Lord God of Israel ! He brought his people out of Egypt long ago and later kept his promise to make my father David the king of Israel . The Lord also promised him that Jerusalem would be the city where his temple will be built , and now that promise has come true .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	7	When my father wanted to build a temple for the Lord God of Israel ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	8	the Lord said , “ It 's good that you want to build a temple where I can be worshiped .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	9	But you 're not the one to do it . Your son will build the temple to honor me. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	10	The Lord has done what he promised . I am now the king of Israel , and I 've built a temple for the Lord our God .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	11	I 've also put the sacred chest in the temple . And in that chest are the two flat stones on which is written the solemn agreement the Lord made with our ancestors when he rescued them from Egypt . Solomon Prays at the Temple (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	14	and prayed : Lord God of Israel , no other god in heaven or on earth is like you ! You never forget the agreement you made with your people , and you are loyal to anyone who faithfully obeys your teachings .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	15	My father David was your servant , and today you have kept every promise you made to him .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	16	( B ) You promised that someone from his family would always be king of Israel , if they do their best to obey you , just as he did .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	17	Please keep this promise you made to your servant David .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	18	( C ) There 's not enough room in all of heaven for you , Lord God . How could you possibly live on earth in this temple I have built ?
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	19	But I ask you to answer my prayer .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	20	( D ) This is the temple where you have chosen to be worshiped . Please watch over it day and night and listen when I turn toward it and pray .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	21	I am your servant , and the people of Israel belong to you , and so whenever any of us look toward this temple and pray , answer from your home in heaven and forgive our sins .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	22	Suppose someone accuses a person of a crime , and the accused has to stand in front of the altar in your temple and say , “ I swear I am innocent ! ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	23	Listen from heaven and decide who is right . Then punish the guilty person and let the innocent one go free .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	24	Suppose your people Israel sin against you , and then an enemy defeats them . If they come to this temple and beg for forgiveness ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	25	listen from your home in heaven . Forgive them and bring them back to the land you gave their ancestors .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	26	Suppose your people sin against you , and you punish them by holding back the rain . If they stop sinning and turn toward this temple to pray in your name ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	27	listen from your home in heaven and forgive them . The people of Israel are your servants , so teach them to live right . And send rain on the land you promised them forever .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	28	Sometimes the crops may dry up or rot or be eaten by locusts [ a ] or grasshoppers , and your people will be starving . Sometimes enemies may surround their towns , or your people will become sick with deadly diseases .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	29	Please listen when anyone in Israel truly feels sorry and sincerely prays with arms lifted toward your temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	30	You know what is in everyone 's heart . So from your home in heaven answer their prayers , according to what they do and what is in their hearts .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	31	Then your people will worship you and obey you for as long as they live in the land you gave their ancestors .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	32	Foreigners will hear about you and your mighty power , and some of them will come to live among your people Israel . If any of them pray toward this temple ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	33	listen from your home in heaven and answer their prayers . Then everyone on earth will worship you , just as your own people Israel do , and they will know that I have built this temple in your honor .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	34	Sometimes you will order your people to attack their enemies . Then your people will turn toward this temple I have built for you in your chosen city , and they will pray to you .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	35	Answer their prayers from heaven and give them victory .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	36	Everyone sins . But when your people sin against you , suppose you get angry enough to let their enemies drag them away to foreign countries . 37-39 Later , they may feel sorry for what they did and ask your forgiveness . Answer them when they pray toward this temple I have built for you in your chosen city , here in this land you gave their ancestors . From your home in heaven , listen to their sincere prayers and forgive your people who have sinned against you .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	40	Lord God , hear us when we pray in this temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	6	41	( E ) Come to your new home , where we have already placed the sacred chest , which is the symbol of your strength . I pray that when the priests announce your power to save people , those who are faithful to you will celebrate what you 've done for them .

They prayed : “ The Lord is good , and his love never ends. ” 4-5 Solomon and the people dedicated the temple to the Lord by sacrificing 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	6	Everybody stood up during the ceremony . The priests were in their assigned places , blowing their trumpets . And the Levites faced them , playing the musical instruments that David had made for them to use when they praised the Lord for his never-ending love .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	11	The Lord 's temple and Solomon 's palace were now finished . In fact , everything Solomon had planned to do was completed .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	12	Some time later , the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and said : I heard your prayer , and I have chosen this temple as the place where sacrifices will be offered to me .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	13	Suppose I hold back the rain or send locusts [ c ] to eat the crops or make my people suffer with deadly diseases .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	15	I will hear the prayers made in this temple ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	16	because it belongs to me , and this is where I will be worshiped forever . I will never stop watching over it .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	17	Your father David obeyed me , and now , Solomon , you must do the same . Obey my laws and teachings ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	18	( C ) and I will keep my solemn promise to him that someone from your family will always be king of Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	19	But if you or any of the people of Israel disobey my laws or start worshiping foreign gods ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	20	I will pull you out of this land I gave you . I will desert this temple where I said I would be worshiped , so that people everywhere will think it is only a joke and will make fun of it .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	21	This temple is now magnificent . But when these things happen , everyone who walks by it will be shocked and will ask , “ Why did the Lord do such a terrible thing to his people and to this temple ? ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	7	22	Then they will answer , “ It was because the people of Israel rejected the Lord their God , who rescued their ancestors from Egypt , and they started worshiping other gods. ” Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Chronicles	10	5	Rehoboam replied , “ Come back in three days for my answer. ” So the people left .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	10	6	Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father 's senior officials , and he asked them , “ What should I tell these people ? ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	10	7	They answered , “ If you want them to serve and obey you , then you should be kind and promise to make their work easier. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	10	8	But Rehoboam refused their advice and went to the younger men who had grown up with him and were now his officials .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	10	9	He asked , “ What do you think I should say to these people who asked me to make their work easier ? ”

Rehoboam can rule his own people. ” Adoniram [ b ] was in charge of the work force , and Rehoboam sent him to talk to the people . But they stoned him to death . Then Rehoboam ran to his chariot and hurried back to Jerusalem . Everyone from Israel 's northern tribes went home , leaving Rehoboam to rule only the people from Judah . And since that day , the people of Israel have been opposed to David 's descendants in Judah . [ c ] All of this happened just as Ahijah the Lord 's prophet from Shiloh had told Jeroboam .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	18	Micaiah replied : I then saw the Lord seated on his throne with every creature in heaven gathered around him .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	1	Kings 22.29-35 )
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	3	and finally asked , “ Jehoshaphat , would you go with me to attack Ramoth ? ” “ Yes , ” Jehoshaphat answered . “ My army is at your command .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	4	But first let 's ask the Lord what to do. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	5	Ahab sent for
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	400	prophets and asked , “ Should I attack the city of Ramoth ? ” “ Yes ! ” the prophets answered . “ God will help you capture the city. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Just to make sure , is there another of the Lord 's prophets we can ask ? ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	7	“ We could ask Micaiah son of Imlah , ” Ahab said . “ But I hate Micaiah . He always has bad news for me. ” “ Do n't say that ! ” Jehoshaphat replied .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	8	Then Ahab sent someone to bring Micaiah as soon as possible .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	9	All this time , Ahab and Jehoshaphat were dressed in their royal robes and were seated on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria , listening to the prophets tell them what the Lord had said .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	10	Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was one of the prophets . He had made some horns out of iron and shouted , “ Ahab , the Lord says you will attack the Syrians like a bull with iron horns and wipe them out ! ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	11	All the prophets agreed that Ahab should attack the Syrians at Ramoth and promised that the Lord would help him defeat them .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	12	Meanwhile , the messenger who went to get Micaiah whispered , “ Micaiah , all the prophets have good news for Ahab . Now go and say the same thing. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	13	“ I 'll say whatever the living Lord my God tells me to say , ” Micaiah replied .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	14	Then Micaiah went up to Ahab , who asked , “ Micaiah , should we attack Ramoth ? ” “ Yes ! ” Micaiah answered . “ The Lord will help you capture the city. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	15	Ahab shouted , “ Micaiah , I 've told you over and over to tell me the truth ! What does the Lord really say ? ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	16	( A ) Micaiah answered , “ In a vision [ b ] I saw Israelite soldiers wandering around , lost in the hills like sheep without a shepherd . The Lord said , ‘ These troops have no leader . They should go home and not fight. ’ ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	17	Ahab turned to Jehoshaphat and said , “ I told you he would bring me bad news ! ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	19	The Lord asked , “ Who can trick Ahab and make him go to Ramoth where he will be killed ? ” They talked about it for a while ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	20	then finally a spirit came forward and said to the Lord , “ I can trick Ahab. ” “ How ? ” the Lord asked .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	21	“ I 'll make Ahab 's prophets lie to him. ” “ Good ! ” the Lord replied . “ Now go and do it . You will be successful. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	22	Ahab , this is exactly what has happened . The Lord made all your prophets lie to you , and he knows you will soon be destroyed .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Zedekiah walked over and slapped Micaiah on the face . Then he asked , “ Do you really think the Lord would speak to you and not to me ? ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	24	Micaiah answered , “ You 'll find out on the day you have to hide in the back room of some house. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	25	Ahab shouted , “ Arrest Micaiah ! Take him to Prince Joash and Governor Amon of Samaria .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	26	Tell them to put him in prison and to give him nothing but bread and water until I come back safely. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	27	Micaiah said , “ If you do come back , I was wrong about what the Lord wanted me to say. ” Then he told the crowd , “ Do n't forget what I said ! ” Ahab Dies at Ramoth (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	28	Ahab and Jehoshaphat led their armies to Ramoth in Gilead .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	29	Before they went into battle , Ahab said , “ Jehoshaphat , I 'll disguise myself , but you wear your royal robe. ” Ahab disguised himself and went into battle .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	30	The king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders to attack only Ahab .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	31	So when they saw Jehoshaphat in his robe , they thought he was Ahab and started to attack him . But Jehoshaphat prayed , and the Lord made the Syrian soldiers stop .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	32	And when they realized he was n't Ahab , they left him alone .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	33	However , during the fighting a soldier shot an arrow without even aiming , and it hit Ahab between two pieces of his armor . He shouted to his chariot driver , “ I 've been hit ! Get me out of here ! ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	18	34	The fighting lasted all day , with Ahab propped up in his chariot so he could see the Syrian troops . He stayed there until evening , and by sundown he was dead . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	2	But the prophet Jehu son of Hanani met him and said : By helping that wicked Ahab , you have made friends with someone who hates the Lord . Now the Lord God is angry with you !
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	19	Jehoshaphat returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	3	But not everything about you is bad . You destroyed the sacred poles [ a ] used in worshiping the goddess Asherah—that shows you have tried to obey the Lord . Jehoshaphat Appoints Judges To Settle Cases
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	4	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem , but he often traveled through his kingdom , from Beersheba in the south to the edge of the hill country of Ephraim in the north . He talked with the people and convinced them to turn back to the Lord God and worship him , just as their ancestors had done .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	5	He assigned judges to each of the fortified cities in Judah
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	6	and told them : Be careful when you make your decisions in court , because you are judging by the Lord 's standards and not by human standards , and he will know what you decide .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	7	So do your work in honor of him and know that he wo n't allow you to be unfair to anyone or to take bribes .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	8	Jehoshaphat also chose some Levites , some priests , and some of the family leaders , and he appointed them to serve as judges in Jerusalem .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	9	He told them : Faithfully serve the Lord !
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	10	The people of Judah will bring you legal cases that involve every type of crime , including murder . You must settle these cases and warn the people to stop sinning against the Lord , so that he wo n't get angry and punish Judah . Remember , if you follow these instructions , you wo n't be held responsible for anything that happens .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	19	11	Amariah the high priest will have the final say in any religious case . And Zebadiah , the leader [ b ] of the Judah tribe , will have the final say in all other cases . The rest of the Levites will serve as your assistants . Be brave , and I pray that the Lord will help you do right . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	2	Messengers told Jehoshaphat , “ A large army from Edom [ b ] east of the Dead Sea has invaded our country . They have already reached En-Gedi. ” [ c ]
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	20	Early the next morning , as everyone got ready to leave for the desert near Tekoa , Jehoshaphat stood up and said , “ Listen my friends , if we trust the Lord God and believe what these prophets have told us , the Lord will help us , and we will be successful. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	3	Jehoshaphat was afraid , so he asked the Lord what to do . He then told the people of Judah to go without eating to show their sorrow .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	4	They immediately left for Jerusalem to ask for the Lord 's help .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	5	After everyone from Judah and Jerusalem had come together at the Lord 's temple , Jehoshaphat stood in front of the new courtyard
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	6	and prayed : You , Lord , are the God our ancestors worshiped , and from heaven you rule every nation in the world . You are so powerful that no one can defeat you .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	7	( A ) Our God , you forced out the nations who lived in this land before your people Israel came here , and you gave it to the descendants of your friend Abraham forever .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	8	Our ancestors lived in this land and built a temple to honor you .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	9	They believed that whenever this land is struck by war or disease or famine , your people can pray to you at the temple , and you will hear their prayer and save them .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	10	( B ) You can see that the armies of Ammon , Moab , and Edom are attacking us ! Those are the nations you would not let our ancestors invade on their way from Egypt , so these nations were not destroyed .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	11	Now they are coming to take back the land you gave us .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	12	Are n't you going to punish them ? We wo n't stand a chance when this army attacks . We do n't know what to do—we are begging for your help .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	13	While every man , woman , and child of Judah was standing there at the temple ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	14	the Lord 's Spirit suddenly spoke to Jahaziel , a Levite from the Asaph clan . [ d ]
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	15	( C ) Then Jahaziel said : Your Majesty and everyone from Judah and Jerusalem , the Lord says that you do n't need to be afraid or let this powerful army discourage you . God will fight on your side !
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	16	So here 's what you must do . Tomorrow the enemy armies will march through the desert around the town of Jeruel . March down and meet them at the town of Ziz as they come up the valley .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	17	( D ) You wo n't even have to fight . Just take your positions and watch the Lord rescue you from your enemy . Do n't be afraid . Just do as you 're told . And as you march out tomorrow , the Lord will be there with you .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	18	Jehoshaphat bowed low to the ground and everyone worshiped the Lord .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	19	Then some Levites from the Kohath and Korah clans stood up and shouted praises to the Lord God of Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	21	Then he explained his plan and appointed men to march in front of the army and praise the Lord for his holy power by singing : [ e ] “ Praise the Lord ! His love never ends. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	22	As soon as they began singing , the Lord confused the enemy camp ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	23	so that the Ammonite and Moabite troops attacked and completely destroyed those from Edom . Then they turned against each other and fought until the entire camp was wiped out !
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	24	When Judah 's army reached the tower that overlooked the desert , they saw that every soldier in the enemy 's army was lying dead on the ground .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	25	years . His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	26	Then on the fourth day , everyone came together in Beracah Valley and sang praises to the Lord . That 's why that place was called Praise Valley . [ h ] 27-28 Jehoshaphat led the crowd back to Jerusalem . And as they marched , they played harps and blew trumpets . They were very happy because the Lord had given them victory over their enemies , so when they reached the city , they went straight to the temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	29	When the other nations heard how the Lord had fought against Judah 's enemies , they were too afraid
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	30	to invade Judah . The Lord let Jehoshaphat 's kingdom be at peace . Jehoshaphat Dies (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	1	Kings 22.41-50 )
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	31	Jehoshaphat was
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	35	While Jehoshaphat was king , he signed a peace treaty with Ahaziah the wicked king of Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	32	Jehoshaphat obeyed the Lord , just as his father Asa had done ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	33	but he did not destroy the local shrines . [ i ] So the people still worshiped foreign gods , instead of faithfully serving the God their ancestors had worshiped .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	34	Everything else Jehoshaphat did while he was king is written in the records of Jehu son of Hanani that are included in The History of the Kings of Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	36	They agreed to build several seagoing ships [ j ] at Ezion-Geber .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	20	37	But the prophet Eliezer [ k ] warned Jehoshaphat , “ The Lord will destroy these ships because you have supported Ahaziah. ” The ships were wrecked and never sailed .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	2	King Jehoshaphat had seven sons : Jehoram , Azariah , Jehiel , Zechariah , Azariah , Michael , and Shephatiah .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	21	Jehoshaphat died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem , and his son Jehoram became king . King Jehoram of Judah (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	3	Jehoshaphat gave each of them silver and gold , as well as other valuable gifts . He also put them in charge of the fortified cities in Judah , but he had chosen his oldest son Jehoram to succeed him as king .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	4	After Jehoram had taken control of Judah , he had his brothers killed , as well as some of the nation 's leaders .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	5	He was
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	32	years old when he became king , and he ruled
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	6	Jehoram married Ahab 's daughter and followed the sinful example of Ahab 's family and the other kings of Israel . He disobeyed the Lord by doing wrong ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	7	( A ) but because the Lord had made a solemn promise to King David that someone from his family would always rule in Judah , he refused to wipe out David 's descendants .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	8	years from Jerusalem . He died , and no one even felt sad . He was buried in Jerusalem , but not in the royal tombs .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	9	Jehoram , his officers , and his cavalry marched to Edom , where the Edomite army surrounded them . He escaped during the night ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	10	but Judah was never able to regain control of Edom . Even the town of Libnah [ a ] rebelled at that time . Those things happened because Jehoram had turned away from the Lord , the God his ancestors had worshiped .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	11	Jehoram even built local shrines [ b ] in the hills of Judah and let the people sin against the Lord by worshiping foreign gods .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	12	One day , Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet that said : I have a message for you from the Lord God your ancestor David worshiped . He knows that you have not followed the example of Jehoshaphat your father or Asa your grandfather .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	13	Instead you have acted like those sinful kings of Israel and have encouraged the people of Judah to stop worshiping the Lord , just as Ahab and his descendants did . You even murdered your own brothers , who were better men than you .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	14	Because you have done these terrible things , the Lord will severely punish the people in your kingdom , including your own family , and he will destroy everything you own .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	15	You will be struck with a painful stomach disease and suffer until you die .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	16	The Lord later caused the Philistines and the Arabs who lived near the Ethiopians [ c ] to become angry with Jehoram .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	17	They invaded Judah and stole the royal property from the palace , and they led Jehoram 's wives and sons away as prisoners . The only one left behind was Ahaziah , [ d ] his youngest son .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	18	After this happened , the Lord struck Jehoram with an incurable stomach disease .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	21	19	About two years later , Jehoram died in terrible pain . No bonfire was built to honor him , even though the people had done this for his ancestors .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	2	Kings 11.1-3 )
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	22	[ a ] years old at the time , and he ruled only one year from Jerusalem . Ahaziah 's mother was Athaliah , a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	3	and she encouraged her son to sin against the Lord . He followed the evil example of King Ahab and his descendants .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	4	In fact , after his father 's death , Ahaziah sinned against the Lord by appointing some of Ahab 's relatives to be his advisors . Their advice led to his downfall .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	5	He listened to them and went with King Joram of Israel to attack King Hazael and the Syrian troops at Ramoth in Gilead . Joram was wounded in that battle ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	6	and he went to the town of Jezreel to recover . And Ahaziah later went there to visit him .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	7	It was during that visit that God had Ahaziah put to death . When Ahaziah arrived at Jezreel , he and Joram went to meet with Jehu grandson of Nimshi . The Lord had already told Jehu to kill every male in Ahab 's family ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	8	and while Jehu was doing that , he saw some of Judah 's leaders and Ahaziah 's nephews who had come with Ahaziah . Jehu killed them on the spot ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	9	then gave orders to find Ahaziah . Jehu 's officers found him hiding in Samaria . They brought Ahaziah to Jehu , who immediately put him to death . They buried Ahaziah only because they respected Jehoshaphat his grandfather , who had done his best to obey the Lord . There was no one from Ahaziah 's family left to become king of Judah . Queen Athaliah of Judah (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	10	As soon as Athaliah heard that her son King Ahaziah was dead , she decided to kill any relative who could possibly become king . She would have done just that ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	11	but Jehosheba [ b ] rescued Joash son of Ahaziah just as the others were about to be murdered . Jehosheba , who was Jehoram 's daughter and Ahaziah 's half sister , was married to Jehoiada the priest . So she was able to hide her nephew Joash and his personal servant in a bedroom in the Lord 's temple where he was safe from Athaliah .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	22	12	Joash hid in the temple with them for six years while Athaliah ruled as queen of Judah . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	2	These five men went to the towns in Judah and called together the Levites and the clan leaders . They all came to Jerusalem
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	23	After Ahaziah 's son Joash had hidden in the temple for six years , Jehoiada the priest knew that something had to be done . So he made sure he had the support of several army officers . They were Azariah son of Jeroham , Ishmael son of Jehohanan , Azariah son of Obed , Maaseiah son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat son of Zichri .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	3	( A ) and gathered at the temple , where they agreed to help Joash . Jehoiada said to them : Joash will be our next king , because long ago the Lord promised that one of David 's descendants would always be king .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	4	Here is what we will do . Three groups of priests and Levites will be on guard duty on the Sabbath—one group will guard the gates of the temple ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	5	one will guard the palace , and the other will guard Foundation Gate . The rest of you will stand guard in the temple courtyards .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	6	Only the priests and Levites who are on duty will be able to enter the temple , because they will be the only ones who have gone through the ceremony to make themselves clean and acceptable . The others must stay outside in the courtyards , just as the Lord has commanded .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	7	You Levites must protect King Joash . Do n't let him out of your sight ! And keep your swords ready to kill anyone who comes into the temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	8	The Levites and the people of Judah followed Jehoiada 's orders . The guards going off duty were not allowed to go home , and so each commander had all his guards available—those going off duty as well as those coming on duty .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	9	Jehoiada went into the temple and brought out the swords and shields that had belonged to King David , and he gave them to the commanders .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	10	They gave the weapons to the guards , and Jehoiada then made sure that the guards took their positions around the temple and the altar to protect the king on every side .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	11	Jehoiada and his sons brought Joash outside , where they placed the crown on his head and gave him a copy of the instructions for ruling the nation . Olive oil was poured on his head to show that he was now king , and the crowd cheered and shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	12	As soon as Queen Athaliah heard the crowd cheering for Joash , she went to the temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	13	There she saw Joash standing by one of the columns near the entrance , which was the usual place for the king . The commanders and the trumpet players were standing next to him , and the musicians were playing instruments and leading the people as they celebrated and blew trumpets . Athaliah tore her clothes in anger and shouted , “ You betrayed me , you traitors ! ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	14	At once , Jehoiada said to the army commanders , “ Do n't kill her near the Lord 's temple . Take her out in front of the troops , and be sure to kill all of her followers ! ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	15	She tried to escape , but the commanders caught and killed her near the gate where horses are led into the palace .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	16	Jehoiada asked King Joash and the people to join with him in being faithful to the Lord . They agreed ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	17	then rushed to the temple of the god Baal and tore it down . They smashed the altars and the idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	18	Jehoiada assigned the priests and Levites their duties at the temple , just as David had done . They were in charge of offering sacrifices to the Lord according to the Law of Moses , and they were responsible for leading the celebrations with singing .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	19	Jehoiada ordered the guards at the temple gates to keep out anyone who was unclean .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	20	Finally , Jehoiada called together the army commanders , the most important citizens of Judah , and the government officials . The crowd of people followed them as they led Joash from the temple , through the Upper Gate , and into the palace , where he took his place as king of Judah .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	23	21	Everyone celebrated because Athaliah had been killed and Jerusalem was peaceful again . Copyright ©

CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	2	While Jehoiada the priest was alive , Joash obeyed the Lord by doing right .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	24	The Syrian army was very small , but the Lord let them defeat Judah 's large army , because he was punishing Joash and the people of Judah for turning away from him . 25-26 Joash was severely wounded during the battle , and as soon as the Syrians left Judah , two of his officials , Zabad and Jehozabad , [ b ] decided to revenge the death of Zechariah . They plotted and killed Joash while he was in bed , recovering from his wounds . Joash was buried in Jerusalem , but not in the royal tombs .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	7	And now we need it to repair the temple because the sons of that evil woman Athaliah came in and wrecked it . They even used some of the sacred objects to worship the god Baal. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	40	years from Jerusalem . His mother Zibiah was from the town of Beersheba .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	3	Jehoiada even chose two women for Joash to marry so he could have a family .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	4	Some time later , Joash decided it was time to repair the temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	5	He called together the priests and Levites and said , “ Go everywhere in Judah and collect the annual tax from the people . I want this done at once—we need that money to repair the temple. ” But the Levites were in no hurry to follow the king 's orders .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	6	( A ) So he sent for Jehoiada the high priest and asked , “ Why did n't you send the Levites to collect the taxes ? The Lord 's servant Moses and the people agreed long ago that this tax would be collected and used to pay for the upkeep of the sacred tent .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	8	Joash gave orders for a wooden box to be made and had it placed outside , near the gate of the temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	9	He then sent letters everywhere in Judah and Jerusalem , asking everyone to bring their taxes to the temple , just as Moses had required their ancestors to do .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	10	The people and their leaders agreed , and they brought their money to Jerusalem and placed it in the box .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	11	Each day , after the Levites took the box into the temple , the king 's secretary and the high priest 's assistant would dump out the money and count it . Then the empty box would be taken back outside . This happened day after day , and soon a large amount of money was collected .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	12	Joash and Jehoiada turned the money over to the men who were supervising the repairs to the temple . They used the money to hire stonecutters , carpenters , and experts in working with iron and bronze .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	13	These workers went right to work repairing the temple , and when they were finished , it looked as good as new .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	14	They did not use all the tax money for the repairs , so the rest of it was handed over to Joash and Jehoiada , who then used it to make dishes and other gold and silver objects for the temple . Sacrifices to please the Lord [ a ] were offered regularly in the temple for as long as Jehoiada lived .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	15	He died at the ripe old age of
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	130	years ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	16	and he was buried in the royal tombs in Jerusalem , because he had done so much good for the people of Israel , for God , and for the temple . Joash Turns Away from the Lord
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	17	After the death of Jehoiada the priest , the leaders of Judah went to Joash and talked him into doing what they wanted .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	18	The people of Judah soon stopped worshiping in the temple of the Lord God and started worshiping idols and the symbols of the goddess Asherah . These sinful things made the Lord God angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	19	but he still sent prophets who warned them to turn back to him . The people refused to listen .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	20	( B ) God 's Spirit spoke to Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest , and Zechariah told everyone that God was saying : “ Why are you disobeying me and my laws ? This will only bring punishment ! You have deserted me , so now I will desert you. ” 21-22 King Joash forgot that Zechariah 's father had always been a loyal friend . So when the people of Judah plotted to kill Zechariah , Joash joined them and gave orders for them to stone him to death in the courtyard of the temple . As Zechariah was dying , he said , “ I pray that the Lord will see this and punish all of you. ” Joash Is Killed
CEV	2%20Chronicles	24	23	In the spring of the following year , the Syrian army invaded Judah and Jerusalem , killing all of the nation 's leaders . They collected everything of value that belonged to the people and took it back to their king in Damascus .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	7	One of God 's prophets said , “ Your Majesty , do n't let these Israelite soldiers march into battle with you . The Lord has refused to help anyone from the northern kingdom of Israel ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	8	and so he will let your enemies defeat you , even if you fight hard . He is the one who brings both victory and defeat. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	9	Amaziah replied , “ What am I supposed to do about all the silver I paid those troops ? ” “ The Lord will give you back even more than you paid , ” the prophet answered .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	10	Amaziah ordered the troops from Israel to go home , but when they left , they were furious with the people of Judah .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	11	After Amaziah got his courage back , he led his troops to Salt Valley , where he killed 10,000 Edomite soldiers in battle .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	12	He captured 10,000 more soldiers and dragged them to the top of a high cliff . Then he pushed them over the side , and they all were killed on the rocks below .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	13	Meanwhile , the Israelite troops that Amaziah had sent home , raided the towns in Judah between Samaria and Beth-Horon . They killed 3,000 people and carried off their possessions .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	16	But before the prophet finished speaking , Amaziah interrupted and said , “ You 're not one of my advisors ! Do n't say another word , or I 'll have you killed. ” The prophet stopped . But then he added , “ First you sinned and now you 've ignored my warning . It 's clear that God has decided to punish you ! ” Israel Defeats Judah (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	17	King Amaziah of Judah talked with his officials , then sent a message to King Jehoash [ c ] of Israel : “ Come out and face me in battle ! ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	18	Jehoash sent back a reply that said : Once upon a time , a small thornbush in Lebanon arranged the marriage between his son and the daughter of a large cedar tree . But a wild animal came along and trampled the small bush .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	25	19	Amaziah , you think you 're so powerful because you defeated Edom . But stay at home and do your celebrating . If you cause any trouble , both you and your kingdom of Judah will be destroyed .

He owned such a large herd of livestock in the western foothills and in the flatlands , that he had cisterns dug there to catch the rainwater .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	26	19	Uzziah , who was standing next to the incense altar at the time , was holding the incense burner , ready to offer incense to the Lord . He became very angry when he heard Azariah 's warning , and leprosy [ d ] suddenly appeared on his forehead !

CEV	2%20Chronicles	28	3	and he offered sacrifices in Hinnom Valley . Worst of all , Ahaz sacrificed his own sons , which was a disgusting custom of the nations that the Lord had forced out of Israel .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	28	8	The Israelite troops captured 200,000 women and children and took them back to their capital city of Samaria , along with a large amount of their possessions . They did these things even though the people of Judah were their own relatives . Oded the Prophet Condemns Israel
CEV	2%20Chronicles	28	9	Oded lived in Samaria and was one of the Lord 's prophets . He met Israel 's army on their way back from Judah and said to them : The Lord God of your ancestors let you defeat Judah 's army only because he was angry with them . But you should not have been so cruel !
CEV	2%20Chronicles	28	10	If you make slaves of the people of Judah and Jerusalem , you will be as guilty as they are of sinning against the Lord .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Send these prisoners back home—they are your own relatives . If you do n't , the Lord will punish you in his anger .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	28	12	About the same time , four of Israel 's leaders arrived . They were Azariah son of Johanan , Berechiah son of Meshillemoth , Jehizkiah son of Shallum , and Amasa son of Hadlai . They agreed with Oded that the Israelite troops were wrong ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	28	13	and they said : If you bring these prisoners into Samaria , that will be one more thing we 've done to sin against the Lord . And he is already angry enough with us .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	28	14	So in front of the leaders and the crowd , the troops handed over their prisoners and the property they had taken from Judah .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	3	In the first month [ a ] of the first year of Hezekiah 's rule , he unlocked the doors to the Lord 's temple and had them repaired . [ b ]
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	4	Then he called the priests and Levites to the east courtyard of the temple
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	5	and said : It 's time to purify the temple of the Lord God of our ancestors . You Levites must first go through the ceremony to make yourselves clean , then go into the temple and bring out everything that is unclean and unacceptable to the Lord .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	6	Some of our ancestors were unfaithful and disobeyed the Lord our God . Not only did they turn their backs on the Lord , but they also completely ignored his temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	7	They locked the doors , then let the lamps go out and stopped burning incense and offering sacrifices to him .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	8	The Lord became terribly angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem , and everyone was shocked and horrified at what he did to punish them . Not only were
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	9	our ancestors killed in battle , but our own children and wives were taken captive .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	10	So I have decided to renew our agreement with the Lord God of Israel . Maybe then he will stop being so angry with us .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	11	Let 's not waste any time , my friends . You are the ones who were chosen to be the Lord 's priests and to offer him sacrifices . 12-14 When Hezekiah finished talking , the following Levite leaders went to work : Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohath clan ; Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merari clan ; Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershon clan ; Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphan clan ; Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaph clan ; Jehuel and Shimei from the Heman clan ; Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthun clan .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	15	These leaders gathered together the rest of the Levites , and they all went through the ceremony to make themselves clean . Then they began to purify the temple according to the Law of the Lord , just as Hezekiah had commanded .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	16	The priests went into the temple and carried out everything that was unclean . They put these things in the courtyard , and from there , the Levites carried them outside the city to Kidron Valley .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	17	The priests and Levites began their work on the first day of the first month . [ c ] It took them one week to purify the courtyards of the temple and another week to purify the temple . So on the sixteenth day of that same month
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	18	they went back to Hezekiah and said : Your Majesty , we have finished our work . The entire temple is now pure again , and so is the altar and its utensils , as well as the table for the sacred loaves of bread and its utensils .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	19	And we have brought back all the things that King Ahaz took from the temple during the time he was unfaithful to God . We purified them and put them back in front of the altar . Worship in the Temple
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	20	At once , Hezekiah called together the officials of Jerusalem , and they went to the temple .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	21	They brought with them seven bulls , seven rams , seven lambs , and seven goats [ d ] as sacrifices to take away the sins of Hezekiah 's family and of the people of Judah , as well as to purify the temple . Hezekiah told the priests , who were descendants of Aaron , to sacrifice these animals on the altar .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	22	The priests killed the bulls , the rams , and the lambs , then splattered the blood on the altar .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	23	They took the goats to Hezekiah and the worshipers , and they laid their hands on the animals .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	24	The priests then killed the goats and splattered the blood on the altar as a sacrifice to take away the sins of everyone in Israel , because Hezekiah had commanded that these sacrifices be made for all the people of Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	26	( A ) The Levites were ready to play the instruments that had belonged to David ; the priests were ready to blow the trumpets .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	27	As soon as Hezekiah gave the signal for the sacrifices to be burned on the altar , the musicians began singing praises to the Lord and playing their instruments ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	28	and everyone worshiped the Lord . This continued until the last animal was sacrificed .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	30	Then Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to sing the songs of praise that David and Asaph the prophet had written . And so they bowed down and joyfully sang praises to the Lord .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	31	Hezekiah said to the crowd , “ Now that you are once again acceptable to the Lord , bring sacrifices and offerings to give him thanks. ” The people did this , and some of them voluntarily brought animals to be offered as sacrifices .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	32	Seventy bulls ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	100	rams , and
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	200	lambs were brought as sacrifices to please the Lord ; [ e ]

CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	600	bulls and 3,000 sheep were brought as sacrifices to ask the Lord 's blessing . [ f ]
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	34	There were not enough priests to skin all these animals , because many of the priests had not taken the time to go through the ceremony to make themselves clean . However , since all the Levites had made themselves clean , they helped the priests until the last animal was skinned .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	35	Besides all the sacrifices that were burned on the altar , the fat from the other animal sacrifices was burned , and the offerings of wine were poured over the altar . So the temple was once again used for worshiping the Lord .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	29	36	Hezekiah and the people of Judah celebrated , because God had helped them make this happen so quickly .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	30	1-4 ( A ) Passover was n't celebrated in the first month , [ a ] which was the usual time , because many of the priests were still unclean and unacceptable to serve , and because not everyone in Judah had come to Jerusalem for the festival . So Hezekiah , his officials , and the people agreed to celebrate Passover in the second month . [ b ] Hezekiah sent a message to everyone in Israel and Judah , including those in the territories of Ephraim and West Manasseh , inviting them to the temple in Jerusalem for the celebration of Passover in honor of the Lord God of Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	5	Everyone from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north was invited . This was the largest crowd of people that had ever celebrated Passover , according to the official records .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	6	Hezekiah 's messengers went everywhere in Israel and Judah with the following letter : People of Israel , now that you have survived the invasion of the Assyrian kings , [ c ] it 's time for you to turn back to the Lord God our ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob worshiped . If you do this , he will stop being angry .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	7	Do n't follow the example of your ancestors and your Israelite relatives in the north . They were unfaithful to the Lord , and he punished them horribly .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	8	Do n't be stubborn like your ancestors . Decide now to obey the Lord our God ! Come to Jerusalem and worship him in the temple that will belong to him forever . Then he will stop being angry ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	9	and the enemies that have captured your families will show pity and send them back home . The Lord God is kind and merciful , and if you turn back to him , he will no longer turn his back on you .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	10	The messengers went to every town in Ephraim and West Manasseh as far north as the territory of Zebulun , but people laughed and insulted them .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	11	Only a few people from the tribes of Asher , West Manasseh , and Zebulun were humble and went to Jerusalem .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	12	God also made everyone in Judah eager to do what Hezekiah and his officials had commanded . Passover Is Celebrated
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	13	In the second month , [ d ] a large crowd of people gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Thin Bread . [ e ]
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	14	They took all the foreign altars and incense altars in Jerusalem and threw them into Kidron Valley . 15-17 Then , on the fourteenth day of that same month , the Levites began killing the lambs for Passover , because many of the worshipers were unclean and were not allowed to kill their own lambs . Meanwhile , some of the priests and Levites felt ashamed because they had not gone through the ceremony to make themselves clean . They immediately went through that ceremony and went to the temple , where they offered sacrifices to please the Lord . [ f ] Then the priests and Levites took their positions , according to the Law of Moses , the servant of God . As the Levites killed the lambs , they handed some of the blood to the priests , who splattered it on the altar . 18-19 Most of the people that came from Ephraim , West Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun had not made themselves clean , but they ignored God 's Law and ate the Passover lambs anyway . Hezekiah found out what they had done and prayed , “ Lord God , these people are unclean according to the laws of holiness . But they are worshiping you , just as their ancestors did . So , please be kind and forgive them. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	20	The Lord answered Hezekiah 's prayer and did not punish them .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	21	The worshipers in Jerusalem were very happy and celebrated the Festival for seven days . The Levites and priests sang praises to the Lord every day and played their instruments .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	22	Hezekiah thanked the Levites for doing such a good job , leading the celebration . The worshipers celebrated for seven days by offering sacrifices , by eating the sacred meals , and by praising the Lord God of their ancestors .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	23	Everyone was so excited that they agreed to celebrate seven more days .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	24	So Hezekiah gave the people 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep to be offered as sacrifices and to be used as food for the sacred meals . His officials gave 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep , and many more priests agreed to go through the ceremony to make themselves clean .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	30	25	Everyone was very happy , including those from Judah and Israel , the priests and Levites , and the foreigners living in Judah and Israel .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	2	Hezekiah divided the priests and Levites into groups , according to their duties . Then he assigned them the responsibilities of offering sacrifices to please the Lord [ c ] and sacrifices to ask his blessing . [ d ] He also appointed people to serve at the temple and to sing praises at the temple gates .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	31	After the Festival , the people went to every town in Judah and smashed the stone images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred poles [ a ] for worshiping the goddess Asherah . They destroyed all the local shrines [ b ] and foreign altars in Judah , as well as those in the territories of Benjamin , Ephraim , and West Manasseh . Then everyone went home .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	4	( B ) He told the people of Jerusalem to bring the offerings that were to be given to the priests and Levites , so that they would have time to serve the Lord with their work .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	5	As soon as the people heard what the king wanted , they brought a tenth of everything they owned , including their best grain , wine , olive oil , honey , and other crops .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	6	The people from the other towns of Judah brought a tenth of their herds and flocks , as well as a tenth of anything they had dedicated to the Lord .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	7	The people started bringing their offerings to Jerusalem in the third month , [ e ] and the last ones arrived four months later .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	8	When Hezekiah and his officials saw these offerings , they thanked the Lord and the people .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	9	Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the large amount of offerings .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	10	The high priest at the time was Azariah , a descendant of Zadok , and he replied , “ Ever since the people have been bringing us their offerings , we have had more than enough food and supplies . The Lord has certainly blessed his people . Look at how much is left over ! ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	11	So the king gave orders for storerooms to be built in the temple , and when they were completed , 12-13 all the extra offerings were taken there . Hezekiah and Azariah then appointed Conaniah the Levite to be in charge of these storerooms . His brother Shimei was his assistant , and the following Levites worked with them : Jehiel , Azaziah , Nahath , Asahel , Jerimoth , Jozabad , Eliel , Ismachiah , Mahath , and Benaiah .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	14	Kore son of Imnah was assigned to guard the East Gate , and he was put in charge of receiving the offerings voluntarily given to God and of dividing them among the priests and Levites . 15-16 He had six assistants who were responsible for seeing that all the priests in the other towns of Judah also got their share of these offerings . They were Eden , Miniamin , Jeshua , Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah . Every priest and every Levite over

CEV	2%20Chronicles	31	19	Hezekiah also appointed other men to take food and supplies to the priests and Levites whose homes were in the pastureland around the towns of Judah . But the priests had to be descendants of Aaron , and the Levites had to be listed in the official records . 20-21 Everything Hezekiah did while he was king of Judah , including what he did for the temple in Jerusalem , was right and good .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	32	Everything else Hezekiah did while he was king , including how faithful he was to the Lord , is included in the records kept by Isaiah the prophet . These are written in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	5	Hezekiah 's workers also repaired the broken sections of the city wall . Then they built defense towers and an outer wall to help protect the one already there . The landfill on the east side of David 's City was also strengthened . He gave orders to make a large supply of weapons and shields ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	6	and he appointed army commanders over the troops . Then he gathered the troops together in the open area in front of the city gate and said to them :
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	7	Be brave and confident ! There 's no reason to be afraid of King Sennacherib and his powerful army . We are much more powerful ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	8	because the Lord our God fights on our side . The Assyrians must rely on human power alone . These words encouraged the army of Judah .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	9	When Sennacherib and his troops were camped at the town of Lachish , he sent a message to Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem . It said :
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	10	I am King Sennacherib of Assyria , and I have Jerusalem surrounded . Do you think you can survive my attack ?
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Hezekiah your king is telling you that the Lord your God will save you from me . But he is lying , and you 'll die of hunger and thirst .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Did n't Hezekiah tear down all except one of the Lord 's altars and places of worship ? [ a ] And did n't he tell you people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place ?
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	13	You 've heard what my ancestors and I have done to other nations . Were the gods of those nations able to defend their land against us ?
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	14	None of those gods kept their people safe from the kings of Assyria . Do you really think your God can do any better ?
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Do n't be fooled by Hezekiah ! No god of any nation has ever been able to stand up to Assyria . Believe me , your God can not keep you safe !
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	16	The Assyrian officials said terrible things about the Lord God and his servant Hezekiah .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	17	Sennacherib 's letter even made fun of the Lord . It said , “ The gods of other nations could not save their people from Assyria 's army , and neither will the God that Hezekiah worships. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	18	The officials said all these things in Hebrew , so that everyone listening from the city wall would understand and be terrified and surrender .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	19	The officials talked about the Lord God as if he were nothing but an ordinary god or an idol that someone had made . The Death of King Sennacherib (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	20	Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz begged the Lord for help ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	21	and he sent an angel that killed every soldier and commander in the Assyrian camp . Sennacherib returned to Assyria , completely disgraced . Then one day he went into the temple of his god where some of his sons killed him .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	22	The Lord rescued Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from Sennacherib and also protected them from other enemies .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	23	People brought offerings to Jerusalem for the Lord and expensive gifts for Hezekiah , and from that day on , every nation on earth respected Hezekiah . Hezekiah Gets Sick and Almost Dies (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	24	About this same time , Hezekiah got sick and was almost dead . He prayed , and the Lord gave him a sign that he would recover .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	25	But Hezekiah was so proud that he refused to thank the Lord for everything he had done for him . This made the Lord angry , and he punished Hezekiah and the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	26	Hezekiah and the people later felt sorry and asked the Lord to forgive them . So the Lord did not punish them as long as Hezekiah was king . Hezekiah 's Wealth (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	27	Hezekiah was very rich , and everyone respected him . He built special rooms to store the silver , the gold , the precious stones and spices , the shields , and the other valuable possessions .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	28	Storehouses were also built for his supply of grain , wine , and olive oil ; barns were built for his cattle , and pens were put up for his sheep .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	29	God made Hezekiah extremely rich , so he bought even more sheep , goats , and cattle . And he built towns where he could keep all these animals .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	30	It was Hezekiah who built a tunnel that carried the water from Gihon Spring into the city of Jerusalem . In fact , everything he did was successful !
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	31	Even when the leaders of Babylonia sent messengers to ask Hezekiah about the sign God had given him , God let Hezekiah give his own answer to test him and to see if he would remain faithful . Hezekiah Dies (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	32	33	When Hezekiah died , he was buried in the section of the royal tombs that was reserved for the most respected kings , [ b ] and everyone in Judah and Jerusalem honored him . His son Manasseh then became king . Footnotes - 32.12 worship : Hezekiah actually had torn down the places where idols were worshiped , and he had told the people to worship the Lord at the one place of worship in Jerusalem .

CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	4	In the temple , where only the Lord was supposed to be worshiped , Manasseh built altars for the worship of pagan gods
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	5	and the stars . He placed these altars in both courtyards of the temple 6-7 ( B ) and even set up a stone image of a foreign god . Manasseh practiced magic and witchcraft ; he asked fortunetellers for advice and sacrificed his own sons in Hinnom Valley . He did many other sinful things and made the Lord very angry . Years ago , God had told David and Solomon : Jerusalem is the place I prefer above all others in Israel . It belongs to me , and there in the temple I will be worshiped forever .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	8	If my people will faithfully obey all the laws and teaching I gave to my servant Moses , I will never again force them to leave the land I gave to their ancestors .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	9	But the people of Judah and Jerusalem listened to Manasseh and did even more sinful things than the nations the Lord had wiped out .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	10	The Lord tried to warn Manasseh and the people about their sins , but they ignored the warning .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	11	So he let Assyrian army commanders invade Judah and capture Manasseh . They put a hook in his nose and tied him up in chains , and they took him to Babylon .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	13	The Lord listened to Manasseh 's prayer and saw how sorry he was , and so he let him go back to Jerusalem and rule as king . Manasseh knew from then on that the Lord was God .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	14	Later , Manasseh rebuilt the eastern section of Jerusalem 's outer wall and made it taller . This section went from Gihon Valley north to Fish Gate and around the part of the city called Mount Ophel . He also assigned army officers to each of the fortified cities in Judah . [ c ]
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	15	Manasseh also removed the idols and the stone image of the foreign god from the temple , and he gathered the altars he had built near the temple and in other parts of Jerusalem . He threw all these things outside the city .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	16	Then he repaired the Lord 's altar and offered sacrifices to thank him and sacrifices to ask his blessing . [ d ] He gave orders that everyone in Judah must worship the Lord God of Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	17	The people obeyed Manasseh , but they worshiped the Lord at their own shrines .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	18	Everything else Manasseh did while he was king , including his prayer to the Lord God and the warnings from his prophets , is written in The History of the Kings of Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	33	19	Hozai [ e ] wrote a lot about Manasseh , including his prayer and God 's answer . But Hozai also recorded the evil things Manasseh did before turning back to God , as well as a list of places where Manasseh set up idols , and where he built local shrines and places to worship Asherah .

It will stay in the temple built by King Solomon son of David , where you will serve the Lord and his people Israel .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	4	( A ) Get ready to do the work that David and Solomon assigned to you , according to your clans .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	5	Divide yourselves into groups , then arrange yourselves throughout the temple so that each family of worshipers will be able to get help from one of you . [ b ]
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	6	When the people bring you their Passover lamb , you must kill it and prepare it to be sacrificed to the Lord . Make sure the people celebrate according to the instructions that the Lord gave Moses , and do n't do anything to make yourselves unclean and unacceptable .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	7	Josiah donated 30,000 sheep and goats , and 3,000 bulls from his own flocks and herds for the people to offer as sacrifices .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	8	Josiah 's officials also voluntarily gave some of their animals to the people , the priests , and the Levites as sacrifices . Hilkiah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , who were the officials in charge of the temple , gave the priests 2,600 sheep and lambs and
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	300	bulls to sacrifice during the Passover celebration .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	9	Conaniah , his two brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel , as well as Hashabiah , Jeiel , and Jozabad were leaders of the Levites , and they gave the other Levites 5,000 sheep and goats , and
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	500	bulls to offer as sacrifices .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	10	When everything was ready to celebrate Passover , the priests and the Levites stood where Josiah had told them .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	11	Then the Levites killed and skinned the Passover lambs , and they handed some of the blood to the priests , who splattered it on the altar .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	12	The Levites set aside the parts of the animal that the worshipers needed for their sacrifices to please the Lord , [ c ] just as the Law of Moses required . They also did the same thing with the bulls .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	13	( B ) They sacrificed the Passover animals on the altar and boiled the meat for the other offerings in pots , kettles , and pans . Then they quickly handed the meat to the people so they could eat it .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	14	All day long , the priests were busy offering sacrifices and burning the animals ' fat on the altar . And when everyone had finished , the Levites prepared Passover animals for themselves and for the priests .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	15	( C ) During the celebration some of the Levites prepared Passover animals for the musicians and the guards , so that the Levite musicians would not have to leave their places , which had been assigned to them according to the instructions of David , Asaph , Heman , and Jeduthun the king 's prophet . Even the guards at the temple gates did not have to leave their posts .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	16	So on that day , Passover was celebrated to honor the Lord , and sacrifices were offered on the altar to him , just as Josiah had commanded .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	17	( D ) The worshipers then celebrated the Festival of Thin Bread for the next seven days .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	18	People from Jerusalem and from towns all over Judah and Israel were there . Passover had not been observed like this since the days of Samuel the prophet . In fact , this was the greatest Passover celebration in Israel 's history !
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	19	All these things happened in the eighteenth year of Josiah 's rule in Judah . Josiah Dies in Battle (
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	20	Some time later , King Neco of Egypt led his army to the city of Carchemish on the Euphrates River . And Josiah led his troops north to meet the Egyptians in battle . [ d ]
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	21	Neco sent the following message to Josiah : I 'm not attacking you , king of Judah ! We 're not even at war . But God has told me to quickly attack my enemy . God is on my side , so if you try to stop me , he will punish you .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	22	But Josiah ignored Neco 's warning , even though it came from God ! Instead , he disguised himself and marched into battle against Neco in the valley near Megiddo .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	23	During the battle an Egyptian soldier shot Josiah with an arrow . Josiah told his servants , “ Get me out of here ! I 've been hit. ”
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	24	They carried Josiah out of his chariot , then put him in the other chariot he had there and took him back to Jerusalem , where he soon died . He was buried beside his ancestors , and everyone in Judah and Jerusalem mourned his death .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	25	Jeremiah the prophet wrote a funeral song in honor of Josiah . And since then , anyone in Judah who mourns the death of Josiah sings that song . It is included in the collection of funeral songs .
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	26	Everything else Josiah did while he was king , including how he faithfully obeyed the Lord ,
CEV	2%20Chronicles	35	27	is written in The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah .

CEV	Ezra	1	1	( A ) Years ago the Lord sent Jeremiah with a message about a promise [ a ] for the people of Israel . Then in the first year that Cyrus was king of Persia , [ b ] the Lord kept his promise by telling Cyrus to send this official message to all parts of his kingdom : 2-3 ( B ) I am King Cyrus of Persia .

CEV	Ezra	3	7	King Cyrus of Persia had said the Israelites could have cedar trees brought from Lebanon to Joppa by sea . So they sent grain , wine , and olive oil to the cities of Tyre and Sidon as payment for these trees , and they gave money to the stoneworkers and carpenters .
CEV	Ezra	3	8	During the second month [ d ] of the second year after the people had returned from Babylonia , they started rebuilding the Lord 's temple . Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , Joshua son of Jozadak , the priests , the Levites , and everyone else who had returned started working . Every Levite over
CEV	Ezra	3	20	years of age was put in charge of some part of the work .
CEV	Ezra	3	9	The Levites in charge of the whole project were Joshua and his sons and relatives and Kadmiel and his sons from the family of Hodaviah . [ e ] The family of Henadad worked along with them .
CEV	Ezra	3	10	( E ) When the builders had finished laying the foundation of the temple , the priests put on their robes and blew trumpets in honor of the Lord , while the Levites from the family of Asaph praised God with cymbals . All of them followed the instructions given years before by King David . [ f ]
CEV	Ezra	3	11	( F ) They praised the Lord and gave thanks as they took turns singing : “ The Lord is good ! His faithful love for Israel will last forever. ” Everyone started shouting and praising the Lord because work on the foundation of the temple had begun .
CEV	Ezra	3	12	( G ) Many of the older priests and Levites and the heads of families wept bitterly because they remembered seeing the first temple years before . But others were so happy that they celebrated with joyful shouts .

CEV	Ezra	4	4	Then the neighboring people began to do everything possible to frighten the Jews [ c ] and to make them stop building .
CEV	Ezra	4	2	( A ) So they went to Zerubbabel and to the family leaders and said , “ Let us help ! Ever since King Esarhaddon of Assyria [ b ] brought us here , we have worshiped your God and offered sacrifices to him. ”
CEV	Ezra	4	3	But Zerubbabel , Joshua , and the family leaders answered , “ You can not take part in building a temple for the Lord our God ! We will build it ourselves , just as King Cyrus of Persia commanded us. ”
CEV	Ezra	4	5	During the time that Cyrus was king and even until Darius [ d ] became king , they kept bribing government officials to slow down the work . Trouble Rebuilding Jerusalem [ e ]
CEV	Ezra	4	6	( B ) In the first year that Xerxes was king , [ f ] the neighboring people brought written charges against the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
CEV	Ezra	4	7	Later , Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and their advisors got together and wrote a letter to Artaxerxes when he was king of Persia . [ g ] It was written in Aramaic and had to be translated . [ h ] 8-10 [ i ] A letter was also written to Artaxerxes about Jerusalem by Governor Rehum , Secretary Shimshai , and their advisors , including the judges , the governors , the officials , and the local leaders . They were joined in writing this letter by people from Erech and Babylonia , the Elamites from Susa , [ j ] and people from other foreign nations that the great and famous Ashurbanipal [ k ] had forced to settle in Samaria and other parts of Western Province . [ l ]
CEV	Ezra	4	11	This letter said : Your Majesty King Artaxerxes , we are your servants from everywhere in Western Province , and we send you our greetings .
CEV	Ezra	4	12	You should know that the Jews who left your country have moved back to Jerusalem and are now rebuilding that rebellious city . In fact , they have almost finished rebuilding the walls and repairing the foundations .
CEV	Ezra	4	13	You should also know that if the walls are completed and the city is rebuilt , the Jews wo n't pay any kind of taxes , and there will be less money in your treasury .
CEV	Ezra	4	14	We are telling you this , because you have done so much for us , and we want everyone to respect you .
CEV	Ezra	4	15	If you look up the official records of your ancestors , you will find that Jerusalem has constantly rebelled and has led others to rebel against kings and provinces . That 's why the city was destroyed in the first place .
CEV	Ezra	4	16	If Jerusalem is rebuilt and its walls completed , you will no longer have control over Western Province .
CEV	Ezra	4	17	King Artaxerxes answered : Greetings to Governor Rehum , Secretary Shimshai , and to your advisors in Samaria and other parts of Western Province .
CEV	Ezra	4	18	After your letter was translated and read to me ,
CEV	Ezra	4	19	I had the old records checked . It is true that for years Jerusalem has rebelled and caused trouble for other kings and nations .
CEV	Ezra	4	20	And powerful kings have ruled Western Province from Jerusalem and have collected all kinds of taxes .
CEV	Ezra	4	21	I want you to command the people to stop rebuilding the city until I give further notice .
CEV	Ezra	4	22	Do this at once , so that no harm will come to the kingdom .
CEV	Ezra	4	23	As soon as this letter was read , Governor Rehum , Secretary Shimshai , and their advisors went to Jerusalem and forced everyone to stop rebuilding the city . Work on the Temple Starts Again

CEV	Ezra	5	5	But God was looking after the Jewish leaders . So the governor and his group decided not to make the people stop working on the temple until they could report to Darius and get his advice .
CEV	Ezra	5	1	( A ) Then the Lord God of Israel told the prophets Haggai and Zechariah [ a ] to speak in his name to the people of Judah and Jerusalem . And they did .
CEV	Ezra	5	2	( B ) So Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the priest urged the people to start working on the temple again , and God 's prophets encouraged them .
CEV	Ezra	5	3	Governor Tattenai of Western Province and his assistant Shethar Bozenai got together with some of their officials . Then they went to Jerusalem and said to the people , “ Who told you to rebuild this temple ?
CEV	Ezra	5	4	Give us the names of the workers ! ”
CEV	Ezra	5	6	Governor Tattenai , Shethar Bozenai , and their advisors sent a report to Darius ,
CEV	Ezra	5	7	which said : King Darius , we wish you the best !
CEV	Ezra	5	8	We went to Judah , where the temple of the great God is being built with huge stones and wooden beams set in the walls . Everyone is working hard , and the building is going up quickly .
CEV	Ezra	5	9	We asked those in charge to tell us who gave them permission to rebuild the temple .
CEV	Ezra	5	10	We also asked for the names of their leaders , so that we could write them down for you .
CEV	Ezra	5	11	They claimed to be servants of the God who rules heaven and earth . And they said they were rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago by one of Israel 's greatest kings . [ b ]
CEV	Ezra	5	12	( C ) We were told that their people had made God angry , and he let them be captured by Nebuchadnezzar , [ c ] the Babylonian king [ d ] who took them away as captives to Babylonia . Nebuchadnezzar tore down their temple , 13-15 ( D ) took its gold and silver articles , and put them in the temple of his own god in Babylon . They also said that during the first year Cyrus was king of Babylonia , [ e ] he gave orders for God 's temple to be rebuilt in Jerusalem where it had stood before . So Cyrus appointed Sheshbazzar governor of Judah and sent these gold and silver articles for him to put in the temple .
CEV	Ezra	5	16	Sheshbazzar then went to Jerusalem and laid the foundation for the temple , and the work is still going on .
CEV	Ezra	5	17	Your Majesty , please order someone to look up the old records in Babylonia and find out if King Cyrus really did give orders to rebuild God 's temple in Jerusalem .

CEV	Ezra	6	6	King Darius sent this message : Governor Tattenai of Western Province and Shethar Bozenai , you and your advisors must stay away from the temple .
CEV	Ezra	6	2	Finally , a scroll [ a ] was found in Ecbatana , the capital of Media Province , and it said : This official record will show

CEV	Ezra	6	9	And do n't fail to let the priests in Jerusalem have whatever they need each day so they can offer sacrifices to the God of heaven . Give them young bulls , rams , sheep , as well as wheat , salt , wine , and olive oil .
CEV	Ezra	6	10	I want them to be able to offer pleasing sacrifices to God and to pray for me and my family .
CEV	Ezra	6	11	If any of you do n't obey this order , a wooden beam will be taken from your house and sharpened on one end . Then it will be driven through your body , [ d ] and your house will be torn down and turned into a garbage dump .
CEV	Ezra	6	12	I ask the God who is worshiped in Jerusalem to destroy any king or nation who tries either to change what I have said or to tear down his temple . I , Darius , give these orders , and I expect them to be followed carefully . The Temple Is Dedicated
CEV	Ezra	6	13	Governor Tattenai , Shethar Bozenai , and their advisors carefully obeyed King Darius .
CEV	Ezra	6	14	( A ) With great success the Jewish leaders continued working on the temple , while Haggai and Zechariah encouraged them by their preaching . And so , the temple was completed at the command of the God of Israel and by the orders of kings Cyrus , Darius , and Artaxerxes of Persia . [ e ]
CEV	Ezra	6	15	On the third day of the month of Adar [ f ] in the sixth year of the rule of Darius , [ g ] the temple was finished .
CEV	Ezra	6	16	The people of Israel , the priests , the Levites , and everyone else who had returned from exile were happy and celebrated as they dedicated God 's temple .
CEV	Ezra	6	17	One hundred bulls , two hundred rams , and four hundred lambs were offered as sacrifices at the dedication . Also twelve goats were sacrificed as sin offerings for the twelve tribes of Israel .

CEV	Ezra	6	19	( B ) Everyone who had returned from exile celebrated Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month . [ i ]
CEV	Ezra	6	20	The priests and Levites had gone through a ceremony to make themselves acceptable to lead in worship . Then some of them killed Passover lambs for those who had returned , including the other priests and themselves .
CEV	Ezra	6	21	The sacrifices were eaten by the Israelites who had returned and by the neighboring people who had given up the sinful customs of other nations in order to worship the Lord God of Israel .
CEV	Ezra	6	22	For seven days they celebrated the Festival of Thin Bread .

CEV	Ezra	9	9	We are slaves , but you have never turned your back on us . You love us , and because of you , the kings of Persia have helped us . It 's as though you have given us new life ! You let us rebuild your temple and live safely in Judah and Jerusalem .
CEV	Ezra	9	2	Some Israelite men have married foreign women and have let their sons do the same thing . Our own officials and leaders were the first to commit this disgusting sin , and now God 's holy people are mixed with foreigners .
CEV	Ezra	9	3	This news made me so angry that I ripped my clothes and tore hair from my head and beard . Then I just sat in shock
CEV	Ezra	9	4	until the time for the evening sacrifice . Many of our people were greatly concerned and gathered around me , because the God of Israel had warned us to stay away from foreigners . Ezra 's Prayer
CEV	Ezra	9	5	At the time of the evening sacrifice , I was still sitting there in sorrow with my clothes all torn . So I got down on my knees , then lifted my arms ,
CEV	Ezra	9	6	and prayed : I am much too ashamed to face you , Lord God . Our sins and our guilt have swept over us like a flood that reaches up to the heavens .
CEV	Ezra	9	7	Since the time of our ancestors , all of us have sinned . That 's why we , our kings , and our priests have often been defeated by other kings . They have killed some of us and made slaves of others ; they have taken our possessions and made us ashamed , just as we are today .
CEV	Ezra	9	8	But for now , Lord God , you have shown great kindness to us . You made us truly happy by letting some of us settle in this sacred place and by helping us in our time of slavery .
CEV	Ezra	9	10	Our God , what can we say now ? Even after all this , we have disobeyed the commands
CEV	Ezra	9	11	that were given to us by your servants the prophets . They said the land you are giving us is full of sinful and wicked people , who never stop doing disgusting things . [ b ]
CEV	Ezra	9	12	( A ) And we were warned not to let our daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters . Your prophets also told us never to help those foreigners or even let them live in peace . You wanted us to become strong and to enjoy the good things in the land , then someday to leave it to our children forever .
CEV	Ezra	9	13	You punished us because of our terrible sins . But you did not punish us nearly as much as we deserve , and you have brought some of us back home .
CEV	Ezra	9	14	Why should we disobey your commands again by letting our sons and daughters marry these foreigners who do such disgusting things ? That would make you angry enough to destroy us all !
CEV	Ezra	9	15	Lord God of Israel , you have been more than fair by letting a few of us survive . But once again , our sins have made us ashamed to face you . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezra	10	10	Ezra the priest stood up and said : You have broken God 's Law by marrying foreign women , and you have made the whole nation guilty !
CEV	Ezra	10	2	Shecaniah son of Jehiel from the family of Elam said : Ezra , we have disobeyed God by marrying these foreign women . But there is still hope for the people of Israel ,
CEV	Ezra	10	3	if we follow your advice and the advice of others who truly respect the laws of God . We must promise God that we will divorce our foreign wives and send them away , together with their children .
CEV	Ezra	10	4	Ezra , it 's up to you to do something ! We will support whatever you do . So be brave !
CEV	Ezra	10	5	Ezra stood up and made the chief priests , the Levites , and everyone else in Israel swear that they would follow the advice of Shecaniah .
CEV	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra left God 's temple and went to spend the night in the living quarters of Jehohanan son of Eliashib . He felt sorry because of what the people had done , and he did not eat or drink a thing . 7-8 The officials and leaders sent a message to all who had returned from Babylonia and were now living in Jerusalem and Judah . This message told them to meet in Jerusalem within three days , or else they would lose everything they owned and would no longer be considered part of the people that had returned from Babylonia .
CEV	Ezra	10	9	Three days later , on the twentieth day of the ninth month , [ a ] everyone from Judah and Benjamin came to Jerusalem and sat in the temple courtyard . It was a serious meeting , and they sat there , trembling in the rain .
CEV	Ezra	10	11	Now you must confess your sins to the Lord God of your ancestors and obey him . Divorce your foreign wives and do n't have anything to do with the rest of the foreigners who live around here .
CEV	Ezra	10	12	Everyone in the crowd shouted : You 're right ! We will do what you say .
CEV	Ezra	10	13	But there are so many of us , and we ca n't just stay out here in this downpour . A lot of us have sinned by marrying foreign women , and the matter ca n't be settled in only a day or two .
CEV	Ezra	10	14	Why ca n't our officials stay on in Jerusalem and take care of this for us ? Let everyone who has sinned in this way meet here at a certain time with leaders and judges from their own towns . If we take care of this problem , God will surely stop being so terribly angry with us .
CEV	Ezra	10	15	Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah were the only ones who objected , except for the two Levites , Meshullam and Shabbethai .
CEV	Ezra	10	16	Everyone else who had returned from exile agreed with the plan . So Ezra the priest chose men [ b ] who were heads of the families , and he listed their names . They started looking into the matter on the first day of the tenth month , [ c ]

CEV	Nehemiah	1	1	I am Nehemiah son of Hacaliah , and in this book I tell what I have done . During the month of Chislev [ a ] in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes [ b ] ruled Persia , I was in his fortress city of Susa , [ c ]
CEV	Nehemiah	1	2	when my brother Hanani came with some men from Judah . So I asked them about the Jews who had escaped [ d ] from being captives in Babylonia . I also asked them about the city of Jerusalem .

CEV	Nehemiah	1	8	( A ) Please remember the promise you made to Moses . You told him that if we were unfaithful , you would scatter us among foreign nations .
CEV	Nehemiah	1	9	( B ) But you also said that no matter how far away we were , we could turn to you and start obeying your laws . Then you would bring us back to the place where you have chosen to be worshiped .
CEV	Nehemiah	1	10	Our Lord , I am praying for your servants—those you rescued by your great strength and mighty power .

CEV	Nehemiah	2	2	So the king said , “ Why do you look so sad ? You 're not sick . Something must be bothering you. ” Even though I was frightened ,
CEV	Nehemiah	2	3	( A ) I answered , “ Your Majesty , I hope you live forever ! I feel sad because the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins , and its gates have been burned down. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	2	4	The king asked , “ What do you want me to do ? ” I prayed to the God who rules from heaven .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	5	Then I told the king , “ Sir , if it 's all right with you , please send me back to Judah , so that I can rebuild the city where my ancestors are buried. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	2	6	The queen was sitting beside the king when he asked me , “ How long will it take , and when will you be back ? ” The king agreed to let me go , and I told him when I would return .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	7	Then I asked , “ Your Majesty , would you be willing to give me letters to the governors of the provinces west of the Euphrates River , so that I can travel safely to Judah ?
CEV	Nehemiah	2	8	I will need timber to rebuild the gates of the fortress near the temple and more timber to construct the city wall and to build a place for me to live . And so , I would appreciate a letter to Asaph , who is in charge of the royal forest. ” God was good to me , and the king did everything I asked .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	9	The king sent some army officers and cavalry troops along with me , and as I traveled through the Western Provinces , I gave the letters to the governors .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	10	But when Sanballat from Horon [ b ] and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about what had happened , they became very angry , because they did n't want anyone to help the people of Israel . Nehemiah Inspects the Wall of Jerusalem
CEV	Nehemiah	2	11	Three days after arriving in Jerusalem ,
CEV	Nehemiah	2	12	I got up during the night and left my house . I took some men with me , without telling anyone what I thought God wanted me to do for the city . The only animal I took was the donkey I rode on .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	13	I went through Valley Gate on the west , then south past Dragon Spring , before coming to Garbage Gate . As I rode along , I took a good look at the crumbled walls of the city and the gates that had been torn down and burned .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	14	On the east side of the city , I headed north to Fountain Gate and King 's Pool , but then the trail became too narrow for my donkey .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	15	So I went down to Kidron Valley and looked at the wall from there . Then before daylight I returned to the city through Valley Gate .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	16	None of the city officials knew what I had in mind . And I had not even told any of the Jews—not the priests , the leaders , the officials , or any other Jews who would be helping in the work .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	17	But when I got back , I said to them , “ Jerusalem is truly in a mess ! The gates have been torn down and burned , and everything is in ruins . We must rebuild the city wall so that we can again take pride in our city. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	2	18	Then I told them how kind God had been and what the king had said . Immediately , they replied , “ Let 's start building now ! ” So they got everything ready .
CEV	Nehemiah	2	19	When Sanballat , Tobiah , and Geshem the Arab heard about our plans , they started insulting us and saying , “ Just look at you ! Do you plan to rebuild the walls of the city and rebel against the king ? ”
CEV	Nehemiah	2	20	I answered , “ We are servants of the God who rules from heaven , and he will make our work succeed . So we will start rebuilding Jerusalem , but you have no right to any of its property , because you have had no part in its history. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Nehemiah	4	4	But I prayed , “ Our God , these people hate us and have wished horrible things for us . Please answer our prayers and make their insults fall on them ! Let them be the ones to be dragged away as prisoners of war .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	2	In front of his friends and the Samaritan army he said , “ What is this feeble bunch of Jews trying to do ? Are they going to rebuild the wall and offer sacrifices all in one day ? Do they think they can make something out of this pile of scorched stones ? ”
CEV	Nehemiah	4	3	Tobiah from Ammon was standing beside Sanballat and said , “ Look at the wall they are building ! Why , even a fox could knock over this pile of stones. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	4	5	Do n't forgive the mean and evil way they have insulted the builders. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	4	6	The people worked hard , and we built the walls of Jerusalem halfway up again .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	7	But Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabs , the Ammonites , and the people from the city of Ashdod saw the walls going up and the holes being repaired . So they became angry
CEV	Nehemiah	4	8	and decided to stir up trouble , and to fight against the people of Jerusalem .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	9	But we kept on praying to our God , and we also stationed guards day and night .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	10	Meanwhile , the people of Judah were singing a sorrowful song : “ So much rubble for us to haul ! Worn out and weary , will we ever finish this wall ? ”
CEV	Nehemiah	4	11	Our enemies were saying , “ Before those Jews know what has happened , we will sneak up and kill them and put an end to their work. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	4	12	On at least ten different occasions , the Jews living near our enemies warned us against attacks from every side , [ a ]
CEV	Nehemiah	4	13	and so I sent people to guard the wall at its lowest places and where there were still holes in it . I placed them according to families , and they stood guard with swords and spears and with bows and arrows .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	14	Then I looked things over and told the leaders , the officials , and the rest of the people , “ Do n't be afraid of your enemies ! The Lord is great and fearsome . So think of him and fight for your relatives and children , your wives and homes ! ”
CEV	Nehemiah	4	15	Our enemies found out that we knew about their plot against us , but God kept them from doing what they had planned . So we went back to work on the wall .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	16	From then on , I let half of the young men work while the other half stood guard . They wore armor and had spears and shields , as well as bows and arrows . The leaders helped the workers
CEV	Nehemiah	4	17	who were rebuilding the wall . Everyone who hauled building materials kept one hand free to carry a weapon .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	18	Even the workers who were rebuilding the wall strapped on a sword . The worker who was to blow the signal trumpet stayed with me .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	19	I told the people and their officials and leaders , “ Our work is so spread out , that we are a long way from one another .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	20	If you hear the sound of the trumpet , come quickly and gather around me . Our God will help us fight. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	4	21	Every day from dawn to dark , half of the workers rebuilt the walls , while the rest stood guard with their spears .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	22	I asked the men in charge and their workers to stay inside Jerusalem and stand guard at night . So they guarded the city at night and worked during the day .
CEV	Nehemiah	4	23	I even slept in my work clothes at night ; my relatives , the workers , and the guards slept in theirs as well . And we always kept our weapons close by . [ b ] Copyright ©

CEV	Nehemiah	5	5	We are Jews just as they are , and our children are as good as theirs . But we still have to sell our children as slaves , and some of our daughters have already been raped . We are completely helpless ; our fields and vineyards have even been taken from us. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	5	2	and said , “ We have large families , and it takes a lot of grain merely to keep us alive. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	5	3	Others said , “ During the famine we even had to mortgage our fields , vineyards , and homes to them in order to buy grain. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	5	4	Then others said , “ We had to borrow money from those in power to pay the government tax on our fields and vineyards .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	6	When I heard their complaints and their charges , I became very angry .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	7	( A ) So I thought it over and said to the leaders and officials , “ How can you charge your own people interest ? ” Then I called a public meeting and accused the leaders
CEV	Nehemiah	5	8	by saying , “ We have tried to buy back all of our people who were sold into exile . But here you are , selling more of them for us to buy back ! ” The officials and leaders did not say a word , because they knew this was true .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	9	I continued , “ What you have done is wrong ! We must honor our God by the way we live , so the Gentiles ca n't find fault with us .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	10	My relatives , my friends , and I are also lending money and grain , but we must no longer demand payment in return .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	11	Now give back the fields , vineyards , olive orchards , and houses you have taken and also the interest you have been paid. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	5	12	The leaders answered , “ We will do whatever you say and return their property , without asking to be repaid. ” So I made the leaders promise in front of the priests to give back the property .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	13	Then I emptied my pockets and said , “ If you do n't keep your promise , that 's what God will do to you . He will empty out everything you own , even taking away your houses. ” The people answered , “ We will keep our promise. ” Then they praised the Lord and did as they had promised . Nehemiah Is Generous
CEV	Nehemiah	5	14	I was governor of Judah from the twentieth year that Artaxerxes [ a ] was king until the thirty-second year . And during these entire twelve years , my relatives and I refused to accept the food that I was allowed .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	15	Each governor before me had been a burden to the people by making them pay for his food and wine and by demanding forty silver coins a day . Even their officials had been a burden to the people . But I respected God , and I did n't think it was right to be so hard on them .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	16	I spent all my time getting the wall rebuilt and did not buy any property . Everyone working for me did the same thing .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	17	I usually fed
CEV	Nehemiah	5	150	of our own Jewish people and their leaders , as well as foreign visitors from surrounding lands .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	18	Each day one ox , six of the best sheep , and lots of chickens were prepared . Then every ten days , a large supply of wine was brought in . I knew what a heavy burden this would have been for the people , and so I did not ask for my food allowance as governor .
CEV	Nehemiah	5	19	I pray that God will bless me for everything I have done for my people . Footnotes - 5.14 Artaxerxes : See the note at 1.1 . Copyright ©

CEV	Nehemiah	6	6	which said : A rumor is going around among the nations that you and the other Jews are rebuilding the wall and planning to rebel , because you want to be their king . And Geshem [ a ] says it 's true !
CEV	Nehemiah	6	2	Then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message , asking me to meet with them in one of the villages in Ono Valley . I knew they were planning to harm me in some way .
CEV	Nehemiah	6	3	So I sent messengers to tell them , “ My work is too important to stop now and go there . I ca n't afford to slow down the work just to visit with you. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	6	4	They invited me four times , but each time I refused to go .
CEV	Nehemiah	6	5	Finally , Sanballat sent an official to me with an unsealed letter ,
CEV	Nehemiah	6	7	You even have prophets in Jerusalem , claiming you are now the king of Judah . You know the Persian king will hear about this , so let 's get together and talk it over .
CEV	Nehemiah	6	8	I sent a message back to Sanballat , saying , “ None of this is true ! You are making it all up. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	6	9	Our enemies were trying to frighten us and to keep us from our work . But I asked God to give me strength .
CEV	Nehemiah	6	10	One day I went to visit Shemaiah . [ b ] He was n't supposed to leave his house , but he said , “ Let 's hurry to the holy place of the temple and hide there . [ c ] We will lock the temple doors , because your enemies are planning to kill you tonight. ”
CEV	Nehemiah	6	11	I answered , “ Why should someone like me have to run and hide in the temple to save my life ? I wo n't go ! ”
CEV	Nehemiah	6	12	Suddenly I realized that God had not given Shemaiah this message . But Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to trick me
CEV	Nehemiah	6	13	and to frighten me into doing something wrong , because they wanted to ruin my good name .
CEV	Nehemiah	6	14	Then I asked God to punish Tobiah and Sanballat for what they had done . I prayed that God would punish the prophet Noadiah and the other prophets who , together with her , had tried to frighten me . The Work Is Finished
CEV	Nehemiah	6	15	On the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul , [ d ] the wall was completely rebuilt . It had taken
CEV	Nehemiah	6	52	days .
CEV	Nehemiah	6	16	When our enemies in the surrounding nations learned that the work was finished , they felt helpless , because they knew that our God had helped us rebuild the wall .
CEV	Nehemiah	6	17	All this time the Jewish leaders and Tobiah had been writing letters back and forth .
CEV	Nehemiah	6	18	Many people in Judah were loyal to Tobiah for two reasons : Shecaniah son of Arah was his father-in-law , and Tobiah 's son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah . [ e ]
CEV	Nehemiah	6	19	The people would always tell me about the good things Tobiah had done , and then they would tell Tobiah everything I had said . So Tobiah kept sending letters , trying to frighten me . Footnotes - 6.6 Geshem : Hebrew “ Gashmu ” ( see verse

CEV	Nehemiah	7	2	I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem , along with Hananiah , the commander of the fortress , because Hananiah could be trusted , and he respected God more than most people did .
CEV	Nehemiah	7	3	I said to them , “ Do n't let the gates to the city be opened until the sun has been up for a while . And make sure that they are closed and barred before the guards go off duty at sunset . Choose people from Jerusalem to stand guard at different places around the wall and others to stand guard near their own houses. ” A List of Exiles Who Returned ( Ezra 2.1-70 )
CEV	Nehemiah	7	4	Although Jerusalem covered a large area , not many people lived there , and no new houses had been built . 5-6 So God gave me the idea to bring together the people , their leaders , and officials and to check the family records of those who had returned from captivity in Babylonia , after having been taken there by King Nebuchadnezzar .

They had lived in the Babylonian towns of Tel-Melah , Tel-Harsha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer . 63-64 The families of Hobaiah , Hakkoz , and Barzillai could not prove they were priests . The ancestor of the family of Barzillai had married the daughter of Barzillai from Gilead and had taken his wife 's family name . But the records of these three families could not be found , and none of them were allowed to serve as priests .
CEV	Nehemiah	7	65	( A ) In fact , the governor told them , “ You can not eat the food offered to God until he lets us know if you really are priests. ” [ e ] 66-69 There were 42,360 who returned , in addition to 7,337 servants and

CEV	Nehemiah	9	6	You alone are the Lord , Creator of the heavens and all the stars , Creator of the earth and those who live on it , Creator of the ocean and all its creatures . You are the source of life , praised by the stars that fill the heavens .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	7	( A ) You are the Lord our God , the one who chose Abram— you brought him from Ur in Babylonia and named him Abraham .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	8	( B ) Because he was faithful , you made an agreement to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites and Hittites , of the Amorites and Perizzites , and of the Jebusites and Girgashites . Now you have kept your promise , just as you always do .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	10	( D ) You knew that the King of Egypt and his officials and his nation had mistreated your people . So you worked fearsome miracles against the Egyptians and earned a reputation that still remains .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	11	( E ) You divided the deep sea , and your people walked through on dry land . But you tossed their enemies in , and they sank down like a heavy stone .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	12	( F ) Each day you led your people with a thick cloud , and at night you showed the way with a flaming fire .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	13	( G ) At Sinai you came down from heaven , and you gave your people good laws and teachings that are fair and honest .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	14	You commanded them to respect your holy Sabbath , and you instructed your servant Moses to teach them your laws .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	15	( H ) When they were hungry , you sent bread from heaven , and when they were thirsty , you let water flow from a rock . Then you commanded them to capture the land that you had solemnly promised . *

CEV	Nehemiah	9	17	( J ) But , our God , you are merciful and quick to forgive ; you are loving , kind , and very patient . So you never turned away from them—
CEV	Nehemiah	9	18	( K ) not even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and insulted you by claiming , “ This is the god who rescued us from Egypt. ”

CEV	Nehemiah	9	27	So you handed them over to their enemies , who treated them terribly . But in their sufferings , they begged you to help . From heaven you listened to their prayers and because of your great mercy , you sent leaders to rescue them .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	28	( S ) But when they were at peace , they would turn against you , and you would hand them over to their enemies . Then they would beg for help , and because you are merciful , you rescued them over and over again .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	29	( T ) You warned them to turn back and discover true life by obeying your laws . But they stubbornly refused and continued to sin .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	30	( U ) For years , you were patient , and your Spirit [ h ] warned them with messages spoken by your prophets . Still they refused to listen , and you handed them over to their enemies .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	31	But you are merciful and kind , and so you never forgot them or let them be destroyed .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	32	( V ) Our God , you are powerful , fearsome , and faithful , always true to your word . So please keep in mind the terrible sufferings of our people , kings , leaders , priests , and prophets , from the time Assyria ruled until this very day .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	33	You have always been fair when you punished us for our sins .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	34	Our kings and leaders , our priests and ancestors have never obeyed your commands or heeded your warnings .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	35	You blessed them with a kingdom and with an abundance of rich , fertile land , but they refused to worship you or turn from their evil .
CEV	Nehemiah	9	36	Now we are slaves in this fruitful land you gave to our ancestors .

CEV	Nehemiah	13	13	Finally , I appointed three men with good reputations to be in charge of what was brought there and to distribute it to the others . They were Shelemiah the priest , Zadok the teacher of the Law , and Pedaiah the Levite . Their assistant was Hanan , the son of Zaccur and the grandson of Mattaniah .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	2	( B ) This was because they had refused to give food and water to Israel and had hired Balaam [ a ] to call down a curse on them . However , our God turned the curse into a blessing .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	3	Following the reading of the Law of Moses , the people of Israel started sending away anyone who had any foreign ancestors . Nehemiah Makes Other Changes
CEV	Nehemiah	13	4	The priest Eliashib was a relative of Tobiah and had earlier been put in charge of the temple storerooms .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	5	So he let Tobiah live in one of these rooms , where all kinds of things had been stored—the grain offerings , incense , utensils for the temple , as well as the tenth of the grain , wine , and olive oil that had been given for the use of the Levites , singers , and temple guards , and the gifts for the priests .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	6	This happened in the thirty-second year that Artaxerxes [ b ] ruled Babylonia . I was away from Jerusalem at the time , because I was visiting him . Later I received permission from the king
CEV	Nehemiah	13	7	to return to Jerusalem . Only then did I find out that Eliashib had done this terrible thing of letting Tobiah have a room in the temple .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	8	It upset me so much that I threw out every bit of Tobiah 's furniture .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	9	Then I ordered the room to be cleaned and the temple utensils , the grain offerings , and the incense to be brought back into the room .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	10	( C ) I also found out that the temple singers and several other Levites had returned to work on their farms , because they had not been given their share of the harvest .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	11	I called the leaders together and angrily asked them , “ Why is the temple neglected ? ” Then I told them to start doing their jobs .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	12	( D ) After this , everyone in Judah brought a tenth of their grain , wine , and olive oil to the temple storeroom .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	14	I pray that my God will remember these good things that I have done for his temple and for those who worship there . The Sabbath
CEV	Nehemiah	13	15	( E ) I also noticed what the people of Judah were doing on the Sabbath . Not only were they trampling grapes to make wine , but they were harvesting their grain , grapes , figs , and other crops , and then loading these on donkeys to sell in Jerusalem . So I warned them not to sell food on the Sabbath .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	16	People who had moved to Jerusalem from the city of Tyre were bringing in fish and other things to sell there on the Sabbath .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	17	I got angry and said to the leaders of Judah , “ This evil you are doing is an insult to the Sabbath !
CEV	Nehemiah	13	18	Did n't God punish us and this city because our ancestors did these very same things ? And here you are , about to make God furious again by disgracing the Sabbath ! ”
CEV	Nehemiah	13	19	I ordered the gates of Jerusalem to be closed on the eve of the Sabbath [ c ] and not to be opened until after the Sabbath had ended . Then I put some of my own men in charge of the gates to make certain that nothing was brought in on the Sabbath .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	20	Once or twice some merchants spent the night outside Jerusalem with their goods .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	21	But I warned them , “ If you do this again , I 'll have you arrested. ” From then on , they did not come on the Sabbath .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	22	I ordered the Levites to make themselves holy and to guard the gates on the Sabbath , so that it would be kept holy . God is truly merciful , and I pray that he will treat me with kindness and bless me for doing this . Mixed Marriages
CEV	Nehemiah	13	23	( F ) I discovered that some Jewish men had married women from Ashdod , Ammon , and Moab .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	24	About half of their children could not speak Hebrew—they spoke only the language of Ashdod or some other foreign language .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	25	So in my anger , I called down curses on those men . I had them beaten and even pulled out the hair of some of them . Then I made them promise : In the name of God we solemnly promise not to let our sons and daughters marry foreigners .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	26	( G ) God dearly loved King Solomon of Israel and made him the greatest king on earth , but Solomon 's foreign wives led him into sin .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	27	So we will obey you and not rebel against our God by marrying foreign women .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	28	( H ) Jehoiada , the son of the high priest Eliashib , had a son who had married a daughter of Sanballat from Horon , [ d ] and I forced his son to leave .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	29	I pray that God will punish them for breaking their priestly vows and disgracing the Levi tribe .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	30	Then I made sure that the people were free from every foreign influence , and I assigned duties for the priests and Levites .
CEV	Nehemiah	13	31	I also arranged for the people to bring firewood to the altar each day and for them to bring the first part of their harvest to the temple . I pray that God will bless me for the good I have done . Copyright ©

CEV	Esther	1	1	1-2 ( A ) King Xerxes [ a ] of Persia lived in his capital city of Susa [ b ] and ruled
CEV	Esther	1	127	provinces from India to Ethiopia . [ c ]
CEV	Esther	1	3	During the third year of his rule , Xerxes gave a big dinner for all his officials and officers . The governors and leaders of the provinces were also invited , and even the commanders of the Persian and Median armies came .
CEV	Esther	1	4	For
CEV	Esther	1	180	days he showed off his wealth and spent a lot of money to impress his guests with the greatness of his kingdom .
CEV	Esther	1	5	At the end of this time , King Xerxes gave another dinner and invited everyone in the city of Susa , no matter who they were . The eating and drinking lasted seven days in the beautiful palace gardens .
CEV	Esther	1	6	The area was decorated with blue and white cotton curtains tied back with purple linen cords that ran through silver rings fastened to marble columns . Couches of gold and silver rested on pavement that had all kinds of designs made from costly bright-colored stones and marble and mother-of-pearl .
CEV	Esther	1	7	The guests drank from gold cups , and each cup had a different design . The king was generous
CEV	Esther	1	8	and said to them , “ Drink all you want ! ” Then he told his servants , “ Keep their cups full. ”
CEV	Esther	1	9	While the men were enjoying themselves , Queen Vashti gave the women a big dinner inside the royal palace .
CEV	Esther	1	10	By the seventh day , King Xerxes was feeling happy because of so much wine . And he asked his seven personal servants , Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , Abagtha , Zethar , and Carkas ,
CEV	Esther	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti to him . The king wanted her to wear her crown and let his people and his officials see how beautiful she was .
CEV	Esther	1	12	The king 's servants told Queen Vashti what he had said , but she refused to go to him , and this made him terribly angry . 13-14 The king called in the seven highest officials of Persia and Media . They were Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan . These men were very wise and understood all the laws and customs of the country , and the king always asked them what they thought about such matters .
CEV	Esther	1	15	The king said to them , “ Queen Vashti refused to come to me when I sent my servants for her . What does the law say I should do about that ? ”
CEV	Esther	1	16	Then Memucan told the king and the officials : Your Majesty , Queen Vashti has not only embarrassed you , but she has insulted your officials and everyone else in all the provinces .
CEV	Esther	1	17	The women in the kingdom will hear about this , and they will refuse to respect their husbands . They will say , “ If Queen Vashti does n't obey her husband , why should we ? ”
CEV	Esther	1	18	Before this day is over , the wives of the officials of Persia and Media will find out what Queen Vashti has done , and they will refuse to obey their husbands . They wo n't respect their husbands , and their husbands will be angry with them .
CEV	Esther	1	19	Your Majesty , if you agree , you should write for the Medes and Persians a law that can never be changed . This law would keep Queen Vashti from ever seeing you again . Then you could let someone who respects you be queen in her place .
CEV	Esther	1	20	When the women in your great kingdom hear about this new law , they will respect their husbands , no matter if they are rich or poor .
CEV	Esther	1	21	King Xerxes and his officials liked what Memucan had said ,
CEV	Esther	1	22	and he sent letters to all of his provinces . Each letter was written in the language of the province to which it was sent , and it said that husbands should be in charge of their wives and children .

CEV	Esther	2	2	Then the king 's personal servants said : Your Majesty , a search must be made to find you some beautiful young women .
CEV	Esther	2	3	You can select officers in every province to bring them to the place where you keep your wives in the capital city of Susa . Put your servant Hegai in charge of them since that is his job . He can see to it that they are given the proper beauty treatments .
CEV	Esther	2	4	Then let the young woman who pleases you most take Vashti 's place as queen . King Xerxes liked these suggestions , and he followed them .
CEV	Esther	2	5	At this time a Jew named Mordecai was living in Susa . His father was Jair , and his grandfather Shimei was the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin .

CEV	Esther	2	8	When the king ordered the search for beautiful women , many were taken to the king 's palace in Susa , and Esther was one of them . Hegai was put in charge of all the women ,
CEV	Esther	2	9	and from the first day , Esther was his favorite . He began her beauty treatments at once . He also gave her plenty of food and seven special maids from the king 's palace , and they had the best rooms .
CEV	Esther	2	10	Mordecai had warned Esther not to tell anyone that she was a Jew , and she obeyed him .
CEV	Esther	2	11	He was anxious to see how Esther was getting along and to learn what had happened to her . So each day he would walk back and forth in front of the court where the women lived .
CEV	Esther	2	12	The young women were given beauty treatments for one whole year . The first six months their skin was rubbed with olive oil and myrrh , and the last six months it was treated with perfumes and cosmetics . Then each of them spent the night alone with King Xerxes .
CEV	Esther	2	13	When a young woman went to the king , she could wear whatever clothes or jewelry she chose from the women 's living quarters .
CEV	Esther	2	14	In the evening she would go to the king , and the following morning she would go to the place where his wives stayed after being with him . There a man named Shaashgaz was in charge of the king 's wives . [ b ] Only the ones the king wanted and asked for by name could go back to the king . 15-16 Xerxes had been king for seven years when Esther 's turn came to go to him during Tebeth , [ c ] the tenth month of the year . Everyone liked Esther . The king 's personal servant Hegai was in charge of the women , and Esther trusted Hegai and asked him what she ought to take with her . [ d ]
CEV	Esther	2	17	Xerxes liked Esther more than he did any of the other young women . None of them pleased him as much as she did , and he immediately fell in love with her and crowned her queen in place of Vashti .
CEV	Esther	2	18	In honor of Esther he gave a big dinner for his leaders and officials . Then he declared a holiday [ e ] everywhere in his kingdom and gave expensive gifts . Mordecai Saves the King 's Life
CEV	Esther	2	19	When the young women were brought together again , Esther 's cousin Mordecai had become a palace official .
CEV	Esther	2	20	He had told Esther never to tell anyone that she was a Jew , and she obeyed him , just as she had always done .
CEV	Esther	2	21	Bigthana and Teresh were the two men who guarded King Xerxes ' rooms , but they got angry with the king and decided to kill him .
CEV	Esther	2	22	Mordecai found out about their plans and asked Queen Esther to tell the king what he had found out .
CEV	Esther	2	23	King Xerxes learned that Mordecai 's report was true , and he had the two men hanged . Then the king had all of this written down in his record book as he watched .

CEV	Esther	3	3	When the other officials asked Mordecai why he disobeyed the king 's command ,
CEV	Esther	3	2	and the king had given orders for his officials at the royal gate to honor Haman by kneeling down to him . All of them obeyed except Mordecai .
CEV	Esther	3	4	he said , “ Because I am a Jew. ” They spoke to him for several days about kneeling down , but he still refused to obey . Finally , they reported this to Haman , to find out if he would let Mordecai get away with it .
CEV	Esther	3	5	Haman was furious to learn that Mordecai refused to kneel down and honor him .
CEV	Esther	3	6	And when he found out that Mordecai was a Jew , he knew that killing only Mordecai was not enough . Every Jew in the whole kingdom had to be killed .
CEV	Esther	3	7	It was now the twelfth year of the rule of King Xerxes . During Nisan , [ b ] the first month of the year , Haman said , “ Find out the best time for me to do this. ” [ c ] The time chosen was Adar , [ d ] the twelfth month .
CEV	Esther	3	8	( A ) Then Haman went to the king and said : Your Majesty , there are some people who live all over your kingdom and wo n't have a thing to do with anyone else . They have customs that are different from everyone else 's , and they refuse to obey your laws . We would be better off to get rid of them !
CEV	Esther	3	9	Why not give orders for all of them to be killed ? I can promise that you will get tons of silver for your treasury .
CEV	Esther	3	10	The king handed his official ring to Haman , who hated the Jews , and the king told him ,
CEV	Esther	3	11	“ Do what you want with those people ! You can keep their money. ”
CEV	Esther	3	12	On the thirteenth day of Nisan , Haman called in the king 's secretaries and ordered them to write letters in every language used in the kingdom . The letters were written in the name of the king and sealed by using the king 's own ring . [ e ] At once they were sent to the king 's highest officials , the governors of each province , and the leaders of the different nations in the kingdom of Xerxes .
CEV	Esther	3	13	The letters were taken by messengers to every part of the kingdom , and this is what was said in the letters : On the thirteenth day of Adar , the twelfth month , all Jewish men , women , and children are to be killed . And their property is to be taken . 14-15 King Xerxes gave orders for these letters to be posted where they could be seen by everyone all over the kingdom . The king 's command was obeyed , and one of the letters was read aloud to the people in the walled city of Susa . Then the king and Haman sat down to drink together , but no one in the city [ f ] could figure out what was going on .

CEV	Esther	4	4	When Esther 's servant girls and her other servants told her what Mordecai was doing , she became very upset and sent Mordecai some clothes to wear in place of the sackcloth . But he refused to take them .
CEV	Esther	4	2	But he could go only as far as the palace gate , because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside the palace .
CEV	Esther	4	3	( A ) In every province where the king 's orders were read , the Jews cried and mourned , and they went without eating . [ a ] Many of them even put on sackcloth and sat in ashes .
CEV	Esther	4	5	Esther had a servant named Hathach , who had been given to her by the king . So she called him in and said , “ Find out what 's wrong with Mordecai and why he 's acting this way. ”
CEV	Esther	4	6	Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square in front of the palace gate ,
CEV	Esther	4	7	and Mordecai told him everything that had happened . He also told him how much money Haman had promised to add to the king 's treasury , if all the Jews were killed .
CEV	Esther	4	8	Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the orders for the murder of the Jews and told him that these had been read in Susa . He said , “ Show this to Esther and explain what it means . Ask her to go to the king and beg him to have pity on her people , the Jews ! ”
CEV	Esther	4	9	Hathach went back to Esther and told her what Mordecai had said .
CEV	Esther	4	10	She answered , “ Tell Mordecai
CEV	Esther	4	11	there is a law about going in to see the king , and all his officials and his people know about this law . Anyone who goes in to see the king without being invited by him will be put to death . The only way that anyone can be saved is for the king to hold out the gold scepter to that person . And it 's been thirty days since he has asked for me. ”
CEV	Esther	4	12	When Mordecai was told what Esther had said ,
CEV	Esther	4	13	he sent back this reply , “ Do n't think that you will escape being killed with the rest of the Jews , just because you live in the king 's palace .
CEV	Esther	4	14	If you do n't speak up now , we will somehow get help , but you and your family will be killed . It could be that you were made queen for a time like this ! ”
CEV	Esther	4	15	Esther sent a message to Mordecai , saying ,
CEV	Esther	4	16	“ Bring together all the Jews in Susa and tell them to go without eating for my sake ! Do n't eat or drink for three days and nights . My servant girls and I will do the same . Then I will go in to see the king , even if it means I must die. ”

CEV	Esther	5	2	He was happy to see Esther , and he held out the gold scepter to her . When Esther came up and touched the tip of the scepter ,
CEV	Esther	5	3	the king said , “ Esther , what brings you here ? Just ask , and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom. ”
CEV	Esther	5	4	Esther answered , “ Your Majesty , please come with Haman to a dinner I will prepare for you later today. ”
CEV	Esther	5	6	and while they were drinking wine , the king asked her , “ What can I do for you ? Just ask , and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom. ” 7-8 Esther replied , “ Your Majesty , if you really care for me and are willing to do what I want , please come again tomorrow with Haman to the dinner I will prepare for you . At that time I will answer Your Majesty 's question. ” Haman Plans To Kill Mordecai
CEV	Esther	5	9	Haman was feeling great as he left . But when he saw Mordecai at the palace gate , he noticed that Mordecai did not stand up or show him any respect . This made Haman really angry ,
CEV	Esther	5	10	but he did not say a thing . When Haman got home , he called together his friends and his wife Zeresh
CEV	Esther	5	11	and started bragging about his great wealth and all his sons . He told them the many ways that the king had honored him and how all the other officials and leaders had to respect him .
CEV	Esther	5	12	Haman added , “ That 's not all ! Besides the king himself , I 'm the only person Queen Esther invited for dinner . She has also invited the king and me to dinner tomorrow .
CEV	Esther	5	13	But none of this makes me happy , as long as I see that Jew Mordecai serving the king. ”

CEV	Esther	6	6	When Haman entered the room , the king asked him , “ What should I do for a man I want to honor ? ” Haman was sure that he was the one the king wanted to honor .
CEV	Esther	6	2	( A ) When the servant read how Mordecai had kept Bigthana and Teresh from killing the king ,
CEV	Esther	6	3	the king asked , “ What has been done to reward Mordecai for this ? ” “ Nothing , Your Majesty ! ” the king 's servants replied .
CEV	Esther	6	4	About this time , Haman came in to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows he had built . The king saw him and asked , “ Who is that man waiting in front of the throne room ? ”
CEV	Esther	6	5	The king 's servants answered , “ Your Majesty , it is Haman. ” “ Tell him to come in , ” the king commanded .
CEV	Esther	6	7	So he replied , “ Your Majesty , if you wish to honor a man ,
CEV	Esther	6	8	get someone to bring him one of your own robes and one of your own horses with a fancy headdress .

CEV	Esther	7	5	“ Who would dare to do such a thing ? ” the king asked .
CEV	Esther	7	6	Esther replied , “ That evil Haman is the one out to get us ! ” Haman was terrified , as he looked at the king and the queen .
CEV	Esther	7	8	Just as the king came back into the room , Haman got down on his knees beside Esther , who was lying on the couch . The king shouted , “ Now you 're even trying to rape my queen here in my own palace ! ” As soon as the king said this , his servants covered Haman 's head .

CEV	Esther	8	7	King Xerxes then said to Esther and Mordecai , “ I have already ordered Haman to be hanged and his house given to Esther , because of his evil plans to kill the Jews .
CEV	Esther	8	9	On the twenty-third day of Sivan , [ a ] the third month , the king 's secretaries wrote the law . They obeyed Mordecai and wrote to the Jews , the rulers , the governors , and the officials of all
CEV	Esther	8	127	provinces from India to Ethiopia . [ b ] The letters were written in every language used in the kingdom , including the Jewish language .
CEV	Esther	8	10	They were written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with his ring . Then they were taken by messengers who rode the king 's finest and fastest horses . 11-13 In these letters the king said : On the thirteenth day of Adar , [ c ] the twelfth month , the Jews in every city and province will be allowed to get together and defend themselves . They may destroy any army that attacks them , and they may kill all of their enemies , including women and children . They may also take everything that belongs to their enemies . A copy of this law is to be posted in every province and read by everyone . 14-15 Then the king ordered his messengers to take their fastest horses and deliver the law as quickly as possible to every province . When Mordecai left , he was wearing clothes fit for a king . He wore blue and white robes , a large gold crown , and a cape made of fine linen and purple cloth . After the law was announced in Susa , everyone shouted and cheered ,
CEV	Esther	8	16	and the Jews were no longer afraid . In fact , they were very happy and felt that they had won a victory .
CEV	Esther	8	17	In every province and city where the law was sent , the Jews had parties and celebrated . Many of the people in the provinces accepted the Jewish religion , because they were now afraid of the Jews . Copyright ©

CEV	Esther	9	9	The first law that the king had made was to be followed on the thirteenth day of Adar , [ a ] the twelfth month . This was the very day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to do away with them . But the Jews turned things around ,
CEV	Esther	9	2	and in the cities of every province they came together to attack their enemies . Everyone was afraid of the Jews , and no one could do anything to oppose them .
CEV	Esther	9	3	The leaders of the provinces , the rulers , the governors , and the court officials were afraid of Mordecai and took sides with the Jews .
CEV	Esther	9	4	Everyone in the provinces knew that the king had promoted him and had given him a lot of power .
CEV	Esther	9	5	The Jews took their swords and did away with their enemies , without showing any mercy . 6-10 They killed
CEV	Esther	9	500	people in Susa , [ b ] but they did not take anything that belonged to the ones they killed . Haman had been one of the worst enemies of the Jews , and ten of his sons were among those who were killed . Their names were Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha , Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha , Parmashta , Arisai , Aridai , and Vaizatha .
CEV	Esther	9	11	Later that day , someone told the king how many people had been killed in Susa . [ c ]
CEV	Esther	9	12	Then he told Esther , “ Five hundred people , including Haman 's ten sons , have been killed in Susa alone . If that many were killed here , what must have happened in the provinces ? Is there anything else you want done ? Just tell me , and it will be done. ”
CEV	Esther	9	13	Esther answered , “ Your Majesty , please let the Jews in Susa fight to defend themselves tomorrow , just as they did today . And order the bodies of Haman 's ten sons to be hanged in public. ”
CEV	Esther	9	14	King Xerxes did what Esther had requested , and the bodies of Haman 's sons were hung in Susa .
CEV	Esther	9	15	Then on the fourteenth day of Adar the Jews of the city got together and killed
CEV	Esther	9	300	more people . But they still did not take anything that belonged to their enemies . 16-17 On the thirteenth day of Adar , the Jews in the provinces had come together to defend themselves . They killed 75,000 of their enemies , but the Jews did not take anything that belonged to the ones they killed . Then on the fourteenth day of the month the Jews celebrated with a feast .
CEV	Esther	9	18	( A ) On the fifteenth day of the month the Jews in Susa held a holiday and celebrated , after killing their enemies on the thirteenth and the fourteenth .
CEV	Esther	9	19	This is why the Jews in the villages now celebrate on the fourteenth day of the month . It is a joyful holiday that they celebrate by feasting and sending gifts of food to each other . The Festival of Purim
CEV	Esther	9	20	Mordecai wrote down everything that had happened . Then he sent letters to the Jews everywhere in the provinces
CEV	Esther	9	21	and told them : Each year you must celebrate on both the fourteenth and the fifteenth of Adar ,
CEV	Esther	9	22	the days when we Jews defeated our enemies . Remember this month as a time when our sorrow was turned to joy , and celebration took the place of crying . Celebrate by having parties and by giving to the poor and by sharing gifts of food with each other .
CEV	Esther	9	23	They followed Mordecai 's instructions and set aside these two days every year as a time of celebration . The Reason for the Festival of Purim
CEV	Esther	9	24	( B ) Haman was the son of Hammedatha and a descendant of Agag . He hated the Jews so much that he planned to destroy them , but he wanted to find out the best time to do it . So he cast lots . [ d ]
CEV	Esther	9	25	Esther went to King Xerxes and asked him to save her people . Then the king gave written orders for Haman and his sons to be punished in the same terrible way that Haman had in mind for the Jews . So they were hanged .
CEV	Esther	9	26	Mordecai 's letter had said that the Jews must celebrate for two days because of what had happened to them . This time of celebration is called Purim , [ e ] which is the Hebrew word for the lots that were cast .
CEV	Esther	9	27	Now every year the Jews set aside these two days for having parties and celebrating , just as they were told to do .
CEV	Esther	9	28	From now on , all Jewish families must remember to celebrate Purim on these two days each year .
CEV	Esther	9	29	Queen Esther , daughter of Abihail , wanted to give full authority to Mordecai 's letter about the Festival of Purim , and with his help she wrote a letter about the feast .
CEV	Esther	9	30	Copies of this letter were sent to Jews in the
CEV	Esther	9	127	provinces of King Xerxes . In the letter they said : We pray that all of you will live in peace and safety .
CEV	Esther	9	31	You and your descendants must always remember to celebrate Purim at the time and in the way that we have said . You must also follow the instructions that we have given you about mourning and going without eating . [ f ]
CEV	Esther	9	32	These laws about Purim are written by the authority of Queen Esther .

CEV	Job	1	1	Many years ago , a man named Job lived in the land of Uz . [ a ] He was a truly good person , who respected God and refused to do evil .
CEV	Job	1	2	Job had
CEV	Job	1	7	the Lord asked , “ Satan , where have you been ? ” Satan replied , “ I have been going all over the earth. ”
CEV	Job	1	3	He owned 7,000 sheep , 3,000 camels ,
CEV	Job	1	500	donkeys , and a large number of servants . He was the richest person in the East .
CEV	Job	1	4	Job 's sons took turns having feasts in their homes , and they always invited their three sisters to join in the eating and drinking .
CEV	Job	1	5	After each feast , Job would send for his children and perform a ceremony , as a way of asking God to forgive them of any wrongs they may have done . He would get up early the next morning and offer a sacrifice for each of them , just in case they had sinned or silently cursed God . Angels , the Lord , and Satan
CEV	Job	1	6	( A ) One day , when the angels [ b ] had gathered around the Lord , and Satan [ c ] was there with them ,
CEV	Job	1	8	Then the Lord asked , “ What do you think of my servant Job ? No one on earth is like him—he is a truly good person , who respects me and refuses to do evil. ”
CEV	Job	1	9	( B ) “ Why should n't he respect you ? ” Satan remarked .
CEV	Job	1	10	“ You are like a wall protecting not only him , but his entire family and all his property . You make him successful in whatever he does , and his flocks and herds are everywhere .
CEV	Job	1	11	Try taking away everything he owns , and he will curse you to your face. ”
CEV	Job	1	12	The Lord replied , “ All right , Satan , do what you want with anything that belongs to him , but do n't harm Job. ” Then Satan left . Job Loses Everything
CEV	Job	1	13	Job 's sons and daughters were having a feast in the home of his oldest son ,
CEV	Job	1	14	when someone rushed up to Job and said , “ While your servants were plowing with your oxen , and your donkeys were nearby eating grass ,
CEV	Job	1	15	a gang of Sabeans [ d ] attacked and stole the oxen and donkeys ! Your other servants were killed , and I am the only one who escaped to tell you. ”
CEV	Job	1	16	That servant was still speaking , when a second one came running and said , “ God sent down a fire that killed your sheep and your servants . I am the only one who escaped to tell you. ”
CEV	Job	1	17	Before that servant finished speaking , a third one raced up and said , “ Three gangs of Chaldeans [ e ] attacked and stole your camels ! All of your other servants were killed , and I am the only one who escaped to tell you. ”
CEV	Job	1	18	That servant was still speaking , when a fourth one dashed up and said , “ Your children were having a feast and drinking wine at the home of your oldest son ,
CEV	Job	1	19	when suddenly a windstorm from the desert blew the house down , crushing all of your children . I am the only one who escaped to tell you. ”
CEV	Job	1	20	When Job heard this , he tore his clothes and shaved his head because of his great sorrow . He knelt on the ground , then worshiped God
CEV	Job	1	21	( C ) and said : “ We bring nothing at birth ; we take nothing with us at death . The Lord alone gives and takes . Praise the name of the Lord ! ”
CEV	Job	1	22	In spite of everything , Job did not sin or accuse God of doing wrong . Footnotes - 1.1 Uz : The exact location of this place is unknown , though it was possibly somewhere in northwest Arabia . - 1.6 angels : See the note at 15.8 . - 1.6 Satan : Hebrew “ the accuser. ” - 1.15 Sabeans : Perhaps the people of Sheba in what is now southwest Arabia ( see Isaiah 60.6 ) . - 1.17 Chaldeans : People from the region of Babylonia , northeast of Palestine .

CEV	Job	2	2	and the Lord asked , “ Satan , where have you been ? ” Satan replied , “ I have been going all over the earth. ”
CEV	Job	2	3	Then the Lord asked , “ What do you think of my servant Job ? No one on earth is like him—he is a truly good person , who respects me and refuses to do evil . And he has n't changed , even though you persuaded me to destroy him for no reason. ”
CEV	Job	2	4	Satan answered , “ There 's no pain like your own . [ c ] People will do anything to stay alive .
CEV	Job	2	5	Try striking Job 's own body with pain , and he will curse you to your face. ”
CEV	Job	2	6	“ All right ! ” the Lord replied . “ Make Job suffer as much as you want , but just do n't kill him. ”
CEV	Job	2	7	Satan left and caused painful sores to break out all over Job 's body—from head to toe .
CEV	Job	2	8	Then Job sat on the ash-heap to show his sorrow . And while he was scraping his sores with a broken piece of pottery ,
CEV	Job	2	9	his wife asked , “ Why do you still trust God ? Why do n't you curse him and die ? ”
CEV	Job	2	10	Job replied , “ Do n't talk like a fool ! If we accept blessings from God , we must accept trouble as well. ” In all that happened , Job never once said anything against God . Job 's Three Friends
CEV	Job	2	11	Eliphaz from Teman , Bildad from Shuah , and Zophar from Naamah [ d ] were three of Job 's friends , and they heard about his troubles . So they agreed to visit Job and comfort him .
CEV	Job	2	12	When they came near enough to see Job , they could hardly recognize him . And in their great sorrow , they tore their clothes , then sprinkled dust on their heads and cried bitterly .
CEV	Job	2	13	For seven days and nights , they sat silently on the ground beside him , because they realized what terrible pain he was in . Footnotes - 2.1 angels : See the note at 15.8 . - 2.1 Satan : See the note at 1.6 . - 2.4 There 's no pain like your own : The Hebrew text has “ Skin for skin , ” which was probably a popular saying . - 2.11 Teman … Shuah … Naamah : Teman was a place in northern Edom ; Shuah may have been a town on the Euphrates River or else further south , near the towns of Dedan and Sheba ; Naamah may have been located on the road between Beirut and Damascus , though its exact location is unknown .

Footnotes - 3.8 those with magic powers : The Hebrew text has “ those who can place a curse on the day and rouse up Leviathan , ” which was some kind of sea monster . God 's victory over this monster sometimes stood for God 's power over all creation and sometimes for his defeat of his enemies ( see Isaiah 27.1 ) . In Job 41.1 , Leviathan is either a sea monster or a crocodile with almost supernatural powers . - 3.12 Why was I accepted : The Hebrew text has “ Why were there knees to receive me , ” which may refer either to Job 's mother or to his father , who would have placed Job on his knees to show that he had accepted him as his child .

CEV	Job	4	12	A secret was told to me in a faint whisper—
CEV	Job	4	13	( A ) I was overcome by sleep , but disturbed by dreams ;
CEV	Job	4	14	I trembled with fear ,
CEV	Job	4	15	and my hair stood on end , as a wind blew past my face .
CEV	Job	4	16	It stopped and stood still . Then a form appeared— a shapeless form . And from the silence , I heard a voice say ,
CEV	Job	4	17	“ No humans are innocent in the eyes of God their Creator .
CEV	Job	4	18	He finds fault with his servants and even with his angels .
CEV	Job	4	19	Humans are formed from clay and are fragile as moths , so what chance do you have ?

CEV	Job	9	16	And if God came into court when I called him , he would not hear my case .
CEV	Job	9	17	He would strike me with a storm [ c ] and increase my injuries for no reason at all .

CEV	Job	9	21	I am not guilty , but I no longer care what happens to me .
CEV	Job	9	22	What difference does it make ? God destroys the innocent along with the guilty .

CEV	Job	9	27	Sometimes I try to be cheerful and to stop complaining ,

CEV	Job	9	30	Even if I washed myself with the strongest soap ,
CEV	Job	9	31	God would throw me into a pit of stinking slime , leaving me disgusting to my clothes .

CEV	Job	20	20	Greedy people want everything and are never satisfied . [ b ]
CEV	Job	20	2	Your words are disturbing ; now I must speak .
CEV	Job	20	3	You have accused and insulted me , and reason requires a reply .
CEV	Job	20	4	Since the time of creation , everyone has known
CEV	Job	20	5	that sinful people are happy for only a while .
CEV	Job	20	6	Though their pride and power may reach to the sky ,
CEV	Job	20	7	they will disappear like dust , and those who knew them will wonder what happened .
CEV	Job	20	8	( A ) They will be forgotten like a dream
CEV	Job	20	9	and vanish from the sight of family and friends .
CEV	Job	20	10	Their children will have to repay what the parents took from the poor .
CEV	Job	20	11	Indeed , the wicked will die and go to their graves in the prime of life . Sinners Love the Taste of Sin
CEV	Job	20	12	Sinners love the taste of sin ; they relish every bite
CEV	Job	20	13	and swallow it slowly .
CEV	Job	20	14	But their food will turn sour and poison their stomachs .
CEV	Job	20	15	Then God will make them lose the wealth they gobbled up .
CEV	Job	20	16	They will die from the fangs of poisonous snakes
CEV	Job	20	17	and never enjoy rivers flowing with milk and honey .
CEV	Job	20	18	Their hard work will result in nothing gained ,
CEV	Job	20	19	because they cheated the poor and took their homes .
CEV	Job	20	21	But when nothing remains for them to grab , they will be nothing .
CEV	Job	20	22	Once they have everything , distress and despair will strike them down ,
CEV	Job	20	23	and God will make them swallow his blazing anger . [ c ]
CEV	Job	20	24	( B ) While running from iron spears , they will be killed by arrows of bronze ,
CEV	Job	20	25	whose shining tips go straight through their bodies . They will be trapped by terror ,
CEV	Job	20	26	and what they treasure most will be lost in the dark . God will send flames to destroy them in their tents with all their property .
CEV	Job	20	27	The heavens and the earth will testify against them ,
CEV	Job	20	28	and all their possessions will be dragged off when God becomes angry .

CEV	Job	21	2	If you want to offer comfort , then listen to me .
CEV	Job	21	3	And when I have finished , you can start your insults all over again .
CEV	Job	21	4	My complaint is against God ; that 's why I am impatient .
CEV	Job	21	5	Just looking at me is enough to make you sick ,
CEV	Job	21	6	and the very thought of myself fills me with disgust .
CEV	Job	21	7	Why do evil people live so long and gain such power ?
CEV	Job	21	8	. Copyright ©
CEV	Job	21	9	They have no worries at home , and God never punishes them .
CEV	Job	21	10	Their cattle have lots of calves without ever losing one ;

CEV	Job	21	12	These people sing and celebrate to the sound of tambourines , small harps , and flutes ,
CEV	Job	21	13	and they are successful , without a worry , until the day they die . Leave Us Alone !
CEV	Job	21	14	Those who are evil say to God All-Powerful , “ Leave us alone ! Do n't bother us with your teachings .
CEV	Job	21	15	What do we gain from praying and worshiping you ?
CEV	Job	21	16	We succeeded all on our own. ” And so , I keep away from them and their evil schemes .
CEV	Job	21	17	How often does God become angry and send disaster and darkness to punish sinners ?
CEV	Job	21	18	How often does he strike them like a windstorm that scatters straw ?
CEV	Job	21	19	You say , “ God will punish those sinners ' children in place of those sinners. ” But I say , “ Let him punish those sinners themselves until they really feel it .
CEV	Job	21	20	Let God All-Powerful force them to drink their own destruction from the cup of his anger .
CEV	Job	21	22	Who can tell God what to do ? He judges powerful rulers . *
CEV	Job	21	23	Some of us die prosperous ,
CEV	Job	21	24	enjoying good health ,
CEV	Job	21	25	while others die in poverty , having known only pain .
CEV	Job	21	26	But we all end up dead , beneath a blanket of worms .
CEV	Job	21	27	My friends , I know that you are plotting against me .
CEV	Job	21	28	You ask , “ Where is the home of that important person who does so much evil ? ”
CEV	Job	21	29	Everyone , near and far , agrees
CEV	Job	21	30	that those who do wrong never suffer disaster , when God becomes angry .
CEV	Job	21	31	No one points out their sin or punishes them .
CEV	Job	21	32	Then at their funerals , they are highly praised ;
CEV	Job	21	33	the earth welcomes them home , while crowds mourn .

CEV	Job	22	22	Listen to his teachings and take them to heart .
CEV	Job	22	2	( A ) What use are we humans to God , even the wisest of us ?
CEV	Job	22	3	If you were completely sinless , that would still mean nothing to God All-Powerful .
CEV	Job	22	4	Is he correcting you for worshiping him ?
CEV	Job	22	5	No ! It 's because of your terrible and endless sins .
CEV	Job	22	6	To guarantee payment of a debt , you have taken clothes from innocent people .
CEV	Job	22	7	And you refused bread and water to the hungry and thirsty ,
CEV	Job	22	8	although you were rich , respected , and powerful .
CEV	Job	22	9	You have turned away widows and have broken the arms of orphans .
CEV	Job	22	10	That 's why you were suddenly trapped by terror ,
CEV	Job	22	11	blinded by darkness , and drowned in a flood . God Lives in the Heavens
CEV	Job	22	12	God lives in the heavens above the highest stars , where he sees everything .
CEV	Job	22	13	Do you think the deep darkness hides you from God ?
CEV	Job	22	14	Do thick clouds cover his eyes , as he walks around heaven 's dome high above the earth ?
CEV	Job	22	15	Give up those ancient ideas believed by sinners ,
CEV	Job	22	16	who were swept away without warning .
CEV	Job	22	17	They rejected God All-Powerful , feeling he was helpless ,
CEV	Job	22	18	although he had been kind to their families . The beliefs of these sinners are truly disgusting .
CEV	Job	22	19	When God 's people see the godless swept away , they celebrate ,
CEV	Job	22	20	saying , “ Our enemies are gone , and fire has destroyed their possessions. ” Surrender to God All-Powerful
CEV	Job	22	21	Surrender to God All-Powerful ! You will find peace and prosperity .
CEV	Job	22	23	If you return to God and turn from sin , all will go well for you .
CEV	Job	22	24	So get rid of your finest gold , as though it were sand .
CEV	Job	22	25	Let God All-Powerful be your silver and gold ,
CEV	Job	22	26	and you will find happiness by worshiping him .
CEV	Job	22	27	God will answer your prayers , and you will keep the promises you made to him .
CEV	Job	22	28	He will do whatever you ask , and life will be bright .

CEV	Job	23	23	Job said :
CEV	Job	23	2	Today I complain bitterly , because God has been cruel and made me suffer .
CEV	Job	23	3	If I knew where to find God , I would go there
CEV	Job	23	4	and argue my case .
CEV	Job	23	5	Then I would discover what he wanted to say .
CEV	Job	23	6	Would he overwhelm me with his greatness ? No ! He would listen
CEV	Job	23	7	because I am innocent , and he would say , “ I now set you free ! ”
CEV	Job	23	8	I can not find God anywhere— in front or back of me ,
CEV	Job	23	9	to my left or my right . God is always at work , though I never see him .
CEV	Job	23	10	But he knows what I am doing , and when he tests me , I will be pure as gold . *
CEV	Job	23	11	I have never refused to follow any of his commands ,

CEV	Job	24	24	Great for a while ; gone forever ! Sinners are mowed down like weeds , then they wither and die .
CEV	Job	24	2	Sinners remove boundary markers and take care of sheep they have stolen .
CEV	Job	24	3	They cheat orphans and widows by taking their donkeys and oxen .
CEV	Job	24	4	The poor are trampled and forced to hide
CEV	Job	24	5	in the desert , where they and their children must live like wild donkeys and search for food .
CEV	Job	24	6	If they want grain or grapes , [ a ] they must go to the property of these sinners .
CEV	Job	24	7	They sleep naked in the cold , because they have no cover ,
CEV	Job	24	8	and during a storm their only shelters are caves among the rocky cliffs .
CEV	Job	24	9	Children whose fathers have died are taken from their mothers as payment for a debt .
CEV	Job	24	10	Then they are forced to work naked in the grain fields because they have no clothes , and they go hungry .
CEV	Job	24	11	They crush olives to make oil and grapes to make wine— but still they go thirsty .
CEV	Job	24	12	And along the city streets , the wounded and dying cry out , yet God does nothing . Some Reject the Light
CEV	Job	24	13	Some rebel and refuse to follow the light .
CEV	Job	24	14	Soon after sunset they murder the poor and the needy , and at night they steal .
CEV	Job	24	15	Others wait for the dark , thinking they wo n't be seen if they sleep with the wife or husband of someone else .
CEV	Job	24	16	Robbers hide during the day , then break in after dark because they reject the light .
CEV	Job	24	17	They prefer night to day , since the terrors of the night are their friends . Sinners Are Filthy Foam
CEV	Job	24	18	Those sinners are filthy foam on the surface of the water . And so , their fields and vineyards will fall under a curse and wo n't produce .
CEV	Job	24	19	Just as the heat of summer swallows the snow , the world of the dead swallows those who sin .
CEV	Job	24	20	Forgotten here on earth , and with their power broken , they taste sweet to worms .
CEV	Job	24	21	Sinners take advantage of widows and other helpless women . [ b ]
CEV	Job	24	22	But God 's mighty strength destroys those in power . Even if they seem successful , they are doomed to fail .

CEV	Job	26	4	How can anyone possibly speak with such understanding ?
CEV	Job	26	5	Remember the terrible trembling of those in the world of the dead below the mighty ocean .
CEV	Job	26	6	Nothing in that land of death and destruction is hidden from God ,
CEV	Job	26	7	who hung the northern sky and suspended the earth on empty space .
CEV	Job	26	8	God stores water in clouds , but they do n't burst ,
CEV	Job	26	9	and he wraps them around the face of the moon .
CEV	Job	26	10	On the surface of the ocean , God has drawn a boundary line between light and darkness .
CEV	Job	26	11	And columns supporting the sky tremble at his command .
CEV	Job	26	12	By his power and wisdom , God conquered the force of the mighty ocean . [ a ]
CEV	Job	26	13	The heavens became bright when he breathed , and the escaping sea monster [ b ] died at his hands .
CEV	Job	26	14	These things are merely a whisper of God 's power at work . How little we would understand if this whisper ever turned into thunder ! Footnotes - 26.12 the force of the mighty ocean : The Hebrew text has “ the ocean … Rahab. ” In this passage the sea monster Rahab stands for the fearsome power of the ocean ( see the notes at 3.8 and 9.13 ) . - 26.13 sea monster : The Hebrew text has “ snake , ” which probably stands for some kind of fearsome sea monster , such as Leviathan ( see Isaiah 27.1 ) .

CEV	Job	27	4	I will tell only the truth .
CEV	Job	27	5	Until the day I die , I will refuse to do wrong by saying you are right ,

CEV	Job	27	9	without listening when they beg for mercy .

CEV	Job	27	13	Here is how God All-Powerful treats those who are wicked and brutal .
CEV	Job	27	14	They may have many children , but most of them will go hungry or suffer a violent death .
CEV	Job	27	15	Others will die of disease , and their widows wo n't be able to weep .
CEV	Job	27	16	The wicked may collect riches and clothes in abundance as easily as clay .
CEV	Job	27	17	But God 's people will wear clothes taken from them and divide up their riches .
CEV	Job	27	18	No homes built by the wicked will outlast a cocoon or a shack .
CEV	Job	27	19	Those sinners may go to bed rich , but they will wake up poor . [ a ]
CEV	Job	27	20	Terror will strike at night like a flood or a storm .
CEV	Job	27	21	Then a scorching wind will sweep them away

CEV	Job	32	11	I eagerly listened to each of your arguments ,
CEV	Job	32	12	but not one of you proved Job to be wrong .
CEV	Job	32	13	You should n't say , “ We know what 's right ! Let God punish him. ”
CEV	Job	32	14	Job has n't spoken against me , and so I wo n't answer him with your arguments .
CEV	Job	32	15	All of you are shocked ; you do n't know what to say .
CEV	Job	32	16	But am I to remain silent , just because you have stopped speaking ?

CEV	Job	33	13	So why do you challenge God to answer you ? [ b ]
CEV	Job	33	14	God speaks in different ways , and we do n't always recognize his voice . *
CEV	Job	33	15	( B ) Sometimes in the night , he uses terrifying dreams
CEV	Job	33	16	to give us warnings .
CEV	Job	33	17	God does this to make us turn from sin and pride

CEV	Job	33	22	We feel death and the grave taking us in their grip .
CEV	Job	33	23	One of a thousand angels then comes to our rescue by saying we are innocent .
CEV	Job	33	24	The angel shows kindness , commanding death to release us , because the price was paid .
CEV	Job	33	25	Our health is restored , we feel young again ,
CEV	Job	33	26	and we ask God to accept us . Then we joyfully worship God , and we are rewarded because we are innocent .
CEV	Job	33	27	When that happens , we tell everyone , “ I sinned and did wrong , but God forgave me
CEV	Job	33	28	and rescued me from death ! Now I will see the light. ”
CEV	Job	33	29	God gives each of us chance after chance
CEV	Job	33	30	to be saved from death and brought into the light that gives life .
CEV	Job	33	31	So , Job , pay attention and do n't interrupt ,
CEV	Job	33	32	though I would gladly listen to anything you say that proves you are right .

CEV	Job	34	7	But to tell the truth , Job is shameless !

CEV	Job	34	26	And while others look on , he punishes them because they were evil
CEV	Job	34	27	and refused to obey him .
CEV	Job	34	28	The persons they mistreated had prayed for help , until God answered their prayers .
CEV	Job	34	29	When God does nothing , can any person or nation find fault with him ?
CEV	Job	34	30	But still , he punishes rulers who abuse their people . [ a ]
CEV	Job	34	31	Job , you should tell God that you are guilty and promise to do better .
CEV	Job	34	32	Then ask him to point out what you did wrong , so you wo n't do it again .
CEV	Job	34	33	Do you make the rules , or does God ? You have to decide— I ca n't do it for you ; now make up your mind .

CEV	Psalms	78	78	Contemporary English Version ( A special psalm by Asaph . ) What God Has Done for His People
CEV	Psalms	78	1	My friends , I beg you to listen as I teach .
CEV	Psalms	78	2	( A ) I will give instruction and explain the mystery of what happened long ago .
CEV	Psalms	78	3	These are things we learned from our ancestors ,
CEV	Psalms	78	4	and we will tell them to the next generation . We wo n't keep secret the glorious deeds and the mighty miracles of the Lord .
CEV	Psalms	78	5	God gave his Law to Jacob 's descendants , the people of Israel . And he told our ancestors to teach their children ,
CEV	Psalms	78	6	so that each new generation would know his Law and tell it to the next .
CEV	Psalms	78	7	Then they would trust God and obey his teachings , without forgetting anything God had done .
CEV	Psalms	78	8	They would be different from their ancestors , who were stubborn , rebellious , and unfaithful to God .
CEV	Psalms	78	9	The warriors from Ephraim were armed with arrows , but they ran away when the battle began .
CEV	Psalms	78	10	They broke their agreement with God , and they turned their backs on his teaching .
CEV	Psalms	78	11	They forgot all he had done , even the mighty miracles
CEV	Psalms	78	12	( B ) ( C ) he did for their ancestors near Zoan [ a ] in Egypt .
CEV	Psalms	78	13	( D ) God made a path in the sea and piled up the water as he led them across .
CEV	Psalms	78	14	( E ) He guided them during the day with a cloud , and each night he led them with a flaming fire .
CEV	Psalms	78	15	( F ) God made water flow from rocks he split open in the desert , and his people drank freely , as though from a lake .
CEV	Psalms	78	16	He made streams gush out like rivers from rocks .
CEV	Psalms	78	17	But in the desert , the people of God Most High kept sinning and rebelling .
CEV	Psalms	78	18	( G ) They stubbornly tested God and demanded from him what they wanted to eat .
CEV	Psalms	78	19	They challenged God by saying , “ Can God provide food out here in the desert ?
CEV	Psalms	78	20	It 's true God struck the rock and water gushed out like a river , but can he give his people bread and meat ? ”
CEV	Psalms	78	21	When the Lord heard this , he was angry and furious with Jacob 's descendants , the people of Israel .
CEV	Psalms	78	22	They had refused to trust him , and they had doubted his saving power .
CEV	Psalms	78	23	But God gave a command to the clouds , and he opened the doors in the skies .
CEV	Psalms	78	24	( H ) From heaven he sent grain that they called manna . [ b ]
CEV	Psalms	78	25	He gave them more than enough , and each one of them ate this special food .
CEV	Psalms	78	26	God 's mighty power sent a strong wind from the southeast ,
CEV	Psalms	78	27	and it brought birds that covered the ground , like sand on the beach .
CEV	Psalms	78	28	Then God made the birds fall in the camp of his people near their tents .
CEV	Psalms	78	29	God gave his people all they wanted , and each of them ate until they were full .
CEV	Psalms	78	30	But before they had swallowed the last bite ,
CEV	Psalms	78	31	God became angry and killed the strongest and best from the families of Israel .
CEV	Psalms	78	32	But the rest kept on sinning and would not trust God 's miracles .
CEV	Psalms	78	33	So he cut their lives short and made them terrified .
CEV	Psalms	78	34	After he killed some of them , the others turned to him with all their hearts .
CEV	Psalms	78	35	They remembered God Most High , the mighty rock [ c ] that kept them safe .
CEV	Psalms	78	36	But they tried to flatter God , and they told him lies ;
CEV	Psalms	78	37	( I ) they were unfaithful and broke their promises .

CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	1	When the son of David was king in Jerusalem , he was known to be very wise , [ a ] and he said :
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	2	Nothing makes sense ! Everything is nonsense . I have seen it all— nothing makes sense !
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	3	What is there to show for all of our hard work here on this earth ?
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	4	( A ) People come , and people go , but still the world never changes .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	5	The sun comes up , the sun goes down ; it hurries right back to where it started from .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	6	The wind blows south , the wind blows north ; round and round it blows over and over again .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	7	All rivers empty into the sea , but it never spills over ; one by one the rivers return to their source . [ b ]
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	8	All of life is far more boring than words could ever say . Our eyes and our ears are never satisfied with what we see and hear .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	9	Everything that happens has happened before ; nothing is new , nothing under the sun .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	10	Someone might say , “ Here is something new ! ” But it happened before , long before we were born .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	11	No one who lived in the past is remembered anymore , and everyone yet to be born will be forgotten too . It Is Senseless To Be Wise
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	12	I said these things when I lived in Jerusalem as king of Israel .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	13	With all my wisdom I tried to understand everything that happens here on earth . And God has made this so hard for us humans to do .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	14	I have seen it all , and everything is just as senseless as chasing the wind . [ c ]
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	15	If something is crooked , it ca n't be made straight ; if something is n't there , it ca n't be counted .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	16	( B ) I said to myself , “ You are by far the wisest person who has ever lived in Jerusalem . You are eager to learn , and you have learned a lot. ”
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	17	Then I decided to find out all I could about wisdom and foolishness . Soon I realized that this too was as senseless as chasing the wind . [ d ]
CEV	Ecclesiastes	1	18	The more you know , the more you hurt ; the more you understand , the more you suffer .

CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	2	Laughing and having fun is crazy . What good does it do ?
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	3	I wanted to find out what was best for us during the short time we have on this earth . So I decided to make myself happy with wine and find out what it means to be foolish , without really being foolish myself .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	4	( A ) I did some great things . I built houses and planted vineyards .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	5	I had flower gardens and orchards full of fruit trees .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	6	And I had pools where I could get water for the trees .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	7	( B ) I owned slaves , and their sons and daughters became my slaves . I had more sheep and goats than anyone who had ever lived in Jerusalem .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	8	( C ) Foreign rulers brought me silver , gold , and precious treasures . Men and women sang for me , and I had many wives [ a ] who gave me great pleasure .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	9	( D ) I was the most famous person who had ever lived in Jerusalem , and I was very wise .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	10	I got whatever I wanted and did whatever made me happy . But most of all , I enjoyed my work .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	11	Then I thought about everything I had done , including the hard work , and it was simply chasing the wind . [ b ] Nothing on earth is worth the trouble . Wisdom Comes from God
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	12	I asked myself , “ What can the next king do that I have n't done ? ” Then I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and stupidity .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	13	And I discovered that wisdom is better than foolishness , just as light is better than darkness .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	14	Wisdom is like having two good eyes ; foolishness leaves you in the dark . But wise or foolish , we all end up the same .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	15	Finally , I said to myself , “ Being wise got me nowhere ! The same thing will happen to me that happens to fools . Nothing makes sense .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	16	Wise or foolish , we all die and are soon forgotten. ”
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	17	This made me hate life . Everything we do is painful ; it 's just as senseless as chasing the wind . [ c ]
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	18	Suddenly I realized that others would someday get everything I had worked for so hard , then I started hating it all .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	19	Who knows if those people will be sensible or stupid ? Either way , they will own everything I have earned by hard work and wisdom . It does n't make sense .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	20	I thought about all my hard work , and I felt depressed .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	21	When we use our wisdom , knowledge , and skill to get what we own , why do we have to leave it to someone who did n't work for it ? This is senseless and wrong .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	22	What do we really gain from all of our hard work ?
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	23	( E ) Our bodies ache during the day , and work is torture . Then at night our thoughts are troubled . It just does n't make sense .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	24	( F ) The best thing we can do is to enjoy eating , drinking , and working . [ d ] I believe these are God 's gifts to us ,
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	25	and no one enjoys eating and living more than I do .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	2	26	( G ) If we please God , he will make us wise , understanding , and happy . But if we sin , God will make us struggle for a living , then he will give all we own to someone who pleases him . This makes no more sense than chasing the wind . [ e ] Copyright ©

CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I have seen what difficult things God demands of us .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	11	God makes everything happen at the right time . Yet none of us can ever fully understand all he has done , and he puts questions in our minds about the past and the future .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	12	I know the best thing we can do is to always enjoy life ,
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	13	because God 's gift to us is the happiness we get from our food and drink and from the work we do .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	14	Everything God has done will last forever ; nothing he does can ever be changed . God has done all this , so that we will worship him .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	15	Everything that happens has happened before , and all that will be has already been— God does everything over and over again . [ a ] The Future Is Known Only to God
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	16	Everywhere on earth I saw violence and injustice instead of fairness and justice .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	17	So I told myself that God has set a time and a place for everything . He will judge everyone , both the wicked and the good .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I know God is testing us to show us that we are merely animals .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	19	Like animals we breathe and die , and we are no better off than they are . It just does n't make sense .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	20	All living creatures go to the same place . We are made from earth , and we return to earth .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who really knows if our spirits go up and the spirits of animals go down into the earth ?

CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	4	Then I realized that we work and do wonderful things just because we are jealous of others . This makes no more sense than chasing the wind . [ a ]
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	2	I said to myself , “ The dead are better off than the living .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	3	But those who have never been born are better off than anyone else , because they have never seen the terrible things that happen on this earth. ”
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	5	Fools will fold their hands and starve to death .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	6	Yet a very little food eaten in peace is better than twice as much earned from overwork and chasing the wind . [ b ]
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Once again I saw that nothing on earth makes sense .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	8	For example , some people do n't have friends or family . But they are never satisfied with what they own , and they never stop working to get more . They should ask themselves , “ Why am I always working to have more ? Who will get what I leave behind ? ” What a senseless and miserable life ! It Is Better To Have a Friend
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	9	You are better having a friend than to be all alone , because then you will get more enjoyment out of what you earn .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	10	If you fall , your friend can help you up . But if you fall without having a friend nearby , you are really in trouble .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	11	If you sleep alone , you wo n't have anyone to keep you warm on a cold night .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	12	Someone might be able to beat up one of you , but not both of you . As the saying goes , “ A rope made from three strands of cord is hard to break. ”
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	13	You may be poor and young , but if you are wise , you are better off than a foolish old king who wo n't listen to advice .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	14	Even if you were not born into the royal family and have been a prisoner and poor , you can still be king .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I once saw everyone in the world follow a young leader who came to power after the king was gone .

CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	7	Corruption [ b ] makes fools of sensible people , and bribes can ruin you .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	2	It 's better to go to a funeral than to attend a feast ; funerals remind us that we all must die .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Choose sorrow over laughter because a sad face may hide a happy heart .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	4	A sensible person mourns , but fools always laugh .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	5	Correction from someone wise is better by far than praise from fools .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	6	Foolish laughter is stupid . It sounds like thorns crackling in a fire .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	8	Something completed is better than something just begun ; patience is better than too much pride .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	9	( B ) Only fools get angry quickly and hold a grudge .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	10	It is n't wise to ask , “ Why is everything worse than it used to be ? ”
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Having wisdom is better than an inheritance .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	12	Wisdom will protect you just like money ; knowledge with good sense will lead you to life .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Think of what God has done ! If God makes something crooked , can you make it straight ?
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	14	When times are good , you should be cheerful ; when times are bad , think about what it means . God makes them both to keep us from knowing what will happen next . Some of Life 's Questions
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	15	I have seen everything during this senseless life of mine . I have seen good citizens die for doing the right thing , while criminals live and prosper .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	16	So do n't destroy yourself by being too good or acting too smart !
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Do n't die before your time by being too evil or acting like a fool .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	18	Keep to the middle of the road . You can do this if you truly respect God .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	19	Wisdom will make you stronger than the ten most powerful leaders in your city .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	20	No one in this world always does right .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Do n't listen to everything that everyone says , or you might hear your servant cursing you .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	22	Have n't you cursed many others ?
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	23	I told myself that I would be smart and try to understand all this , but it was too much for me .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	24	The truth is beyond us . It 's far too deep .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	25	So I decided to learn everything I could and become wise enough to discover what life is all about . At the same time , I wanted to understand why it 's stupid and senseless to be an evil fool .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	26	Here is what I discovered : A bad woman is worse than death . She is a trap , reaching out with body and soul to catch you . But if you obey God , you can escape . If you do n't obey , you are done for .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	27	With all my wisdom I have tried to find out how everything fits together ,
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	28	but so far I have not been able to . I do know there is one good man in a thousand , but never have I found a good woman .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	7	29	I did learn one thing : We were completely honest when God created us , but now we have twisted minds . Copyright ©

CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	8	We can not control the wind [ a ] or determine the day of our death . There is no escape in time of war , and no one can hide behind evil .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	2	If you promised God that you would be loyal to the king , I advise you to keep that promise .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Do n't quickly oppose the king or argue when he has already made up his mind .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	4	The king 's word is law . No one can ask him , “ Why are you doing this ? ”
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	5	If you obey the king , you will stay out of trouble . So be wise and learn what to do and when to do it .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	6	Life is hard , but there is a time and a place for everything ,
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	7	though no one can tell the future .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	9	I noticed all this and thought seriously about what goes on in the world . Why does one person have the power to hurt another ? Who Can Understand the Ways of God ?
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	10	I saw the wicked buried with honor , but God 's people had to leave the holy city and were forgotten . [ b ] None of this makes sense .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	11	When we see criminals commit crime after crime without being punished , it makes us want to start a life of crime .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	12	They commit hundreds of crimes and live a long time , in spite of the saying : Everyone who lives right and respects God will prosper ,
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	13	but no one who sins and rejects God will prosper or live very long .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is something else that does n't make sense to me . Good citizens are treated as criminals , while criminals are honored as though they were good citizens .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	15	So I think we should get as much out of life as we possibly can . There is nothing better than to enjoy our food and drink and have a good time . Then we can make it through this troublesome life that God has given us here on earth .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	16	Day and night I went without sleep , trying to understand what goes on in this world .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	8	17	I saw everything God does , and I realized no one can really understand what happens . We may be very wise , but no matter how much we try or how much we claim to know , we can not understand it all . Copyright ©

CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Life is short , and you love your wife , so enjoy being with her . This is what you are supposed to do as you struggle through life on this earth .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	2	But exactly [ b ] the same thing will finally happen to all of us , whether we live right and respect God or sin and do n't respect God . Yes , the same thing will happen if we offer sacrifices to God or if we do n't , if we keep our promises or are afraid to make them .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	3	It 's terribly unfair for the same thing to happen to each of us . We are mean and foolish while we live , and then we die .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	4	As long as we are alive , we still have hope , just as a live dog is better off than a dead lion .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	5	We know we will die , but the dead do n't know a thing . Nothing good will happen to them—they are gone and forgotten .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	6	Their loves , their hates , and their jealous feelings have all disappeared with them . They will never again take part in anything that happens on this earth .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	7	So be happy and enjoy eating and drinking ! God decided long ago that this is what you should do .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Dress up , comb your hair , and look your best .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Work hard at whatever you do . You will soon go to the world of the dead , where no one works or thinks or reasons or even knows anything .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	11	Here is something else I have learned : The fastest runners and the greatest heroes do n't always win races and battles . Wisdom , intelligence , and skill do n't always make you healthy , rich , or popular . We each have our own share of misfortune .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	12	None of us know when we might fall victim to a sudden disaster and find ourselves like fish in a net or birds in a trap . Better To Be Wise than Foolish
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	13	Once I saw what people really think of wisdom , and it made an impression on me .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	14	It happened when a powerful ruler surrounded and attacked a small city where only a few people lived . The enemy army was getting ready to break through the city walls .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	15	But the city was saved by the wisdom of a poor person who was soon forgotten .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	16	So I decided that wisdom is better than strength . Yet if you are poor , no one pays any attention to you , no matter how smart you are .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	17	Words of wisdom spoken softly make much more sense than the shouts of a ruler to a crowd of fools .
CEV	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is more powerful than weapons , yet one mistake can destroy all the good you have done . Copyright ©

However , in the Greek translation made about
CEV	Isaiah	7	200	b.c . and used by the early Christians , the word parthenos had a double meaning . While the translator took it to mean “ young woman , ” Matthew understood it to mean “ virgin ” and quoted the passage ( Matthew 1.23 ) because it was the appropriate description of Mary , the mother of Jesus . - 7.14 Immanuel : In Hebrew “ Immanuel ” means “ God is with us. ” - 7.15,16 yogurt and honey : This may refer either to expensive foods eaten in a time of plenty or to a limited diet eaten in times of a food shortage . - 7.20 shave … head … body … beard : This would have been a terrible insult . - 7.22 yogurt and honey : See the note at 7.15,16 .

CEV	Isaiah	30	10	and have said to his messengers and prophets : Do n't tell us what God has shown you and do n't preach the truth . Just say what we want to hear , even if it 's false .
CEV	Isaiah	30	11	Stop telling us what God has said ! We do n't want to hear any more about the holy One of Israel .
CEV	Isaiah	30	12	Now this is the answer of the holy One of Israel : “ You rejected my message , and you trust in violence and lies .

CEV	Isaiah	43	15	I am the Lord , your holy God , Israel 's Creator and King .
CEV	Isaiah	43	16	I am the one who cut a path through the mighty ocean .
CEV	Isaiah	43	17	I sent an army to chase you with chariots and horses ; now they lie dead , unable to move . They are like an oil lamp with the flame snuffed out . Forget the Past The Lord said :
CEV	Isaiah	43	18	Forget what happened long ago ! Do n't think about the past .
CEV	Isaiah	43	19	I am creating something new . There it is ! Do you see it ? I have put roads in deserts , streams [ d ] in thirsty lands .
CEV	Isaiah	43	20	Every wild animal honors me , even jackals [ e ] and owls . I provide water in deserts— streams in thirsty lands for my chosen people .
CEV	Isaiah	43	21	I made them my own nation , so they would praise me .
CEV	Isaiah	43	22	I , the Lord , said to Israel : You have become weary of me , but not from worshiping me .
CEV	Isaiah	43	23	You have not honored me by sacrificing sheep or other animals . And I have not burdened you with demands for sacrifices or sweet-smelling incense .
CEV	Isaiah	43	24	You have not brought delicious spices for me or given me the best part of your sacrificed animals . Instead , you burden me down with your terrible sins .
CEV	Isaiah	43	25	But I wipe away your sins because of who I am . And so , I will forget the wrongs you have done .
CEV	Isaiah	43	26	Meet me in court ! State your case and prove that you are right .

CEV	Isaiah	44	44	People of Israel , I have chosen you as my servant .
CEV	Isaiah	44	2	I am your Creator . You were in my care even before you were born . Israel , do n't be terrified ! You are my chosen servant , my very favorite . [ a ]
CEV	Isaiah	44	3	I will bless the thirsty land by sending streams of water ; I will bless your descendants by giving them my Spirit .
CEV	Isaiah	44	4	They will spring up like grass [ b ] or like willow trees near flowing streams .
CEV	Isaiah	44	5	They will worship me and become my people . They will write my name on the back of their hands . [ c ]
CEV	Isaiah	44	6	( A ) I am the Lord All-Powerful , the first and the last , the one and only God . Israel , I have rescued you ! I am your King .
CEV	Isaiah	44	7	Can anyone compare with me ? If so , let them speak up and tell me now . Let them say what has happened since I made my nation long ago , and let them tell what is going to happen . [ d ]
CEV	Isaiah	44	8	Do n't tremble with fear ! Did n't I tell you long ago ? Did n't you hear me ? I alone am God— no one else is a mighty rock . [ e ] Idols Ca n't Do a Thing The Lord said :
CEV	Isaiah	44	9	Those people who make idols are nothing themselves , and the idols they treasure are just as worthless . Worshipers of idols are blind , stupid , and foolish .
CEV	Isaiah	44	10	Why make an idol or an image that ca n't do a thing ?
CEV	Isaiah	44	11	Everyone who makes idols and all who worship them are mere humans , who will end up sadly disappointed . Let them face me in court and be terrified . Idols and Firewood
CEV	Isaiah	44	12	A metalworker shapes an idol by using a hammer [ f ] and heat from the fire . In his powerful hand he holds a hammer , as he pounds the metal into the proper shape . But he gets hungry and thirsty and loses his strength .
CEV	Isaiah	44	13	Some woodcarver measures a piece of wood , then draws an outline . The idol is carefully carved with each detail exact . At last it looks like a person and is placed in a temple .
CEV	Isaiah	44	14	Either cedar , cypress , oak , or any tree from the forest may be chosen . Or even a pine tree planted by the woodcarver and watered by the rain .
CEV	Isaiah	44	15	( B ) Some of the wood is used to make a fire for heating or for cooking . One piece is made into an idol , then the woodcarver bows down and worships it .
CEV	Isaiah	44	16	He enjoys the warm fire and the meat that was roasted over the burning coals .
CEV	Isaiah	44	17	Afterwards , he bows down to worship the wooden idol . “ Protect me ! ” he says . “ You are my god. ”
CEV	Isaiah	44	18	Those who worship idols are stupid and blind !
CEV	Isaiah	44	19	They do n't have enough sense to say to themselves , “ I made a fire with half of the wood and cooked my bread and meat on it . Then I made something worthless with the other half . Why worship a block of wood ? ”
CEV	Isaiah	44	20	How can anyone be stupid enough to trust something that can be burned to ashes ? [ g ] No one can save themselves like that . Do n't they realize that the idols they hold in their hands are not really gods ? The Lord Wo n't Forget His People
CEV	Isaiah	44	21	People of Israel , you are my servant , so remember all of this . Israel , I created you , and you are my servant . I wo n't forget you . [ h ]
CEV	Isaiah	44	22	Turn back to me ! I have rescued you and swept away your sins as though they were clouds . Sing Praises to the Lord
CEV	Isaiah	44	23	Tell the heavens and the earth to start singing ! Tell the mountains and every tree in the forest to join in the song ! The Lord has rescued his people ; now they will worship him . The Lord Created Everything
CEV	Isaiah	44	24	Israel , I am your Lord , the source of your life , and I have rescued you . I created everything from the sky above to the earth below .
CEV	Isaiah	44	25	( C ) I make liars of false prophets and fools of fortunetellers . I take human wisdom and turn it into nonsense .
CEV	Isaiah	44	26	I will make the message of my prophets come true . They are saying , “ Jerusalem will be filled with people , and the Lord will rebuild the towns of Judah. ”
CEV	Isaiah	44	27	I am the one who commands the sea and its streams to run dry .
CEV	Isaiah	44	28	( D ) I am also the one who says , “ Cyrus will lead my people and obey my orders .

CEV	Isaiah	45	10	Children do n't have the right to demand of their parents , “ What have you done to make us what we are ? ”
CEV	Isaiah	45	11	I am the Lord , the Creator , the holy God of Israel . Do you dare question me about my own nation or about what I have done ?
CEV	Isaiah	45	12	I created the world and covered it with people ; I stretched out the sky and filled it with stars .
CEV	Isaiah	45	13	I have done the right thing by placing Cyrus in power , and I will make the roads easy for him to follow . I am the Lord All-Powerful ! Cyrus will rebuild my city and set my people free without being paid a thing . I , the Lord , have spoken . The Lord Alone Can Save
CEV	Isaiah	45	14	My people , I , the Lord , promise that the riches of Egypt and the treasures of Ethiopia [ d ] will belong to you . You will force into slavery those tall people of Seba . [ e ] They will bow down and say , “ The only true God is with you ; there are no other gods. ”
CEV	Isaiah	45	15	People of Israel , your God is a mystery , though he alone can save .
CEV	Isaiah	45	16	Anyone who makes idols will be confused and terribly disgraced .
CEV	Isaiah	45	17	But Israel , I , the Lord , will always keep you safe and free from shame . Everyone Is Invited
CEV	Isaiah	45	18	The Lord alone is God ! He created the heavens and made a world where people can live , instead of creating an empty desert . The Lord alone is God ; there are no others .
CEV	Isaiah	45	19	The Lord did not speak in a dark secret place or command Jacob 's descendants to search for him in vain . The Lord speaks the truth , and this is what he says
CEV	Isaiah	45	20	to every survivor from every nation : “ Gather around me ! Learn how senseless it is to worship wooden idols or pray to helpless gods .
CEV	Isaiah	45	21	“ Why do n't you get together and meet me in court ? Did n't I tell you long ago what would happen ? I am the only God ! There are no others . I bring about justice , and have the power to save .
CEV	Isaiah	45	22	“ I invite the whole world to turn to me and be saved . I alone am God ! No others are real .

CEV	Jeremiah	1	14	The Lord said : I will pour out destruction all over the land .

CEV	Jeremiah	2	4	Listen , people of Israel , [ a ]

CEV	Jeremiah	2	17	It 's all your own fault ! You stopped following me , the Lord your God ,
CEV	Jeremiah	2	18	and you trusted the power of Egypt and Assyria . [ b ]

CEV	Jeremiah	2	35	you claim to be innocent , and you want me to stop being angry with you . So I 'll take you to court , and we 'll see who is right .
CEV	Jeremiah	2	36	When Assyria let you down , you quickly ran to Egypt , but you 'll find no help there ,

CEV	Jeremiah	3	9	The kingdom of Judah was n't sorry for being a prostitute , and she did n't care that she had made both herself and the land unclean by worshiping idols of stone and wood .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	10	And worst of all , the people of Judah pretended to come back to me .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	11	Even the people of Israel were honest enough not to pretend .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	12	Jeremiah , shout toward the north : Israel , I am your Lord— come back to me ! You were unfaithful and made me furious , but I am merciful , and so I will forgive you .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	13	Just admit that you rebelled and worshiped foreign gods under large trees everywhere .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	14	You are unfaithful children , but you belong to me . Come home ! I 'll take one or two of you from each town and clan and bring you to Zion .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	15	Then I 'll appoint wise rulers who will obey me , and they will care for you like shepherds .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	16	You will increase in numbers , and there will be no need to remember the sacred chest or to make a new one . [ e ]
CEV	Jeremiah	3	17	The whole city of Jerusalem will be my throne . [ f ] All nations will come here to worship me , and they will no longer follow their stubborn , evil hearts .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	18	Then , in countries to the north , you people of Judah and Israel will be reunited , and you will return to the land I gave your ancestors .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	19	I have always wanted to treat you as my children and give you the best land , the most beautiful on earth . I wanted you to call me “ Father ” and not turn from me .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	20	But instead , you are like a wife who broke her wedding vows . You have been unfaithful to me . I , the Lord , have spoken . The People Confess Their Sins The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	3	21	Listen to the noise on the hilltops ! It 's the people of Israel , weeping and begging me to answer their prayers . They forgot about me and chose the wrong path .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	22	I will tell them , “ Come back , and I will cure you of your unfaithfulness. ” They will answer , “ We will come back , because you are the Lord our God .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	23	On hilltops , we worshiped idols and made loud noises , but it was all for nothing— only you can save us .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	24	Since the days of our ancestors when our nation was young , that shameful god Baal [ g ] has taken our crops and livestock , our sons and daughters .
CEV	Jeremiah	3	25	We have rebelled against you just like our ancestors , and we are ashamed of our sins. ” Footnotes - 3.2 hilltop … sex : See the note at 2.20 . - 3.6 Josiah : Ruled 640–609 b.c . - 3.6 Israel : The northern kingdom ( see the note at 2.4 ) . - 3.6 prostitute … trees : See the note at 2.20 . - 3.16 make a new one : The sacred chest was probably destroyed or taken away by the Babylonians when they captured Jerusalem in

CEV	Jeremiah	4	4	With all your hearts , keep the agreement I made with you . But if you are stubborn and keep on sinning , my anger will burn like a fire that can not be put out . Disaster Is Coming The Lord said : *
CEV	Jeremiah	4	2	Make promises only in my name , and do what you promise ! Then all nations will praise me , and I will bless them .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	3	( A ) People of Jerusalem and Judah , do n't be so stubborn ! Your hearts have become hard , like unplowed ground where thornbushes grow .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	5	“ Sound the trumpets , my people . Warn the people of Judah , [ a ] ‘ Run for your lives !
CEV	Jeremiah	4	6	Head for Jerusalem or another walled town ! ’ “ Jeremiah , tell them I 'm sending disaster from the north .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	7	An army will come out , like a lion from its den . It will destroy nations and leave your towns empty and in ruins. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	4	8	Then I told the people of Israel , “ Put on sackcloth ! [ b ] Mourn and cry out , ‘ The Lord is still angry with us. ’ ”
CEV	Jeremiah	4	9	The Lord said , “ When all this happens , the king and his officials , the prophets and the priests will be shocked and terrified. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	4	10	I said , “ You are the Lord God . So why have you fooled everyone , especially the people of Jerusalem ? Why did you promise peace , when a knife is at our throats ? ” The Coming Disaster 11-12 When disaster comes , the Lord will tell you people of Jerusalem , “ I am sending a windstorm from the desert— not a welcome breeze . [ c ] And it will sweep you away as punishment for your sins .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	13	Look ! The enemy army swoops down like an eagle ; their cavalry and chariots race faster than storm clouds blown by the wind. ” Then you will answer , “ We are doomed ! ”
CEV	Jeremiah	4	14	But Jerusalem , there is still time for you to be saved . Wash the evil from your hearts and stop making sinful plans ,
CEV	Jeremiah	4	15	before a message of disaster arrives from the hills of Ephraim and the town of Dan . [ d ] 16-17 The Lord said , “ Tell the nations that my people have rebelled against me . And so an army will come from far away to surround Jerusalem and the towns of Judah . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	18	“ People of Judah , your hearts will be in pain , but it 's your own fault that you will be punished. ” Jeremiah 's Vision of the Coming Punishment
CEV	Jeremiah	4	19	I ca n't stand the pain ! My heart pounds , as I twist and turn in agony . I hear the signal trumpet and the battle cry of the enemy , and I can not be silent .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	20	I see the enemy defeating us time after time , leaving everything in ruins . Even my own home is destroyed in a moment .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	21	How long will I see enemy flags and hear their trumpets ?
CEV	Jeremiah	4	22	I heard the Lord say , “ My people ignore me . They are foolish children who do not understand that they will be punished . All they know is how to sin. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	4	23	After this , I looked around . The earth was barren , with no form of life . The sun , moon , and stars had disappeared .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	24	The mountains were shaking ;
CEV	Jeremiah	4	25	no people could be seen , and all the birds had flown away .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	26	Farmland had become a desert , and towns were in ruins . The Lord 's fierce anger had done all of this . The Death of Jerusalem 27-28 The Lord said : I have made my decision , and I wo n't change my mind . This land will be destroyed , although not completely . The sky will turn dark , and the earth will mourn .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	29	Enemy cavalry and archers shout their battle cry . People run for their lives and try to find safety among trees and rocks . Every town is empty .
CEV	Jeremiah	4	30	Jerusalem , your land has been wiped out . But you act like a prostitute and try to win back your lovers , who now hate you . You can put on a red dress , gold jewelry , and eye shadow , but it 's no use— your lovers are out to kill you !
CEV	Jeremiah	4	31	I heard groaning and crying . Was it a woman giving birth to her first child ? No , it was Jerusalem , gasping for breath and begging for help . “ I 'm dying ! ” she said . “ They have murdered me. ” Footnotes - 4.5 Judah : Hebrew “ Judah and Jerusalem. ” - 4.8 sackcloth : A rough , dark-colored cloth made from goat or camel hair and used to make grain sacks . It was worn in times of trouble or sorrow . - 4.11,12 a welcome breeze : Hebrew “ a wind to blow away the husks. ” Farmers used a special shovel to pitch grain and husks into the air . Wind would blow away the light husks , and the grain would fall back to the ground , where it could be gathered up . - 4.15 Ephraim … Dan : The hills of Ephraim were to the north of Jerusalem , and Dan was even farther north . They would be reached by the invading army first . Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	5	5	So I 'll go and talk to the leaders . They know what God demands. ” But even they had decided not to obey the Lord .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	2	Everyone breaks promises made in my name. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	5	3	I answered , “ I know that you look for truth . You punished your people for their lies , but in spite of the pain , they became more stubborn and refused to turn back to you. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	5	4	Then I thought to myself , “ These common people act like fools , and they have never learned what the Lord their God demands of them .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	6	The people have rebelled and rejected the Lord too many times . So enemies will attack like lions from the forest or wolves from the desert . Those enemies will watch the towns of Judah , and like leopards they will tear to pieces whoever goes outside . Enemies Will Punish Judah The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	5	7	People of Judah , how can I forgive you ? I gave you everything , but you abandoned me and worshiped idols . You men go to prostitutes and are unfaithful to your wives .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	8	You are no better than animals , and you always want sex with someone else 's wife .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	9	Why should n't I punish the people of Judah ?
CEV	Jeremiah	5	10	I will tell their enemies , “ Go through my vineyard . Do n't destroy the vines , but cut off the branches , because they are the people who do n't belong to me. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	5	11	In every way , Judah and Israel have been unfaithful to me . *
CEV	Jeremiah	5	12	Their prophets lie and say , “ The Lord wo n't punish us . We will have peace and plenty of food. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	5	13	They tell these lies in my name , so now they will be killed in war or starve to death .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	14	I am the Lord God All-Powerful . Jeremiah , I will tell you exactly what to say . Your words will be a fire ; Israel and Judah will be the fuel .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	15	People of Israel , I have made my decision . An army from a distant country will attack you . I 've chosen an ancient nation , and you wo n't understand their language .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	16	All of them are warriors , and their arrows bring death .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	17	This nation will eat your crops and livestock ; they will leave no fruit on your vines or fig trees . And although you feel safe behind thick walls , your towns will be destroyed and your children killed . Israel Refused To Worship the Lord
CEV	Jeremiah	5	18	The Lord said : Jeremiah , the enemy army wo n't kill everyone in Judah .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	19	And the people who survive will ask , “ Why did the Lord our God do such terrible things to us ? ” Then tell them : I am the Lord , but you abandoned me and worshiped other gods in your own land . Now you will be slaves in a foreign country .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	20	Tell these things to each other , you people of Judah , you descendants of Jacob .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	21	( A ) You fools ! Why do n't you listen when I speak ? Why ca n't you understand
CEV	Jeremiah	5	22	( B ) that you should worship me with fear and trembling ? I 'm the one who made the shore to hold back the ocean . Waves may crash on the beach , but they can come no farther .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	23	You stubborn people have rebelled and turned your backs on me .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	24	You refuse to say , “ Let 's worship the Lord ! He 's the one who sends rain in spring and autumn and gives us a good harvest. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	5	25	That 's why I can not bless you ! *
CEV	Jeremiah	5	26	A hunter traps birds and puts them in a cage , but some of you trap humans and make them your slaves .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	27	You are evil , and you lie and cheat to make yourselves rich . You are powerful
CEV	Jeremiah	5	28	and prosperous , but you refuse to help [ a ] the poor get the justice they deserve .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	29	You need to be punished , and so I will take revenge .
CEV	Jeremiah	5	30	Look at the terrible things going on in this country . I am shocked !
CEV	Jeremiah	5	31	Prophets give their messages in the name of a false god , [ b ] my priests do n't want to serve me , [ c ] and you—my own people— like it this way ! But on the day of disaster , where will you turn for help ? Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	6	6	I am the Lord All-Powerful , and I will command these armies to chop down trees and build a ramp up to the walls of Jerusalem . People of Jerusalem , I must punish you for your injustice .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	2	Jerusalem is a lovely pasture ,
CEV	Jeremiah	6	3	but shepherds will surround it and divided up , then let their flocks eat all the grass . [ a ]
CEV	Jeremiah	6	4	Kings will tell their troops , “ If we reach Jerusalem in the morning , we 'll attack at noon . But if we arrive later ,
CEV	Jeremiah	6	5	we 'll attack after dark and destroy its fortresses. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	6	7	Evil pours from your city like water from a spring . Sounds of injustice and violence echo within your walls ; victims are everywhere , wounded and dying .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	8	Listen to me , you people of Jerusalem and Judah . I will abandon you , and your land will become an empty desert .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	9	I will tell your enemies to leave your nation bare like a vine stripped of grapes . I , the Lord All-Powerful , have spoken . Jeremiah 's Anger
CEV	Jeremiah	6	10	I have told the people that you , Lord , will punish them , but they just laugh and refuse to listen .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	11	Your anger against Judah flames up inside me , and I ca n't hold it in much longer . The Lord 's Anger Will Sweep Everyone Away The Lord answered : Do n't hold back my anger ! Let it sweep away everyone— the children at play and all adults , young and old alike .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	12	( A ) I 'll punish the people of Judah and give to others their houses and fields , as well as their wives . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	13	Everyone is greedy and dishonest , whether poor or rich . Even the prophets and priests can not be trusted .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	14	( B ) All they ever offer to my deeply wounded people are empty hopes for peace .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	15	They should be ashamed of their disgusting sins , but they do n't even blush . And so , when I punish Judah , they will end up on the ground , dead like everyone else . I , the Lord , have spoken . The People of Judah Rejected God 's Way of Life
CEV	Jeremiah	6	16	The Lord said : My people , when you stood at the crossroads , I told you , “ Follow the road your ancestors took , and you will find peace. ” But you refused .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	17	I also sent prophets to warn you of danger , but when they sounded the alarm , you paid no attention .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	18	So I tell all nations on earth , “ Watch what I will do !
CEV	Jeremiah	6	19	My people ignored me and rejected my laws . They planned to do evil , and now the evil they planned will happen to them. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	6	20	People of Judah , you bring me incense from Sheba and spices from distant lands . You offer sacrifices of all kinds . But why bother ? I hate these gifts of yours !
CEV	Jeremiah	6	21	So I will put stumbling blocks in your path , and everyone will die , including parents and children , neighbors and friends . An Army from the North
CEV	Jeremiah	6	22	The Lord said , “ Look toward the north , where a powerful nation has prepared for war .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	23	Its well-armed troops are cruel and never show mercy . Their galloping horses sound like ocean waves pounding on the shore . This army will attack you , lovely Jerusalem. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	6	24	Then the people said , “ Just hearing about them makes us tremble with fear , and we twist and turn in pain like a woman giving birth. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	6	25	The Lord said , “ Do n't work in your fields or walk along the roads . It 's too dangerous . The enemy is well armed
CEV	Jeremiah	6	26	and attacks without warning . So mourn , my people , as though your only child had died . Wear clothes made of sackcloth [ b ] and roll in the ash pile. ” The Lord 's People Must Be Tested The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	6	27	Jeremiah , test my people as though they were metal .
CEV	Jeremiah	6	28	And you 'll find they are hard like bronze and iron . They are stubborn rebels , always spreading lies . * 29-30 Silver can be purified in a fiery furnace , but my people are too wicked to be made pure , and so I have rejected them . Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	7	7	Then I will let you enjoy a long life in this land I gave your ancestors .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	4	Do n't fool yourselves ! My temple is here in Jerusalem , but that does n't mean I will protect you .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	5	I will keep you safe only if you change your ways and are fair and honest with each other .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	6	Stop taking advantage of foreigners , orphans , and widows . Do n't kill innocent people . And stop worshiping other gods .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	8	But just look at what is happening ! You put your trust in worthless lies .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	9	You steal and murder ; you lie in court and are unfaithful in marriage . You worship idols and offer incense to Baal , when these gods have never done anything for you .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	10	And then you come into my temple and worship me ! Do you think I will protect you so that you can go on sinning ?
CEV	Jeremiah	7	11	( A ) You are thieves , and you have made my temple your hideout . But I 've seen everything you have done .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	12	( B ) Go to Shiloh , where my sacred tent once stood . Take a look at what I did there . My people Israel sinned , and so I destroyed Shiloh !
CEV	Jeremiah	7	13	While you have been sinning , I have been trying to talk to you , but you refuse to listen .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	14	Do n't think this temple will protect you . Long ago I told your ancestors to build it and worship me here , but now I have decided to tear it down , just as I destroyed Shiloh .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	15	And as for you , people of Judah , I 'm going to send you away from my land , just as I sent away the people of Ephraim and the other northern tribes . Punishment for Worshiping Other Gods
CEV	Jeremiah	7	16	Jeremiah , do n't pray for these people ! I , the Lord , would refuse to listen .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	17	Do you see what the people of Judah are doing in their towns and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
CEV	Jeremiah	7	18	( C ) Children gather firewood , their fathers build fires , and their mothers mix dough to bake bread for the goddess they call the Queen of Heaven . [ c ] They even offer wine sacrifices to other gods , just to insult me .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	19	But they are not only insulting me ; they are also harming themselves by doing these shameful things .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	20	And now , I , the Lord All-Powerful , will flood Judah with my fiery anger until nothing is left—no people or animals , no trees or crops . It Is Useless To Offer Sacrifices
CEV	Jeremiah	7	21	The Lord told me to say to the people of Judah : I am the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , but I wo n't accept sacrifices from you . So do n't even bother bringing them to me . You might as well just cook the meat for yourselves .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	22	At the time I brought your ancestors out of Egypt , I did n't command them to offer sacrifices to me .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	23	Instead , I told them , “ If you listen to me and do what I tell you , I will be your God , you will be my people , and all will go well for you. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	7	24	But your ancestors refused to listen . They were stubborn , and whenever I wanted them to go one way , they always went the other .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	25	Ever since your ancestors left Egypt , I have been sending my servants the prophets to speak for me .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	26	But you have ignored me and become even more stubborn and sinful than your ancestors ever were ! Slaughter Valley The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	7	27	Jeremiah , no matter what you do , the people wo n't listen .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	28	So you must say to them : People of Judah , I am the Lord your God , but you have refused to obey me , and you did n't change when I punished you . And now , you no longer even pretend to be faithful to me .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	29	Shave your head bald and throw away the hair . Sing a funeral song on top of a barren hill . You people have made me angry , and I have abandoned you .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	30	You have disobeyed me by putting your disgusting idols in my temple , and now the temple itself is disgusting to me .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	31	( D ) At Topheth in Hinnom Valley you have built altars where you kill your children and burn them as sacrifices to other gods . I would never think of telling you to do this .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	32	So watch out ! Someday that place will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley . It will be called Slaughter Valley , because you will bury your dead there until you run out of room ,
CEV	Jeremiah	7	33	and then bodies will lie scattered on the ground . Birds and wild animals will come and eat , and no one will be around to scare them off .
CEV	Jeremiah	7	34	( E ) When I am finished with your land , there will be deathly silence in the empty ruins of Jerusalem and the towns of Judah—no happy voices , no sounds of parties or wedding celebrations . Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	8	3	Some of you people of Judah will be left alive , but I will force you to go to foreign countries , and you will wish you were dead . I , the Lord God All-Powerful , have spoken . The People Took the Wrong Road
CEV	Jeremiah	8	4	The Lord said : People of Jerusalem , when you stumble and fall , you get back up , and if you take a wrong road , you turn around and go back . [ a ]
CEV	Jeremiah	8	5	So why do you refuse to come back to me ? Why do you hold so tightly to your false gods ?
CEV	Jeremiah	8	6	I listen carefully , but none of you admit that you 've done wrong . Without a second thought , you run down the wrong road [ b ] like horses running blindly into battle .
CEV	Jeremiah	8	7	Storks , doves , swallows , and thrushes all know when it 's time to fly away for the winter and when to come back . But you , my people , do n't know what I demand .

CEV	Jeremiah	8	10	( A ) I 'll give their wives and fields to strangers . Everyone is greedy and dishonest , whether poor or rich . Even the prophets and priests can not be trusted .
CEV	Jeremiah	8	11	( B ) All they ever offer to my deeply wounded people are empty hopes for peace .
CEV	Jeremiah	8	12	They should be ashamed of the way they live , but they do n't even blush . And so , when I punish Judah , they will end up on the ground , dead like everyone else .

CEV	Jeremiah	8	14	The people of Judah say to each other , “ What are we waiting for ? Let 's run to a town with walls and die there . We rebelled against the Lord , and we were sentenced to die by drinking poison .
CEV	Jeremiah	8	15	We had hoped for peace and a time of healing , but all we got was terror .
CEV	Jeremiah	8	16	Our enemies have reached the town of Dan in the north , and the snorting of their horses makes us tremble with fear . The enemy will destroy Jerusalem and our entire nation . No one will survive. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	8	17	“ Watch out ! ” the Lord says . “ I 'm sending poisonous snakes to attack you , and no one can stop them. ” Jeremiah Mourns for His People
CEV	Jeremiah	8	18	I 'm burdened with sorrow and feel like giving up .
CEV	Jeremiah	8	19	In a foreign land my people are crying . Listen ! You 'll hear them say , “ Has the Lord deserted Zion ? Is he no longer its king ? ” I hear the Lord reply , “ Why did you make me angry by worshiping useless idols ? ”
CEV	Jeremiah	8	20	The people complain , “ Spring and summer have come and gone , but still the Lord has n't rescued us. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	8	21	My people are crushed , and so is my heart . I am horrified and mourn .

CEV	Jeremiah	9	9	Give me one good reason not to punish them as they deserve . I , the Lord All-Powerful , have spoken . Jeremiah Weeps for His People
CEV	Jeremiah	9	2	I wish I could go into the desert and find a hiding place from all who are treacherous and unfaithful to God . The Lord Answers Jeremiah
CEV	Jeremiah	9	3	The Lord replied : Lies come from the mouths of my people , like arrows from a bow . With each dishonest deed their power increases , and not one of them will admit that I am God .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	4	Jeremiah , all your friends and relatives tell lies about you , so do n't trust them .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	5	They wear themselves out , always looking for a new way to cheat their friends .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	6	Everyone takes advantage of everyone else , and no one will admit that I am God .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	7	And so I will purify the hearts of my people just as gold is purified in a furnace . I have no other choice .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	8	They say they want peace , but this lie is deadly , like an arrow that strikes when you least expect it .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	10	I weep for the pastureland in the hill country . It 's so barren and scorched that no one travels there . No cattle can be found there , and birds and wild animals have all disappeared .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	11	I heard the Lord reply , “ When I am finished , Jerusalem and the towns of Judah will be piles of ruins where only jackals [ a ] live. ” Why the Land Was Destroyed
CEV	Jeremiah	9	12	I said to the Lord , “ None of us can understand why the land has become like an uncrossable desert . Wo n't you explain why ? ”
CEV	Jeremiah	9	13	The Lord said : I destroyed the land because the people disobeyed me and rejected my laws and teachings .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	14	They were stubborn and worshiped Baal , [ b ] just as their ancestors did .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	15	So I , the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , promise them poison to eat and drink . [ c ]
CEV	Jeremiah	9	16	I 'll scatter them in foreign countries that they and their ancestors have never even heard of . Finally , I will send enemy soldiers to kill every last one of them . The Women Who Are Paid To Weep
CEV	Jeremiah	9	17	The Lord All-Powerful said , “ Make arrangements now for the women who are paid to weep at funerals , [ d ] especially the women who can cry the loudest. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	9	18	The people answered , “ Let them come quickly and cry for us , until our own eyes are flooded with tears .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	19	Now those of us on Zion cry , ‘ We are ruined ! We ca n't stand the shame . Our homes have been destroyed , and we must leave our land. ’
CEV	Jeremiah	9	20	“ We ask you women to pay attention to what the Lord says . We will teach you a funeral song that you can teach your daughters and friends :
CEV	Jeremiah	9	21	‘ We were in our fortress , but death sneaked in through our windows . It even struck down children at play and our strongest young men. ’
CEV	Jeremiah	9	22	“ The Lord has told us the ground will be covered with dead bodies , like ungathered stalks of grain or manure in a field. ” What the Lord Likes Best
CEV	Jeremiah	9	23	The Lord says : Do n't brag about your wisdom or strength or wealth .
CEV	Jeremiah	9	24	( A ) If you feel you must brag , then have enough sense to brag about worshiping me , the Lord . What I like best is showing kindness , justice , and mercy to everyone on earth . 25-26 Someday I will punish the nations of Egypt , Edom , Ammon , and Moab , and the tribes of the desert . [ e ] The men of these nations are circumcised , but they do n't worship me . And it 's the same with you people of Judah . Your bodies are circumcised , but your hearts are unchanged .

CEV	Jeremiah	10	10	You , Lord , are the only true and living God . You will rule for all time . When you are angry the earth shakes , and nations are destroyed .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	3	Their religion is worthless ! They chop down a tree , carve the wood into an idol ,
CEV	Jeremiah	10	4	cover it with silver and gold , and then nail it down so it wo n't fall over .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	5	An idol is no better than a scarecrow . It ca n't speak , and it has to be carried , because it ca n't walk . Why worship an idol that ca n't help or harm you ? Jeremiah Praises the Lord
CEV	Jeremiah	10	6	Our Lord , great and powerful , you alone are God .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	7	( A ) You are King of the nations . Everyone should worship you . No human anywhere on earth is wiser than you .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	8	Idols are worthless , and anyone who worships them is a fool !
CEV	Jeremiah	10	9	Idols are made by humans . A carver shapes the wood . A metalworker hammers out a covering of gold from Uphaz or of silver from Tarshish . Then the idol is dressed in blue and purple clothes .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	11	You told me to say that idols did not create the heavens and the earth , and that you , the Lord , will destroy every idol .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	12	With your wisdom and power you created the earth and spread out the heavens .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	13	The waters in the heavens roar at your command . You make clouds appear— you send the winds from your storehouse and make lightning flash in the rain .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	14	People who make idols are so stupid ! They will be disappointed , because their false gods are not alive .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	15	Idols are merely a joke , and when the time is right , they will be destroyed .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	16	But you , Israel 's God , created all things , and you chose Israel to be your very own . Your name is the Lord All-Powerful . Judah Will Be Thrown from Its Land
CEV	Jeremiah	10	17	I said to the people of Judah , “ Gather your things ; you are surrounded .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	18	The Lord said these troubles will lead to your capture , and he will throw you from this land like a rock from a sling. ” [ a ]
CEV	Jeremiah	10	19	The people answered , “ We are wounded and doomed to die . Why did we say we could stand the pain ?
CEV	Jeremiah	10	20	Our homes are destroyed ; our children are dead . No one is left to help us find shelter. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	10	21	But I told them , “ Our leaders were stupid failures , because they refused to listen to the Lord . And so we 've been scattered like sheep .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	22	“ Sounds of destruction rumble from the north like distant thunder . Soon our towns will be ruins where only jackals [ b ] live. ” Jeremiah Prays
CEV	Jeremiah	10	23	I know , Lord , that we humans are not in control of our own lives .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	24	Correct me , as I deserve , but not in your anger , or I will be dead .
CEV	Jeremiah	10	25	Our enemies refuse to admit that you are God or to worship you . They have wiped out our people and left our nation lying in ruins . So get angry and sweep them away ! Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	11	11	Here is what I 've decided to do . I will bring suffering on the people of Judah and Jerusalem , and no one will escape . They will beg me to help , but I wo n't listen to their prayers . 12-13 Then they will offer sacrifices to their other gods and ask them for help . After all , the people of Judah have more gods than towns , and more shameful altars for Baal than there are streets in Jerusalem . But those gods wo n't be able to rescue the people of Judah from disaster .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	4	My commands have n't changed since I brought your ancestors out of Egypt , a nation that seemed like a blazing furnace where iron ore is melted . I told your ancestors that if they obeyed my commands , I would be their God , and they would be my people .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	5	Then I did what I had promised and gave them this wonderful land , where you now live . “ Yes , Lord , ” I replied , “ that 's true. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	11	6	Then the Lord told me to say to everyone on the streets of Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah : Pay attention to the commands in my agreement with you .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	7	Ever since I brought your ancestors out of Egypt , I have been telling your people to obey me . But you and your ancestors
CEV	Jeremiah	11	8	have always been stubborn . You have refused to listen , and instead you have done whatever your sinful hearts have desired . You have not kept the agreement we made , so I will make you suffer every curse that goes with it .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	9	The Lord said to me : Jeremiah , the people of Judah and Jerusalem are plotting against me .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	10	They have sinned in the same way their ancestors did , by turning from me and worshiping other gods . The northern kingdom of Israel broke the agreement I made with your ancestors , and now the southern kingdom of Judah [ a ] has done the same .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	14	Jeremiah , do n't pray for these people or beg me to rescue them . If you do , I wo n't listen , and I certainly wo n't listen if they pray !
CEV	Jeremiah	11	15	Then the Lord told me to say to the people of Judah : You are my chosen people , but you have no right to be here in my temple , doing such evil things . The sacrifices you offer me wo n't protect you from disaster , so stop celebrating . [ b ]
CEV	Jeremiah	11	16	Once you were like an olive tree covered with fruit . But soon I will send a noisy mob to break off your branches and set you on fire .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	17	I am the Lord All-Powerful . You people of Judah were like a tree that I had planted , but you have made me angry by offering sacrifices to Baal , just as the northern kingdom did . And now I 'm going to pull you up by the roots . The Plot To Kill Jeremiah *
CEV	Jeremiah	11	18	Some people plotted to kill me . And like a lamb being led to the butcher , I knew nothing about their plans .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	19	But then the Lord told me that they had planned to chop me down like a tree— fruit and all— so that no one would ever remember me again .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	20	( A ) I prayed , “ Lord All-Powerful , you always do what is right , and you know every thought . So I trust you to help me and to take revenge. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	11	21	Then the Lord said : Jeremiah , some men from Anathoth [ c ] say they will kill you , if you keep on speaking for me .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	22	But I will punish them . Their young men will die in battle , and their children will starve to death .
CEV	Jeremiah	11	23	And when I am finished , no one from their families will be left alive . Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	12	12	A destroying army marches along desert roads and attacks everywhere . They are my deadly sword ; no one is safe from them .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	2	You plant them like trees ; you let them prosper and produce fruit . Yet even when they praise you , they do n't mean it .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	3	But you know , Lord , how faithful I 've always been , even in my thoughts . So drag my enemies away and butcher them like sheep !
CEV	Jeremiah	12	4	How long will the ground be dry and the pasturelands parched ? The birds and animals are dead and gone . And all of this happened because the people are so sinful . They even brag , “ God ca n't see the sins we commit. ” [ a ] The Lord Answers Jeremiah
CEV	Jeremiah	12	5	Jeremiah , if you get tired in a race against people , how can you possibly run against horses ? If you fall in open fields , what will happen in the forest along the Jordan River ?
CEV	Jeremiah	12	6	Even your own family has turned against you . They act friendly , but do n't trust them . They 're out to get you , and so is everyone else . The Lord Is Furious with His People
CEV	Jeremiah	12	7	I loved my people and chose them as my very own . But now I will reject them and hand them over to their enemies .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	8	My people have turned against me and roar at me like lions . That 's why I hate them .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	9	My people are like a hawk surrounded and attacked by other hawks . [ b ] Tell the wild animals to come and eat their fill .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	10	My beautiful land is ruined like a field or a vineyard trampled by shepherds and stripped bare by their flocks .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	11	Every field I see lies barren , and no one cares .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	13	My people , you planted wheat , but because I was furious , I let only weeds grow . You wore yourselves out and gained only shame ! The Lord Will Have Pity on Other Nations
CEV	Jeremiah	12	14	The Lord said : I gave this land to my people Israel , but enemies around it have attacked and robbed it . So I will uproot them from their own countries just as I will uproot Judah from its land .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	15	But later , I will have pity on these nations and bring them back to their own lands .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	16	They once taught my people to worship Baal . But if they admit I am the only true God , and if they let my people teach them how to worship me , these nations will also become my people .
CEV	Jeremiah	12	17	However , if they do n't listen to me , I will uproot them from their lands and completely destroy them . I , the Lord , have spoken . Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	13	13	Then say to them : I am the Lord , and what I 'm going to do will make everyone in Judah and Jerusalem appear to be full of wine . And the worst ones will be the kings of David 's family and the priests and the prophets .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought a pair of shorts and put them on .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	3	Then the Lord said ,
CEV	Jeremiah	13	4	“ Take off the shorts . Go to Parah [ a ] and hide the shorts in a crack between some large rocks. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	13	5	And that 's what I did .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	6	Some time later the Lord said , “ Go back and get the shorts. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	13	7	I went back and dug the shorts out of their hiding place , but the cloth had rotted , and the shorts were ruined .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	8	Then the Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	13	9	Jeremiah , I will use Babylonia to [ b ] destroy the pride of the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	10	The people of Judah are evil and stubborn . So instead of listening to me , they do whatever they want and even worship other gods . When I am finished with these people , they will be good for nothing , just like this pair of shorts .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	11	These shorts were tight around your waist , and that 's how tightly I held onto the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . I wanted them to be my people . I wanted to make them famous , so that other nations would praise and honor me , but they refused to obey me . Wine Jars The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	13	12	Jeremiah , tell the people of Judah , “ The Lord God of Israel orders you to fill your wine jars with wine. ” They will answer , “ Of course we fill our wine jars with wine ! Why are you telling us something we already know ? ”
CEV	Jeremiah	13	14	Then I will smash them against each other like jars . I will have no pity on the young or the old , and they will all be destroyed . I , the Lord , have spoken . The People of Judah Will Be Taken Away
CEV	Jeremiah	13	15	People of Judah , do n't be too proud to listen to what the Lord has said .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	16	You hope for light , but God is sending darkness . Evening shadows already deepen in the hills . So return to God and confess your sins to him before you trip and fall .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	17	If you are too proud to listen , I will weep alone . Tears will stream from my eyes when the Lord 's people are taken away as prisoners .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	18	The Lord told me to tell you that your king and his mother [ c ] must surrender their thrones and remove their crowns . [ d ]
CEV	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities in the Southern Desert are surrounded ; no one can get in or out . Everyone in Judah will be taken away .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	20	Jerusalem , you were so proud of ruling the people of Judah . But where are they now ? Look north , and you will see your enemies approaching .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	21	You once trusted them to help , but now I 'll let them rule you . [ e ] What do you say about that ? You will be in pain like a woman giving birth .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	22	Do you know why your clothes were torn off and you were abused ? It was because of your terrible sins .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	23	Can you ever change and do what 's right ? Can people change the color of their skin , or can a leopard remove its spots ? If so , then maybe you can change and learn to do right .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	24	I will scatter you , just as the desert wind blows husks from grain tossed in the air .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	25	I wo n't change my mind . I , the Lord , have spoken . You rejected me and worshiped false gods . *
CEV	Jeremiah	13	26	You were married to me , but you were unfaithful . You even became a prostitute [ f ] by worshiping disgusting gods on hilltops and in fields .
CEV	Jeremiah	13	27	So I 'll rip off your clothes and leave you naked and ashamed for everyone to see . You are doomed ! Will you ever be worthy to worship me again ?

CEV	Jeremiah	14	14	The Lord answered : They claim to speak for me , but they 're lying ! I did n't even speak to them , much less choose them to be my prophets . Their messages come from worthless dreams , useless fortunetelling , and their own imaginations .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	2	Judah and Jerusalem weep as the land dries up .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	3	Rulers send their servants to the storage pits for water . [ a ] But there 's none to be found ; they return in despair with their jars still empty .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	4	There has been no rain , and farmers feel sick as they watch cracks appear in the dry ground . [ b ]
CEV	Jeremiah	14	5	A deer gives birth in a field , then abandons her newborn fawn and leaves in search of grass .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	6	Wild donkeys go blind from starvation . So they stand on barren hilltops and sniff the air , [ c ] hoping to smell green grass . The Lord 's People Pray
CEV	Jeremiah	14	7	We rejected you and did evil , so we deserve to be punished . But if you rescue us , Lord , everyone will see how great you are .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	8	You 're our only hope ; you alone can save us now . You help us one day , but you 're gone the next .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	9	Did this disaster take you by surprise ? Are you a warrior with your hands tied ? You have chosen us , and your temple is here . Do n't abandon us ! The Lord 's Answer
CEV	Jeremiah	14	10	My people , you love to wander away ; you do n't even try to stay close to me . So now I will reject you and punish you for your sins . I , the Lord , have spoken . Lying Prophets
CEV	Jeremiah	14	11	The Lord said , “ Jeremiah , do n't ask me to help these people .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	12	They may even go without eating [ d ] and offer sacrifices to please me [ e ] and to give thanks . [ f ] But when they cry out for my help , I wo n't listen , and I wo n't accept their sacrifices . Instead , I 'll send war , starvation , and disease to wipe them out. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	14	13	I replied , “ The other prophets keep telling everyone that you wo n't send starvation or war , and that you 're going to give us peace. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	14	15	Those lying prophets say there will be peace and plenty of food . But I say that those same prophets will die from war and hunger .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	16	And everyone who listens to them will be killed , just as they deserve . Their dead bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem , because their families will also be dead , and no one will be left to bury them . [ g ]
CEV	Jeremiah	14	17	Jeremiah , go and tell the people how you feel about all this . So I told them : “ Tears will flood my eyes both day and night , because my nation suffers from a deadly wound .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	18	In the fields I see the bodies of those killed in battle . And in the towns I see crowds dying of hunger . But the prophets and priests go about their business , without understanding what has happened. ” [ h ] Jeremiah Prays to the Lord
CEV	Jeremiah	14	19	Have you rejected Judah , Lord ? Do you hate Jerusalem ? Why did you strike down Judah with a fatal wound ? We had hoped for peace and a time of healing , but all we got was terror .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	20	We and our ancestors are guilty of rebelling against you .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	21	If you save us , it will show how great you are . Do n't let our enemies disgrace your temple , your beautiful throne . Do n't forget that you promised to rescue us .
CEV	Jeremiah	14	22	Idols ca n't send rain , and showers do n't fall by themselves . Only you control the rain , so we put our trust in you , the Lord our God .

CEV	Jeremiah	15	4	( C ) This punishment will happen because of the horrible things [ a ] your King Manasseh [ b ] did . And you will be disgusting to all nations on earth .
CEV	Jeremiah	15	5	People of Jerusalem , who will feel sorry for you ? Will anyone bother to ask if you are well ?

CEV	Jeremiah	16	19	Our Lord , you are the one who gives me strength and protects me like a fortress when I am in trouble . People will come to you from distant nations and say , “ Our ancestors worshiped false and useless gods ,
CEV	Jeremiah	16	20	worthless idols made by human hands. ”

CEV	Jeremiah	17	18	Keep me from failure and disgrace , but make my enemies fail and be disgraced . Send destruction to make their worst fears come true . Resting on the Sabbath 19-20 The Lord said : Jeremiah , stand at each city gate in Jerusalem , including the one the king uses , and speak to him and everyone else . Tell them I have said : I am the Lord , so pay attention . 21-24 ( C ) If you value your lives , do n't do any work on the Sabbath . Do n't carry anything through the city gates or through the door of your house , or anywhere else . Keep the Sabbath day sacred ! I gave this command to your ancestors , but they were stubborn and refused to obey or to be corrected . But if you obey ,
CEV	Jeremiah	17	25	then Judah and Jerusalem will always be ruled by kings from David 's family . The king and his officials will ride through these gates on horses or in chariots , and the people of Judah and Jerusalem will be with them . There will always be people living in Jerusalem ,
CEV	Jeremiah	17	26	and others will come here from the nearby villages , from the towns of Judah and Benjamin , [ f ] from the hill country and the foothills to the west , and from the Southern Desert . They will bring sacrifices to please me and to give me thanks , [ g ] as well as offerings of grain and incense .
CEV	Jeremiah	17	27	But if you keep on carrying things through the city gates on the Sabbath and keep treating it as any other day , I will set fire to these gates and burn down the whole city , including the fortresses .

CEV	Jeremiah	18	18	Some of the people said , “ Let 's get rid of Jeremiah ! We will always have priests to teach us God 's laws , as well as wise people to give us advice , and prophets to speak the Lord 's messages . So , instead of listening to Jeremiah any longer , let 's accuse him of a crime. ” Jeremiah Prays about His Enemies
CEV	Jeremiah	18	2	“ Jeremiah , go to the pottery shop , and when you get there , I will tell you what to say to the people. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	18	3	I went there and saw the potter making clay pots on his pottery wheel .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	4	And whenever the clay would not take the shape he wanted , he would change his mind and form it into some other shape .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the Lord told me to say :
CEV	Jeremiah	18	6	People of Israel , I , the Lord , have power over you , just as a potter has power over clay .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	7	If I threaten to uproot and shatter an evil nation ,
CEV	Jeremiah	18	8	and that nation turns from its evil , I will change my mind .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	9	If I promise to make a nation strong ,
CEV	Jeremiah	18	10	but its people start disobeying me and doing evil , then I will change my mind and not help them at all .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	11	So listen to me , people of Judah and Jerusalem ! I have decided to strike you with disaster , and I wo n't change my mind unless you stop sinning and start living right .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	12	But I know you wo n't listen . You might as well answer , “ We do n't care what you say . We have made plans to sin , and we are going to be stubborn and do as we please ! ”
CEV	Jeremiah	18	13	So I , the Lord , command you to ask the nations , and find out if they have ever heard of such a horrible sin as what you have done .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	14	. Copyright ©
CEV	Jeremiah	18	15	But you , my people , have turned from me to burn incense to worthless idols . You have left the ancient road to follow an unknown path where you stumble over idols .

CEV	Jeremiah	18	17	When your enemies attack , I will scatter you like dust blown by an eastern wind . Then , on that day of disaster , I will turn my back on you . The Plot against Jeremiah
CEV	Jeremiah	18	19	Please , Lord , answer my prayer . Make my enemies stop accusing me of evil .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	20	I tried to help them , but they are paying me back by digging a pit to trap me . I even begged you not to punish them .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	21	But now I am asking you to let their children starve or be killed in war . Let women lose their husbands and sons to disease and violence .
CEV	Jeremiah	18	22	These people have dug pits and set traps for me , Lord . Make them scream in fear when you send enemy troops to attack their homes .

CEV	Jeremiah	19	19	The Lord said : Jeremiah , go to the pottery shop and buy a clay jar . Then take along some of the city officials and leading priests
CEV	Jeremiah	19	2	( A ) and go to Hinnom Valley , just outside Potsherd [ a ] Gate . Tell the people that I have said :
CEV	Jeremiah	19	3	I am the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , and you kings of Judah and you people of Jerusalem had better pay attention . I am going to bring so much trouble on this valley that everyone who hears about it will be shocked . 4-5 ( B ) The people of Judah stopped worshiping me and made this valley into a place of worship for Baal and other gods that have never helped them or their ancestors or their kings . And they have committed murder here , burning their young , innocent children as sacrifices to Baal . I have never even thought of telling you to do that .
CEV	Jeremiah	19	6	So watch out ! Someday this place will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley . It will be called Slaughter Valley !
CEV	Jeremiah	19	7	You people of Judah and Jerusalem may have big plans , but here in this valley I 'll ruin [ b ] those plans . I 'll let your enemies kill you , and I 'll tell the birds and wild animals to eat your dead bodies .
CEV	Jeremiah	19	8	I will turn Jerusalem into a pile of rubble , and every passerby will be shocked and horrified and will make insulting remarks .
CEV	Jeremiah	19	9	And while your enemies are trying to break through your city walls to kill you , the food supply will run out . You will become so hungry that you will eat the flesh of your friends and even of your own children .
CEV	Jeremiah	19	10	Jeremiah , as soon as you have said this , smash the jar while the people are watching .
CEV	Jeremiah	19	11	Then tell them that I have also said : I am the Lord All-Powerful , and I warn you that I will shatter Judah and Jerusalem just like this jar that is broken beyond repair . You will bury your dead here in Topheth , but so many of you will die that there wo n't be enough room . 12-13 I will make Jerusalem as unclean as Topheth , by filling the city with your dead bodies . I will do this because you and your kings have gone up to the roofs of your houses and burned incense to the stars in the sky , as though they were gods . And you have given sacrifices of wine to foreign gods . Jeremiah Speaks in the Temple Courtyard
CEV	Jeremiah	19	14	I went to Topheth , where I told the people what the Lord had said . Then I went to the temple courtyard and shouted to the people ,
CEV	Jeremiah	19	15	“ Listen , everyone ! Some time ago , the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , warned you that he would bring disaster on Jerusalem and all nearby villages . But you were stubborn and refused to listen . Now the Lord is going to bring the disaster he promised. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	20	20	Pashhur son of Immer was a priest and the chief of temple security . He heard what I had said ,
CEV	Jeremiah	20	2	and so he hit me . [ a ] Then he had me arrested and put in chains [ b ] at the Benjamin Gate in the Lord 's temple . [ c ]
CEV	Jeremiah	20	3	The next day , when Pashhur let me go free , I told him that the Lord had said : No longer will I call you Pashhur . Instead , I will call you Afraid-of-Everything . [ d ]
CEV	Jeremiah	20	4	You will be afraid , and you will bring fear to your friends as well . You will see enemies kill them in battle . Then I will let the king of Babylonia take everyone in Judah prisoner , killing some and dragging the rest away to Babylonia .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	5	He will clean out the royal treasury and take everything else of value from Jerusalem .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	6	Pashhur , you are guilty of telling lies and claiming they were messages from me . That 's why I will let the Babylonians take you , your family , and your friends as prisoners to Babylonia , where you will all die and be buried . Jeremiah Complains to the Lord
CEV	Jeremiah	20	7	You tricked me , Lord , and I was really fooled . You are stronger than I am , and you have defeated me . People never stop sneering and insulting me .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	8	You have let me announce only injustice and death . Your message has brought me nothing but insults and trouble .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	9	Sometimes I tell myself not to think about you , Lord , or even mention your name . But your message burns in my heart and bones , and I can not keep silent .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	10	I heard the crowds whisper , “ Everyone is afraid . Now 's our chance to accuse Jeremiah ! ” All of my so-called friends are just waiting for me to make a mistake . They say , “ Maybe Jeremiah can be tricked . Then we can overpower him and get even at last. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	20	11	But you , Lord , are a mighty soldier , standing at my side . Those troublemakers will fall down and fail— terribly embarrassed , forever ashamed .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	12	Lord All-Powerful , you test those who do right , and you know every heart and mind . I have told you my complaints , so let me watch you take revenge on my enemies .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	13	I sing praises to you , Lord . You rescue the oppressed from the wicked .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	14	( A ) Put a curse on the day I was born ! Do n't bless that day .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	15	Put a curse on the man who told my father , “ Good news ! You have a son. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	20	16	May that man be like the towns you destroyed without pity . Let him hear shouts of alarm in the morning and battle cries at noon .
CEV	Jeremiah	20	17	He deserves to die for not killing me before I was born . Then my mother 's body would have been my grave .

CEV	Jeremiah	21	21	King Zedekiah [ a ] of Judah sent for Pashhur son of Malchiah and for a priest named Zephaniah son of Maaseiah . Then he told them , “ Talk with Jeremiah for me. ” So they came to me and said ,
CEV	Jeremiah	21	2	( A ) “ King Nebuchadnezzar [ b ] of Babylonia has attacked Judah . Please ask the Lord to work miracles for our people , as he has done in the past , so that Nebuchadnezzar will leave us alone. ” 3-7 I told them that the Lord God of Israel had told me to say to King Zedekiah : The Babylonians have surrounded Jerusalem and want to kill you and your people . You are asking me to save you , but you have made me furious . So I will stretch out my mighty arm and fight against you myself . Your army is using spears and swords to fight the Babylonians , but I will make your own weapons turn and attack you . I will send a horrible disease to kill many of the people and animals in Jerusalem , and there will be nothing left to eat . Finally , I will let King Nebuchadnezzar and his army fight their way to the center of Jerusalem and capture everyone who is left alive , including you and your officials . But Nebuchadnezzar wo n't be kind or show any mercy—he will have you killed ! I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	21	8	( B ) Then I told them that the Lord had said : People of Jerusalem , I , the Lord , give you the choice of life or death .
CEV	Jeremiah	21	9	The Babylonian army has surrounded Jerusalem , so if you want to live , you must go out and surrender to them . But if you want to die because of hunger , disease , or war , then stay here in the city .
CEV	Jeremiah	21	10	I have decided not to rescue Jerusalem . Instead , I am going to let the king of Babylonia burn it to the ground . I , the Lord , have spoken . The Lord Warns the King of Judah *
CEV	Jeremiah	21	11	Pay attention , you that belong to the royal family .
CEV	Jeremiah	21	12	Each new day , make sure that justice is done , and rescue those who are being robbed . Or else my anger will flame up like a fire that never goes out .
CEV	Jeremiah	21	13	Jerusalem , from your mountaintop you look out over the valleys [ c ] and think you are safe . But I , the Lord , am angry ,

CEV	Jeremiah	22	22	Now you will be disgraced because of your sins . Your leaders will be swept away by the wind , and the nations you trusted will be captured and dragged to a foreign country .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	4	If you obey me , the kings from David 's family will continue to rule Judah from this palace . They and their officials will ride in and out on their horses or in their chariots .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	5	( A ) But if you ignore me , I promise in my own name that this palace will lie in ruins .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	6	Listen to what I think about it : The palace of Judah 's king is as glorious as Gilead or Lebanon 's highest peaks . But it will be as empty as a ghost-town when I 'm through with it .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	7	I 'll send troops to tear it apart , and its beautiful cedar beams will be used for firewood .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	8	People from different nations will pass by and ask , “ Why did the Lord do this to such a great city as Jerusalem ? ”
CEV	Jeremiah	22	9	Others will answer , “ It 's because the people worshiped foreign gods and broke the agreement that the Lord their God had made with them. ” King Jehoahaz The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	22	10	King Josiah is dead , so do n't mourn for him . [ a ] Instead , mourn for his son King Jehoahaz , dragged off to another country , [ b ] never to return . 11-12 ( B ) Jehoahaz [ c ] became king of Judah after his father King Josiah died . But Jehoahaz was taken as a prisoner to a foreign country . Now I , the Lord , promise that he will die there without ever seeing his own land again . King Jehoiakim The Lord told me to say : *
CEV	Jeremiah	22	13	King Jehoiakim , [ d ] you are doomed ! You built a palace with large rooms upstairs .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	14	You put in big windows and used cedar paneling and red paint . But you were unfair and forced the builders to work without pay . *
CEV	Jeremiah	22	15	More cedar in your palace does n't make you a better king than your father Josiah . He always did right— he gave justice to the poor and was honest .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	16	That 's what it means to truly know me . So he lived a comfortable life and always had enough to eat and drink .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	17	But all you think about is how to cheat or abuse or murder some innocent victim .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	18	( C ) Jehoiakim , no one will mourn at your funeral . They wo n't turn to each other and ask , “ Why did our great king have to die ? ”
CEV	Jeremiah	22	19	You will be given a burial fit for a donkey ; your body will be dragged outside the city gates and tossed in the dirt . I , the Lord , have spoken . King Jehoiachin and the People of Jerusalem The Lord told me to say :
CEV	Jeremiah	22	20	People of Jerusalem , the nations [ e ] you trusted have been crushed . Go to Lebanon and weep ; cry in the land of Bashan and in Moab .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	21	When times were good , I warned you . But you ignored me , just as you have done since Israel was young .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	23	Those who live in the palace paneled with cedar [ f ] will groan with pain like women giving birth .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	24	( D ) King Jehoiachin , [ g ] son of Jehoiakim , [ h ] even if you were the ring I wear as the sign of my royal power , I would still pull you from my finger .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	25	I would hand you over to the enemy you fear , to King Nebuchadnezzar [ i ] and his army , who want to kill you .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	26	You and your mother [ j ] were born in Judah , but I will throw both of you into a foreign country , where you will die ,
CEV	Jeremiah	22	27	longing to return home .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	28	Jehoiachin , you are unwanted like a broken clay pot . So you and your children will be thrown into a country you know nothing about .
CEV	Jeremiah	22	29	Land of Judah , I am the Lord . Now listen to what I say !
CEV	Jeremiah	22	30	Erase the names of Jehoiachin 's children from the royal records . He is a complete failure , and so none of them will ever be king . I , the Lord , have spoken .

CEV	Jeremiah	23	9	When I think of the prophets , I am shocked , and I tremble [ a ] like someone drunk , because of the Lord and his sacred words .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	10	. - 23.14 in marriage : Or “ to me. ” - 23.14 never tell the truth : Or “ worship other gods. ” - 23.14 Sodom and Gomorrah : Two cities that the Lord destroyed because their people were so evil ( see Genesis 18.16—19.29 ) . - 23.18 a meeting of my council in heaven : Sometimes , prophets had visions of the Lord meeting with his angels ( see
CEV	Jeremiah	23	11	The Lord told me to say : You prophets and priests think so little of me , the Lord , that you even sin in my own temple !
CEV	Jeremiah	23	12	Now I will punish you with disaster , and you will slip and fall in the darkness . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	13	The prophets in Samaria were repulsive to me , because they preached in the name of Baal and led my people astray .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	14	( C ) And you prophets in Jerusalem are even worse . You 're unfaithful in marriage [ c ] and never tell the truth . [ d ] You even lead others to sin instead of helping them turn back to me . You and the people of Jerusalem are evil like Sodom and Gomorrah . [ e ]
CEV	Jeremiah	23	15	You prophets in Jerusalem have spread evil everywhere . That 's why I , the Lord , promise to give you bitter poison to eat and drink . The Lord Gives a Warning The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	23	16	Do n't listen to the lies of these false prophets , you people of Judah ! The message they preach is something they imagined ; it did not come from me , the Lord All-Powerful .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	17	These prophets go to people who refuse to respect me and who are stubborn and do whatever they please . The prophets tell them , “ The Lord has promised everything will be fine. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	23	18	But I , the Lord , tell you that these prophets have never attended a meeting of my council in heaven [ f ] or heard me speak .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	19	They are evil ! So in my anger I will strike them like a violent storm .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	20	I wo n't calm down , until I have finished what I have decided to do . Someday you will understand exactly what I mean .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	21	I did not send these prophets or speak to them , but they ran to find you and to preach their message .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	22	If they had been in a meeting of my council in heaven , they would have told you people of Judah to give up your sins and come back to me .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	24	( D ) in heaven and on earth . There are no secret places where you can hide from me .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	25	These unfaithful prophets claim that I have given them a dream or a vision , and then they tell lies in my name .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	26	But everything they say comes from their own twisted minds . How long can this go on ?
CEV	Jeremiah	23	27	They tell each other their dreams and try to get my people to reject me , just as their ancestors left me and worshiped Baal .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	28	Their dreams and my truth are as different as straw and wheat . But when prophets speak for me , they must say only what I have told them .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	29	My words are a powerful fire ; they are a hammer that shatters rocks . 30-32 These unfaithful prophets claim I give them their dreams , but it is n't true . I did n't choose them to be my prophets , and yet they babble on and on , speaking in my name , while stealing words from each other . And when my people hear these liars , they are led astray instead of being helped . So I warn you that I am now the enemy of these prophets . I , the Lord , have spoken . News and Nuisance The Lord said to me :
CEV	Jeremiah	23	33	Jeremiah , when a prophet or a priest or anyone else comes to you and asks , “ Does the Lord have news for us ? ” tell them , “ You people are a nuisance [ g ] to the Lord , and he [ h ] will get rid of you. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	23	34	If any of you say , “ Here is news from the Lord , ” I will punish you and your families , even if you are a prophet or a priest .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	35	Instead , you must ask your friends and relatives , “ What answer did the Lord give ? ” or “ What has the Lord said ? ”
CEV	Jeremiah	23	36	It seems that you each have your own news ! So if you say , “ Here is news from the Lord , ” you are twisting my words into a lie . Remember that I am your God , the Lord All-Powerful .
CEV	Jeremiah	23	37	If you go to a prophet , it 's all right to ask , “ What answer did the Lord give to my question ? ” or “ What has the Lord said ? ”
CEV	Jeremiah	23	38	But if you disobey me and say , “ Here is news from the Lord , ”
CEV	Jeremiah	23	39	. - 23.33 You people are a nuisance to the Lord , and he : Two ancient translations ; Hebrew “ Does the Lord have news for us ? He. ” - 23.39 pick you up : A few Hebrew manuscripts and three ancient translations ; most Hebrew manuscripts “ forget you completely. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	24	24	( A ) The Lord spoke to me in a vision after King Nebuchadnezzar [ a ] of Babylonia had come to Judah and taken King Jehoiachin , [ b ] his officials , and all the skilled workers back to Babylonia . In this vision I saw two baskets of figs in front of the Lord 's temple .
CEV	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket was full of very good figs that ripened early , and the other was full of rotten figs that were not fit to eat .

CEV	Jeremiah	25	4	The Lord has sent prophets to you time after time , but you refused to listen .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	5	They told you that the Lord had said : Change your ways ! If you stop doing evil , I will let you stay forever in this land that I gave your ancestors .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	6	I do n't want to harm you . So do n't make me angry by worshiping idols and other gods .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	7	But you refused to listen to my prophets . So I , the Lord , say that you have made me angry by worshiping idols , and you are the ones who were hurt by what you did .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	8	You refused to listen to me ,
CEV	Jeremiah	25	9	and now I will let you be attacked by nations from the north , and especially by my servant , King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia . You and other nearby nations will be destroyed and left in ruins forever . Everyone who sees what has happened will be shocked , but they will still make fun of you .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	10	( B ) I will put an end to your parties and wedding celebrations ; no one will grind grain or be here to light the lamps at night .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	11	( C ) This country will be as empty as a desert , because I will make all of you the slaves of the king of Babylonia for
CEV	Jeremiah	25	70	years .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	12	When that time is up , I will punish the king of Babylonia and his people for everything they have done wrong , and I will turn that country into a wasteland forever .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	13	My servant Jeremiah has told you what I said I will do to Babylonia and to the other nations , and he wrote it all down in this book . I will do everything I threatened .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	14	I will pay back the Babylonians for every wrong they have done . Great kings from many other nations will conquer the Babylonians and force them to be slaves . The Cup Full of God 's Anger
CEV	Jeremiah	25	15	The Lord God of Israel showed me a vision in which he said , “ Jeremiah , here is a cup filled with the wine of my anger . Take it and make every nation drink some .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	16	They will vomit and act crazy , because of the war this cup of anger will bring to them. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	25	17	I took the cup from the Lord 's hand , and I went to the kings of the nations and made each of them drink some .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	18	I started with Jerusalem and the towns of Judah , and the king and his officials were removed from power in disgrace . Everyone still makes insulting jokes about them and uses their names as curse words .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	19	The second place I went was Egypt , where everyone had to drink from the cup , including the king and his officials , the other government workers , the rest of the Egyptians ,
CEV	Jeremiah	25	20	and all the foreigners who lived in the country . Next I went to the king of Uz , and then to the four kings of Philistia , who ruled from Ashkelon , Gaza , Ekron , and what was left of Ashdod . [ d ]
CEV	Jeremiah	25	21	Then I went to the kings of Edom , Moab , Ammon ,
CEV	Jeremiah	25	22	and to the kings of Tyre , Sidon , and their colonies across the sea . 23-24 After this , I went to the kings of Dedan , Tema , Buz , the tribes of the Arabian Desert , [ e ]
CEV	Jeremiah	25	26	and the countries in the north , both near and far . I went to all the countries on earth , one after another , and finally to Babylonia . [ f ]
CEV	Jeremiah	25	27	The Lord had said to tell each king , “ The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , commands you to drink from this cup that is full of the wine of his anger . It will make you so drunk that you will vomit . And when the Lord sends war against the nations , you will be completely defeated. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	25	28	The Lord told me that if any of them refused to drink from the cup , I must tell them that he had said , “ I , the Lord All-Powerful , command you to drink .

CEV	Jeremiah	25	31	My voice will be heard everywhere on earth , accusing nations of their crimes and sentencing the guilty to death . Disaster Is Coming
CEV	Jeremiah	25	32	The Lord All-Powerful says : You can see disaster spreading from far across the earth , from nation to nation like a horrible storm .
CEV	Jeremiah	25	33	When it strikes , I will kill so many people that their bodies will cover the ground like manure . No one will be left to bury them or to mourn . The Leaders of Judah Will Be Punished
CEV	Jeremiah	25	34	The Lord 's people are his flock , and you leaders were the shepherds . But now it 's your turn to be butchered like sheep . You 'll shatter like fine pottery dropped on the floor . [ g ] So roll on the ground , crying and mourning .

CEV	Jeremiah	26	26	( A ) Soon after Jehoiakim [ a ] became king of Judah , the Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	26	2	Jeremiah , I have a message for everyone who comes from the towns of Judah to worship in my temple . Go to the temple courtyard and speak every word that I tell you .
CEV	Jeremiah	26	3	Maybe the people will listen this time . And if they stop doing wrong , I will change my mind and not punish them for their sins .
CEV	Jeremiah	26	4	Tell them that I have said : You have refused to listen to me and to obey my laws and teachings .
CEV	Jeremiah	26	5	Again and again I have sent my servants the prophets to preach to you , but you ignored them as well . Now I am warning you that if you do n't start obeying me at once ,
CEV	Jeremiah	26	6	( B ) I will destroy this temple , just as I destroyed the town of Shiloh . [ b ] Then everyone on earth will use the name “ Jerusalem ” as a curse word . Jeremiah on Trial
CEV	Jeremiah	26	7	The priests , the prophets , and everyone else in the temple heard what I said , 8-9 and as soon as I finished , they all crowded around me and started shouting , “ Why did you preach that the Lord will destroy this temple , just as he destroyed Shiloh ? Why did you say that Jerusalem will be empty and lie in ruins ? You ought to be put to death for saying such things in the Lord 's name ! ” Then they had me arrested .
CEV	Jeremiah	26	10	The royal officers heard what had happened , and they came from the palace to the new gate of the temple to be the judges at my trial . [ c ]
CEV	Jeremiah	26	11	While they listened , the priests and the prophets said to the crowd , “ All of you have heard Jeremiah prophesy that Jerusalem will be destroyed . He deserves the death penalty. ” 12-13 Then I told the judges and everyone else : The Lord himself sent me to tell you about the terrible things he will do to you , to Jerusalem , and to the temple . But if you change your ways and start obeying the Lord , he will change his mind .
CEV	Jeremiah	26	14	You must decide what to do with me . Just do whatever you think is right .
CEV	Jeremiah	26	15	But if you put me to death , you and everyone else in Jerusalem will be guilty of murdering an innocent man , because everything I preached came from the Lord .
CEV	Jeremiah	26	16	The judges and the other people told the priests and prophets , “ Since Jeremiah only told us what the Lord our God had said , we do n't think he deserves to die. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	26	17	Then some of the leaders from other towns stepped forward . They told the crowd that
CEV	Jeremiah	26	18	( C ) years ago when Hezekiah [ d ] was king of Judah , a prophet named Micah from the town of Moresheth had said : “ I , the Lord All-Powerful , say Jerusalem will be plowed under and left in ruins . Thorns will cover the mountain where the temple now stands. ” [ e ]
CEV	Jeremiah	26	19	Then the leaders continued : No one put Micah to death for saying that . Instead , King Hezekiah prayed to the Lord with fear and trembling and asked him to have mercy . Then the Lord decided not to destroy Jerusalem , even though he had already said he would . People of Judah , if Jeremiah is killed , we will bring a terrible disaster on ourselves . 20-24 After these leaders finished speaking , an important man named Ahikam son of Shaphan spoke up for me as well . And so , I was n't handed over to the crowd to be killed . Uriah the Prophet While Jehoiakim [ f ] was still king of Judah , a man named Uriah son of Shemaiah left his hometown of Kiriath-Jearim and came to Jerusalem . Uriah was one of the Lord 's prophets , and he was saying the same things about Judah and Jerusalem that I had been saying . And when Jehoiakim and his officials and military officers heard what Uriah said , they tried to arrest him , but he escaped to Egypt . So Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Achbor and some other men after Uriah , and they brought him back . Then Jehoiakim had Uriah killed and his body dumped in a common burial pit .

CEV	Jeremiah	27	27	1-2 ( A ) Not long after Zedekiah became king of Judah , [ a ] the Lord told me : Jeremiah , make a wooden yoke [ b ] with leather straps , and place it on your neck .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	3	Then send a message [ c ] to the kings of Edom , Moab , Ammon , Tyre , and Sidon . Some officials from these countries are in Jerusalem , meeting with Zedekiah .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	4	So have them tell their kings that I have said : I am the All-Powerful Lord God of Israel ,
CEV	Jeremiah	27	5	and with my power I created the earth , its people , and all animals . I decide who will rule the earth , 6-7 ( B ) and I have chosen my servant King Nebuchadnezzar [ d ] of Babylonia to rule all nations , including yours . I will even let him rule the wild animals . All nations will be slaves of Nebuchadnezzar , his son , and his grandson . Then many nations will join together , and their kings will make slaves of the Babylonians .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	8	This yoke stands for the power of King Nebuchadnezzar , and I will destroy any nation that refuses to obey him . Nebuchadnezzar will attack , and many will die in battle or from hunger and disease .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	9	You might have people in your kingdom who claim they can tell the future by magic or by talking with the dead or by dreams or messages from a god . But do n't pay attention if any of them tell you not to obey Nebuchadnezzar .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	10	If you listen to such lies , I will have you dragged far from your country and killed .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	11	But if you and your nation are willing to obey Nebuchadnezzar , I will let you stay in your country , and your people will continue to live and work on their farms .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	12	After I had spoken to the officials from the nearby kingdoms , I went to King Zedekiah and told him the same thing . Then I said : Zedekiah , if you and the people of Judah want to stay alive , you must obey Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	13	But if you refuse , then you and your people will die from war , hunger , and disease , just as the Lord has warned .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	14	Your prophets have told you that you do n't need to obey Nebuchadnezzar , but do n't listen to their lies .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	15	Those prophets claim to be speaking for the Lord , but he did n't send them . They are lying ! If you do what they say , he will have both you and them dragged off to another country and killed . The Lord has spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	16	When I finished talking to the king , I told the priests and everyone else that the Lord had said : Do n't listen to the prophets when they say that very soon the Babylonians will return the things they took from my temple . Those prophets are lying !
CEV	Jeremiah	27	17	If you choose to obey the king of Babylonia , you will live . But if you listen to those prophets , this whole city will be nothing but a pile of rubble .
CEV	Jeremiah	27	18	If I really had spoken to those prophets , they would know what I am going to do . Then they would be begging me not to let everything else be taken from the temple and the king 's palace and the rest of Jerusalem . 19-21 After all , when Nebuchadnezzar took King Jehoiachin [ e ] to Babylonia as a prisoner , he did n't take everything of value from Jerusalem . He left the bronze pillars , the huge bronze bowl called the Sea , and the movable bronze stands in the temple , and he left a lot of other valuable things in the palace and in the rest of Jerusalem . But now I , the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , say that all these things
CEV	Jeremiah	27	22	will be taken to Babylonia , where they will remain until I decide to bring them back to Jerusalem . I , the Lord , have spoken . Footnotes - 27.1,2 Not long after Zedekiah became king of Judah : A few manuscripts and one ancient translation ; most Hebrew manuscripts “ Not long after Jehoiakim became king of Judah ” ; most manuscripts of another ancient translation do not have these words . Jehoiakim ruled 609–598 b.c. , and Zedekiah ruled 598–586 b.c . - 27.1,2 yoke : A wooden collar that fits around the neck of an ox , so the ox can be made to pull a plow or a cart . - 27.3 a message : Hebrew “ them. ” - 27.6,7 Nebuchadnezzar : See the note at 21.2 . - 27.19-21 Jehoiachin : Hebrew “ Jeconiah ” ( see the note at 24.1 ) .

CEV	Jeremiah	28	28	( A ) Later that same year , in the fifth month of the fourth year that Zedekiah [ a ] was king , [ b ] the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur from Gibeon came up to me in the temple . And while the priests and others in the temple were listening ,
CEV	Jeremiah	28	2	he told me that the Lord had said : I am the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , and I will smash the yoke [ c ] that Nebuchadnezzar [ d ] put on the necks of the nations to make them his slaves .
CEV	Jeremiah	28	3	And within two years , I will bring back to Jerusalem everything that he took from my temple and carried off to Babylonia .
CEV	Jeremiah	28	4	King Jehoiachin [ e ] and the other people who were taken from Judah to Babylonia will be allowed to come back here as well . All this will happen because I will smash the power of the king of Babylonia !
CEV	Jeremiah	28	5	The priests and the others were still standing there , so I said :
CEV	Jeremiah	28	6	Hananiah , I hope the Lord will do exactly what you said . I hope he does bring back everything the Babylonians took from the temple , and that our people who were taken to Babylonia will be allowed to return home .
CEV	Jeremiah	28	7	But let me remind you and everyone else
CEV	Jeremiah	28	8	that long before we were born , prophets were saying powerful kingdoms would be struck by war , disaster , and disease .
CEV	Jeremiah	28	9	Now you are saying we will have peace . We will just have to wait and see if that is really what the Lord has said . [ f ]
CEV	Jeremiah	28	10	Hananiah grabbed the wooden yoke from my neck and smashed it .
CEV	Jeremiah	28	11	Then he said , “ The Lord says this is the way he will smash the power Nebuchadnezzar has over the nations , and it will happen in less than two years. ” I left the temple ,
CEV	Jeremiah	28	12	and a little while later , the Lord told me 13-14 to go back and say to Hananiah : I am the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel . You smashed a wooden yoke , but I will replace it with one made of iron . I will put iron yokes on all the nations , and they will have to do what King Nebuchadnezzar commands . I will even let him rule the wild animals . 15-16 Hananiah , I have never sent you to speak for me . And yet you have talked my people into believing your lies and rebelling against me . So now I will send you—I 'll send you right off the face of the earth ! You will die before this year is over .
CEV	Jeremiah	28	17	Two months later , Hananiah died . Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	29	29	When Zephaniah received Shemaiah 's letter , he read it to me .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	3	I gave the letter to Elasah and Gemariah , [ c ] two men that King Zedekiah [ d ] of Judah was sending to Babylon to talk with Nebuchadnezzar . In the letter , I wrote
CEV	Jeremiah	29	4	that the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , had said : I had you taken from Jerusalem to Babylonia . Now I tell you
CEV	Jeremiah	29	5	to settle there and build houses . Plant gardens and eat what you grow in them .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	6	Get married and have children , then help your sons find wives and help your daughters find husbands , so they can have children as well . I want your numbers to grow , not to get smaller .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	7	Pray for peace in Babylonia and work hard to make it prosperous . The more successful that nation is , the better off you will be . 8-9 Some of your people there in Babylonia are fortunetellers , and you have asked them to tell you what will happen in the future . But they will only lead you astray with their dreams . [ e ] And do n't let the prophets fool you , either . They speak in my name , but they are liars . I have not spoken to them .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	10	( B ) After Babylonia has been the strongest nation for
CEV	Jeremiah	29	70	years , I will be kind and bring you back to Jerusalem , just as I have promised .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	11	I will bless you with a future filled with hope—a future of success , not of suffering .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	12	You will turn back to me and ask for help , and I will answer your prayers .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	13	( C ) You will worship me with all your heart , and I will be with you
CEV	Jeremiah	29	14	and accept your worship . Then I will gather you from all the nations where I scattered you , and you will return to Jerusalem .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	15	You feel secure , because you think I have sent prophets to speak for me in Babylonia . 16-19 But I have been sending prophets to the people of Judah for a long time , and the king from David 's family and the people who are left in Jerusalem and Judah still do n't obey me . So I , the Lord All-Powerful , will keep attacking them with war and hunger and disease , until they are as useless as rotten figs . I will force them to leave the land , and all nations will be disgusted and shocked at what happens to them . The nations will sneer and make fun of them and use the names “ Judah ” and “ Jerusalem ” as curse words . And you have not obeyed me , even though
CEV	Jeremiah	29	20	I had you taken from Jerusalem to Babylonia . But you had better listen to me now . 21-23 You think Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah are prophets because they claim to speak for me . But they are lying ! I have n't told them anything . They are also committing other horrible sins in your community , such as sleeping with the wives of their friends . So I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar , who will put them to death while the rest of you watch . And in the future , when you want to put a curse on someone , you will say , “ I pray that the Lord will kill you in the same way the king of Babylonia burned Zedekiah and Ahab to death ! ” A Message for Shemaiah 24-25 The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , told me what would happen to Shemaiah , [ f ] who was one of our people in Babylonia . After my letter reached Babylonia , Shemaiah wrote letters to the people of Jerusalem , including the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah , and the other priests . The letter to Zephaniah said :
CEV	Jeremiah	29	26	After the death of Jehoiada the priest , the Lord chose you to be the priest in charge of the temple security force . You know that anyone who acts crazy and pretends to be a prophet should be arrested and put in chains [ g ] and iron collars .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	27	Jeremiah from the town of Anathoth is pretending to be a prophet there in Jerusalem , so why have n't you punished him ?
CEV	Jeremiah	29	28	He even wrote a letter to the people here in Babylonia , saying we would be here a long time . He told us to build homes and to plant gardens and grow our own food .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	30	Then the Lord told me what to write in a second letter
CEV	Jeremiah	29	31	to the people of Judah who had been taken to Babylonia . In this letter , I wrote that the Lord had said : I , the Lord , have not chosen Shemaiah to be one of my prophets , and he has misled you by telling lies in my name .
CEV	Jeremiah	29	32	He has even talked you into disobeying me . So I will punish Shemaiah . He and his descendants wo n't live to see the good things I will do for my people . I , the Lord , have spoken .

CEV	Jeremiah	31	15	( A ) In Ramah [ f ] a voice is heard , crying and weeping loudly . Rachel mourns for her children [ g ] and refuses to be comforted , because they are dead . *
CEV	Jeremiah	31	16	But I , the Lord , say to dry your tears . Someday your children will come home from the enemy 's land . Then all you have done for them will be greatly rewarded .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	17	So do n't lose hope . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	18	The people of Israel [ h ] moan and say to me , “ We were like wild bulls , but you , Lord , broke us , and we learned to obey . You are our God— please let us come home .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	19	When we were young , we strayed and sinned , but then we realized what we had done . We are ashamed and disgraced and want to return to you. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	31	20	People of Israel , you are my own dear children . Do n't I love you best of all ? Though I often make threats , I want you to be near me , so I will have mercy on you . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	21	With rock piles and signposts , mark the road well , my dear people . The road by which you left by will now lead you home .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	22	Will you ever decide to be faithful ? I will make sure that someday things will be different , as different as a woman protecting a man . [ i ] The Lord Will Bring Judah Home
CEV	Jeremiah	31	23	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , said : I promise to set the people of Judah free and to lead them back to their hometowns . And when I do , they will once again say , “ We pray that the Lord will bless his home , the sacred hill in Jerusalem where his temple stands. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	31	24	The people will live in Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah . Some will be farmers , and others will be shepherds .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	25	Those who feel tired and worn out will find new life and energy ,

CEV	Jeremiah	31	27	Someday , Israel and Judah will be my field where my people and their livestock will grow .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	28	In the past , I took care to uproot them , to tear them down , and to destroy them . But when that day comes , I will take care to plant them and help them grow .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	29	( B ) No longer will anyone go around saying , “ Sour grapes eaten by parents leave a sour taste in the mouths of their children. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	31	30	When that day comes , only those who eat sour grapes will get the sour taste , and only those who sin will be put to death . The New Agreement with Israel and Judah The time will surely come when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and Judah .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	32	It will be different from the agreement I made with their ancestors when I led them out of Egypt . Although I was their God , they broke that agreement .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	33	( E ) Here is the new agreement that I , the Lord , will make with the people of Israel : “ I will write my laws on their hearts and minds . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	34	( F ) “ No longer will they have to teach one another to obey me . I , the Lord , promise that all of them will obey me , ordinary people and rulers alike . I will forgive their sins and forget the evil things they have done. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	31	35	I am the Lord All-Powerful . I command the sun to give light each day , the moon and stars to shine at night , and ocean waves to roar .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	36	I will never forget to give those commands , and I will never let Israel stop being a nation . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	37	Can you measure the heavens ? Can you explore the depths of the earth ? That 's how hard it would be for me to reject Israel forever , even though they have sinned . I , the Lord , have spoken . Jerusalem Will Be Rebuilt
CEV	Jeremiah	31	38	The Lord said : Someday , Jerusalem will truly belong to me . It will be rebuilt with a boundary line running from Hananel Tower to Corner Gate .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	39	From there , the boundary will go in a straight line to Gareb Hill , then turn toward Goah .
CEV	Jeremiah	31	40	Even that disgusting Hinnom Valley [ k ] will be sacred to me , and so will the eastern slopes that go down from Horse Gate into Kidron Valley .

CEV	Jeremiah	32	32	( A ) The Lord spoke to me in the tenth year that Zedekiah [ a ] was king of Judah , which was the eighteenth year that Nebuchadnezzar [ b ] was king of Babylonia .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	2	At that time , the Babylonian army had surrounded Jerusalem , and I was in the prison at the courtyard of the palace guards .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	3	Zedekiah had ordered me to be held there because I told everyone that the Lord had said : I am the Lord , and I am about to let the king of Babylonia conquer Jerusalem .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	4	King Zedekiah will be captured and taken to King Nebuchadnezzar , who will speak with him face to face .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	5	Then Zedekiah will be led away to Babylonia , where he will stay until I am finished with him . So , if you people of Judah fight against the Babylonians , you will lose . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	6	Later , when I was in prison , the Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	32	7	Jeremiah , your cousin Hanamel , the son of your uncle Shallum , will visit you . He must sell his field near the town of Anathoth , and because you are his nearest relative , you have the right and the responsibility to buy it and keep it in the family . [ c ]
CEV	Jeremiah	32	8	Hanamel came , just as the Lord had promised . And he said , “ Please buy my field near Anathoth in the territory of the Benjamin tribe . You have the right to buy it , and if you do , it will stay in our family. ” The Lord had told me to buy it
CEV	Jeremiah	32	9	from Hanamel , and so I did . The price was
CEV	Jeremiah	32	17	Lord God , you stretched out your mighty arm and made the sky and the earth . You can do anything .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	12	And while he , the witnesses , and all the other Jews sitting in the courtyard were still watching , I gave both copies to Baruch son of Neriah . [ e ] 13-14 I told Baruch that the Lord had said : Take both copies of this bill of sale , one sealed shut and the other open , and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	15	I am the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , and I promise you that people will once again buy and sell houses , farms , and vineyards in this country . Jeremiah Questions the Lord
CEV	Jeremiah	32	16	Then I prayed :
CEV	Jeremiah	32	18	You show kindness for a thousand generations , [ f ] but you also punish people for the sins of their parents . You are the Lord All-Powerful .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	19	With great wisdom you make plans , and with your great power you do all the mighty things you planned . Nothing we do is hidden from your eyes , and you reward or punish us as we deserve .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	20	You are famous because you worked miracles in Egypt , and you are still working them in Israel and in the rest of the world as well .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	21	You terrified the Egyptians with your miracles , and you reached out your mighty arm and rescued your people Israel from Egypt .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	22	Then you gave Israel this land rich with milk and honey , just as you had promised our ancestors .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	23	But when our ancestors took over the land , they did not obey you . And now you have punished Israel with disaster .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	24	Jerusalem is under attack , and we suffer from hunger and disease . The Babylonians have already built dirt ramps up to the walls of our city , and you can see that Jerusalem will be captured just as you said .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	25	So why did you tell me to get some witnesses and buy a field with my silver , when Jerusalem is about to be captured by the Babylonians ? The Lord Explains about the Field
CEV	Jeremiah	32	26	The Lord explained :
CEV	Jeremiah	32	27	Jeremiah , I am the Lord God . I rule the world , and I can do anything !
CEV	Jeremiah	32	28	( B ) It is true that I am going to let King Nebuchadnezzar [ g ] of Babylonia capture Jerusalem .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	29	The Babylonian army is already attacking , and they will capture the city and set it on fire . The people of Jerusalem have made me angry by going up to the flat roofs of their houses and burning incense to Baal and offering wine sacrifices to other gods . Now these houses will be burned to the ground ! 30-33 The kings and the officials , the priests and the prophets , and everyone else in Israel and Judah have turned from me and made me angry by worshiping idols . Again and again I have tried to teach my people to obey me , but they refuse to be corrected . I am going to get rid of Jerusalem , because its people have done nothing but evil .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	34	( C ) They have set up repulsive idols in my temple , and now it is n't a fit place to worship me .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	35	( D ) And they led Judah into sin by building places to worship Baal in Hinnom Valley , where they also sacrificed their sons and daughters to the god Molech . I have never even imagined they would commit such disgusting sins .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	36	Jeremiah , what you said is true . The people of Jerusalem are suffering from hunger and disease , and so the king of Babylonia will be able to capture Jerusalem .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	37	I am angry with the people of Jerusalem , and I will scatter them in foreign countries . But someday I will bring them back here and let them live in safety .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	38	They will be my people , and I will be their God . 39-41 I will make their thoughts and desires pure . Then they will realize that , for their own good and the good of their children , they must worship only me . They will even be afraid to turn away from me . I will make an agreement with them that will never end , and I wo n't ever stop doing good things for them . With all my heart I promise that they will be planted in this land once again .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	42	Even though I have brought disaster on the people , I will someday do all these good things for them .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	43	Jeremiah , when you bought the field , you showed that fields will someday be bought and sold again . You say that this land has been conquered by the Babylonians and has become a desert , emptied of people and animals .
CEV	Jeremiah	32	44	But someday , people will again spend their silver to buy fields everywhere—in the territory of Benjamin , the region around Jerusalem and the towns of Judah , and in the hill country , the foothills to the west , and the Southern Desert . Buyers and sellers and witnesses will sign and seal the bills of sale for the fields . It will happen , because I will give this land back to my people . I , the Lord , have spoken .

CEV	Jeremiah	33	33	1-2 I was still being held prisoner in the courtyard of the palace guards when the Lord told me : I am the Lord , and I created the whole world . [ a ]
CEV	Jeremiah	33	3	Ask me , and I will tell you things that you do n't know and ca n't find out . 4-5 Many of the houses in Jerusalem and some of the buildings at the royal palace have been torn down to be used in repairing the walls to keep out the Babylonian attackers . [ b ] Now there are empty spaces where the buildings once stood . But I am furious , and these spaces will be filled with the bodies of the people I kill . The people of Jerusalem will cry out to me for help , but they are evil , and I will ignore their prayers .
CEV	Jeremiah	33	6	Then someday , I will heal this place and my people as well , and let them enjoy unending peace . [ c ]
CEV	Jeremiah	33	7	I will give this land to Israel and Judah once again , and I will make them as strong as they were before .
CEV	Jeremiah	33	8	They sinned and rebelled against me , but I will forgive them and take away their guilt .
CEV	Jeremiah	33	9	When that happens , all nations on earth will see the good things I have done for Jerusalem , and how I have given it complete peace . The nations will celebrate and praise and honor me , but they will also tremble with fear because of the powerful things I have done .
CEV	Jeremiah	33	10	Jeremiah , you say that this land is a desert without people or animals , and for now , you are right . The towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem are deserted , and people and animals are nowhere to be seen . But someday you will hear
CEV	Jeremiah	33	11	( A ) happy voices and the sounds of parties and wedding celebrations . And when people come to my temple to offer sacrifices to thank me , you will hear them say : “ We praise you , Lord All-Powerful ! You are good to us , and your love never fails. ” The land will once again be productive . 12-13 Now it is empty , without people or animals . But when that time comes , shepherds will take care of their flocks in pastures near every town in the hill country , in the foothills to the west , in the Southern Desert , in the land of the Benjamin tribe , and around Jerusalem and the towns of Judah . I , the Lord , have spoken . The Lord 's Wonderful Promise
CEV	Jeremiah	33	14	( B ) The Lord said : I made a wonderful promise to Israel and Judah , [ d ] and the days are coming when I will keep it .
CEV	Jeremiah	33	15	I promise that the time will come when I will appoint a king from the family of David , a king who will be honest and rule with justice .
CEV	Jeremiah	33	16	In those days , Judah will be safe ; Jerusalem will have peace and will be named , “ The Lord Gives Justice. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	33	17	( C ) The king of Israel will be one of David 's descendants ,
CEV	Jeremiah	33	18	( D ) and there will always be priests from the Levi tribe serving at my altar and offering sacrifices to please me and to give thanks . [ e ]
CEV	Jeremiah	33	19	Then the Lord told me :
CEV	Jeremiah	33	20	I , the Lord , have an agreement with day and night , so they always come at the right time . You ca n't break the agreement I made with them ,
CEV	Jeremiah	33	21	and you ca n't break the agreements I have made with David 's family and with the priests from the Levi tribe who serve at my altar . A descendant of David will always rule as king of Israel ,
CEV	Jeremiah	33	22	and there will be more descendants of David and of the priests from the Levi tribe than stars in the sky or grains of sand on the beach .
CEV	Jeremiah	33	23	The Lord also said :
CEV	Jeremiah	33	24	You 've heard foreigners insult my people by saying , “ The Lord chose Israel and Judah , but now he has rejected them , and they are no longer a nation. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	33	25	Jeremiah , I will never break my agreement with the day and the night or let the sky and the earth stop obeying my commands .
CEV	Jeremiah	33	26	In the same way , I will never reject the descendants of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob or break my promise that they will always have a descendant of David as their king . I will be kind to my people Israel , and they will be successful again .

CEV	Jeremiah	34	34	( A ) King Nebuchadnezzar [ a ] had a large army made up of people from every kingdom in his empire . He and his army were attacking Jerusalem and all the nearby towns , when the Lord told me
CEV	Jeremiah	34	2	to say to King Zedekiah : [ b ] I am the Lord , and I am going to let Nebuchadnezzar capture this city and burn it down .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	3	You will be taken prisoner and brought to Nebuchadnezzar , and he will speak with you face to face . Then you will be led away to Babylonia .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	4	Zedekiah , I promise that you wo n't die in battle .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	5	You will die a peaceful death . People will mourn when you die , and they will light bonfires in your honor , just as they did for your ancestors , the kings who ruled before you .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	6	I went to Zedekiah and told him what the Lord had said .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	7	Meanwhile , the king of Babylonia was trying to break through the walls of Lachish , Azekah , and Jerusalem , the only three towns of Judah that had not been captured . The People Break a Promise 8-10 King Zedekiah , [ c ] his officials , and everyone else in Jerusalem made an agreement to free all Hebrew [ d ] men and women who were slaves . No Jew would keep another as a slave . And so , all the Jewish slaves were given their freedom .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	11	But those slave owners changed their minds and forced their former slaves back into slavery .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	12	That 's when the Lord told me to say to the people :
CEV	Jeremiah	34	13	I am the Lord God of Israel , and I made an agreement with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt , where they had been slaves .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	14	( B ) As part of this agreement , you must let a Hebrew slave go free after six years of service . Your ancestors did not obey me , 15-16 but you decided to obey me and do the right thing by setting your Hebrew slaves completely free . You even went to my temple , and in my name you made an agreement to set them free . But you have abused my name , because you broke that agreement and forced your former slaves back into slavery .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	17	You have disobeyed me by not giving your slaves their freedom . So I will give you freedom—the freedom to die in battle or from disease or hunger . I will make you disgusting to all other nations on earth .
CEV	Jeremiah	34	18	You asked me to be a witness when you made the agreement to set your slaves free . And as part of the ceremony you cut a calf into two parts , then walked between the parts . But you people of Jerusalem have broken that agreement as well as my agreement with Israel . So I will do to you what you did to that calf . 19-20 I will let your enemies take all of you prisoner , including the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem , the royal officials , the priests , and everyone else who walked between the two parts of the calf . These enemies will kill you and leave your bodies lying on the ground as food for birds and wild animals . 21-22 These enemies are King Nebuchadnezzar [ e ] of Babylonia and his army . They have stopped attacking Jerusalem , but they want to kill King Zedekiah and his high officials . So I will command them to return and attack again . This time they will conquer the city and burn it down , and they will capture Zedekiah and his officials . I will also let them destroy the towns of Judah , so that no one can live there any longer .

CEV	Jeremiah	35	35	( A ) When Jehoiakim [ a ] was king of Judah , the Lord told me ,
CEV	Jeremiah	35	2	Kings 10.15-23 . In the Hebrew of this chapter , “ Jonadab ” is sometimes spelled “ Jehonadab. ” - 35.11 Nebuchadnezzar : See the note at 21.2 . Copyright ©
CEV	Jeremiah	35	3	So I went to Jaazaniah , [ c ] the leader of the clan , and I invited him and all the men of his clan .
CEV	Jeremiah	35	4	I brought them into the temple courtyard and took them upstairs to a room belonging to the prophets who were followers of Hanan son of Igdaliah . It was next to a room belonging to some of the officials , and that room was over the one belonging to Maaseiah , a priest who was one of the high officials in the temple . [ d ]
CEV	Jeremiah	35	5	I set out some large bowls full of wine together with some cups , and then I said to the Rechabites , “ Have some wine ! ”
CEV	Jeremiah	35	6	But they answered : No ! The ancestor of our clan , Jonadab son of Rechab , [ e ] made a rule that we must obey . He said , “ Do n't ever drink wine
CEV	Jeremiah	35	7	or build houses or plant crops and vineyards . Instead , you must always live in tents and move from place to place . If you obey this command , you will live a long time. ” 8-10 Our clan has always obeyed Jonadab 's command . To this very day , we and our wives and sons and daughters do n't drink wine or build houses or plant vineyards or crops . And we have lived in tents ,
CEV	Jeremiah	35	11	except now we have to live inside Jerusalem because Nebuchadnezzar [ f ] has taken over the countryside with his army from Babylonia and Syria . 12-13 Then the Lord told me to say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem : I , the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , want you to learn a lesson
CEV	Jeremiah	35	14	from the Rechabite clan . Their ancestor Jonadab told his descendants never to drink wine , and to this very day they have obeyed him . But I have spoken to you over and over , and you have n't obeyed me !
CEV	Jeremiah	35	15	You refused to listen to my prophets , who kept telling you , “ Stop doing evil and worshiping other gods ! Start obeying the Lord , and he will let you live in this land he gave your ancestors. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	35	16	The Rechabites have obeyed the command of their ancestor Jonadab , but you have not obeyed me ,
CEV	Jeremiah	35	17	your God . I am the Lord All-Powerful , and I warned you about the terrible things that would happen to you if you did not listen to me . But you have ignored me , so now disaster will strike you . I , the Lord , have spoken . The Lord Makes a Promise to the Rechabites
CEV	Jeremiah	35	18	Then the Lord told me to say to the Rechabite clan : “ I am the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel . You have obeyed your ancestor Jonadab ,
CEV	Jeremiah	35	19	so I promise that your clan will be my servants and will never die out. ” Footnotes - 35.1 Jehoiakim : See the note at 1.3 . - 35.2 side rooms : Probably a room with walls on three sides , and open to the courtyard on the fourth side . - 35.3 Jaazaniah : The Hebrew text has “ Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah ” ; this is a different Jeremiah than the author of the book . - 35.4 Maaseiah … temple : Hebrew “ Maaseiah son of Shallum , the keeper of the temple door. ” - 35.6 Jonadab son of Rechab : See

CEV	Jeremiah	36	36	( A ) During the fourth year that Jehoiakim [ a ] son of Josiah [ b ] was king of Judah , the Lord said to me , “ Jeremiah ,
CEV	Jeremiah	36	2	since the time Josiah was king , I have been speaking to you about Israel , Judah , and the other nations . Now , get a scroll [ c ] and write down everything I have told you ,
CEV	Jeremiah	36	3	then read it to the people of Judah . Maybe they will stop sinning when they hear what terrible things I plan for them . And if they turn back to me , I will forgive them. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	36	4	I sent for Baruch son of Neriah and asked him to help me . I repeated everything the Lord had told me , and Baruch wrote it all down on a scroll .
CEV	Jeremiah	36	5	Then I said , Baruch , the officials refuse to let me go into the Lord 's temple ,
CEV	Jeremiah	36	6	so you must go instead . Wait for the next holy day when the people of Judah come to the temple to pray and to go without eating . [ d ] Then take this scroll to the temple and read it aloud .
CEV	Jeremiah	36	7	The Lord is furious , and if the people hear how he is going to punish them , maybe they will ask to be forgiven . 8-10 In the ninth month [ e ] of the fifth year that Jehoiakim was king , the leaders set a day when everyone who lived in Jerusalem or who was visiting there had to pray and go without eating . So Baruch took the scroll to the upper courtyard of the temple . He went over to the side of the courtyard and stood in a covered area near New Gate , where he read the scroll aloud . This covered area belonged to Gemariah , [ f ] one of the king 's highest officials .
CEV	Jeremiah	36	11	Gemariah 's son Micaiah was there and heard Baruch read what the Lord had said .
CEV	Jeremiah	36	12	When Baruch finished reading , Micaiah went down to the palace . His father Gemariah was in the officials ' room , meeting with the rest of the king 's officials , including Elishama , Delaiah , Elnathan , and Zedekiah . [ g ]
CEV	Jeremiah	36	13	Micaiah told them what he had heard Baruch read to the people .
CEV	Jeremiah	36	14	Then the officials sent Jehudi and Shelemiah [ h ] to tell Baruch , “ Bring us that scroll. ” When Baruch arrived with the scroll ,
CEV	Jeremiah	36	15	the officials said , “ Please sit down and read it to us , ” which he did .
CEV	Jeremiah	36	16	After they heard what was written on the scroll , they were worried and said to each other , “ The king needs to hear this ! ” Turning to Baruch , they asked ,
CEV	Jeremiah	36	17	“ Did someone tell you what to write on this scroll ? ”
CEV	Jeremiah	36	18	“ Yes , Jeremiah did , ” Baruch replied . “ I wrote down just what he told me. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	36	19	The officials said , “ You and Jeremiah must go into hiding , and do n't tell anyone where you are going. ” 20-22 The officials put the scroll in Elishama 's room and went to see the king , who was in one of the rooms where he lived and worked during the winter . It was the ninth month [ i ] of the year , so there was a fire burning in the fireplace , [ j ] and the king was sitting nearby . After the officials told the king about the scroll , he sent Jehudi to get it . Then Jehudi started reading the scroll to the king and his officials . 23-25 But every time Jehudi finished reading three or four columns , the king would tell him to cut them off with his penknife and throw them in the fire . Elnathan , Delaiah , and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll , but he ignored them , and soon there was nothing left of it . The king and his servants listened to what was written on the scroll , but they were not the least bit afraid , and they did not tear their clothes in sorrow . [ k ]
CEV	Jeremiah	36	26	The king told his son Jerahmeel to take Seraiah and Shelemiah [ l ] and to go arrest Baruch and me . [ m ] But the Lord kept them from finding us . Jeremiah 's Second Scroll
CEV	Jeremiah	36	27	I had told Baruch what to write on that first scroll , [ n ] but King Jehoiakim [ o ] had burned it . So the Lord told me
CEV	Jeremiah	36	28	to get another scroll and write down everything that had been on the first one .
CEV	Jeremiah	36	29	Then he told me to say to King Jehoiakim : Not only did you burn Jeremiah 's scroll , you had the nerve to ask why he had written that the king of Babylonia would attack and ruin the land , killing all the people and even the animals .
CEV	Jeremiah	36	30	So I , the Lord , promise that you will be killed and your body thrown out on the ground . The sun will beat down on it during the day , and the frost will settle on it at night . And none of your descendants will ever be king of Judah .
CEV	Jeremiah	36	31	You , your children , and your servants are evil , and I will punish everyone of you . I warned you and the people of Judah and Jerusalem that I would bring disaster , but none of you have listened . So now you are doomed !

CEV	Jeremiah	37	8	Then the Babylonians will return and attack Jerusalem , and this time they will capture the city and set it on fire .
CEV	Jeremiah	37	9	Do n't fool yourselves into thinking that the Babylonians will leave as they did before .
CEV	Jeremiah	37	10	Even if you could defeat their entire army , their wounded survivors would still be able to leave their tents and set Jerusalem on fire . Jeremiah Is Put in Prison
CEV	Jeremiah	37	11	The Babylonian army had left because the Egyptian army was on its way to help us .
CEV	Jeremiah	37	12	So I decided to leave Jerusalem and go to the territory of the Benjamin tribe to claim my share of my family 's land .
CEV	Jeremiah	37	13	I was leaving Jerusalem through Benjamin Gate , when I was stopped by Irijah , [ i ] the officer in charge of the soldiers at the gate . He said , “ Jeremiah , you 're under arrest for trying to join the Babylonians. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	37	14	“ I 'm not trying to join them ! ” I answered . But Irijah would n't listen , and he took me to the king 's officials . 15-16 They were angry and ordered the soldiers to beat me . Then I was taken to the house that belonged to Jonathan , one of the king 's officials . It had been turned into a prison , and I was kept in a basement room . After I had spent a long time there ,
CEV	Jeremiah	37	17	King Zedekiah secretly had me brought to his palace , where he asked , “ Is there any message for us from the Lord ? ” “ Yes , there is , Your Majesty , ” I replied . “ The Lord is going to let the king of Babylonia capture you. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	37	18	Then I continued , “ Your Majesty , why have you put me in prison ? Have I committed a crime against you or your officials or the nation ?
CEV	Jeremiah	37	19	Have you locked up the prophets who lied to you and said that the king of Babylonia would never attack Jerusalem ?
CEV	Jeremiah	37	20	Please , do n't send me back to that prison at Jonathan 's house . If you do , I will die there. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	37	21	King Zedekiah had me taken to the prison cells in the courtyard of the palace guards . He told the soldiers to give me a loaf of bread [ j ] from one of the bakeries every day until the city ran out of grain .

CEV	Jeremiah	38	38	One day , Shephatiah , Gedaliah , Jehucal , [ a ] and Pashhur [ b ] heard me tell the people of Judah 2-3 that the Lord had said , “ If you stay here in Jerusalem , you will die in battle or from disease or hunger , and the Babylonian army will capture the city anyway . But if you surrender to the Babylonians , they will let you live. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	38	4	So the four of them went to the king and said , “ You should put Jeremiah to death , because he is making the soldiers and everyone else lose hope . He is n't trying to help our people ; he 's trying to harm them. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	38	5	Zedekiah replied , “ Do what you want with him . I ca n't stop you. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	38	6	Then they took me back to the courtyard of the palace guards and let me down with ropes into the well that belonged to Malchiah , the king 's son . There was no water in the well , but I sank down in the mud . 7-8 Ebedmelech from Ethiopia [ c ] was an official at the palace , and he heard what they had done to me . So he went to speak with King Zedekiah , who was holding court at Benjamin Gate .
CEV	Jeremiah	38	9	Ebedmelech said , “ Your Majesty , Jeremiah is a prophet , and those men were wrong to throw him into a well . And when Jerusalem runs out of food , Jeremiah will starve to death down there. ”

CEV	Jeremiah	38	12	Then he said , “ Put these rags under your arms so the ropes wo n't hurt you. ” After I did ,
CEV	Jeremiah	38	13	the men pulled me out . And from then on , I was kept in the courtyard of the palace guards . King Zedekiah Questions Jeremiah
CEV	Jeremiah	38	14	King Zedekiah [ e ] had me brought to his private entrance [ f ] to the temple , and he said , “ I 'm going to ask you something , and I want to know the truth. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	38	15	“ Why ? ” I replied . “ You wo n't listen , and you might even have me killed ! ”
CEV	Jeremiah	38	16	He said , “ I swear in the name of the living Lord our Creator that I wo n't have you killed . No one else can hear what we say , and I wo n't let anyone kill you. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	38	17	Then I told him that the Lord had said : “ Zedekiah , I am the Lord God All-Powerful , the God of Israel . I promise that if you surrender to King Nebuchadnezzar 's [ g ] officers , you and your family wo n't be killed , and Jerusalem wo n't be burned down .
CEV	Jeremiah	38	18	But if you do n't surrender , I will let the Babylonian army capture Jerusalem and burn it down , and you will be taken prisoner. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	38	19	Zedekiah answered , “ I ca n't surrender to the Babylonians . I 'm too afraid of the people of Judah who have already joined them . The Babylonians might hand me over to them , and they would torture me. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	38	20	I said , “ If you will just obey the Lord , the Babylonians wo n't hand you over to those Jews . You will be allowed to live , and all will go well for you .
CEV	Jeremiah	38	21	But the Lord has shown me that if you refuse to obey ,
CEV	Jeremiah	38	22	then the women of your palace will be taken prisoner by Nebuchadnezzar 's officials . And those women will say to you : Friends you trusted led you astray . Now you 're trapped in mud , and those friends you trusted have all turned away .
CEV	Jeremiah	38	23	The Babylonian army will take your wives and children captive , you will be taken as a prisoner to the King of Babylonia , and Jerusalem will be burned down. ” [ h ]
CEV	Jeremiah	38	24	Zedekiah said , “ Jeremiah , if you tell anyone what we have talked about , you might lose your life .
CEV	Jeremiah	38	25	And I 'm sure that if my officials hear about our meeting , they will ask you what we said to each other . They might even threaten to kill you if you do n't tell them .
CEV	Jeremiah	38	26	So if they question you , tell them you were begging me not to send you back to the prison at Jonathan 's house , because going back there would kill you. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	38	27	The officials did come and question me about my meeting with the king , and I told them exactly what he had ordered me to say . They never spoke to me about the meeting again , since no one had heard us talking .

CEV	Jeremiah	39	39	1-3 In the tenth month [ a ] of the ninth year that Zedekiah [ b ] was king of Judah , King Nebuchadnezzar [ c ] and the Babylonian army began their attack on Jerusalem .

CEV	Jeremiah	39	6	and gave orders for him to be punished . Zedekiah 's sons were killed there in front of him , and so were the leaders of Judah 's ruling families .

CEV	Jeremiah	39	8	Meanwhile , the Babylonian army had burned the houses in Jerusalem , including [ k ] the royal palace , and they had broken down the city walls .

CEV	Jeremiah	40	40	I was led away in chains along with the people of Judah and Jerusalem who were being taken to Babylonia . Nebuzaradan was the officer in charge of the guard , and while we were stopped at Ramah , the Lord caused him to set me free .
CEV	Jeremiah	40	2	Nebuzaradan said : Jeremiah , the Lord your God warned your people that he would bring disaster on this land .
CEV	Jeremiah	40	3	But they continued to rebel against him , and now he has punished them just as he threatened .
CEV	Jeremiah	40	4	Today I am taking the chains off your wrists and setting you free ! If you want to , you can come with me to Babylonia , and I will see that you are taken care of . Or if you decide to stay here , you can go wherever you wish .
CEV	Jeremiah	40	5	King Nebuchadnezzar [ a ] has chosen Gedaliah to rule Judah . You can live near Gedaliah , and he will provide for you , or you can live anywhere else you choose . Nebuzaradan gave me a supply of food , then let me leave .
CEV	Jeremiah	40	6	I decided to stay with the people of Judah , and I went to live near Gedaliah in Mizpah . The Harvest Is Brought In 7-8 ( A ) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , together with Johanan and Jonathan , the two sons of Kareah , had been officers in Judah 's army . And so had Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah from Maacah . They and their troops had been stationed outside Jerusalem and had not been captured . They heard that Gedaliah had been chosen to rule Judah , and that the poorest men , women , and children had not been taken away to Babylonia . So they went to Mizpah and met with their new ruler .
CEV	Jeremiah	40	9	Gedaliah told them , “ There 's no need to be afraid of the Babylonians . Everything will be fine , if we live peacefully and obey King Nebuchadnezzar . [ b ]
CEV	Jeremiah	40	10	I will stay here at Mizpah and meet with the Babylonian officials on each of their visits . But you must go back to your towns and bring in the harvest , then store the wine , olive oil , and dried fruit. ” 11-12 Earlier , when the Babylonians had invaded Judah , many of the Jews escaped to Moab , Ammon , Edom , and several other countries . But these Jews heard that the king of Babylonia had appointed Gedaliah as ruler of Judah , and that only a few people were left there . So the Jews in these other countries came back to Judah and helped with the grape and fruit harvest , which was especially large that year . Gedaliah Is Murdered
CEV	Jeremiah	40	13	One day , Johanan got together with some of the other men who had been army officers , and they came to Mizpah and met with Gedaliah .
CEV	Jeremiah	40	14	They said , “ Gedaliah , we came to warn you that King Baalis of Ammon hired Ishmael to murder you ! ” Gedaliah refused to believe them ,
CEV	Jeremiah	40	15	so Johanan went to Gedaliah privately and said , “ Let me kill Ishmael . No one will find out who did it . There are only a few people left in Judah , but they are depending on you . And if you are murdered , they will be scattered or killed. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	40	16	Gedaliah answered , “ Do n't kill Ishmael ! What you 've said about him ca n't be true. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	41	41	( A ) But in the seventh month , [ a ] Ishmael [ b ] came to Mizpah with ten of his soldiers . He had been one of the king 's officials and was a member of the royal family . Ishmael and his men were invited to eat with Gedaliah .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	2	During the meal , Ishmael and his soldiers killed Gedaliah , the man chosen as ruler of Judah by the king of Babylonia .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	3	Then they killed the Jews who were with Gedaliah , and they also killed the Babylonian soldiers who were there .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	4	The next day , the murders had still not been discovered ,
CEV	Jeremiah	41	5	when
CEV	Jeremiah	41	80	men came down the road toward Mizpah from the towns of Shechem , Shiloh , and Samaria . They were on their way to the temple to offer gifts of grain and incense to the Lord . They had shaved off their beards , torn their clothes , and cut themselves , because they were mourning .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	6	Ishmael went out the town gate to meet them . He pretended to be weeping , and he asked them to come into Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah , the ruler of Judah .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	7	But after they were inside the town , Ishmael ordered his soldiers to kill them and throw their bodies into a well .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	8	He let ten of the men live , because they offered to give him supplies of wheat , barley , olive oil , and honey they had hidden in a field .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	9	The well that he filled with bodies [ c ] had been dug by King Asa [ d ] of Judah to store rainwater , because he was afraid that King Baasha [ e ] of Israel might surround Mizpah and keep the people from getting to their water supply .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	10	Nebuzaradan , King Nebuchadnezzar 's [ f ] officer in charge of the guard , had left King Zedekiah 's [ g ] daughters and many other people at Mizpah , and he had put Gedaliah in charge of them . But now Ishmael took them all prisoner and led them toward Ammon , on the other side of the Jordan River .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	11	Johanan and the other army officers heard what Ishmael had done .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	12	So they and their troops chased Ishmael and caught up with him at the large pit at Gibeon .
CEV	Jeremiah	41	13	When Ishmael 's prisoners saw Johanan and the officers , they were happy

CEV	Jeremiah	42	42	""
CEV	Jeremiah	42	1	Johanan , Jezaniah , [ a ] the other army officers , and everyone else in the group , came to me
CEV	Jeremiah	42	2	and said , “ Please , Jeremiah , pray to the Lord your God for us . Judah used to have many people , but as you can see , only a few of us are left .
CEV	Jeremiah	42	3	Ask the Lord to tell us where he wants us to go and what he wants us to do. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	42	4	“ All right , ” I answered , “ I will pray to the Lord your God , and I will tell you everything he says. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	42	5	They answered , “ The Lord himself will be our witness that we promise to do whatever he says ,
CEV	Jeremiah	42	6	even if it is n't what we want to do . We will obey the Lord so that all will go well for us. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	42	7	Ten days later , the Lord gave me an answer for
CEV	Jeremiah	42	8	Johanan , the officers , and the other people . So I called them together
CEV	Jeremiah	42	9	and told them that the Lord God of Israel had said : You asked Jeremiah to pray and find out what you should do .
CEV	Jeremiah	42	10	I am sorry that I had to punish you , and so I now tell you to stay here in Judah , where I will plant you and build you up , instead of tearing you down and uprooting you .
CEV	Jeremiah	42	11	Do n't be afraid of the King of Babylonia . I will protect you from him ,
CEV	Jeremiah	42	12	and I will even force him to have mercy on you and give back your farms .
CEV	Jeremiah	42	13	But you might keep on saying , “ We wo n't stay here in Judah , and we wo n't obey the Lord our God .
CEV	Jeremiah	42	14	We are going to Egypt , where there is plenty of food and no danger of war. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	42	15	People of Judah , you survived when the Babylonian army attacked . Now you are planning to move to Egypt , and if you do go , this is what will happen . 16-17 You are afraid of war , starvation , and disease here in Judah , but they will follow you to Egypt and kill you there . None of you will survive the disasters I will send .
CEV	Jeremiah	42	18	I , the Lord , was angry with the people of Jerusalem and punished them . And if you go to Egypt , I will be angry and punish you the same way . You will never again see your homeland . People will be horrified at what I do to you , and they will use the name of your city as a curse word . Jeremiah Gives a Warning
CEV	Jeremiah	42	19	I told the people : You escaped the disaster that struck Judah , but now the Lord warns you to stay away from Egypt .
CEV	Jeremiah	42	20	You asked me to pray and find out what the Lord our God wants you to do , and you promised to obey him . But that was a terrible mistake ,
CEV	Jeremiah	42	21	because now that I have given you the Lord 's answer , you refuse to obey him .
CEV	Jeremiah	42	22	And so , you will die in Egypt from war , hunger , and disease . Footnotes - 42.1 Jezaniah : Hebrew “ Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah ” ; one ancient translation “ Azariah son of Hoshaiah ” ( see also 43.2 and the note there ) . Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	43	43	I told the people everything the Lord had told me .
CEV	Jeremiah	43	2	But Azariah , Johanan [ a ] and some other arrogant men said to me , “ You 're lying ! The Lord did n't tell you to say that we should n't go to Egypt .
CEV	Jeremiah	43	3	Baruch son of Neriah must have told you to say that . He wants the Babylonians to capture us , so they can take us away to Babylonia or even kill us. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	43	4	Johanan , the other army officers , and everyone else refused to stay in Judah in spite of the Lord 's command .
CEV	Jeremiah	43	5	( A ) So Johanan and the officers led us away toward Egypt . The group that left Judah included those who had been scattered in other countries and who had then come back to live in Judah .
CEV	Jeremiah	43	6	Baruch and I and others in the group had been staying with Gedaliah , because Nebuzaradan , the Babylonian officer in charge of the guard , had ordered him to take care of the king 's daughters and quite a few men , women , and children .
CEV	Jeremiah	43	7	The people disobeyed the Lord and went to Egypt . The group had settled in Tahpanhes ,
CEV	Jeremiah	43	8	when the Lord told me :
CEV	Jeremiah	43	9	Jeremiah , carry some large stones to the entrance of the government building in Tahpanhes . Bury the stones underneath the brick pavement [ b ] and be sure the Jews are watching .
CEV	Jeremiah	43	10	Then tell them that I , the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , have sent for my servant , Nebuchadnezzar [ c ] of Babylonia . I will bring him here and have him set up his throne and his royal tent over these stones that I told you to bury .
CEV	Jeremiah	43	11	He will attack Egypt and kill many of its people ; others will die of disease or be dragged away as prisoners . 12-13 I will let him set Egypt 's temples on fire , and he will either burn or carry off their idols . He will destroy the sacred monuments at the temple of the sun-god . [ d ] Then Nebuchadnezzar will pick the land clean , just like a shepherd picking the lice off his clothes . And he will return safely home . Copyright ©

CEV	Jeremiah	44	44	The Lord told me to speak with the Jews who were living in the towns of Migdol , Tahpanhes , and Memphis in northern Egypt , and also to those living in southern Egypt . He told me to tell them :
CEV	Jeremiah	44	2	I am the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel . You saw how I destroyed Jerusalem and the towns of Judah . They lie empty and in ruins today ,
CEV	Jeremiah	44	3	because the people of Judah made me angry by worshiping gods that had never helped them or their ancestors .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	4	Time after time I sent my servants the prophets to tell the people of Judah how much I hated their disgusting sins . The prophets warned them to stop sinning ,
CEV	Jeremiah	44	5	but they refused to listen and would not stop worshiping other gods .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	6	Finally , my anger struck like a raging flood , and today Jerusalem and the towns of Judah are nothing but empty ruins .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	7	Why do you now insist on heading for another disaster ? A disaster that will destroy not only you , but also your children and babies .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	8	You have made me angry by worshiping idols and burning incense to other gods after you came here to Egypt . You will die such a disgusting death , that other nations will use the name of Judah as a curse word .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	9	When you were living in Jerusalem and Judah , you followed the example of your ancestors in doing evil things , just like your kings and queens .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	10	Even now , your pride keeps you from respecting me and obeying the laws and teachings I gave you and your ancestors .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	11	I , the Lord All-Powerful , have decided to wipe you out with disasters .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	12	There were only a few of you left in Judah , and you decided to go to Egypt . But you will die such horrible deaths in war or from starvation , that people of other countries will use the name of Judah as a curse word .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	13	I punished Jerusalem with war , hunger , and disease , and that 's how I will punish you .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	14	None of you will survive . You may hope to return to Judah someday , but only a very few of you will escape death and be able to go back . The People Refuse To Worship the Lord
CEV	Jeremiah	44	15	A large number of Jews from both northern and southern Egypt listened to me as I told them what the Lord had said . Most of the men in the crowd knew that their wives often burned incense to other gods . So they and their wives shouted :
CEV	Jeremiah	44	16	Jeremiah , what do we care if you speak in the Lord 's name ? We refuse to listen !
CEV	Jeremiah	44	17	We have promised to worship the goddess Astarte , the Queen of Heaven , [ a ] and that is exactly what we are going to do . We will burn incense and offer sacrifices of wine to her , just as we , our ancestors , our kings , and our leaders did when we lived in Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah . We had plenty of food back then . We were well off , and nothing bad ever happened to us .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	18	But since the time we stopped burning incense and offering wine sacrifices to her , we have been dying from war and hunger .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	19	Then the women said , “ When we lived in Judah , we worshiped the Queen of Heaven and offered sacrifices of wine and special loaves of bread shaped like her . Our husbands knew what we were doing , and they approved of it. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	44	20	Then I told the crowd :
CEV	Jeremiah	44	21	Do n't you think the Lord knew that you and your ancestors , your leaders and kings , and the rest of the people were burning incense to other gods in Jerusalem and everywhere else in Judah ?
CEV	Jeremiah	44	22	And when he could no longer put up with your disgusting sins , he placed a curse on your land and turned it into a desert , as it is today .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	23	This disaster happened because you worshiped other gods and rebelled against the Lord by refusing to obey him or follow his laws and teachings . 24-25 Then I told the men and their wives , that the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , had said : Here in Egypt you still keep your promises to burn incense and offer sacrifices of wine to the so-called Queen of Heaven .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	26	Keep these promises ! But let me tell you what will happen . As surely as I am the Lord God , I swear that I will never again accept any promises you make in my name .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	27	Instead of watching over you , I will watch for chances to harm you . Some of you will die in war , and others will starve to death .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	28	Only a few will escape and return to Judah . Then everyone who went to live in Egypt will know that when I say something will happen , it will—no matter what you say .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	29	And here is how you will know that I will keep my threats to punish you in Egypt .
CEV	Jeremiah	44	30	( A ) I will hand over King Hophra of Egypt to those who want to kill him , [ b ] just as I handed Zedekiah [ c ] over to Nebuchadnezzar , [ d ] who wanted to kill him .

CEV	Jeremiah	46	46	The Lord often told me what to say about the different nations of the world . What the Lord Says about Egypt
CEV	Jeremiah	46	2	( A ) In the fourth year that Jehoiakim [ a ] was king of Judah , King Nebuchadnezzar [ b ] of Babylonia defeated King Neco of Egypt [ c ] in a battle at the city of Carchemish near the Euphrates River . And here is what the Lord told me to say about the Egyptian army :
CEV	Jeremiah	46	3	It 's time to go into battle ! So grab your shields ,
CEV	Jeremiah	46	4	saddle your horses , and polish your spears . Put on your helmets and armor , then take your positions .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	5	I can see the battle now— you are defeated and running away , never once looking back . Terror is all around .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	6	You are strong and run fast , but you ca n't escape . You fall in battle near the Euphrates River .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	7	What nation is this , that rises like the Nile River overflowing its banks ?
CEV	Jeremiah	46	8	It is Egypt , rising with a roar like a raging river and saying , “ I 'll flood the earth , destroying cities , and killing everyone in them. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	46	9	Go ahead , Egypt . Tell your chariots and cavalry to attack and fight hard . Order your troops to march out , with Ethiopians [ d ] and Libyans carrying shields , and the Lydians [ e ] armed with bows and arrows .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	10	But the Lord All-Powerful will win this battle and take revenge on his enemies . His sword will eat them and drink their blood until it is full . They will be killed in the north near the Euphrates River , as a sacrifice to the Lord .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	11	Egypt , no medicine can heal you , not even the soothing lotion from Gilead .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	12	All nations have heard you weep ; you are disgraced , and they know it . Your troops fall to the ground , stumbling over each other . A Warning for Egypt 13-14 ( B ) When King Nebuchadnezzar [ f ] of Babylonia was on his way to attack Egypt , the Lord sent me with a warning for every Egyptian town , but especially for Migdol , Memphis , and Tahpanhes . He said to tell them : Prepare to defend yourselves ! Everywhere in your nation , people are dying in war .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	15	I have struck down your mighty god Apis [ g ] and chased him away . [ h ]
CEV	Jeremiah	46	16	Your soldiers stumble over each other and say , “ Get up ! The enemy will kill us , unless we can escape to our own land. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	46	17	Give the king of Egypt this new name , “ Talks-Big-Does-Nothing. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	46	18	Egypt , I am the true king , the Lord All-Powerful , and as surely as I live , those enemies who attack will tower over you like Mount Tabor among the hills or Mount Carmel by the sea .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	19	You will be led away captive , so pack a few things to bring with you . Your capital , Memphis , will lie empty and in ruins .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	20	An enemy from the north will attack you , beautiful Egypt , like a fly biting a cow .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	21	The foreign soldiers you hired will turn and run . But they are doomed , like well-fed calves being led to the butcher . *
CEV	Jeremiah	46	22	The enemy army will go forward like a swarm of locusts . [ i ] Your troops will feel helpless , like a snake in a forest
CEV	Jeremiah	46	23	when men with axes start chopping down trees . It can only hiss and try to escape .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	24	Your people will be disgraced and captured by the enemy from the north .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	25	I am the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel . Soon I will punish the god Amon of Thebes [ j ] and the other Egyptian gods , the Egyptian kings , the people of Egypt , and everyone who trusts in the Egyptian power .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	26	I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar and his army . But I also promise that Egypt will someday have people living here again , just as it had before . I , the Lord , have spoken . The Lord Will Bring Israel Home The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	46	27	( C ) Israel , [ k ] do n't be afraid . Someday I will bring you home from foreign lands . You and your descendants will live in peace and safety , with nothing to fear .
CEV	Jeremiah	46	28	So do n't be afraid , even though now you deserve to be punished and have been scattered among other nations . But when I destroy them , I will protect you . I , the Lord , have spoken . Footnotes - 46.2 Jehoiakim : See the note at 1.3 . - 46.2 King Nebuchadnezzar : Ruled 605–562 b.c . At the time of the battle in

CEV	Jeremiah	47	47	( A ) Before the king of Egypt attacked the town of Gaza , [ a ] the Lord told me to say to the Philistines :
CEV	Jeremiah	47	2	I , the Lord , tell you that your land will be flooded with an army from the north . It will destroy your towns and sweep you away , moaning and screaming .
CEV	Jeremiah	47	3	When you hear the thunder of horses and chariots , your courage will vanish , and parents will even abandon their own children .
CEV	Jeremiah	47	4	You refugees from Crete , [ b ] your time has now come , and I will destroy you . None of you will be left to help the cities of Tyre and Sidon .
CEV	Jeremiah	47	5	The Anakim who survive [ c ] in Gaza and Ashkelon will mourn for you by shaving their heads and sitting in silence .
CEV	Jeremiah	47	6	You ask how long will I continue to attack you with my sword , then you tell me to put it away and leave you alone .

CEV	Jeremiah	48	48	( A ) The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , told me to say to the nation of Moab : The town of Nebo is doomed ; Kiriathaim will be captured and disgraced , and even its fortress will be left in ruins .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	2	No one honors you , Moab . In Heshbon , enemies make plans to end your life . My sword will leave only silence in your town named “ Quiet. ” [ a ]
CEV	Jeremiah	48	3	The people of Horonaim will cry for help , as their town is attacked and destroyed .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	4	Moab will be shattered ! Your children will sob
CEV	Jeremiah	48	5	and cry on their way up to the town of Luhith ; on the road to Horonaim they will tell of disasters .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	6	Run for your lives ! Head into the desert like a wild donkey . [ b ]
CEV	Jeremiah	48	7	You thought you could be saved by your power and wealth , but you will be captured along with your god Chemosh , his priests , and officials .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	8	Not one of your towns will escape destruction . I have told your enemies , “ Wipe out the valley and the flatlands of Moab .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	9	Spread salt on the ground to kill the crops . [ c ] Leave its towns in ruins , with no one living there .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	10	I want you to kill the Moabites , and if you let them escape , I will put a curse on you. ”
CEV	Jeremiah	48	11	Moab , you are like wine left to settle undisturbed , never poured from jar to jar . And so , your nation continues to prosper and improve . [ d ]
CEV	Jeremiah	48	12	But now , I will send enemies to pour out the wine and smash the jars !
CEV	Jeremiah	48	13	Then you will be ashamed , because your god Chemosh can not save you , just as Bethel [ e ] could not help the Israelites .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	14	You claim that your soldiers are strong and brave .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	15	But I am the Lord , the all-powerful King , and I promise that enemies will overpower your towns . Even your best warriors will die in the battle .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	16	It wo n't be long now— disaster will hit Moab !
CEV	Jeremiah	48	17	I will order the nearby nations to mourn for you and say , “ Is n't it sad ? Moab ruled others , but now its glorious power has been shattered. ”

CEV	Jeremiah	48	25	My decision is final— your army will be crushed , and your power broken .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	26	People of Moab , you claim to be stronger than I am . Now I will tell other nations to make you drunk and to laugh while you collapse in your own vomit .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	27	You made fun of my people and treated them like criminals caught in the act .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	28	Now you must leave your towns and live like doves in the shelter of cliffs and canyons .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	29	I know about your pride , and how you strut and boast .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	30	But I also know bragging will never save you .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	31	So I will cry and mourn for Moab and its town of Kir-Heres .

CEV	Jeremiah	48	33	Harvest celebrations are gone from the orchards and farms of Moab . I have silenced the shouts of people making wine .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	34	Weeping from Heshbon can be heard as far as Elealeh and Jahaz ; cries from Zoar are heard in Horonaim and Eglath-Shelishiyah . And Nimrim Creek has run dry .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	35	I will get rid of anyone who burns incense to the gods of Moab or offers sacrifices at their shrines . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	36	In my heart I moan for Moab , like a funeral song played on a flute . I mourn for the people of the town of Kir-Heres , because their wealth is gone . * 37-38 The people of Moab mourn on the rooftops and in the streets . Men cut off their beards , people shave their heads ; they make cuts on their hands and wear sackcloth . [ j ] And it 's all because I , the Lord , have shattered Moab like a jar that no one wants .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	39	Moab lies broken ! Listen to its people cry as they turn away in shame . Other nations are horrified at what happened , but still they mock her .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	40	Moab , an enemy swoops down like an eagle spreading its wings over your land .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	41	Your cities [ k ] and fortresses will be captured , and your warriors as fearful as women giving birth . [ l ]

CEV	Jeremiah	48	45	Near the city of Heshbon , where Sihon once ruled , tired refugees stand in shadows cast by the flames of their burning city . Soon , the towns on other hilltops , where those warlike people live , will also go up in smoke .
CEV	Jeremiah	48	46	People of Moab , you worshiped Chemosh , your god , but now you are done for , and your children are prisoners in a foreign country .

CEV	Jeremiah	50	3	The attack on the Babylonians will come from the north ; they and their animals will run , leaving the land empty . Israel and Judah Will Return to Their Land

CEV	Jeremiah	50	5	You will ask the way to Zion and then come and join with me in making an agreement you wo n't break or forget .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	6	My people , you are lost sheep abandoned in the mountains by their shepherds . You do n't even remember your resting place .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	7	I am your true pastureland , the one who gave hope to your ancestors . But you abandoned me , so when your enemies found you , they felt no guilt as they gobbled you up .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	8	( B ) Escape from Babylonia , my people . Get out of that country ! Do n't wait for anyone else .

CEV	Jeremiah	50	10	Babylonia will be conquered , and its enemies will carry off everything they want . Babylon Will Be Disgraced The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	50	11	People of Babylonia , you were glad to rob my people . You had a good time , making more noise than horses and jumping around like calves threshing grain . [ c ]

CEV	Jeremiah	50	16	There is no one in Babylonia to plant or harvest crops . Even foreigners who lived there have left for their homelands , afraid of the enemy armies .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	17	Israel is a flock of sheep scattered by hungry lions . The king of Assyria [ d ] first gobbled Israel up . Then Nebuchadnezzar , [ e ] king of Babylonia , crunched on Israel 's bones .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	18	I , the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , punished the king of Assyria , and I will also punish the king of Babylonia .

CEV	Jeremiah	50	36	This war will prove that your prophets are liars and fools . And it will frighten your warriors .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	37	Then your chariot horses and the foreigners in your army will refuse to go into battle , and the enemy will carry away everything you treasure .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	38	Your rivers and canals will dry up . All of this will happen , because your land is full of idols , and they have made fools of you .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	39	( D ) Never again will people live in your land— only desert animals , jackals , [ g ] and unclean birds .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	40	( E ) I destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and the nearby towns , and I will destroy Babylon just as completely . No one will live there again . Babylonia Is Invaded The Lord said :
CEV	Jeremiah	50	41	Far to the north , a nation and its allies have been awakened . They are powerful and ready for war .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	42	Bows and arrows and swords are in their hands . The soldiers are cruel and show no pity . The hoofbeats of their horses echo like ocean waves crashing against the shore . The army has lined up for battle and is coming to attack you , people of Babylonia !
CEV	Jeremiah	50	43	Ever since your king heard about this army , he has been weak with fear ; he twists and turns in pain like a woman giving birth .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	44	Babylonia , I will attack you like a lion from the forest , attacking sheep in a meadow along the Jordan . In a moment the flock runs , and the land is empty . Who will I choose to attack you ? I will do it myself ! No one can force me to fight or chase me away .
CEV	Jeremiah	50	45	Listen to my plans for you , people of Babylonia . Your children will be dragged off , and your country destroyed .

CEV	Jeremiah	52	21	For example , the columns were about
CEV	Jeremiah	52	3	and it was Zedekiah who finally rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar . [ d ] The people of Judah and Jerusalem had made the Lord so angry that he finally turned his back on them . That 's why horrible things were happening there .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	4	( A ) In Zedekiah 's ninth year as king , on the tenth day of the tenth month , [ e ] King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia led his entire army to attack Jerusalem . The troops set up camp outside the city and built ramps up to the city walls . 5-6 After a year and a half , [ f ] all the food in Jerusalem was gone . Then on the ninth day of the fourth month , [ g ]
CEV	Jeremiah	52	7	( B ) the Babylonian troops broke through the city wall . That same night , Zedekiah and his soldiers tried to escape through the gate near the royal garden , even though they knew the enemy had the city surrounded . They headed toward the Jordan River valley ,
CEV	Jeremiah	52	8	meters high and 5.5 meters around . They were hollow , but the bronze was about
CEV	Jeremiah	52	9	Zedekiah was taken to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where Nebuchadnezzar put him on trial and found him guilty .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	10	Zedekiah 's sons and the officials of Judah were killed while he watched ,
CEV	Jeremiah	52	11	( C ) then his eyes were poked out . He was put in chains , then dragged off to Babylon and kept in prison until he died .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	12	Jerusalem was captured during Nebuchadnezzar 's nineteenth year as king of Babylonia . About a month later , [ h ] Nebuchadnezzar 's officer in charge of the guards arrived in Jerusalem . His name was Nebuzaradan ,
CEV	Jeremiah	52	13	( D ) and he burned down the Lord 's temple , the king 's palace , and every important building in the city , as well as all the houses .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	14	Then he ordered the Babylonian soldiers to break down the walls around Jerusalem .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	15	He led away the people left in the city , including everyone who had become loyal to Nebuchadnezzar , the rest of the skilled workers , [ i ] and even some of the poor people of Judah .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	16	Only the very poorest were left behind to work the vineyards and the fields . 17-20 ( E ) Nebuzaradan ordered his soldiers to go to the temple and take everything made of gold or silver , including bowls , fire pans , sprinkling bowls , pans , lampstands , dishes for incense , and the cups for wine offerings . The Babylonian soldiers took all the bronze things used for worship at the temple , including the pans for hot ashes , and the shovels , lamp snuffers , sprinkling bowls , and dishes for incense . The soldiers also took everything else made of bronze , including the two columns that stood in front of the temple , the large bowl called the Sea , the twelve bulls that held it up , and the movable stands . [ j ] The soldiers broke these things into pieces so they could take them to Babylonia . There was so much bronze that it could not be weighed .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	75	millimeters thick .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	22	Each column had a bronze cap over
CEV	Jeremiah	52	23	There were
CEV	Jeremiah	52	96	pomegranates evenly spaced [ l ] around each column , and a total of
CEV	Jeremiah	52	100	pomegranates were located above the chains .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	24	Next , Nebuzaradan arrested Seraiah the chief priest , Zephaniah his assistant , and three temple officials .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	25	Then he arrested one of the army commanders , seven of King Zedekiah 's personal advisors , and the officer in charge of gathering the troops for battle . He also found
CEV	Jeremiah	52	60	more soldiers who were still in Jerusalem . 26-27 Nebuzaradan led them to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where Nebuchadnezzar had them killed . The people of Judah no longer lived in their own country . People of Judah Taken Prisoner 28-30 Here is a list of the number of the people of Judah that Nebuchadnezzar [ m ] took to Babylonia as prisoners : In his seventh year as king , he took 3,023 people . In his eighteenth year as king , he took
CEV	Jeremiah	52	832	from Jerusalem . In his twenty-third year as king , his officer Nebuzaradan took
CEV	Jeremiah	52	745	people . So , Nebuchadnezzar took a total of 4,600 people from Judah to Babylonia . Jehoiachin Is Set Free (
CEV	Jeremiah	52	31	Jehoiachin was a prisoner in Babylon for
CEV	Jeremiah	52	37	years . Then Evil Merodach [ n ] became king of Babylonia , and in the first year of his rule , on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month , [ o ] he let Jehoiachin out of prison .
CEV	Jeremiah	52	32	Evil Merodach was kind to Jehoiachin and honored him more than any of the other kings held prisoner there .

CEV	Lamentations	1	1	( A ) Jerusalem , once so crowded , lies deserted and lonely . This city that was known all over the world is now like a widow . This queen of the nations has been made a slave .
CEV	Lamentations	1	2	Each night , bitter tears flood her cheeks . None of her former lovers are there to offer comfort ; her friends [ a ] have betrayed her and are now her enemies .
CEV	Lamentations	1	3	The people of Judah are slaves , suffering in a foreign land , with no rest from sorrow . Their enemies captured them and were terribly cruel . [ b ]
CEV	Lamentations	1	4	The roads to Zion mourn because no one travels there to celebrate the festivals . The city gates are deserted ; priests are weeping . Young women are raped ; [ c ] Zion is in sorrow !
CEV	Lamentations	1	5	Enemies now rule the city and live as they please . The Lord has punished Jerusalem because of her awful sins ; he has let her people be dragged away .
CEV	Lamentations	1	6	Zion 's glory has disappeared . Her leaders are like deer that can not find pasture ; they are hunted down till their strength is gone .
CEV	Lamentations	1	7	Her people recall the good life that once was theirs ; now they suffer and are scattered . No one was there to protect them from their enemies who sneered when their city was taken .
CEV	Lamentations	1	8	Jerusalem 's horrible sins have made the city a joke . Those who once admired her now hate her instead— she has been disgraced ; she groans and turns away .
CEV	Lamentations	1	9	Her sins had made her filthy , but she was n't worried about what could happen . And when Jerusalem fell , it was so tragic . No one gave her comfort when she cried out , “ Help ! I 'm in trouble , Lord ! The enemy has won. ”
CEV	Lamentations	1	10	Zion 's treasures were stolen . Jerusalem saw foreigners enter her place of worship , though the Lord had forbidden them to belong to his people . [ d ]
CEV	Lamentations	1	11	Everyone in the city groans while searching for food ; they trade their valuables for barely enough scraps to stay alive . Jerusalem Speaks : Jerusalem shouts to the Lord , “ Please look and see how miserable I am ! ”
CEV	Lamentations	1	12	No passerby even cares . [ e ] Why does n't someone notice my terrible sufferings ? You were fiercely angry , Lord , and you punished me worst of all .
CEV	Lamentations	1	13	From heaven you sent a fire that burned in my bones ; you set a trap for my feet and made me turn back . All day long you leave me in shock from constant pain .
CEV	Lamentations	1	14	You have tied my sins around my neck , [ f ] and they weigh so heavily that my strength is gone . You have put me in the power of enemies too strong for me .
CEV	Lamentations	1	15	You , Lord , have turned back my warriors and crushed my young heroes . Judah was a woman untouched , but you let her be trampled like grapes in a wine pit .
CEV	Lamentations	1	16	Because of this , I mourn , and tears flood my eyes . No one is here to comfort or to encourage me ; we have lost the war— my people are suffering . The Prophet Speaks :
CEV	Lamentations	1	17	Zion reaches out her hands , but no one offers comfort . The Lord has turned the neighboring nations against Jacob 's descendants . Jerusalem is merely a filthy rag to her neighbors . Jerusalem Speaks :
CEV	Lamentations	1	18	The Lord was right , but I refused to obey him . Now I ask all of you to look at my sufferings— even my young people have been dragged away .
CEV	Lamentations	1	19	I called out to my lovers , but they betrayed me . My priests and my leaders died while searching the city for scraps of food .
CEV	Lamentations	1	20	Wo n't you look and see how upset I am , our Lord ? My stomach is in knots , and my heart is broken because I betrayed you . In the streets and at home , my people are slaughtered .
CEV	Lamentations	1	21	Everyone heard my groaning , but no one offered comfort . My enemies know of the trouble that you have brought on me , and it makes them glad . Hurry and punish them , as you have promised .
CEV	Lamentations	1	22	Do n't let their evil deeds escape your sight . Punish them as much as you have punished me because of my sins . I never stop groaning— I 've lost all hope !

CEV	Lamentations	2	2	The Lord had no mercy ! He destroyed the homes of Jacob 's descendants . In his anger he tore down every walled city in Judah ; he toppled the nation together with its leaders , leaving them in shame .
CEV	Lamentations	2	3	The Lord was so furiously angry that he wiped out the whole army [ b ] of Israel by not supporting them when the enemy attacked . He was like a raging fire that swallowed up the descendants of Jacob .

CEV	Lamentations	2	9	Zion 's gates have fallen facedown on the ground ; the bars that locked the gates are smashed to pieces . Her king and royal family are prisoners in foreign lands . Her priests do n't teach , and her prophets do n't have a message from the Lord .
CEV	Lamentations	2	10	Zion 's leaders are silent . They just sit on the ground , tossing dirt on their heads and wearing sackcloth . Her young women can do nothing but stare at the ground .
CEV	Lamentations	2	11	My eyes are red from crying , my stomach is in knots , and I feel sick all over . My people are being wiped out , and children lie helpless in the streets of the city .
CEV	Lamentations	2	12	A child begs its mother for food and drink , then blacks out like a wounded soldier lying in the street . The child slowly dies in its mother 's arms .
CEV	Lamentations	2	13	Zion , how can I comfort you ? How great is your pain ? [ e ] Lovely city of Jerusalem , how can I heal your wounds , gaping as wide as the sea ?
CEV	Lamentations	2	14	Your prophets deceived you with false visions and lying messages— they should have warned you to leave your sins and be saved from disaster .
CEV	Lamentations	2	15	Those who pass by shake their heads and sneer as they make fun and shout , “ What a lovely city you were , the happiest on earth , but look at you now ! ”
CEV	Lamentations	2	16	Zion , your enemies curse you and snarl like wild animals , while shouting , “ This is the day we 've waited for ! At last , we 've got you ! ”
CEV	Lamentations	2	17	The Lord has done everything that he had planned and threatened long ago . He destroyed you without mercy and let your enemies boast about their powerful forces . [ f ]
CEV	Lamentations	2	18	Zion , deep in your heart you cried out to the Lord . Now let your tears overflow your walls day and night . Do n't ever lose hope or let your tears stop .
CEV	Lamentations	2	19	Get up and pray for help all through the night . Pour out your feelings to the Lord , as you would pour water out of a jug . Beg him to save your people , who are starving to death at every street crossing . Jerusalem Speaks :
CEV	Lamentations	2	20	Think about it , Lord ! Have you ever been this cruel to anyone before ? Is it right for mothers to eat their children , or for priests and prophets to be killed in your temple ?
CEV	Lamentations	2	21	My people , both young and old , lie dead in the streets . Because you were angry , my young men and women were brutally slaughtered .
CEV	Lamentations	2	22	When you were angry , Lord , you invited my enemies like guests for a party . No one survived that day ; enemies killed my children , my own little ones .

CEV	Ezekiel	1	1	1-3 ( A ) I am Ezekiel—a priest and the son of Buzi . [ a ] Five years after King Jehoiachin of Judah had been led away as a prisoner to Babylonia , I was living near the Chebar River among those who had been taken there with him . Then on the fifth day of the fourth month [ b ] of the thirtieth year , [ c ] the heavens suddenly opened . The Lord placed his hand upon me [ d ] and showed me some visions .
CEV	Ezekiel	1	4	I saw a windstorm blowing in from the north . Lightning flashed from a huge cloud and lit up the whole sky with a dazzling brightness . The fiery center of the cloud was as shiny as polished metal ,
CEV	Ezekiel	1	5	( B ) and in that center I saw what looked like four living creatures . They were somewhat like humans ,
CEV	Ezekiel	1	6	except that each one had four faces and four wings .
CEV	Ezekiel	1	7	Their legs were straight , but their feet looked like the hoofs of calves and sparkled like bronze .
CEV	Ezekiel	1	8	Under each of their wings , these creatures had a human hand .
CEV	Ezekiel	1	9	The four creatures were standing back to back with the tips of their wings touching . They moved together in every direction , without turning their bodies .
CEV	Ezekiel	1	10	( C ) Each creature had the face of a human in front , the face of a lion on the right side , the face of a bull on the left , and the face of an eagle in back .
CEV	Ezekiel	1	11	Two wings [ e ] of each creature were spread out and touched the wings of the creatures on either side . The other two wings of each creature were folded against its body .
CEV	Ezekiel	1	12	The four living creatures went wherever the Spirit led them , and they moved together without turning their bodies , because each creature faced straight ahead .

CEV	Ezekiel	1	25	When the creatures stopped flapping their wings , I heard a sound coming from above the dome .
CEV	Ezekiel	1	26	( I ) I then saw what looked like a throne made of sapphire , [ l ] and sitting on the throne was a figure in the shape of a human .
CEV	Ezekiel	1	27	( J ) From the waist up , it was glowing like metal in a hot furnace , and from the waist down it looked like the flames of a fire . The figure was surrounded by a bright light ,
CEV	Ezekiel	1	28	as colorful as a rainbow that appears after a storm . I realized I was seeing the brightness of the Lord 's glory ! So I bowed with my face to the ground , and just then I heard a voice speaking to me .

CEV	Ezekiel	2	2	After he said this , his Spirit took control of me and lifted me to my feet . Then the Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	2	3	Ezekiel , I am sending you to the people of Israel . They are just like their ancestors who rebelled against me and refused to stop .
CEV	Ezekiel	2	4	They are stubborn and hardheaded . But I , the Lord God , have chosen you to tell them what I say .
CEV	Ezekiel	2	5	Those rebels may not even listen , but at least they will know that a prophet has come to them .
CEV	Ezekiel	2	6	Do n't be afraid of them or of anything they say . You may think you 're in the middle of a thorn patch or a bunch of scorpions . But be brave
CEV	Ezekiel	2	7	and preach my message to them , whether they choose to listen or not .
CEV	Ezekiel	2	8	Ezekiel , do n't rebel against me , as they have done . Instead , listen to everything I tell you . And now , Ezekiel , open your mouth and eat what I am going to give you .
CEV	Ezekiel	2	9	( A ) Just then , I saw a hand stretched out toward me . And in it was a scroll . [ c ]

CEV	Ezekiel	3	4	The Lord said : Ezekiel , I am sending you to your own people . 5-6 They are Israelites , not some strangers who speak a foreign language you ca n't understand . If I were to send you to foreign nations , they would listen to you .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	7	But the people of Israel will refuse to listen , because they have refused to listen to me . All of them are stubborn and hardheaded ,
CEV	Ezekiel	3	8	so I will make you as stubborn as they are .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	9	You will be so determined to speak my message that nothing will stop you . I will make you hard like a diamond , and you 'll have no reason to be afraid of those arrogant rebels .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	10	Listen carefully to everything I say and then think about it .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	11	Then go to the people who were brought here to Babylonia with you and tell them you have a message from me , the Lord God . Do this , whether they listen to you or not .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	12	The Spirit [ a ] lifted me up , and as the glory of the Lord started to leave , [ b ] I heard a loud , thundering noise behind me .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	13	It was the sound made by the creatures ' wings as they brushed against each other , and by the rumble of the wheels beside them .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	14	Then the Spirit carried me away . The Lord 's power had taken complete control of me , and I was both annoyed and angry .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	15	When I was back with the others living at Abib Hill near the Chebar River , I sat among them for seven days , shocked at what had happened to me . The Lord Appoints Ezekiel To Stand Watch ( Ezekiel 33.1-9 )
CEV	Ezekiel	3	16	Seven days after I had seen the brightness of the Lord 's glory , the Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	3	17	Ezekiel , son of man , I have appointed you to stand watch for the people of Israel . So listen to what I say , then warn them for me .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	18	When I tell wicked people they will die because of their sins , you must warn them to turn from their sinful ways so they wo n't be punished . If you refuse , you are responsible for their death .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	19	However , if you do warn them , and they keep on sinning , they will die because of their sins , and you will be innocent .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	20	Now suppose faithful people start sinning , and I decide to put stumbling blocks in their paths to make them fall . They deserve to die because of their sins . So if you refuse to warn them , I will forget about the times they were faithful , and I will hold you responsible for their death .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	21	But if you do warn them , and they listen to you and stop sinning , I will let them live . And you will be innocent . Ezekiel Can not Talk
CEV	Ezekiel	3	22	The Lord took control of me and said , “ Stand up ! Go into the valley , and I will talk with you there. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	3	23	I immediately went to the valley , where I saw the brightness of the Lord 's glory , just as I had seen it near the Chebar River , and I bowed with my face to the ground .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	24	His Spirit took control of me and lifted me to my feet . Then the Lord said : Go back and lock yourself in your house !
CEV	Ezekiel	3	25	You will be tied up to keep you inside ,
CEV	Ezekiel	3	26	and I will make you unable to talk or to warn those who have rebelled against me .
CEV	Ezekiel	3	27	But the time will come , when I will tell you what to say , and you will again be able to speak my message . [ c ] Some of them will listen ; others will be stubborn and refuse to listen . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	4	4	Ezekiel , son of man , find a brick and sketch a picture of Jerusalem on it .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	2	Then prepare to attack the brick as if it were a real city . Build a dirt mound and a ramp up to the top and surround the brick with enemy camps . On every side put large wooden poles as though you were going to break down the gate to the city .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	3	Set up an iron pan like a wall between you and the brick . All this will be a warning for the people of Israel . 4-5 After that , lie down on your left side and stay there for
CEV	Ezekiel	4	390	days you are lying down .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	6	Then turn over and lie on your right side
CEV	Ezekiel	4	40	more days . That will be a sign of Judah 's punishment—one day for each year of its suffering .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	7	The brick stands for Jerusalem , so attack it ! Stare at it and shout angry warnings .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	8	I will tie you up , so you ca n't leave until your attack has ended .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	9	Get a large bowl . Then mix together wheat , barley , beans , lentils , and millet , and make some bread . This is what you will eat for the
CEV	Ezekiel	4	10	Eat only a small loaf of bread each day
CEV	Ezekiel	4	11	and drink only two large cups of water .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	12	Use dried human waste to start a fire , then bake the bread on the coals where everyone can watch you .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	13	When I scatter the people of Israel among the nations , they will also have to eat food that is unclean , just as you must do . [ b ]
CEV	Ezekiel	4	14	I said , “ Lord God , please do n't make me do that ! Never in my life have I eaten food that would make me unacceptable to you . I 've never eaten anything that died a natural death or was killed by a wild animal or that you said was unclean. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	4	15	The Lord replied , “ Instead of human waste , I will let you bake your bread on a fire made from cow manure .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	16	Ezekiel , the people of Jerusalem will starve . They will have so little food and water that they will be afraid and hopeless .
CEV	Ezekiel	4	17	Everyone will be shocked at what is happening , and , because of their sins , they will die a slow death. ” Footnotes - 4.4,5 Israel 's punishment : Israel here refers to the northern kingdom that was destroyed in

It is used here to show that when a city is under attack , people eat whatever food is left , even if the Lord had said it was unclean . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	5	5	I am the Lord God , and I have made Jerusalem the most important place in the world , and all other nations admire it .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	2	After you attack the brick that stands for Jerusalem , burn one pile of your hair on the brick . Chop up the second pile and let the small pieces of hair fall around the brick . Throw the third pile into the wind , and I will strike it with my own sword .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	3	Keep a few of the hairs and wrap them in the hem of your clothes .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	4	Then pull out a few of those hairs and throw them in the fire , so they will also burn . This fire will spread , destroying everyone in Israel .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	6	But the people of Jerusalem rebelled and refuse to obey me . They ignored my laws and have become even more sinful than the nations around them .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	7	So tell the people of Jerusalem : I am the Lord God ! You have refused to obey my laws and teachings , and instead you have obeyed the laws of the surrounding nations . You have become more rebellious than any of them !
CEV	Ezekiel	5	8	Now all those nations will watch as I turn against you and punish you
CEV	Ezekiel	5	9	for your sins . Your punishment will be more horrible than anything I 've ever done or will ever do again .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	10	( A ) Parents will be so desperate for food that they will eat their own children , and children will eat their parents . Those who survive this horror will be scattered in every direction .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	11	Your sins have disgusted me and made my temple unfit as a place to worship me . So I swear by my own life that I will cut you down [ a ] and show you no pity .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	12	A third of you will die here in Jerusalem from disease or starvation . Another third will be killed in war . And I will scatter the last third of you in every direction , then track you down and kill you .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	13	You will feel my fierce anger until I have finished taking revenge . Then you will know that I , the Lord , was furious because of your disobedience .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	14	Every passerby will laugh at your destruction . Foreign nations
CEV	Ezekiel	5	15	will insult you and make fun of you , but they will also be shocked and terrified at what I did in my anger .
CEV	Ezekiel	5	16	I will destroy your crops until you starve to death , and disasters will strike you like arrows .

CEV	Ezekiel	6	2	Ezekiel , son of man , face the hills of Israel and tell them :
CEV	Ezekiel	6	3	Listen , you mountains and hills , and every valley and gorge ! I , the Lord , am about to turn against you and crush all the places where foreign gods are worshiped .
CEV	Ezekiel	6	4	Every altar will be smashed , and in front of the idols I will put to death the people who worship them .

CEV	Ezekiel	6	9	where they will be prisoners . And when they think of me , they will realize that they disgraced me by rebelling and by worshiping idols . They will hate themselves for the evil things they did ,
CEV	Ezekiel	6	10	and they will know that I am the Lord and that my warnings must be taken seriously .
CEV	Ezekiel	6	11	The Lord God then said : Ezekiel , beat your fists together and stomp your feet in despair ! Moan in sorrow , because the people of Israel have done disgusting things and now will be killed by enemy troops , or they will die from starvation and disease .
CEV	Ezekiel	6	12	Those who live far away will be struck with deadly diseases . Those who live nearby will be killed in war . And the ones who are left will starve to death . I will let loose my anger on them !
CEV	Ezekiel	6	13	These people used to offer incense to idols at altars built on hills and mountaintops and in the shade of large oak trees . But when they see dead bodies lying around those altars , they will know that I am the Lord .

CEV	Ezekiel	8	8	God said , “ Make this hole bigger. ” And when I did , I realized it was a doorway .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	2	( A ) and I saw something in the shape of a human . [ b ] This figure was like fire from the waist down , and it was bright as polished metal from the waist up .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	3	It reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed my hair . Then in my vision the Lord 's Spirit lifted me into the sky and carried me to Jerusalem . The Spirit took me to the north gate of the temple 's inner courtyard , where there was an idol that disgusted the Lord and made him furious .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	4	( B ) Then I saw the brightness of the glory of the God of Israel , just as I had seen it near the Chebar River .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	5	God said to me , “ Ezekiel , son of man , look north. ” And when I did , I saw that repulsive idol by the altar near the gate .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	6	God then said , “ Do you see the terrible sins of the people of Israel ? Their sins are making my holy temple unfit as a place to worship me . Yet you will see even worse things than this. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	8	7	Next , I was taken to the entrance of the courtyard , where I saw a hole in the wall .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	9	“ Go in , ” God said , “ and see what horrible and evil things the people are doing. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	8	10	Inside , I saw that the walls were covered with pictures of reptiles and disgusting , unclean animals , [ c ] as well as with idols that the Israelites were worshiping .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	11	Seventy Israelite leaders were standing there , including Jaazaniah son of Shaphan . Each of these leaders was holding an incense burner , and the smell of incense filled the room .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	12	God said , “ Ezekiel , do you see what horrible things Israel 's leaders are doing in secret ? They have filled their rooms with idols . And they say I ca n't see them , because they think I have already deserted Israel .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	13	But I will show you something even worse than this. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	8	14	He took me to the north gate of the temple , where I saw women mourning for the god Tammuz . [ d ]
CEV	Ezekiel	8	15	God asked me , “ Can you believe what these women are doing ? But now I want to show you something even worse. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	8	16	I was then led into the temple 's inner courtyard , where I saw about
CEV	Ezekiel	8	25	men standing near the entrance , between the porch and the altar . Their backs were to the Lord 's temple , and they were bowing down to the rising sun .
CEV	Ezekiel	8	17	God said , “ Ezekiel , it 's bad enough that the people of Judah are doing these disgusting things . But they have also spread violence and injustice everywhere in Israel and have made me very angry . They have disgraced and insulted me in the worst possible way . [ e ]

CEV	Ezekiel	9	9	The Lord answered , “ The people of Israel and Judah have done horrible things . Their country is filled with murderers , and Jerusalem itself is filled with violence . They think that I have deserted them , and that I ca n't see what they are doing .
CEV	Ezekiel	9	2	I saw six men come through the north gate of the temple , each one holding a deadly weapon . A seventh man dressed in a linen robe was with them , and he was carrying things to write with . The men went into the temple and stood by the bronze altar .
CEV	Ezekiel	9	3	The brightness of God 's glory then left its place above the statues of the winged creatures [ a ] inside the temple and moved to the entrance . The Lord said to the man in the linen robe ,
CEV	Ezekiel	9	4	( A ) “ Walk through the city of Jerusalem and mark the forehead of anyone who is truly upset and sad about the terrible things that are being done here. ” 5-6 He turned to the other six men and said , “ Follow him and put to death everyone who does n't have a mark on their forehead . Show no mercy or pity ! Kill men and women , parents and children . Begin here at my temple , but be sure not to harm those who are marked. ” The men immediately killed the leaders who were standing there .
CEV	Ezekiel	9	7	Then the Lord said , “ Pollute the temple by piling the dead bodies in the courtyards . Now get busy ! ” They left and started killing the people of Jerusalem .
CEV	Ezekiel	9	8	I was then alone , so I bowed down and cried out to the Lord , “ Why are you doing this ? Are you so angry with the people of Jerusalem that everyone must die ? ”
CEV	Ezekiel	9	10	And so I will not have pity on them or forgive them . They will be punished for what they have done. ”

CEV	Ezekiel	10	10	Each wheel was exactly the same and had a second wheel that cut through the middle of it , [ e ]
CEV	Ezekiel	10	2	( B ) The Lord said to the man in the linen robe , “ Walk among the four wheels beside the creatures and pick up as many hot coals as you can carry . Then scatter them over the city of Jerusalem. ” I watched him as he followed the Lord 's instructions .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	3	The winged creatures were standing south of the temple when the man walked among them . A cloud filled the inner courtyard ,
CEV	Ezekiel	10	4	and the brightness of the Lord 's glory moved from above the creatures and stopped at the entrance of the temple . The entire temple was filled with his glory , and the courtyard was dazzling bright .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	5	The sound of the creatures ' wings was as loud as the voice of God All-Powerful and could even be heard in the outer courtyard .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	6	The man in the robe was now standing beside a wheel .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	7	One of the four creatures reached its hand into the fire among them and gave him some of the hot coals . The man took the coals and left .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	8	I noticed again that each of the four winged creatures had what looked like human hands under their wings ,
CEV	Ezekiel	10	9	( C ) and I saw the four wheels near the creatures . These wheels were shining like chrysolite . [ d ]
CEV	Ezekiel	10	11	so that they could move in any direction without turning . The wheels moved together whenever the creatures moved .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	12	( D ) I also noticed that the wheels and the creatures ' bodies , including their backs , their hands , and their wings , were covered with eyes .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	13	And I heard a voice calling these “ the wheels that spin. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	10	14	( E ) Each of the winged creatures had four faces : the face of a bull , [ f ] the face of a human , the face of a lion , and the face of an eagle . 15-17 These were the same creatures I had seen near the Chebar River . They controlled when and where the wheels moved—the wheels went wherever the creatures went and stopped whenever they stopped . Even when the creatures flew in the air , the wheels stayed beside them .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	18	Then I watched the brightness of the Lord 's glory move from the entrance of the temple and stop above the winged creatures .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	19	They spread their wings and flew into the air with the wheels at their side . They stopped at the east gate of the temple , and the Lord 's glory was above them .
CEV	Ezekiel	10	20	I knew for sure that these were the same creatures I had seen beneath the Lord 's glory near the Chebar River . 21-22 They had four wings with hands beneath them , and they had the same four faces as those near the River .

CEV	Ezekiel	11	14	The Lord replied :
CEV	Ezekiel	11	15	Ezekiel , son of man , the people living in Jerusalem claim that you and the other Israelites who were taken to Babylonia are too far away to worship me . They also claim that the land of Israel now belongs only to them .
CEV	Ezekiel	11	16	But here is what I want you to tell the Israelites in Babylonia : It 's true that I , the Lord God , have forced you out of your own country and made you live among foreign nations . But for now , I will be with you wherever you are , so that you can worship me .
CEV	Ezekiel	11	17	And someday , I will gather you from the nations where you are scattered and let you live in Israel again .
CEV	Ezekiel	11	18	When that happens , I want you to clear the land of all those idols I hate so much .
CEV	Ezekiel	11	19	( A ) Then I will take away your stubbornness and make you eager to be completely faithful to me . You will want to obey me

CEV	Ezekiel	11	23	left Jerusalem and stopped at a hill east of the city .

CEV	Ezekiel	12	12	The leader of Jerusalem will lift his own bag to his shoulders at sunset and leave through a hole that the others have dug in the wall of his house . He will cover his face , so he ca n't see the land he is leaving .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	2	Kings 25.6,7 , King Zedekiah of Judah was blinded before he was taken to Babylon . Copyright ©
CEV	Ezekiel	12	3	So before it gets dark , here is what I want you to do . Pack a few things as though you were going to be taken away as a prisoner . Then go outside where everyone can see you and walk around from place to place . Maybe as they watch , they will realize what rebels they are .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	4	After you have done this , return to your house . Later that evening leave your house as if you were going into exile .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	5	Dig through the wall of your house [ a ] and crawl out , carrying the bag with you . Make sure everyone is watching .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	6	Lift the bag to your shoulders , and with your face covered , take it into the darkness , so that you can not see the land you are leaving . All this will be a warning for the people of Israel .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	7	I did everything the Lord had said . I packed a few things . Then as the sun was going down , and while everyone was watching , I dug a hole through one of the walls of my house . I pulled out my bag , then lifted it to my shoulders and left in the darkness .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	8	The next morning , the Lord
CEV	Ezekiel	12	9	reminded me that those rebellious people did n't even ask what I was doing .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	10	So he sent me back to tell them : The Lord God has a message for the leader of Jerusalem and everyone living there !
CEV	Ezekiel	12	11	I have done these things to show them what will happen when they are taken away as prisoners .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	13	( B ) The Lord will spread out a net and trap him as he leaves Jerusalem . He will then be led away to the city of Babylon , but will never see that place , [ b ] even though he will die there .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	14	His own officials and troops will scatter in every direction , and the Lord will track them down and put them to death .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	15	The Lord will force the rest of the people in Jerusalem to live in foreign nations , where they will realize that he has done all these things .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	16	Some of them will survive the war , the starvation , and the deadly diseases . That way , they will be able to tell foreigners how disgusting their sins were , and that it was the Lord who punished them in this way . A Sign of Fear
CEV	Ezekiel	12	17	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	12	18	Ezekiel , son of man , shake with fear when you eat , and tremble when you drink .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	19	Tell the people of Israel that I , the Lord , say that someday everyone in Jerusalem will shake when they eat and tremble when they drink . Their country will be destroyed and left empty , because they have been cruel and violent .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	20	Every town will lie in ruins , and the land will be a barren desert . Then they will know that I am the Lord . The Words of the Lord Will Come True
CEV	Ezekiel	12	21	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	12	22	Ezekiel , son of man , you 've heard people in Israel use the saying , “ Time passes , and prophets are proved wrong. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	12	23	Now tell the people that I , the Lord , am going to prove that saying wrong . No one will ever be able to use it again in Israel , because very soon everything I have said will come true !
CEV	Ezekiel	12	24	The people will hear no more useless warnings and false messages .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	25	I will give them my message , and what I say will certainly happen . Warn those rebels that the time has come for them to be punished . I , the Lord , make this promise . 26-27 Ezekiel , the people of Israel are also saying that your visions and messages are only about things in the future .
CEV	Ezekiel	12	28	So tell them that my words will soon come true , just as I have warned . I , the Lord , have spoken .

CEV	Ezekiel	13	13	That wall is the city of Jerusalem . And I , the Lord God , am so angry that I will send strong winds , rainstorms , and hailstones to destroy it .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	2	Ezekiel , son of man , condemn the prophets of Israel who say they speak in my name , but who preach messages that come from their own imagination . Tell them it 's time to hear my message .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	3	I , the Lord God , say those lying prophets are doomed ! They do n't see visions—they make up their own messages !
CEV	Ezekiel	13	4	Israel 's prophets are no better than jackals [ a ] that hunt for food among the ruins of a city .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	5	They do n't warn the people about coming trouble or tell them how dangerous it is to sin against me .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	6	Those prophets lie by claiming they speak for me , but I have not even chosen them to be my prophets . And they still think their words will come true .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	7	They say they 're preaching my messages , but they are full of lies—I did not speak to them !
CEV	Ezekiel	13	8	So I am going to punish those lying prophets for deceiving the people of Israel with false messages .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	9	I will turn against them and no longer let them belong to my people . They will not be allowed to call themselves Israelites or even to set foot in Israel . Then they will realize that I am the Lord God .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	10	( A ) Those prophets refuse to be honest . They tell my people there will be peace , even though there 's no peace to be found . They are like workers who think they can fix a shaky wall by covering it with paint .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	11	But when I send rainstorms , hailstones , and strong winds , the wall will surely collapse .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	12	People will then ask the workers why the paint did n't hold it up .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	14	The lying prophets have tried to cover up the evil in Jerusalem , but I will tear down the city , all the way to its foundations . And when it collapses , those prophets will be killed , and everyone will know that I have done these things .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	15	The city of Jerusalem and its lying prophets will feel my fierce anger . Then I will announce that the city has fallen and that the lying prophets are dead ,
CEV	Ezekiel	13	16	because they promised my people peace , when there was no peace . I , the Lord God , have spoken . Women Who Wear Magic Charms The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	13	17	Ezekiel , son of man , now condemn the women of Israel who preach messages that come from their own imagination .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	18	Tell them they 're doomed ! They wear magic charms on their wrists and scarves on their heads , then trick others into believing they can predict the future . [ b ] They wo n't get away with telling those lies .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	19	They charge my people a few handfuls of barley and a couple pieces of bread , and then give messages that are insulting to me . They use lies to sentence the innocent to death and to help the guilty go free . And my people believe them !
CEV	Ezekiel	13	20	I hate the magic charms they use to trick people into believing their lies . I will rip those charms from their wrists and set free the people they have trapped like birds . [ c ]
CEV	Ezekiel	13	21	I will tear the scarves from their heads and rescue my people from their power once and for all . Then they will know that I am the Lord God .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	22	They do things I would never do . They lie to good people and encourage them to do wrong , and they convince the wicked to ruin their own lives by not turning from sin .
CEV	Ezekiel	13	23	I will no longer let these women give false messages and use magic , and I will free my people from their control . Then they will know that I , the Lord , have done these things . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	14	14	( A ) Even if Noah , Daniel , [ a ] and Job were living in that nation , their faithfulness would not save anyone but themselves .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	2	While they were there , the Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	14	3	Ezekiel , son of man , these men have started worshiping idols , though they know it will cause them to sin even more . So I refuse to give them a message !
CEV	Ezekiel	14	4	Tell the people of Israel that if they sin by worshiping idols and then go to a prophet to find out what I say , I will give them the answer their sins deserve .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	5	When they hear my message , maybe they will see that they need to turn back to me and stop worshiping those idols .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	6	Now , Ezekiel , tell everyone in Israel : I am the Lord God . Stop worshiping those idols I hate so much and come back to me .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	7	Suppose one of you Israelites or a foreigner living in Israel rejects me and starts worshiping idols . If you then go to a prophet to find out what I say , I will answer
CEV	Ezekiel	14	8	by turning against you . I will make you a warning to anyone who might think of doing the same thing , and you will no longer belong to my people . Then you will know that I am the Lord and that you have sinned against me .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	9	If a prophet gives a false message , I am the one who caused that prophet to lie . But I will still reject him and cut him off from my people ,
CEV	Ezekiel	14	10	and anyone who goes to that prophet for a message will be punished in the same way .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	11	I will do this , so that you will come back to me and stop destroying yourselves with these disgusting sins . So turn back to me ! Then I will be your God , and you will be my people . I , the Lord God , make this promise . Judgment on a Sinful Nation
CEV	Ezekiel	14	12	The Lord God said :
CEV	Ezekiel	14	13	Ezekiel , son of man , suppose an entire nation sins against me , and I punish it by destroying the crops and letting its people and livestock starve to death .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	15	Or suppose I punish a nation by sending wild animals to eat people and scare away every passerby , so that the land becomes a barren desert .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	16	As surely as I live , I promise that even if these three men lived in that nation , their own children would not be spared . The three men would live , but the land would be an empty desert .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	17	Or suppose I send an enemy to attack a sinful nation and kill its people and livestock .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	18	If these three men were in that nation when I punished it , not even their children would be spared . Only the three men would live .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	19	And suppose I am so angry that I send a deadly disease to wipe out the people and livestock of a sinful nation .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	20	Again , even if Noah , Daniel , and Job were living there , I , the Lord , promise that the children of these faithful men would also die . Only the three of them would be spared .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	21	( B ) I am the Lord God , and I promise to punish Jerusalem severely . I will send war , starvation , wild animals , and deadly disease to slaughter its people and livestock .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	22	And those who survive will be taken from their country and led here to Babylonia . Ezekiel , when you see how sinful they are , you will know why I did all these things to Jerusalem .
CEV	Ezekiel	14	23	You will be convinced that I , the Lord God , was right in doing what I did . Footnotes - 14.14 Daniel : Or “ Danel , ” possibly a well-known hero or wise man . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	15	15	Some time later , the Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	15	2	Ezekiel , son of man , what happens to the wood of a grapevine after the grapes have been picked ? It is n't like other trees in the forest ,
CEV	Ezekiel	15	3	because the wood of a grapevine ca n't be used to make anything , not even a small peg to hang things on .
CEV	Ezekiel	15	4	It can only be used as firewood . But after its ends are burnt and its middle is charred , it ca n't be used for anything .
CEV	Ezekiel	15	5	The wood is useless before it is burned , and afterwards , it is completely worthless .
CEV	Ezekiel	15	6	I , the Lord God , promise that just as the wood of a grapevine is burned as firewood ,
CEV	Ezekiel	15	7	I will punish the people of Jerusalem with fire . Some of them have escaped one destruction , but soon they will be completely burned . And when that happens , you , Ezekiel , will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	15	8	I will make their country an empty wasteland , because they have not been loyal to me . I , the Lord God , have spoken . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	16	16	You made shrines for yourself and decorated them with some of your clothes . That 's where you took your visitors to have sex with them . These things should never have happened ! [ f ]
CEV	Ezekiel	16	2	Ezekiel , son of man , remind the people of Jerusalem of their disgusting sins
CEV	Ezekiel	16	3	and tell them that I , the Lord God , am saying : Jerusalem , you were born in the country where Canaanites lived . Your father was an Amorite , and your mother was a Hittite . [ a ]
CEV	Ezekiel	16	4	When you were born , no one cut you loose from your mother or washed your body . No one rubbed your skin with salt and olive oil , [ b ] and wrapped you in warm blankets .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	5	Not one person loved you enough to do any of these things , and no one even felt sorry for you . You were despised , thrown into a field , and forgotten .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	6	I saw you lying there , rolling around in your own blood , and I could n't let you die .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	7	I took care of you , like someone caring for a tender , young plant . You grew up to be a beautiful young woman with mature breasts and hair , but you were still naked .

CEV	Ezekiel	16	9	I washed the blood off you and rubbed your skin with olive oil .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	10	I gave you the finest clothes and the most expensive robes , [ d ] as well as sandals made from the best leather .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	11	I gave you bracelets , a necklace ,
CEV	Ezekiel	16	12	a ring for your nose , some earrings , and a beautiful crown .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	13	Your jewelry was gold and silver , and your clothes were made of only the finest material and embroidered linen . Your bread was baked from fine flour , and you ate honey and olive oil . You were as beautiful as a queen ,
CEV	Ezekiel	16	14	and everyone on earth knew it . I , the Lord God , had helped you become a lovely young woman .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	15	You learned that you were attractive enough to have any man you wanted , so you offered yourself to every passerby . [ e ]
CEV	Ezekiel	16	17	You made idols out of the gold and silver jewelry I gave you , then you sinned by worshiping those idols .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	18	You dressed them in the clothes you got from me , and you offered them the olive oil and incense I gave you .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	19	I supplied you with fine flour , olive oil , and honey , but you sacrificed it all as offerings to please those idols . I , the Lord God , watched this happen .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	20	But you did something even worse than that—you sacrificed your own children to those idols !
CEV	Ezekiel	16	21	You slaughtered my children , so you could offer them as sacrifices .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	22	You were so busy sinning and being a prostitute that you refused to think about the days when you were young and were rolling around naked in your own blood .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	23	Now I , the Lord God , say you are doomed ! Not only did you do these evil things ,
CEV	Ezekiel	16	24	but you also built places on every street corner
CEV	Ezekiel	16	25	where you disgraced yourself by having sex with anyone who walked by . And you did that more and more every day !
CEV	Ezekiel	16	26	To make me angry , you even offered yourself to Egyptians , who were always ready to sleep with you .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	27	So I punished you by letting those greedy Philistine enemies take over some of your territory . But even they were offended by your repulsive behavior .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	28	You could n't get enough sex , so you chased after Assyrians and slept with them . You still were n't satisfied ,
CEV	Ezekiel	16	29	so you went after Babylonians . But those merchants could not satisfy you either .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	30	. - 16.45 Amorite … Hittite : See the note at 16.3 . - 16.60 the agreement … when you were young : See verse
CEV	Ezekiel	16	31	You had sex on every street corner , and when you finished , you refused to accept money . That 's worse than being a prostitute !
CEV	Ezekiel	16	32	You are nothing but an unfaithful wife who would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	33	Prostitutes accept money for having sex , but you bribe men from everywhere to have sex with you .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	34	You 're not like other prostitutes . Men do n't ask you for sex—you offer to pay them ! Jerusalem Must Be Punished The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	16	35	Jerusalem , you prostitute , listen to me .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	36	You chased after lovers , then took off your clothes and had sex . You even worshiped disgusting idols and sacrificed your own children as offerings to them .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	37	So I , the Lord God , will gather every one of your lovers , those you liked and those you hated . They will stand around you , and I will rip off your clothes and let all of those lovers stare at your nakedness .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	38	I will find you guilty of being an unfaithful wife and a murderer , and in my fierce anger I will sentence you to a violent death !
CEV	Ezekiel	16	39	Then I will hand you over to your lovers , who will tear down the places where you had sex . They will take your clothes and jewelry , leaving you naked and empty-handed .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	40	Your lovers and an angry mob will stone you to death ; they will cut your dead body into pieces
CEV	Ezekiel	16	41	and burn down your houses . Other women will watch these terrible things happen to you . I promise to stop you from being a prostitute and paying your lovers for sex .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	42	Only then will I calm down and stop being angry and jealous .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	43	You made me furious by doing all these disgusting things and by forgetting how I took care of you when you were young . Then you made things worse by acting like a prostitute . You must be punished ! I , the Lord God , have spoken . Jerusalem 's Two Sisters The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	16	44	People will use this saying about you , Jerusalem : “ If the mother is bad , so is her daughter. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	16	45	You are just like your mother , who hated her husband and her own children . You are also like your sisters , who hated their husbands and children . Your father was an Amorite , and your mother was a Hittite . [ h ]
CEV	Ezekiel	16	46	Your older sister was Samaria , that city to your north with her nearby villages . Your younger sister was Sodom , that city to your south with her nearby villages .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	47	You followed their way of life and their wicked customs , and soon you were more repulsive than they were .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	48	As surely as I am the living Lord God , the people of Sodom and its nearby villages were never as sinful as you .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	49	They were arrogant and spoiled ; they had everything they needed and still refused to help the poor and needy .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	50	They thought they were better than everyone else , and they did things I hate . And so I destroyed them .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	51	You people of Jerusalem have sinned twice as much as the people of Samaria . In fact , your evil ways have made both Sodom and Samaria look innocent .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	52	So their punishment will seem light compared to yours . You will be disgraced and put to shame because of your disgusting sins . Jerusalem Will Be Ashamed The Lord said to Jerusalem :
CEV	Ezekiel	16	53	Someday I will bless Sodom and Samaria and their nearby villages . I will also bless you , Jerusalem .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	54	Then you will be ashamed of how you 've acted , and Sodom and Samaria will be relieved that they were n't as sinful as you .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	55	When that day comes , you and Sodom and Samaria will once again be well-off , and all nearby villages will be restored .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	56	Jerusalem , you were so arrogant that you sneered at Sodom .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	57	But now everyone has learned how wicked you really are . The countries of Syria and Philistia , as well as your other neighbors , hate you and make insulting remarks .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	58	You must pay for all the vulgar and disgusting things you have done . I , the Lord , have spoken . The Lord Makes a Promise to Jerusalem The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	16	59	Jerusalem , you deserve to be punished , because you broke your promises and ignored our agreement .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	60	But I remember the agreement I made with you when you were young , [ i ] and so I will make you a promise that will last forever .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	61	When you think about how you acted , you will be ashamed , especially when I return your sisters [ j ] to you as daughters , even though this was not part of our agreement . [ k ]
CEV	Ezekiel	16	62	I will keep this solemn promise , and you will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	16	63	I will forgive you , but you will think about your sins and be too ashamed to say a word . I , the Lord God , have spoken .

CEV	Ezekiel	17	3	so they will understand what I am saying to them : A large eagle with strong wings and beautiful feathers once flew to Lebanon . It broke the top branch off a cedar tree ,
CEV	Ezekiel	17	4	then carried it to a nation of merchants and left it in one of their cities .
CEV	Ezekiel	17	5	The eagle also took a seed from Israel and planted it in a fertile field with plenty of water , like a willow tree beside a stream . [ a ]
CEV	Ezekiel	17	6	The seed sprouted and grew into a grapevine that spread over the ground . It had lots of leaves and strong , deep roots , and its branches grew upward toward the eagle .
CEV	Ezekiel	17	7	There was another eagle with strong wings and thick feathers . The roots and branches of the grapevine soon turned toward this eagle , hoping it would bring water for the soil .
CEV	Ezekiel	17	8	But the vine was already growing in fertile soil , where there was plenty of water to produce healthy leaves and large grapes .
CEV	Ezekiel	17	9	Now tell me , Ezekiel , do you think this grapevine will live ? Or will the first eagle pull it up by its roots and pluck off the grapes and let its new leaves die ? The eagle could easily kill it without the help of a large and powerful army .
CEV	Ezekiel	17	10	The grapevine is strong and healthy , but as soon as the scorching desert wind blows , it will quickly wither . The Lord Explains the Story
CEV	Ezekiel	17	11	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	17	12	( A ) Ezekiel , ask the rebellious people of Israel if they know what this story means . Tell them that the king of Babylonia came to Jerusalem , then he captured the king of Judah [ b ] and his officials , and took them back to Babylon as prisoners .
CEV	Ezekiel	17	13	He chose someone from the family of Judah 's king [ c ] and signed a treaty with him , then made him swear to be loyal . He also led away other important citizens ,
CEV	Ezekiel	17	14	so that the rest of the people of Judah would obey only him and never gain control of their own country again .
CEV	Ezekiel	17	15	But this new king of Judah later rebelled against Babylonia and sent officials to Egypt to get horses and troops . Will this king be successful in breaking the treaty with Babylonia ? Or will he be punished for what he 's done ?

CEV	Ezekiel	17	18	The king of Judah broke his own promises and ignored the treaty with Babylonia . And so he will be punished !
CEV	Ezekiel	17	19	He made a promise in my name and swore to honor the treaty . And now that he has broken that promise , my name is disgraced . He must pay for what he 's done .
CEV	Ezekiel	17	20	I will spread out a net to trap him . Then I will drag him to Babylon and see that he is punished for his unfaithfulness to me .
CEV	Ezekiel	17	21	His best troops [ d ] will be killed in battle , and the survivors will be scattered in every direction . I , the Lord , have spoken .

CEV	Ezekiel	18	18	It is his father who will die for cheating and robbing and doing evil .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	2	( A ) Ezekiel , I hear the people of Israel using the old saying , “ Sour grapes eaten by parents leave a sour taste in the mouths of their children. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	18	3	Now tell them that I am the Lord God , and as surely as I live , that saying will no longer be used in Israel .

CEV	Ezekiel	18	12	cheats the poor , and robs people . He keeps what is given to him as security for a loan . He worships idols , does disgusting things ,
CEV	Ezekiel	18	13	and charges high interest when lending money . An evil man like that will certainly not live . He is the one who has done these horrible sins , so it 's his own fault that he will be put to death .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	14	But suppose this evil man has a son who sees his father do these things and refuses to act like him .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	15	He does n't eat meat at local shrines or worship Israel 's idols , and he does n't have sex with someone else 's wife .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	16	He never cheats or robs anyone and does n't even demand security for a loan . He gives food and clothes to the poor
CEV	Ezekiel	18	17	and refuses to do anything evil [ a ] or to charge interest . And he obeys all my laws and teachings . Such a man will live . His own father sinned , but this good man will not be put to death for the sins of his father .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	19	You may wonder why a son is n't punished for the sins of his father . It is because the son does what is right and obeys my laws .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	20	( C ) Only those who sin will be put to death . Children wo n't suffer for the sins of their parents , and parents wo n't suffer for the sins of their children . Good people will be rewarded for what they do , and evil people will be punished for what they do .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	21	Suppose wicked people stop sinning and start obeying my laws and doing right . They wo n't be put to death .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	22	All their sins will be forgiven , and they will live because they did right .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	23	I , the Lord God , do n't like to see wicked people die . I had much rather see them turn back from their sins and live .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	24	But when good people start sinning and doing disgusting things , will they live ? No ! All their good deeds will be forgotten , and they will be put to death because of their sins .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	25	You people of Israel accuse me of being unfair ! But listen—I 'm not unfair ; you are !
CEV	Ezekiel	18	26	If good people start doing evil , they must be put to death , because they have sinned .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	27	And if wicked people start doing right , they will save themselves from punishment .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	28	They will think about what they 've done and stop sinning , and so they wo n't be put to death .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	29	But you still say that I am unfair . You are the ones who have done wrong and are unfair !
CEV	Ezekiel	18	30	I will judge each of you for what you 've done . So stop sinning , or else you will certainly be punished .
CEV	Ezekiel	18	31	Give up your evil ways and start thinking pure thoughts . And be faithful to me ! Do you really want to be put to death for your sins ?
CEV	Ezekiel	18	32	( D ) I , the Lord God , do n't want to see that happen to anyone . So stop sinning and live ! Footnotes - 18.17 evil : One ancient translation ; Hebrew “ for the poor. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	19	19	Ezekiel , sing a funeral song for two of Israel 's leaders : [ a ]
CEV	Ezekiel	19	2	Your mother was a brave lioness who raised her cubs among lions .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	3	She taught one of them to hunt , and he learned to eat people .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	4	When the nations heard of him , they trapped him in a pit , then they used hooks to drag him to Egypt .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	5	His mother waited for him to return . But soon she lost all hope and raised another cub , who also became fierce .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	6	He hunted with other lions and learned to eat people .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	7	He destroyed fortresses [ b ] and ruined towns ; his mighty roar terrified everyone .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	8	Nations plotted to kill him , and people came from all over to spread out a net and catch him in a trap .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	9	They put him in a cage and took him to Babylonia . The lion was locked away , so that his mighty roar would never again be heard on Israel 's hills .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	10	Your mother was a vine like you , [ c ] growing near a stream . There was plenty of water , so she was filled with branches and with lots of fruit .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	11	Her strong branches became symbols of authority , and she was taller than all other trees— everyone could see how strong and healthy she was .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	12	But in anger , I pulled her up by the roots and threw her to the ground , where the scorching desert wind dried out her fruit . Her strong branches wilted and burned up .
CEV	Ezekiel	19	13	Then she was planted in a hot , dry desert ,
CEV	Ezekiel	19	14	where her stem caught fire , and flames burned her branches and fruit . Not one strong branch is left ; she is stripped bare . This funeral song must be sung with sorrow . Footnotes - 19.1 two of Israel 's leaders : Probably Jehoahaz ( ruled three months in

CEV	Ezekiel	20	20	I told them to respect my Sabbath to show that they were my people and that I was the Lord their God .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	2	Just then , the Lord God said :
CEV	Ezekiel	20	3	Ezekiel , son of man , these leaders have come to find out what I want them to do . As surely as I live , I will not give them an answer of any kind .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	4	Are you willing to warn them , Ezekiel ? Then remind them of the disgusting sins of their ancestors .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	5	( A ) Tell them that long ago I , the Lord God , chose Israel to be my own . I appeared to their ancestors in Egypt and made a solemn promise that I would be their God and the God of their descendants .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	6	I swore that I would rescue them from Egypt and lead them to a land I had already chosen . This land was rich with milk and honey and was the most splendid land of all .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	7	I told them to get rid of their disgusting idols and not to sin by worshiping the gods of Egypt . I reminded them that I was the Lord their God ,
CEV	Ezekiel	20	8	but they still rebelled against me . They refused to listen and kept on worshiping their idols and foreign gods . In my anger , I decided to punish the Israelites in Egypt .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	9	But that would have made me look like a liar , because I had already promised in front of everyone that I would lead them out of Egypt .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	10	So I brought them out and led them into the desert .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	11	( B ) I gave them my laws and teachings , so they would know how to live right .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	12	( C ) And I commanded them to respect the Sabbath as a way of showing that they were holy and belonged to me .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	13	But the Israelites rebelled against me in the desert . They refused to obey my laws and teachings , and they treated the Sabbath like any other day . Then in my anger , I decided to destroy the Israelites in the desert once and for all .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	14	But that would have disgraced me , because many other nations had seen me bring the Israelites out of Egypt .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	15	( D ) Instead , I told them in the desert that I would not lead them into the beautiful , fertile land I had promised .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	16	I said this because they had not only ignored my laws and teachings , but had disgraced my Sabbath and worshiped idols .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	17	Yet , I felt sorry for them and could not let them die in the desert .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	18	So I warned the children not to act like their parents or follow their evil ways or worship their idols .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	19	I reminded them that I was the Lord their God and that they should obey my laws and teachings .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	21	But the children also rebelled against me . They refused to obey my laws and teachings , and they treated the Sabbath as any other day . I became angry and decided to punish them in the desert .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	22	But I did not . That would have disgraced me in front of the nations that had seen me bring the Israelites out of Egypt .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	23	( E ) So I solemnly swore that I would scatter the people of Israel across the nations ,
CEV	Ezekiel	20	24	because they had disobeyed my laws and ignored my teachings ; they had disgraced my Sabbath and worshiped the idols their ancestors had made .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	25	I gave them laws that bring punishment instead of life ,
CEV	Ezekiel	20	26	and I let them offer me unacceptable sacrifices , including their first-born sons . I did this to horrify them and to let them know that I , the Lord , was punishing them .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	27	Ezekiel , tell the people of Israel that their ancestors also rejected and insulted me
CEV	Ezekiel	20	28	by offering sacrifices , incense , and wine to gods on every hill and under every large tree . I was very angry , because they did these things in the land I had given them !
CEV	Ezekiel	20	29	I asked them where they went to worship those gods , and they answered , “ At the local shrines. ” [ b ] And those places of worship are still called shrines .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	30	Then ask the Israelites why they are following the example of their wicked ancestors
CEV	Ezekiel	20	31	by worshiping idols and by sacrificing their own children as offerings . They commit these sins and still think they can ask me for a message . As surely as I am the living Lord God , I will give them no answer .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	32	They may think they can be like other nations and get away with worshiping idols made of wood and stone . But that will never happen ! The Lord Promises To Restore Israel The Lord said to the people of Israel :
CEV	Ezekiel	20	33	As surely as I am the living Lord God , I will rule over you with my powerful arm . You will feel my fierce anger
CEV	Ezekiel	20	34	and my power , when I gather you from the places where you are scattered
CEV	Ezekiel	20	35	and lead you into a desert surrounded by nations . I will meet you there face to face . Then I will pass judgment on you
CEV	Ezekiel	20	36	and punish you , just as I punished your ancestors in the desert near Egypt . [ c ]
CEV	Ezekiel	20	37	I will force each of you to obey the regulations of our solemn agreement .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	38	I will separate the sinful rebels from the rest of you , and even though I will bring them from the nations where they live in exile , they wo n't be allowed to return to Israel . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	39	. Copyright ©
CEV	Ezekiel	20	40	When that day comes , everyone in Israel will worship me on Mount Zion , my holy mountain in Jerusalem . I will once again call you my own , and I will accept your sacred offerings and sacrifices .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	41	When I bring you home from the places where you are now scattered , I will be pleased with you , just as I am pleased with the smell of the smoke from your sacrifices . Every nation on earth will see that I am holy ,
CEV	Ezekiel	20	42	and you will know that I , the Lord , am the one who brought you back to Israel , the land I promised your ancestors .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	43	Then you will remember your wicked sins , and you will hate yourselves for doing such horrible things . They have made you unacceptable to me ,
CEV	Ezekiel	20	44	so you deserve to be punished . But I will treat you in a way that will bring honor to my name , and you will know that I am the Lord God . Fire from the South
CEV	Ezekiel	20	45	The Lord said ,
CEV	Ezekiel	20	46	“ Ezekiel , son of man , turn toward the south and warn the forests
CEV	Ezekiel	20	47	that I , the Lord God , will start a fire that will burn up every tree , whether green or dry . Nothing will be able to put out the blaze of that fire as it spreads to the north and burns everything in its path .
CEV	Ezekiel	20	48	Everyone will know that I started it , and that it can not be stopped. ”

CEV	Ezekiel	21	21	When the Babylonian king stands at that signpost , he will decide which way to go by shaking his arrows , by asking his idols , and by carefully looking at the liver of a sacrificed animal . [ d ]
CEV	Ezekiel	21	2	Ezekiel , son of man , condemn the places in Jerusalem where people worship . Warn everyone in Israel
CEV	Ezekiel	21	3	that I am about to punish them . I will pull out my sword and have it ready to kill everyone , whether good or evil .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	4	From south to north , people will die ,

CEV	Ezekiel	21	8	The Lord said : 9-10 Ezekiel , son of man , tell the people of Jerusalem : I have sharpened my sword to slaughter you ; it is shiny and will flash like lightning ! Do n't celebrate— punishment is coming , because everyone has ignored my warnings . [ a ]
CEV	Ezekiel	21	11	My sword has been polished ; it 's sharp and ready to kill .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	12	Groan in sorrow , Ezekiel ; the sword is drawn against my people and their leaders . They will die ! So give up all hope .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	13	I am testing my people , and they can do nothing to stop me . [ b ] I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	14	Ezekiel , warn my people , then celebrate my victory by clapping your hands . My vicious sword will attack again and again , killing my people with every stroke .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	15	They will lose all courage and stumble with fear . My slaughtering sword is waiting at every gate , flashing and ready to kill . [ c ]
CEV	Ezekiel	21	16	It will slash right and left , wherever the blade is pointed .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	17	Then I will stop being angry , and I will clap my hands in victory . I , the Lord , have spoken . The King of Babylonia and His Sword
CEV	Ezekiel	21	18	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	21	19	Ezekiel , son of man , mark two roads for the king of Babylonia to follow when he comes with his sword . The roads will begin at the same place , but be sure to put up a signpost where the two roads separate and go in different directions .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	20	Clearly mark where the two roads lead . One goes to Rabbah , the capital of Ammon , and the other goes to Jerusalem , the fortified capital of Judah .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	22	His right hand will pull out the arrow marked “ Jerusalem. ” Then he will immediately give the signal to shout the battle cry , to build dirt ramps up to the top of the city walls , to break down its walls and gates with large wooden poles , and to kill the people .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	23	Everyone in Jerusalem had promised to be loyal to Babylonia , and so none of them will believe that this could happen to them . But Babylonia 's king will remind them of their sinful ways and warn them of their coming captivity .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	24	Ezekiel , tell the people of Jerusalem and their ruler that I , the Lord God , am saying : Everything you do is wicked and shows how sinful you are . You are guilty and will be taken away as prisoners .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	25	And now , you evil and wicked ruler of Israel , your day of final punishment is almost here .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	26	I , the Lord God , command you to take off your royal turban and your crown , because everything will be different . Those who had no power will be put in charge , and those who now rule will become nobodies .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	27	I will leave Jerusalem in complete ruins like no one has ever seen until my chosen one comes to punish this city . Judgment against Ammon
CEV	Ezekiel	21	28	( A ) The Lord God said : Ezekiel , son of man , the Ammonites have insulted Israel , so condemn them and tell them I am saying : A sword is drawn , ready to slaughter ; it is polished and prepared to kill as fast as lightning .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	29	You wicked Ammonites see false visions and believe untrue messages . But your day of punishment is coming soon , and my sword will slaughter you !
CEV	Ezekiel	21	30	Your days to punish others are over , so put your swords away . [ e ] You will be punished in the land of your birth .
CEV	Ezekiel	21	31	My furious anger will scorch you like fire , and I will hand you over to cruel men who are experts in killing .

CEV	Ezekiel	22	22	like silver in a furnace . Then they will know that I , the Lord , have punished them in my anger . Everyone in Jerusalem Is Guilty
CEV	Ezekiel	22	2	Ezekiel , son of man , are you ready to condemn Jerusalem ? That city is filled with murderers , so remind the people of their sins
CEV	Ezekiel	22	3	and tell them I am saying : Jerusalem , you have murdered many of your own people and have worshiped idols . You will soon be punished !
CEV	Ezekiel	22	4	Those crimes have made you guilty , and the idols have made you unacceptable to me . So your final punishment is near . Other nations will laugh at you and make insulting remarks ,
CEV	Ezekiel	22	5	and people far and near will make fun of your misery .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	6	Your own leaders use their power to murder .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	7	( A ) None of you honor your parents , and you cheat foreigners , orphans , and widows .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	8	( B ) You show no respect for my sacred places and treat the Sabbath just like any other day .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	9	Some of your own people tell lies , so that others will be put to death . Some of you eat meat sacrificed to idols at local shrines , and others never stop doing vulgar things .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	10	( C ) Men have sex with their father 's wife or with women who are having their monthly period
CEV	Ezekiel	22	11	or with someone else 's wife . Some men even sleep with their own daughter-in-law or half sister .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	12	( D ) Others of you accept money to murder someone . Your own people charge high interest when making a loan to other Israelites , and they get rich by cheating . Worst of all , you have forgotten me , the Lord God .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	13	I will shake my fist in anger at your violent crimes .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	14	When I 'm finished with you , your courage will disappear , and you will be so weak that you wo n't be able to lift your hands . I , the Lord , have spoken and will not change my mind .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	15	I will scatter you throughout every nation on earth and put a stop to your sinful ways .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	16	You [ a ] will be humiliated in the eyes of other nations . Then you will know that I , the Lord God , have done these things . Jerusalem Must Be Purified
CEV	Ezekiel	22	17	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	22	18	Ezekiel , son of man , I consider the people of Israel as worthless as the leftover metal in a furnace after silver has been purified .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	19	So I am going to bring them together in Jerusalem . 20-21 I will be like a metalworker who collects that metal from the furnace and melts it down . I will collect the Israelites and blow on them with my fiery anger . They will melt inside the city of Jerusalem
CEV	Ezekiel	22	23	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	22	24	Ezekiel , son of man , tell the people of Israel that their country is full of sin , and that I , the Lord , am furious !
CEV	Ezekiel	22	25	Their leaders are like [ b ] roaring lions , tearing apart their victims . They put people to death , then steal everything of value . Husbands are killed , and many women are left as widows .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	26	( E ) The priests of Israel ignore my Law ! Not only do they refuse to respect any of my sacred things , but they do n't even teach the difference between what is sacred and what is ordinary or between what is clean and what is unclean . They treat my Sabbath like any other day , and so my own people no longer honor me .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	27	Israel 's officials are like ferocious wolves , ripping their victims apart . They make a dishonest living by injuring and killing people .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	28	And then the prophets in Israel cover up these sins by giving false visions . I have never spoken to them , but they lie and say they have a message from me .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	29	The people themselves cheat and rob ; they abuse the poor and take advantage of foreigners .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	30	I looked for someone to defend the city and to protect it from my anger , as well as to stop me from destroying it . But I found no one .
CEV	Ezekiel	22	31	So in my fierce anger , I will punish the Israelites for what they have done , and they will know that I am furious . I , the Lord , have spoken . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	23	23	I will gather all the handsome young officials and the high-ranking cavalry officers from Babylonia and Assyria , as well as from the Chaldean tribes of Pekod , Shoa , and Koa .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	2	Ezekiel , son of man , listen to this story about two sisters .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	3	While they were young and living in Egypt , they became prostitutes .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	4	) . - 23.43 prostitutes : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text of verse
CEV	Ezekiel	23	5	Even though Oholah was my wife , she continued to be a prostitute and chased after Assyrian lovers .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	6	She offered herself to soldiers in purple uniforms : handsome , high-ranking officers and cavalry troops .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	7	She had sex with all the important Assyrian officials and even worshiped their disgusting idols .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	8	Once she started doing these things in Egypt , she never stopped . Men slept with her , and she was always ready for sex .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	9	So I gave Oholah to the Assyrian lovers she wanted so badly .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	10	They ripped off her clothes , then captured her children and killed her . Women everywhere talked about what had happened to Oholah .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	11	Oholibah saw all this , but she was more sinful and wanted sex more than her sister Oholah ever did .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	12	Oholibah also chased after good-looking Assyrian officers , uniformed soldiers , and cavalry troops .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	13	Just like her sister , she did vulgar things .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	14	But Oholibah behaved worse than her sister . Oholibah saw images of Babylonian men carved into walls and painted red .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	15	They had belts around their waists and large turbans on their heads , and they reminded her of Babylonian cavalry officers .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	16	As soon as she looked at them , she wanted to have sex with them . And so , she sent messengers to bring them to her .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	17	Men from Babylonia came and had sex with her so many times that she got disgusted with them .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	18	She let everyone see her naked body and did n't care if they knew she was a prostitute . That 's why I turned my back on her , just as I had done with her older sister .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	19	Oholibah did n't stop there , but became even more immoral and acted as she had back in Egypt .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	20	She eagerly wanted to go to bed with Egyptian men , who were famous for their sexual powers .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	21	And she longed for the days when she was a young prostitute , when men enjoyed caressing her body . The Lord Will Punish Oholibah
CEV	Ezekiel	23	22	The Lord God said : Oholibah , [ b ] though you no longer want to be around your lovers , they will surround you like enemies , when I turn them against you .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	24	Their large armies will come from the north [ c ] with chariots and wagons carrying weapons . They will wear shields and helmets and will surround you , and I will let them judge and sentence you according to their own laws .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	25	I am angry with you , so I will let them be very cruel . They will cut off your nose and ears ; they will kill your children and burn alive anyone in your family who survives .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	26	Your clothes and jewelry will be torn off .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	27	I will stop your wickedness and the prostitution you started back in Egypt . You will never want to think about those days again .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	28	I , the Lord God , am ready to hand you over to those hateful enemies that you find so disgusting .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	29	They will cruelly take away everything you have worked for and strip you naked . Then everyone will see you for the prostitute you really are . Your own vulgar sins
CEV	Ezekiel	23	30	have led to this . You were the one determined to have sex with men from other nations and to worship their idols .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	31	You have turned out no better than your older sister , and now you must drink from the cup filled with my anger .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	32	I , the Lord God , gave your sister a large , deep cup filled with my anger . And when you drink from that cup , you will be mocked and insulted .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	33	You will end up drunk and devastated , because that cup is filled with horror and ruin .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	34	But you must drink every drop ! Then smash the cup and chew on its broken pieces . Use them to cut your breasts in sorrow . I , the Lord God , have spoken .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	35	You have completely rejected me , and so I promise that you will be punished for the disgusting things you did as a prostitute . The Two Sisters Are Condemned
CEV	Ezekiel	23	36	The Lord said : Ezekiel , son of man , it 's time for you to tell Oholah and Oholibah [ d ] that they are guilty . Remind them of their evil ways !
CEV	Ezekiel	23	37	They have been unfaithful by worshiping idols , and they have committed murder by sacrificing my own children as offerings to idols . 38-39 They came into my temple that same day , and that made it unfit as a place to worship me . They have even stopped respecting the Sabbath .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	40	They sent messengers to attract men from far away . When those men arrived , the two sisters bathed themselves and put on eye shadow and jewelry .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	41	They sat on a fancy couch , and in front of them was a table for the olive oil and incense that had belonged to me .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	42	Their room was always filled with a noisy crowd of drunkards brought in from the desert . These men gave the women bracelets and beautiful crowns ,
CEV	Ezekiel	23	43	. Copyright ©
CEV	Ezekiel	23	44	In fact , the men had sex over and over with Oholah and Oholibah , the two sinful sisters .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	45	But honest judges will someday accuse those two of murder and of being unfaithful , because they are certainly guilty .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	46	So I , the Lord God , now say to these sisters : I will call together an angry mob that will abuse and rob you .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	47	They will stone you to death and cut you to pieces ; they will kill your children and burn down your houses .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	48	I will get rid of sinful prostitution in this country , so that women everywhere will be warned not to act as you have .
CEV	Ezekiel	23	49	You will be punished for becoming prostitutes and for worshiping idols . Then you will know that I am the Lord God .

CEV	Ezekiel	24	24	I am a warning sign—everything I have done , you will also do . And then you will know the Lord God has made these things happen .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	2	( A ) Ezekiel , son of man , write down today 's date , because the king of Babylonia has just begun attacking the city of Jerusalem .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	3	Then tell my rebellious people : “ Pour water in a cooking pot and set it over a fire . *
CEV	Ezekiel	24	4	Throw [ b ] in the legs and shoulders of your finest sheep and put in the juicy bones .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	5	Pile wood [ c ] underneath the pot , and let the meat and bones boil until they are done. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	24	6	These words mean that Jerusalem is doomed ! The city is filled with murderers and is like an old , rusty pot . The meat is taken out piece by piece , and no one cares what happens to it . [ d ]
CEV	Ezekiel	24	7	The people of Jerusalem murdered innocent people in the city and did n't even try to cover up the blood that flowed out on the hard ground .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	8	But I have seen that blood , and it cries out for me to take revenge .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	9	I , the Lord God , will punish that city of violence ! I will make a huge pile of firewood ,
CEV	Ezekiel	24	10	so bring more wood and light it . Cook the meat and boil away the broth [ e ] to let the bones scorch .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	11	Then set the empty pot over the hot coals until it is red-hot . That will clean the pot and burn off the rust .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	12	. - 24.17 Do n't remove your turban … take off your sandals … cover your face … eat the food that mourners eat : The usual way people mourned was to remove anything worn on the head , to go barefoot , to cover their faces , and to eat special food to show they were grieving . - 24.22,23 You will leave your face uncovered … refuse to eat the food … wo n't take off your turbans and your sandals : See the note at 24.17 . - 24.27 you will be able to speak again : See 3.25-27 ; 33.21,22 .

CEV	Ezekiel	24	13	Jerusalem is so full of sin and evil that I ca n't get it clean , even though I have tried . It will stay filthy until I let loose my fierce anger against it .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	14	That time will certainly come ! And when it does , I wo n't show the people of Jerusalem any pity or change my mind . They must be punished for the evil they have done . I , the Lord God , have spoken . Ezekiel 's Wife Dies
CEV	Ezekiel	24	15	The Lord said ,
CEV	Ezekiel	24	16	“ Ezekiel , son of man , I will suddenly take the life of the person you love most . But I do n't want you to complain or cry .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	17	Mourn in silence and do n't show that you are grieving . Do n't remove your turban or take off your sandals ; do n't cover your face to show your sorrow , or eat the food that mourners eat. ” [ g ]
CEV	Ezekiel	24	18	One morning , I was talking with the people as usual , and by sunset my wife was dead . The next day I did what the Lord had told me ,
CEV	Ezekiel	24	19	and when people saw me , they asked , “ Why are n't you mourning for your wife ? ”
CEV	Ezekiel	24	20	I answered : The Lord God says
CEV	Ezekiel	24	21	he is ready to destroy the temple in which you take such pride and which makes you feel so safe . Your children who now live in Jerusalem will be killed .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	22	Then you will do the same things I have done . You will leave your face uncovered and refuse to eat the food that mourners usually eat .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	23	You wo n't take off your turbans and your sandals . [ h ] You wo n't cry or mourn , but all day long you will go around groaning because of your sins .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	25	The Lord said , “ Ezekiel , I will soon destroy the temple that makes everyone feel proud and safe , and I will take away their children as well .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	26	On that same day , someone will escape from the city and come to tell you what has happened .
CEV	Ezekiel	24	27	Then you will be able to speak again , [ i ] and the two of you will talk . You will be a warning sign to the people , and they will know that I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - 24.1 Nine years … tenth month : Probably January of

CEV	Ezekiel	25	3	and tell them : You celebrated when my temple was destroyed , when Israel was defeated , and when my people were taken away as prisoners .
CEV	Ezekiel	25	4	Now I am going to let you be conquered by tribes from the eastern desert . They will set up their camps in your land and eat your fruit and drink your milk .
CEV	Ezekiel	25	5	Your capital city of Rabbah will be nothing but pastureland for camels , and the rest of the country will be pastures for sheep . Then you will know that I am the Lord God .
CEV	Ezekiel	25	6	You hated Israel so much that you clapped and shouted and celebrated .
CEV	Ezekiel	25	7	And so I will hand you over to enemies who will rob you . I will completely destroy you . There wo n't be enough of your people left to be a nation ever again , and you will know that I , the Lord , have done these things . Judgment on Moab
CEV	Ezekiel	25	8	( B ) The Lord God said , “ The people of Moab [ a ] thought Judah was no different from any other nation .
CEV	Ezekiel	25	9	So I will let Moab 's fortress towns along its border be attacked , including Beth-Jeshimoth , Baal-Meon , and Kiriathaim .

CEV	Ezekiel	25	12	( C ) The Lord God then said , “ The people of Edom are guilty of taking revenge on Judah .

CEV	Ezekiel	26	26	( A ) Eleven years [ a ] after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia , the Lord spoke to me on the first day of the month . He said :
CEV	Ezekiel	26	2	Ezekiel , son of man , the people of the city of Tyre [ b ] have celebrated Jerusalem 's defeat by singing , “ Jerusalem has fallen ! It used to be powerful , a center of trade . Now the city is shattered , and we will take its place. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	26	3	Because the people of Tyre have sung that song , I have the following warning for them : I am the Lord God , and I am now your enemy ! I will send nations to attack you , like waves crashing against the shore .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	4	They will tear down your city walls and defense towers . I will sweep away the ruins until all that 's left of you is a bare rock ,
CEV	Ezekiel	26	5	where fishermen can dry their nets along the coast . I promise that you will be robbed
CEV	Ezekiel	26	6	and that the people who live in your towns along the coast will be killed . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	7	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia is the world 's most powerful king , and I will send him to attack you . He will march from the north with a powerful army , including horses and chariots and cavalry troops .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	8	First , he will attack your towns along the coast and kill the people who live there . Then he will build dirt ramps up to the top of your city walls and set up rows of shields around you .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	9	He will command some of his troops to use large wooden poles to beat down your walls , while others use iron rods to knock down your watchtowers .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	10	He will have so many horses that the dust they stir up will seem like a thick fog . And as his chariots and cavalry approach , even the walls will shake , especially when he proudly enters your ruined city .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	11	His troops will ride through your streets , killing people left and right , and your strong columns will crumble to the ground .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	12	The troops will steal your valuable possessions ; they will break down your walls , and crush your expensive houses . Then the stones and wood and all the remains will be dumped into the sea .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	13	( B ) You will have no reason to sing or play music on harps ,
CEV	Ezekiel	26	14	because I will turn you into a bare rock where fishermen can dry their nets . And you will never rebuild your city . I , the Lord God , make this promise .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	15	The people of the nations up and down the coast will shudder when they hear your screams and moans of death .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	16	( C ) The kings will step down from their thrones , then take off their royal robes and fancy clothes , and sit on the ground , trembling . They will be so shocked at the news of your defeat that they will shake in fear
CEV	Ezekiel	26	17	and sing this funeral song : “ The great city beside the sea is destroyed ! [ c ] Its people once ruled the coast and terrified everyone there .
CEV	Ezekiel	26	18	But now Tyre is in ruins , and the people on the coast stare at it in horror and tremble in fear. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	26	19	I , the Lord God , will turn you into a ghost-town . The ocean depths will rise over you
CEV	Ezekiel	26	20	and carry you down to the world of the dead , where you will join people of ancient times and towns ruined long ago . You will stay there and never again be a city filled with people . [ d ]

CEV	Ezekiel	27	29	Every ship is deserted ; rowers and sailors and captains all stand on shore ,
CEV	Ezekiel	27	30	mourning for you . They show their sorrow by putting dust on their heads and rolling in ashes ;
CEV	Ezekiel	27	31	they shave their heads and dress in sackcloth [ k ] as they cry in despair .
CEV	Ezekiel	27	32	In their grief they sing a funeral song for you : “ Tyre , you were greater than all other cities . But now you lie in silence at the bottom of the sea . [ l ]
CEV	Ezekiel	27	33	“ Nations that received your merchandise were always pleased ; kings everywhere got rich from your costly goods .
CEV	Ezekiel	27	34	But now you are wrecked in the deep sea , with your cargo and crew scattered everywhere .
CEV	Ezekiel	27	35	People living along the coast are shocked at the news . Their rulers are horrified , and terror is written across their faces .

CEV	Ezekiel	28	28	The Lord God said :
CEV	Ezekiel	28	2	Ezekiel , son of man , tell the king of Tyre [ a ] that I am saying : You are so arrogant that you think you 're a god and that the city of Tyre is your throne . You may claim to be a god , though you 're nothing but a mere human .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	3	You think you 're wiser than Daniel [ b ] and know everything . [ c ]
CEV	Ezekiel	28	4	Your wisdom has certainly made you rich , because you have storehouses filled with gold and silver .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	5	You 're a clever businessman and are extremely wealthy , but your wealth has led to arrogance !
CEV	Ezekiel	28	6	You compared yourself to a god , so now I , the Lord God ,
CEV	Ezekiel	28	7	will make you the victim of cruel enemies . They will destroy all the possessions you 've worked so hard to get .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	8	Your enemies will brutally kill you , and the sea will be your only grave .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	9	When you face your enemies , will you still claim to be a god ? They will attack , and you will suffer like any other human .

CEV	Ezekiel	28	11	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	28	12	Ezekiel , son of man , sing a funeral song for the king of Tyre [ d ] and tell him I am saying : At one time , you were perfect , [ e ] intelligent , and good-looking .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	13	You lived in the garden of Eden and wore jewelry made of brightly colored gems and precious stones . They were all set in gold [ f ] and were ready for you on the day you were born .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	14	I appointed a winged creature to guard your home [ g ] on my holy mountain , where you walked among gems that dazzled like fire .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	15	You were truly good from the time of your birth , but later you started doing wicked things .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	16	You traded with other nations and became more and more cruel and evil . So I forced you to leave my mountain , and the creature that had been your protector now chased you away from the jewels .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	17	It was your good looks that made you arrogant , and you were so famous that you started acting like a fool . That 's why I threw you to the ground and let other kings sneer at you .
CEV	Ezekiel	28	18	You have cheated so many other merchants that your places of worship are corrupt . So I set your city on fire and burned it down . Now everyone sees only ashes where your city once stood ,
CEV	Ezekiel	28	19	and the people of other nations are shocked . Your punishment was horrible , and you are gone forever . Judgment on Sidon and Peace for Israel
CEV	Ezekiel	28	20	( A ) The Lord said :

CEV	Ezekiel	28	25	The Lord God said : Someday I will gather the people of Israel from the nations where they are now scattered , and every nation will see that I am holy . The Israelites will once again live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob .

CEV	Ezekiel	29	29	( A ) Ten years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia , the Lord spoke to me on the twelfth day of the tenth month . [ a ] He said :
CEV	Ezekiel	29	2	Ezekiel , son of man , condemn the king of Egypt . Tell him and his people
CEV	Ezekiel	29	3	that I am saying : King of Egypt , you were like a giant crocodile lying in a river . You acted as though you owned the Nile and made it for yourself . But now I , the Lord God , am your enemy !
CEV	Ezekiel	29	4	I will put a hook in your jaw and pull you out of the water , and all the fish in your river will stick to your scaly body . [ b ]
CEV	Ezekiel	29	5	I 'll throw you and the fish into the desert , and your body will fall on the hard ground . You will be left unburied , [ c ] and wild animals and birds will eat your flesh .
CEV	Ezekiel	29	6	( B ) Then everyone in Egypt will know that I am the Lord . You and your nation refused to help the people of Israel and were nothing more than a broken stick .
CEV	Ezekiel	29	7	When they reached out to you for support , you broke in half , cutting their arms and making them fall . [ d ]
CEV	Ezekiel	29	8	So I , the Lord God , will send troops to attack you , king of Egypt . They will kill your people and livestock ,
CEV	Ezekiel	29	9	until your land is a barren desert . Then you will know that I have done these things . You claimed that you made the Nile River and control it .
CEV	Ezekiel	29	10	Now I am turning against you and your river . Your nation will be nothing but an empty wasteland all the way from the town of Migdol in the north to Aswan in the south , and as far as the border of Ethiopia . [ e ]
CEV	Ezekiel	29	11	No human or animal will even dare travel through Egypt , because no sign of life will be found there for
CEV	Ezekiel	29	40	years have passed , I will bring your people back from the places where I scattered them .
CEV	Ezekiel	29	12	It will be the most barren place on earth . Every city in Egypt will lie in ruins during those
CEV	Ezekiel	29	13	Then after those
CEV	Ezekiel	29	14	They will once again live in their homeland in southern Egypt . But they will be a weak kingdom
CEV	Ezekiel	29	15	and wo n't ever be strong enough to rule nations , as they did in the past .
CEV	Ezekiel	29	16	My own people Israel will never again depend on your nation .

Then the Israelites will know that I , the Lord God , did these things . King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia Will Conquer Egypt
CEV	Ezekiel	29	17	Twenty-seven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia , the Lord spoke to me on the first day of the first month . [ f ] He said :
CEV	Ezekiel	29	18	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia has attacked the city of Tyre . He forced his soldiers to carry so many heavy loads that their heads were rubbed bald , and their shoulders were red and sore . Nebuchadnezzar and his army still could not capture the city .
CEV	Ezekiel	29	19	So now I will hand over the nation of Egypt to him . He will take Egypt 's valuable treasures and give them to his own troops .
CEV	Ezekiel	29	20	Egypt will be his reward , because he and his army have been following my orders . I , the Lord God , have spoken .

CEV	Ezekiel	30	9	On the same day I destroy Egypt , I will send messengers to the Ethiopians to announce their coming destruction . They think they are safe , but they will be terrified .
CEV	Ezekiel	30	10	Your Egyptian army is very strong , but I will send King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia to completely defeat that army .
CEV	Ezekiel	30	11	He and his cruel troops will invade and destroy your land and leave your dead bodies piled everywhere .
CEV	Ezekiel	30	12	I will dry up the Nile River , then sell the land to evil buyers . I will send foreigners to turn your entire nation into a barren desert . I , the Lord , have spoken . Egypt 's Proud Cities Will Lie in Ruins The Lord said to the people of Egypt :
CEV	Ezekiel	30	13	All the idols and images you Egyptians worship in the city of Memphis [ c ] will be smashed . No one will be left to rule your nation , and terror will fill the land .
CEV	Ezekiel	30	14	The city of Pathros will be left in ruins , and Zoan will be burned to the ground . Thebes , [ d ] your capital city , will also be destroyed !
CEV	Ezekiel	30	15	The fortress city of Pelusium will feel my fierce anger , and all the troops stationed at Thebes will be slaughtered .
CEV	Ezekiel	30	16	I will set fire to your nation of Egypt ! The city of Pelusium will be in anguish . Thebes will fall , and the people of Memphis will live in constant fear . [ e ]
CEV	Ezekiel	30	17	The young soldiers in the cities of Heliopolis and Bubastis [ f ] will die in battle , and the rest of the people will be taken prisoner .
CEV	Ezekiel	30	18	You were so proud of your nation 's power , but when I crush that power and kill that pride , darkness will fall over the city of Tahpanhes . A dark , gloomy cloud will cover the land as you are being led away into captivity .
CEV	Ezekiel	30	19	When I 'm through punishing Egypt , you will know that I am the Lord . Egypt 's King Is Powerless
CEV	Ezekiel	30	20	Eleven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia , the Lord spoke to me on the seventh day of the first month . [ g ] He said :
CEV	Ezekiel	30	21	Ezekiel , son of man , I , the Lord , have defeated the king of Egypt ! I broke his arm , and no one has wrapped it or put it in a sling , so that it could heal and get strong enough to hold a sword .
CEV	Ezekiel	30	22	So tell him that I am now his worst enemy . I will break both his arms—the good one and the broken one ! His sword will drop from his hand forever ,
CEV	Ezekiel	30	23	and I will scatter the Egyptians all over the world . 24-25 I will strengthen the power of Babylonia 's king and give him my sword to use against Egypt . I will also make the wounded king of Egypt powerless , and he will moan in pain and die in front of the Babylonian king . Then everyone on earth will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	30	26	I will force the Egyptians to live as prisoners in foreign nations , and they will know that I , the Lord , have punished them .

CEV	Ezekiel	31	31	Eleven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia , the Lord spoke to me on the first day of the third month . [ a ] He said :
CEV	Ezekiel	31	2	Ezekiel , son of man , tell the king of Egypt and his people that I am saying : You are more powerful than anyone on earth . Now listen to this .

CEV	Ezekiel	31	4	This tree had plenty of water to help it grow tall , and nearby streams watered the other trees in the forest .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	5	But this tree towered over those other trees , and its branches grew long and thick .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	6	Birds built nests in its branches , and animals were born beneath it . People from all nations lived in the shade of this strong tree .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	7	It had beautiful , long branches , and its roots found water deep in the soil .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	8	( A ) None of the cedar trees in my garden of Eden were as beautiful as this tree ; no tree of any kind had such long branches .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	9	I , the Lord , gave this tree its beauty , and I helped the branches grow strong . All other trees in Eden wanted to be just like it .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	10	King of Egypt , now listen to what I , the Lord God , am saying about that tree : The tree grew so tall that it reached the sky [ c ] and became very proud and arrogant .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	11	So I , the Lord God , will reject the tree and hand it over to a foreign ruler , who will punish it for its wickedness .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	12	Cruel foreigners will chop it down and leave it wherever it falls . Branches and broken limbs will be scattered over the mountains and in the valleys . The people living in the shade of those branches will go somewhere else .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	13	Birds will then nest on the stump of the fallen tree , and wild animals will trample its branches .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	14	Never again will any tree dare to grow as tall as this tree , no matter how much water it has . Every tree must die , just as humans die and go down to the world of the dead .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	15	On the day this tree dies and goes to the world below , I , the Lord God , will command rivers and streams to mourn its death . Every underground spring of water and every river will stop flowing . [ d ] The mountains in Lebanon will be covered with darkness as a sign of their sorrow , and all the trees in the forest will wither .
CEV	Ezekiel	31	16	This tree will crash to the ground , and I will send it to the world below . Then the nations of the earth will tremble . The trees from Eden and the choice trees from Lebanon are now in the world of the dead , and they will be comforted when this tree falls .

CEV	Ezekiel	31	18	King of Egypt , all these things will happen to you and your people ! You were like this tree at one time—taller and stronger than anyone on earth . But now you will be chopped down , just as every tree in the garden of Eden must die . You will be sent down to the world of the dead , where you will join the godless and the other victims of violent death . I , the Lord God , have spoken .

CEV	Ezekiel	32	2	Ezekiel , son of man , condemn the king of Egypt and tell him I am saying : You act like a lion roaming the earth ; but you are nothing more than a crocodile in a river , churning up muddy water with your feet .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	3	King of Egypt , listen to me . I , the Lord God , will catch you in my net and let a crowd of foreigners drag you to shore .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	4	I will throw you into an open field , where birds and animals will come to feed on your flesh .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	5	I will spread your rotting flesh [ b ] over the mountains and in the valleys ,
CEV	Ezekiel	32	6	and your blood will flow throughout the land and fill up the streams .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	7	( A ) I will cover the whole sky and every star with thick clouds , so that the sun and moon will stop shining .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	8	The heavens will become black , leaving your country in total darkness . I , the Lord God , have spoken .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	9	Foreign nations you have never heard of will be shocked when I tell them how I destroyed you . [ c ]
CEV	Ezekiel	32	10	They will be horrified , and when I flash my sword in victory on the day of your death , their kings will tremble in the fear of what could happen to them .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	11	The king of Babylonia is coming to attack you , king of Egypt !
CEV	Ezekiel	32	12	Your soldiers will be killed by the cruelest army in the world , and everything you take pride in will be crushed .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	13	I will slaughter your cattle that graze by the river , [ d ] and no people or livestock will be left to muddy its water .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	14	The water will be clear , and streams will be calm . I , the Lord God , have spoken .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	15	Egypt will become a barren wasteland , and no living thing will ever survive there . Then you and your people will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	16	This is your warning , and it will be used as a funeral song by foreign women to mourn the death of your people . I , the Lord God , have spoken . A Sad Ending for Egypt
CEV	Ezekiel	32	17	On the fifteenth day of that same month , [ e ] the Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	32	18	Ezekiel , son of man , mourn for the Egyptians and condemn them to the world of the dead , where they will be buried alongside the people of other powerful nations . [ f ]
CEV	Ezekiel	32	19	Say to them : You may be more beautiful than the people of other nations , but you will also die and join the godless in the world below .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	20	You can not escape ! The enemy 's sword is ready to slaughter every one of you . [ g ]
CEV	Ezekiel	32	21	Brave military leaders killed in battle will gladly welcome you and your allies into the world of the dead . 22-23 The graves of soldiers from Assyria are there . They once terrified people , but they were killed in battle and now lie deep in the world of the dead . [ h ] 24-25 The graves of soldiers from Elam are there . The very sight of those godless soldiers once terrified their enemies and made them panic . But now they are disgraced and ashamed as they lie in the world of the dead , alongside others who were killed in battle .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	26	The graves of soldiers from Meshech and Tubal are there . These godless soldiers who terrified people were all killed in battle .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	27	They were not given a proper burial like the heroes of long ago , [ i ] who were buried with their swords under their heads and with their shields [ j ] over their bodies . These were the heroes who made their enemies panic .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	28	You Egyptians will be cruelly defeated , and you will be buried alongside these other godless soldiers who died in battle .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	29	The graves of kings and leaders from Edom are there . They were powerful at one time . Now they are buried in the world of the dead with other godless soldiers killed in battle .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	30	The graves of the rulers of the north [ k ] are there , as well as those of the Sidonians . Their powerful armies once terrified enemies . Now they lie buried in the world of the dead , where they are disgraced like other soldiers killed in battle .
CEV	Ezekiel	32	31	The Lord God says : When your king of Egypt sees all of these graves , he and his soldiers will be glad they are not the only ones suffering .

CEV	Ezekiel	33	33	Soon they will be punished , just as you warned , and they will know that a prophet has been among them . Copyright ©
CEV	Ezekiel	33	2	Ezekiel , son of man , warn your people by saying : Someday , I , the Lord , may send an enemy to invade a country . And suppose its people choose someone to stand watch
CEV	Ezekiel	33	3	and to sound a warning signal when the enemy is seen coming . 4-5 If any of these people hear the signal and ignore it , they will be killed in battle . But it will be their own fault , because they could have escaped if they had paid attention .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	6	But suppose the person watching fails to sound the warning signal . The enemy will attack and kill some of the sinful people in that country , and I , the Lord , will hold that person responsible for their death .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	7	Ezekiel , I have appointed you to stand watch for the people of Israel . So listen to what I say , then warn them for me .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	8	When I tell wicked people they will die because of their sins , you must warn them to turn from their sinful ways . But if you refuse to warn them , you are responsible for their death .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	9	If you do warn them , and they keep sinning , they will die because of their sins , and you will be innocent . The Lord Is Always Fair ( Ezekiel 18.21-30 )
CEV	Ezekiel	33	10	The Lord said : Ezekiel , son of man , the people of Israel are complaining that the punishment for their sins is more than they can stand . They have lost all hope for survival , and they blame me .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	11	Tell them that as surely as I am the living Lord God , I do n't like to see wicked people die . I enjoy seeing them turn from their sins and live . So if the Israelites want to live , they must stop sinning and turn back to me .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	12	Tell them that when good people start sinning , all the good they did in the past can not save them from being punished . And remind them that when wicked people stop sinning , their past sins will be completely forgiven , and they wo n't be punished .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	13	Suppose I promise good people that they will live , then later they start sinning and believe they will be saved by the good they did in the past . These people will certainly be put to death because of their sins . Their good deeds will be forgotten .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	14	Suppose I warn wicked people that they will die because of their sins , and they stop sinning and start doing right .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	15	For example , they need to return anything they have taken as security for a loan and anything they have stolen . Then if they stop doing evil and start obeying my Law , they will live .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	16	Their past sins will be forgiven , and they will live because they have done right .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	17	Ezekiel , your people accuse me of being unfair . But they are the ones who are unfair .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	18	If good people start doing evil , they will be put to death , because they have sinned .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	19	And if wicked people stop sinning and start doing right , they will save themselves from punishment .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	20	But the Israelites still think I am unfair . So warn them that they will be punished for what they have done . The News of Jerusalem 's Fall
CEV	Ezekiel	33	21	( A ) Twelve years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia , a refugee who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me on the fifth day of the tenth month . [ a ] He told me that the city had fallen .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	22	The evening before this man arrived at my house , the Lord had taken control of me . So when the man came to me the next morning , I could once again speak . [ b ] What Will Happen to Those Left in Israel ?
CEV	Ezekiel	33	23	Then the Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	33	24	Ezekiel , son of man , the people living in the ruined cities of Israel are saying , “ Abraham was just one man , and the Lord gave him this whole land of Israel . There are many of us , and so this land must be ours. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	33	25	So , Ezekiel , tell them I am saying : How can you think the land is still yours ? You eat meat with blood in it and worship idols . You commit murder
CEV	Ezekiel	33	26	and spread violence throughout the land . Everything you do is wicked ; you are even unfaithful in marriage . And you claim the land is yours !
CEV	Ezekiel	33	27	As surely as I am the living Lord God , you people in the ruined cities will be killed in battle . Those of you living in the countryside will be eaten by wild animals , and those hiding in caves and on rocky cliffs will die from deadly diseases .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	28	I will make the whole country an empty wasteland and crush the power in which you take such pride . Even the mountains will be bare , and no one will try to cross them .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	29	I will punish you because of your sins , and I will turn your nation into a barren desert . Then you will know that I am the Lord . The People Listen , but Do n't Change The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	33	30	Ezekiel , son of man , the people with you in Babylonia talk about you when they meet by the city walls or in the doorways of their houses . They say , “ Let 's ask Ezekiel what the Lord has said today. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	33	31	So they all come and listen to you , but they refuse to do what you tell them . They claim to be faithful , but they are forever trying to cheat others out of their money .
CEV	Ezekiel	33	32	They treat you as though you were merely singing love songs or playing music . They listen , but do n't do anything you say .

CEV	Ezekiel	34	34	( A ) The Lord God said :
CEV	Ezekiel	34	2	Ezekiel , son of man , Israel 's leaders are like shepherds taking care of my sheep , the people of Israel . But I want you to condemn these leaders and tell them : I , the Lord God , say you shepherds of Israel are doomed ! You take care of yourselves while ignoring my sheep .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	3	You drink their milk and use their wool to make your clothes . Then you butcher the best ones for food . But you do n't take care of the flock !
CEV	Ezekiel	34	4	You have never protected the weak ones or healed the sick ones or bandaged those that get hurt . You let them wander off and never look for those that get lost . You are cruel and mean to my sheep .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	5	( B ) They strayed in every direction , and because there was no shepherd to watch them , they were attacked and eaten by wild animals .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	6	So my sheep were scattered across the earth . They roamed on hills and mountains , without anyone even bothering to look for them . 7-8 Now listen to what I , the living Lord God , am saying to you shepherds . My sheep have been attacked and eaten by wild animals , because you refused to watch them . You never went looking for the lost ones , and you fed yourselves without feeding my sheep . 9-10 So I , the Lord , will punish you ! I will rescue my sheep from you and never let you be their shepherd again or butcher them for food . I , the Lord , have spoken . The Lord Is the Good Shepherd
CEV	Ezekiel	34	11	The Lord God then said : I will look for my sheep and take care of them myself ,
CEV	Ezekiel	34	12	just as a shepherd looks for lost sheep . My sheep have been lost since that dark and miserable day when they were scattered throughout the nations . [ a ] But I will rescue them
CEV	Ezekiel	34	13	and bring them back from the foreign nations where they now live . I will be their shepherd and will let them graze on Israel 's mountains and in the valleys and fertile fields .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	14	They will be safe as they feed on grassy meadows and green hills .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	15	I promise to take care of them and keep them safe ,
CEV	Ezekiel	34	16	to look for those that are lost and bring back the ones that wander off , to bandage those that are hurt and protect the ones that are weak . I will also slaughter [ b ] those that are fat and strong , because I always do right . Judgment on the Strong Sheep
CEV	Ezekiel	34	17	The Lord God said to his sheep , the people of Israel : I will carefully watch each one of you to decide which ones are the strong sheep and which ones are weak .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	18	Some of you eat the greenest grass , then trample down what 's left when you finish . Others drink clean water , then step in the water to make the rest of it muddy .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	19	That means my other sheep have nothing fit to eat or drink .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	20	So I , the Lord God , will separate you strong sheep from the weak .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	21	You strong ones have used your powerful horns to chase off those that are weak ,
CEV	Ezekiel	34	22	but I will rescue them and no longer let them be mistreated . I will separate the good from the bad .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	23	( C ) After that , I will give you a shepherd from the family of my servant King David . All of you , both strong and weak , will have the same shepherd , and he will take good care of you .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	24	( D ) He will be your leader , and I will be your God . I , the Lord , have spoken . A Bright Future for the Lord 's Sheep The Lord God said :
CEV	Ezekiel	34	25	The people of Israel are my sheep , and I solemnly promise that they will live in peace . I will chase away every wild animal from the desert and the forest , so my sheep will not be afraid .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	26	They will live around my holy mountain , [ c ] and I will bless them by sending more than enough rain
CEV	Ezekiel	34	27	to make their trees produce fruit and their crops to grow . I will set them free from slavery and let them live safely in their own land . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	28	Foreign nations will never again rob them , and wild animals will no longer kill and eat them . They will have nothing to fear .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	29	I will make their fields produce large amounts of crops , so they will never again go hungry or be laughed at by foreigners .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	30	Then everyone will know that I protect my people Israel . I , the Lord , make this promise .
CEV	Ezekiel	34	31	They are my sheep ; I am their God , and I take care of them . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	35	35	( A ) The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	35	2	Ezekiel , son of man , condemn the people of Edom [ a ]
CEV	Ezekiel	35	3	and say to them : I , the Lord God , am now your enemy ! And I will turn your nation into an empty wasteland ,
CEV	Ezekiel	35	4	leaving your towns in ruins . Your land will be a desert , and then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	35	5	People of Edom , not only have you been Israel 's longtime enemy , you simply watched when disaster wiped out its people as punishment for their sins .
CEV	Ezekiel	35	6	And so , as surely as I am the living Lord God , you are guilty of murder and must be put to death .
CEV	Ezekiel	35	7	I will destroy your nation and kill anyone who travels through it .
CEV	Ezekiel	35	8	Dead bodies will cover your mountains and fill up your valleys ,
CEV	Ezekiel	35	9	and your land will lie in ruins forever . No one will live in your towns ever again . You will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	35	10	You thought the nations of Judah and Israel belonged to you , and that you could take over their territory . But I am their God ,
CEV	Ezekiel	35	11	and as surely as I live , I will punish you for treating my people with anger and hatred . Then they will know that I , the Lord , am punishing you !
CEV	Ezekiel	35	12	And you will finally realize that I heard you laugh at their destruction and say their land was yours to take .
CEV	Ezekiel	35	13	You even insulted me , but I heard it all .
CEV	Ezekiel	35	14	Everyone on earth will celebrate when I destroy you ,
CEV	Ezekiel	35	15	just as you celebrated when Israel was destroyed . Your nation of Edom will be nothing but a wasteland . Then everyone will know that I am the Lord . Footnotes - 35.2 Edom : The Hebrew text has “ Mount Seir , ” another name for Edom . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	36	36	Then the nearby nations that survive will know that I am the one who rebuilt the ruined places and replanted the barren fields . I , the Lord , make this promise .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	2	that I , the Lord God , am saying : Your enemies sneered and said that you mountains belonged to them .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	3	They ruined and crushed you from every side , and foreign nations captured and made fun of you .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	4	So all you mountains and hills , streams and valleys , listen to what I will do . Your towns may now lie in ruins , and nations may laugh and insult you .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	5	But in my fierce anger , I will turn against those nations , and especially the Edomites , because they laughed at you the loudest and took over your pasturelands .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	6	You have suffered long enough , and , I , the Lord God , am very angry ! Nations have insulted you ,
CEV	Ezekiel	36	7	so I will now insult and disgrace them . That is my solemn promise .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	8	Trees will grow on you mountains of Israel and produce fruit for my people , because they will soon come home .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	9	I will take care of you by plowing your soil and planting crops on your fertile slopes .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	10	The people of Israel will return and rebuild your ruined towns and live in them .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	11	Children will be born , and animals will give birth to their young . You will no longer be deserted as you are now , but you will be covered with people and treated better than ever . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	12	I will bring my people Israel home , and they will live on you mountains , because you belong to them , and your fertile slopes will never again let them starve .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	13	It 's true that you have been accused of not producing enough food and of letting your people starve . 14-15 But I , the Lord , promise that you wo n't hear other nations laugh and sneer at you ever again . From now on , you will always produce plenty of food for your people . I , the Lord God , have spoken . The Lord Will Be Honored
CEV	Ezekiel	36	16	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	36	17	Ezekiel , son of man , when the people of Israel were living in their own country , they made the land unclean by the way they behaved , just as a woman 's monthly period makes her unclean .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	18	They committed murders and worshiped idols , which made the land even worse . So in my anger , I punished my people
CEV	Ezekiel	36	19	and scattered them throughout the nations , just as they deserved .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	20	Wherever they went , my name was disgraced , because foreigners insulted my people by saying I had forced them out of their own land .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	21	I care what those foreigners think of me ,
CEV	Ezekiel	36	22	so tell the Israelites that I am saying : You have disgraced my holy name among the nations where you now live . So you do n't deserve what I 'm going to do for you . I will lead you home to bring honor to my name
CEV	Ezekiel	36	23	and to show foreign nations that I am holy . Then they will know that I am the Lord God . I have spoken .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	24	I will gather you from the foreign nations and bring you home .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	25	I will sprinkle you with clean water , and you will be clean and acceptable to me . I will wash away everything that makes you unclean , and I will remove your disgusting idols .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	26	( A ) I will take away your stubborn heart and give you a new heart and a desire to be faithful . You will have only pure thoughts ,
CEV	Ezekiel	36	27	because I will put my Spirit in you and make you eager to obey my laws and teachings .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	28	You will once again live in the land I gave your ancestors ; you will be my people , and I will be your God .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	29	I will protect you from anything that makes you unclean . Your fields will overflow with grain , and no one will starve .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	30	Your trees will be filled with fruit , and crops will grow in your fields , so that you will never again feel ashamed for not having enough food .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	31	You will remember your evil ways and hate yourselves for what you 've done .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	32	People of Israel , I 'm not doing these things for your sake . You sinned against me , and you must suffer shame and disgrace for what you have done . I , the Lord God , have spoken .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	33	After I have made you clean , I will let you rebuild your ruined towns and let you live in them .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	34	Your land will be plowed again , and nobody will be able to see that it was once barren .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	35	Instead , they will say that it looks as beautiful as the garden of Eden . They wo n't see towns lying in ruins , but they will see your strong cities filled with people .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	37	I will once again answer your prayers , and I will let your nation grow until you are like a large flock of sheep .
CEV	Ezekiel	36	38	The towns that now lie in ruins will be filled with people , just as Jerusalem was once filled with sheep to be offered as sacrifices during a festival . Then you will know that I am the Lord . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	37	37	Some time later , I felt the Lord 's power take control of me , and his Spirit carried me to a valley full of bones .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	2	The Lord showed me all around , and everywhere I looked I saw bones that were dried out .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	3	He said , “ Ezekiel , son of man , can these bones come back to life ? ” I replied , “ Lord God , only you can answer that. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	37	4	He then told me to say : Dry bones , listen to what the Lord is saying to you ,
CEV	Ezekiel	37	5	“ I , the Lord God , will put breath in you , and once again you will live .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	6	I will wrap you with muscles and skin and breathe life into you . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	37	7	I did what the Lord said , but before I finished speaking , I heard a rattling noise . The bones were coming together !
CEV	Ezekiel	37	8	I saw muscles and skin cover the bones , but they had no life in them .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	9	The Lord said : Ezekiel , now say to the wind , [ a ] “ The Lord God commands you to blow from every direction and to breathe life into these dead bodies , so they can live again. ”
CEV	Ezekiel	37	10	( A ) As soon as I said this , the wind blew among the bodies , and they came back to life ! They all stood up , and there were enough to make a large army .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	11	The Lord said : Ezekiel , the people of Israel are like dead bones . They complain that they are dried up and that they have no hope for the future .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	12	So tell them , “ I , the Lord God , promise to open your graves and set you free . I will bring you back to Israel ,
CEV	Ezekiel	37	13	and when that happens , you will realize that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	14	My Spirit will give you breath , and you will live again . I will bring you home , and you will know that I have kept my promise . I , the Lord , have spoken. ” Judah and Israel Together Again
CEV	Ezekiel	37	15	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	37	16	Ezekiel , son of man , get a stick and write on it , “ The kingdom of Judah. ” Then get another stick and write on it , “ The kingdom of Israel. ” [ b ]
CEV	Ezekiel	37	17	Hold these two sticks end to end , so they look like one stick .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	18	And when your people ask you what this means ,
CEV	Ezekiel	37	19	tell them that I , the Lord , will join together the stick of Israel and the stick of Judah . I will hold them in my hand , and they will become one .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	20	Hold these two sticks where they can be seen by everyone
CEV	Ezekiel	37	21	and then say : I , the Lord God , will gather the people of Israel and bring them home from the foreign nations where they now live .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	22	I will make them into one nation and let them once again live in the land of Israel . Only one king will rule them , and they will never again be divided into two nations .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	23	They will no longer worship idols and do things that make them unacceptable to me . I will wash away their sin and make them clean , and I will protect them from everything that makes them unclean . They will be my people , and I will be their God . 24-25 ( B ) Their king will always come from the family of my servant King David and will care for them like a shepherd . The people of Israel will faithfully obey my laws . They and their descendants will live in the land I gave my servant Jacob , just as their ancestors did .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	26	I solemnly promise to bless the people of Israel with unending peace . I will protect them and let them become a powerful nation . My temple will stand in Israel for all time ,
CEV	Ezekiel	37	27	( C ) and I will live among my people and be their God .
CEV	Ezekiel	37	28	Every nation on earth will know that my temple is in Israel and that I have chosen the Israelites to be my people . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	38	38	The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	38	2	( A ) Ezekiel , son of man , condemn Gog , that wicked ruler of the kingdoms of Meshech and Tubal in the land of Magog . Tell him :
CEV	Ezekiel	38	3	I , the Lord God , am your enemy ,
CEV	Ezekiel	38	4	and I will make you powerless ! I will put a hook in your jaw and drag away both you and your large army . You command cavalry troops that wear heavy armor and carry shields and swords .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	5	Your army includes soldiers from Persia , Ethiopia , [ a ] and Libya ,
CEV	Ezekiel	38	6	as well as from Gomer and Beth-Togarmah in the north . Your army is enormous !
CEV	Ezekiel	38	7	So keep your troops prepared to fight ,
CEV	Ezekiel	38	8	because in a few years , I will command you to invade Israel , a country that was ruined by war . It was deserted for a long time , but its people have returned from the foreign nations where they once lived . The Israelites now live in peace in the mountains of their own land .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	9	But you and your army will attack them like a fierce thunderstorm and surround them like a cloud .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	10	When that day comes , I know that you will have an evil plan
CEV	Ezekiel	38	11	to take advantage of Israel , that weak and peaceful country where people live safely inside towns that have no walls or gates or locks .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	12	You will rob the people in towns that were once a pile of rubble . These people lived as prisoners in foreign nations , but they have returned to Israel , the most important place in the world , and they own livestock and property .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	13	The people of Sheba and Dedan , along with merchants from villages in [ b ] southern Spain , [ c ] will be your allies . They will want some of the silver and gold , as well as the livestock and property that your army takes from Israel .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	14	I , the Lord God , know that when you see [ d ] my people Israel living in peace ,
CEV	Ezekiel	38	15	you will lead your powerful cavalry from your kingdom in the north .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	16	You will attack my people like a storm-cloud that covers their land . I will let you invade my country Israel , so that every nation on earth will know that I , the Lord , am holy . Judgment on Gog
CEV	Ezekiel	38	17	The Lord said to Gog : Long ago , I ordered my prophets to warn the people of Israel that someday I would send an enemy to attack them . You , Gog , are that enemy , and that day is coming .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	18	When you invade Israel , I will become furious ,
CEV	Ezekiel	38	19	and in my anger I will send a terrible earthquake to shake Israel .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	20	Every living thing on earth will tremble in fear of me—every fish and bird , every wild animal and reptile , and every human . Mountains will crumble , cliffs will fall , and cities will collapse .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	21	I , the Lord , will make the mountains of Israel turn against you . [ e ] Your troops will be so terrified that they will attack each other .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	22	I will strike you with diseases and punish you with death . You and your army will be pounded with rainstorms , hailstones , and burning sulfur .
CEV	Ezekiel	38	23	I will do these things to show the world that I , the Lord , am holy .

CEV	Ezekiel	39	39	Ezekiel , son of man , condemn Gog and tell him : You are the ruler of Meshech and Tubal , but I , the Lord , am your enemy !
CEV	Ezekiel	39	2	I will turn you around and drag you from the north until you reach the mountains of Israel .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	3	I will knock the bow out of your left hand and the arrows out of your right hand ,
CEV	Ezekiel	39	4	( A ) and you and your army will die on those mountains . Then birds and wild animals will eat the flesh
CEV	Ezekiel	39	5	of your dead bodies left lying in open fields . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	6	I will set fire to the land of Magog and to those nations along the seacoast that think they are so secure , and they will know that I am the Lord .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	7	My people Israel will know me , and they will no longer disgrace my holy name . Everyone on earth will know that I am the holy Lord God of Israel .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	8	The day is coming when these things will happen , just as I have promised .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	9	When that day comes , the people in the towns of Israel will collect the weapons of their dead enemies . They will use these shields , bows and arrows , spears , and clubs as firewood , and there will be enough to last for seven years .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	10	They will burn these weapons instead of gathering sticks or chopping down trees . That 's how the Israelites will take revenge on those who robbed and abused them . I , the Lord , have spoken . The Burial of Gog The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	39	11	After Gog has been destroyed , I will bury him and his army in Israel , in Travelers ' [ a ] Valley , east of the Dead Sea . That graveyard will be so large that it will block the way of anyone who tries to walk through the valley , [ b ] which will then be known as “ The Valley of Gog 's Army. ” [ c ]
CEV	Ezekiel	39	12	The Israelites will spend seven months burying dead bodies and cleaning up their land .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	13	Everyone will help with the burial , and they will be honored for this on the day the brightness of my glory is seen .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	14	After those seven months , the people will appoint a group of men to look for any dead bodies left unburied . This must be done for seven months to make sure that the land is no longer unclean .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	15	Whenever they find a human bone , they will set up a marker next to it . Then the gravediggers will bury it in “ The Valley of Gog 's Army ”
CEV	Ezekiel	39	16	near the town of “ Gog 's Army. ” After that , the land will be pure again .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	17	( B ) Ezekiel , son of man , I am going to hold a feast on Israel 's mountains and offer sacrifices there . So invite all the birds and wild animals to come from every direction and eat the meat of sacrifices and drink the blood . The birds and animals
CEV	Ezekiel	39	18	will feast on the bodies of warriors and foreign rulers that I will sacrifice like sheep , goats , and bulls .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	19	I want the birds and animals to eat until they are full and drink until they are drunk .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	20	They will come to my table and stuff themselves with the flesh of horses and warriors of every kind . I , the Lord God , have spoken . Israel Will Be Restored The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	39	21	When I punish the nations of the earth , they will see the brightness of my glory .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	22	The people of Israel will know from then on that I am the Lord their God .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	23	Foreign nations will realize that the Israelites were forced to leave their own land because they sinned against me . I turned my back on my people and let enemies attack and kill them .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	24	Their lives were wicked and corrupt , and they deserved to be punished .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	25	Now I will show mercy to the people of Israel and bring them back from the nations where they are living . They are Jacob 's descendants , so I will bless them and show that I am holy .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	26	They will live safely in their own land , but will be ashamed when they remember their evil ways and how they disgraced me . [ d ]
CEV	Ezekiel	39	27	Foreign nations will watch as I take the Israelites from enemy lands and bring them back home , and those nations will see that I am holy .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	28	My people will realize that I , the Lord their God , sent them away as prisoners and now will bring them back to their own land .
CEV	Ezekiel	39	29	Never again will I turn my back on the people of Israel , and my Spirit will live in them . I , the Lord , have spoken . Copyright ©

CEV	Ezekiel	40	40	Four more tables were in the outer courtyard , two on each side of the steps leading into the entrance room .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	14	. - 40.16 just like the ones in the entrance room : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text . - 40.17
CEV	Ezekiel	40	3	( B ) In my vision the Lord took me closer , and I saw a man who was sparkling like polished bronze . He was standing near one of the gates and was holding a tape measure in one hand and a measuring stick in the other .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	4	The man said , “ Ezekiel , son of man , pay close attention to everything I 'm going to show you—that 's why you 've been brought here . Listen carefully , because you must tell the people of Israel what you see. ” The East Gate
CEV	Ezekiel	40	5	( C ) The first thing I saw was an outer wall that completely surrounded the temple area . The man took his measuring stick , which was three meters long , and measured the wall ; it was three meters high and three meters thick . 6-7 Then he went to the east gate , where he walked up steps that led to a long passageway . On each side of this passageway were three guardrooms , which were three meters square , and they were separated by walls two and a half meters thick . The man measured the distance between the opening of the gate and the first guardroom , and it was three meters , the thickness of the outer wall . At the far end of this passageway , I saw an entrance room that faced the courtyard of the temple itself . There was also a distance of three meters between the last guardroom and the entrance room 8-9 at the end of the passageway . The man measured this room : It was four meters from the doorway to the opposite wall , and the distance from the doorway to the wall on either side was one meter .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	10	The three guardrooms on each side of the passageway were the same size , and the walls that separated them were the same thickness .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	11	Next , the man measured the width of the passageway , and it was six and a half meters , but the two doors of the gate were only five meters wide . [ b ]
CEV	Ezekiel	40	12	In front of the guardrooms , which were three meters square , was a railing about
CEV	Ezekiel	40	50	meters square . I also saw an altar in front of the temple .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	13	The man measured the distance from the back wall [ c ] of one of these rooms to the same spot in the room directly across the passageway , and it was twelve and a half meters .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	15	Finally , he measured the total length of the passageway , from the outer wall to the entrance room , and it was
CEV	Ezekiel	40	25	meters long and 12.5 meters wide ,
CEV	Ezekiel	40	16	The three walls in the guardrooms had small windows in them , just like the ones in the entrance room . [ e ] The walls along the passageway were decorated with carvings of palm trees . The Outer Courtyard
CEV	Ezekiel	40	17	The man then led me through the passageway and into the outer courtyard of the temple , where I saw
CEV	Ezekiel	40	30	rooms built around the outside of the courtyard : These were probably used by worshipers as places to meet and share sacrificial meals ( see , for example , Jeremiah 35.2 ) . - 40.19 meters : The Hebrew text adds “ the east and the north. ” - 40.38,39 Just outside : Or “ Inside. ” - 40.38,39 sacrifices to please the Lord : These sacrifices have traditionally been called “ whole burnt offerings ” because the whole animal was burned on the altar . A main purpose of such sacrifices was to please the Lord with the smell of the sacrifice , and so in the CEV they are often called “ sacrifices to please the Lord. ” - 40.38,39 sacrifices for sin : See Leviticus 4.1,2 ; 6.24-30 . - 40.38,39 sacrifices to make things right : See Leviticus 5.14-19 ; 7.1-10 . - 40.42,43 where the meat … altar : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text . - 40.42,43 was a 75-millimeter shelf : Or “ were 75-millimeter pegs. ” - 40.44 south : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text of verse
CEV	Ezekiel	40	18	This was known as the lower sidewalk , and it was
CEV	Ezekiel	40	19	I saw the gates that led to the inner courtyard of the temple and noticed that they were higher than those leading to the outer courtyard . The man measured the distance between the outer and inner gates , and it was
CEV	Ezekiel	40	20	Next , the man measured the north gate that led to the outer courtyard .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	21	This gate also had three guardrooms on each side of a passageway . The measurements of these rooms , the walls between them , and the entrance room at the far end of the passageway were exactly the same as those of the east gate . The north gate was also
CEV	Ezekiel	40	22	and the windows , the entrance room , and the carvings of palm trees were just like those in the east gate . The entrance room also faced the courtyard of the temple and had seven steps leading up to it .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	23	Directly across the outer courtyard was a gate that led to the inner courtyard , just as there was for the east gate . The man measured the distance between the outer and inner gate , and it was
CEV	Ezekiel	40	24	The man then took me to the south gate . He measured the walls and the entrance room of this gate , and the measurements were exactly the same as those of the other two gates .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	26	Seven steps led up to the gate ; the entrance room was at the far end of the passageway and faced the courtyard of the temple . Carvings of palm trees decorated the walls along the passageway .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	27	And directly across the outer courtyard was a gate on the south side of the inner courtyard . The man measured the distance between the outer and inner gate , and it was also
CEV	Ezekiel	40	28	We then went into the inner courtyard , through the gate on the south side of the temple . The man measured the gate , and it was the same size as the gates in the outer wall . 29-30 In fact , everything along the passageway was also the same size , including the guardrooms , the walls separating them , the entrance room at the far end , and the windows . This gate , like the others , was
CEV	Ezekiel	40	31	The entrance room of this gate faced the outer courtyard , and carvings of palm trees decorated the walls of the passageway . Eight steps led up to this gate .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	32	Next , we went through the east gate to the inner courtyard . The man measured this gate , and it was the same size as the others .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	33	The guardrooms , the walls separating them , and its entrance room had the same measurements as the other gates . The guardrooms and the entrance room had windows , and the gate was
CEV	Ezekiel	40	34	The entrance room faced the outer courtyard , and the walls in the passageway were decorated with carvings of palm trees . Eight steps also led up to this gate .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	35	Then the man took me to the north gate . He measured it , and it was the same size as the others ,
CEV	Ezekiel	40	36	including the guardrooms , the walls separating them , and the entrance room . There were also windows in this gate . It was
CEV	Ezekiel	40	37	and like the other inner gates , its entrance room faced the outer courtyard , and its walls were decorated with carvings of palm trees . Eight steps also led up to this gate . The Rooms for Sacrificing Animals 38-39 Inside the entrance room of the north gate , I saw four tables , two on each side of the room , where the animals to be sacrificed were killed . Just outside [ h ] this room was a small building used for washing the animals before they were offered as sacrifices to please the Lord [ i ] or sacrifices for sin [ j ] or sacrifices to make things right . [ k ]
CEV	Ezekiel	40	41	So there was a total of eight tables , four inside and four outside , where the animals were killed , 42-43 and where the meat was placed until it was sacrificed on the altar . [ l ] Next to the tables in the entrance room were four stone tables
CEV	Ezekiel	40	75	centimeters square ; the equipment used for killing the animals was kept on top of these tables . All around the walls of this room was a 75-millimeter shelf . [ m ] The Rooms Belonging to the Priests
CEV	Ezekiel	40	44	. - 40.48 seven meters long : One ancient translation ; these words are not in the Hebrew text of this verse . - 40.49 six : One ancient translation ; Hebrew “ five and a half. ” - 40.49 steps : Hebrew ; one ancient translation “ ten steps. ” Copyright ©
CEV	Ezekiel	40	45	He said , “ The building beside the north gate belongs to the priests who serve in the temple ,
CEV	Ezekiel	40	46	and the building beside the south gate belongs to those who serve at the altar . All of them are descendants of Zadok and are the only Levites allowed to serve as the Lord 's priests. ” The Inner Courtyard and the Temple
CEV	Ezekiel	40	47	Now the man measured the inner courtyard ; it was
CEV	Ezekiel	40	48	We walked to the porch of the temple , and the man measured the doorway of the porch : It was seven meters long , [ o ] two and a half meters wide , and the distance from the doorway to the wall on either side was one and a half meters .
CEV	Ezekiel	40	49	The porch itself was ten meters by six [ p ] meters , with steps [ q ] leading up to it . There was a column on each side of these steps . Footnotes - 40.1,2 Twenty-five years … first month : Probably March of

CEV	Ezekiel	41	41	Next we went into the main room of the temple . The man measured the doorway of this room : It was
CEV	Ezekiel	41	3	meters wide : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text . - 41.7 which meant that … on the bottom level : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text . - 41.15 The inside walls of the temple 's porch and main room : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text . - 41.16 were trimmed in wood : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text . - 41.17 decorated : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text of verse
CEV	Ezekiel	41	2	five meters long , and the distance from the doorway to the wall on either side was two and a half meters . The main room itself was
CEV	Ezekiel	41	20	meters by
CEV	Ezekiel	41	10	and the nearest buildings ten meters away .
CEV	Ezekiel	41	5	The man measured the wall of the temple , and it was three meters thick . Storage rooms two meters wide were built against the outside of the wall .
CEV	Ezekiel	41	6	There were three levels of rooms , with
CEV	Ezekiel	41	30	rooms on each level , and they rested on ledges that were attached to the temple walls , so that nothing was built into the walls .
CEV	Ezekiel	41	7	The walls of the temple were thicker at the bottom than at the top , which meant that the storage rooms on the top level were wider than those on the bottom level . [ b ] Steps led from the bottom level , through the middle level , and into the top level .
CEV	Ezekiel	41	8	The temple rested on a stone base three meters high , which also served as the foundation for the storage rooms .
CEV	Ezekiel	41	9	The outside walls of the storage rooms were two and a half meters thick ; there was nothing between these walls
CEV	Ezekiel	41	11	One door led into the storage rooms on the north side of the temple , and another door led to those on the south side . The stone base extended two and a half meters beyond the outside wall of the storage rooms . The West Building and the Measurements of the Temple
CEV	Ezekiel	41	12	I noticed another building : It faced the west end of the temple and was
CEV	Ezekiel	41	35	meters wide ,
CEV	Ezekiel	41	45	meters long , and had walls over 2.5 meters thick .
CEV	Ezekiel	41	13	The man measured the length of the temple , and it was
CEV	Ezekiel	41	50	meters . The Inside of the Temple The inside walls of the temple 's porch and main room [ c ]
CEV	Ezekiel	41	14	The distance across the front of the temple , including the open space on either side , was also
CEV	Ezekiel	41	15	Finally , the man measured the length of the west building , including the side rooms on each end , and it was also
CEV	Ezekiel	41	16	were paneled with wood all the way from the floor to the windows , while the doorways , the small windows , and the three side rooms were trimmed in wood . [ d ]

CEV	Ezekiel	41	21	The doorframe to the temple 's main room was in the shape of a rectangle . The Wooden Altar In front of the doorway to the most holy place was something that looked like
CEV	Ezekiel	41	22	a wooden altar . It was one and a half meters high and one meter square , [ f ] and its corners , its base , [ g ] and its sides were made of wood . The man said , “ This is a reminder that the Lord is constantly watching over his temple. ” The Doors in the Temple
CEV	Ezekiel	41	23	Both the doorway to the main room of the temple and the doorway to the most holy place had two doors ,
CEV	Ezekiel	41	24	and each door had two sections that could fold open .
CEV	Ezekiel	41	25	The doors to the main room were decorated with carvings of winged creatures and palm trees just like those on the walls , and there was a wooden covering over the porch just outside these doors .

CEV	Ezekiel	42	25	meters long , [ e ] 9-10 and at the east end of this wall was the door leading from the courtyard to these rooms . There was also a set of rooms on the south [ f ] side of the west building .
CEV	Ezekiel	42	3	On one side of them was the
CEV	Ezekiel	42	10	meters of open space … the temple : See 41.10 . - 42.3 the sidewalk that circled the outer courtyard : See 40.17 . - 42.4
CEV	Ezekiel	42	4	with doors that opened toward the north , and in front of them was a walkway five meters wide and
CEV	Ezekiel	42	5	The rooms on the top level were narrower than those on the middle level , and the rooms on the middle level were narrower than those on the bottom level .
CEV	Ezekiel	42	6	The rooms on the bottom level supported those on the two upper levels , and so these rooms did not have columns like other buildings in the courtyard . 7-8 To the north was a privacy wall
CEV	Ezekiel	42	11	These rooms were exactly like those on the north side , and they also had a walkway in front of them .
CEV	Ezekiel	42	12	The door to these rooms was at the east end of the wall that stood in front of them .
CEV	Ezekiel	42	13	The man then said to me : These rooms on the north and south sides of the temple are the sacred rooms where the Lord 's priests will eat the most holy offerings . These offerings include the grain sacrifices , the sacrifices for sin , and the sacrifices to make things right .
CEV	Ezekiel	42	14	When the priests are ready to leave the temple , they must go through these rooms before they return to the outer courtyard . They must leave their sacred clothes in these rooms and put on regular clothes before going anywhere near other people . The Size of the Temple Area
CEV	Ezekiel	42	15	After the man had finished measuring the buildings inside the temple area , he took me back through the east gate and measured the wall around this area .
CEV	Ezekiel	42	16	He used his measuring stick to measure the east side of this wall ; it was
CEV	Ezekiel	42	250	meters long ,
CEV	Ezekiel	42	20	and so the temple area was a perfect square . The wall around this area separated what was sacred from what was ordinary . Footnotes - 42.1,2 he showed me … the west building : One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text . - 42.3 the

CEV	Ezekiel	43	43	The man took me back to the east gate of the temple ,
CEV	Ezekiel	43	2	meters high , was the place where sacrifices were burned , and the four corners of the top section looked like the horns of a bull . The steps leading up to the altar were on the east side . The Dedication of the Altar
CEV	Ezekiel	43	3	This vision was like the one I had seen when God came to destroy Jerusalem and like the one I had seen near the Chebar River . I immediately bowed with my face to the ground ,
CEV	Ezekiel	43	4	and the Lord 's glory came through the east gate and into the temple . [ a ]
CEV	Ezekiel	43	5	The Lord 's Spirit lifted me to my feet and carried me to the inner courtyard , where I saw that the Lord 's glory had filled the temple .

CEV	Ezekiel	43	9	But if the people and their kings stop worshiping other gods and tear down those memorials , I will live among them forever .
CEV	Ezekiel	43	10	The people of Israel must suffer shame for sinning against me , so tell them about my holy temple . Let them think about it ,
CEV	Ezekiel	43	11	then if they are truly sorry , describe for them the design and shape of the temple , the gates , the measurements , and how the buildings are arranged . Explain the regulations about worshiping there , then write down these things , so they can study and obey them .
CEV	Ezekiel	43	12	The temple area on my holy mountain must be kept sacred ! This is the most important law about the temple . The Altar
CEV	Ezekiel	43	13	( B ) According to the official standards , the altar in the temple had the following measurements : Around the bottom of the altar was a gutter
CEV	Ezekiel	43	50	centimeters deep , with a 25-centimeter ledge on the outer rim . 14-17 The altar rested on a base and had three sections , each one of them square . The bottom section was
CEV	Ezekiel	43	18	( C ) The Lord God said : Ezekiel , son of man , after the altar is built , it must be dedicated by offering sacrifices on it and by splattering it with blood . Here is what you must do :
CEV	Ezekiel	43	19	The priests of the Levi tribe from the family of Zadok the priest are the only ones who may serve in my temple—this is my law . So give them a young bull to slaughter as a sacrifice for sin .
CEV	Ezekiel	43	20	Take some of the animal 's blood and smear it on the four corners of the altar , some on the corners of the middle section , and some more on the rim around its edge . That will purify the altar and make it fit for offering sacrifices to me .
CEV	Ezekiel	43	21	Then take the body of the bull outside the temple area and burn it at the special place .
CEV	Ezekiel	43	22	The next day , a goat [ d ] that has nothing wrong with it must be offered as a sacrifice for sin . Purify the altar with its blood , just as you did with the blood of the bull .
CEV	Ezekiel	43	23	Then choose a young bull and a young ram that have nothing wrong with them ,
CEV	Ezekiel	43	24	and bring them to my temple . The priests will sprinkle salt on them [ e ] and offer them as sacrifices to please me . [ f ]
CEV	Ezekiel	43	25	Each day for the next seven days , you must offer a goat and a bull and a ram as sacrifices for sin . These animals must have nothing wrong with them .
CEV	Ezekiel	43	26	The priests will purify the altar during those days , so that it will be acceptable to me and ready to use .
CEV	Ezekiel	43	27	From then on , the priests will use this altar to offer sacrifices to please me and sacrifices to ask my blessing . [ g ] Then I will be pleased with the people of Israel . I , the Lord God , have spoken .

CEV	Ezekiel	44	44	The man took me back to the outer courtyard , near the east gate of the temple area . I saw that the doors to this gate were closed .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	2	The Lord said : I , the Lord God of Israel , came through this gate , so it must remain closed forever ! No one must ever use it .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	3	The ruler of Israel may come here to eat a sacrificial meal that has been offered to me , but he must use only the entrance room of this gate . People Who Are Not Allowed in the Temple
CEV	Ezekiel	44	4	Then the man took me through the north gate to the front of the temple . I saw that the brightness of the Lord 's glory had filled the temple , and I immediately bowed with my face to the ground .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	5	The Lord said : Ezekiel , son of man , I am going to give you the laws for my temple . So pay attention and listen carefully to what kind of people are allowed to come in the temple , and what kind are not .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	6	Tell those rebellious people of Israel : I , the Lord God , command you to stop your evil ways !
CEV	Ezekiel	44	7	My temple has been disgraced , because you have let godless , stubborn foreigners come here when sacrifices are being offered to me . You have sinned and have broken our solemn agreement .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	8	Instead of following the proper ways to worship me , you have put foreigners in charge of worship at my temple .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	9	And so I , the Lord God , say that no godless foreigner who disobeys me will be allowed in my temple . This includes any foreigner living in Israel . The Levites Are Punished The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	44	10	Some of the Levites turned their backs on me and joined the other people of Israel in worshiping idols . So these Levites must be punished !
CEV	Ezekiel	44	11	They will still be allowed to serve me as temple workers by guarding the gates and by killing the animals to be sacrificed and by helping the worshipers .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	12	But because these Levites served the people of Israel when they worshiped idols , I , the Lord God , promise that the Levites will be punished . They did not stop the Israelites from sinning ,
CEV	Ezekiel	44	13	and now I will no longer let the Levites serve as my priests or come near anything sacred to me . They must suffer shame and disgrace for their disgusting sins .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	14	They will be responsible for all the hard work that must be done in the temple . Rules for Priests The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	44	15	The priests of the Levi tribe who are descendants of Zadok the priest were faithful to me , even when the rest of the Israelites turned away . And so , these priests will continue to serve as my priests and to offer the fat and the blood of sacrifices .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	16	They will come into my temple , where they will offer sacrifices at my altar and lead others in worship .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	17	( A ) When they come to the inner courtyard , they must wear their linen priestly clothes . My priests must never wear anything made of wool when they are on duty in this courtyard or in the temple .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	18	Even their turbans and underwear must be made of linen to keep my priests from sweating when they work .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	19	( B ) And before they leave to join the other people in the outer courtyard , they must take off their priestly clothes , then place them in the sacred rooms and put on their regular clothes . [ a ] That way , no one will touch their sacred clothes and be harmed . [ b ]
CEV	Ezekiel	44	20	( C ) Priests must never shave their heads when they are mourning . But they must keep their hair properly trimmed and not let it grow too long .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	21	( D ) They must not drink wine before going to the inner courtyard .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	22	( E ) A priest must not marry a divorced woman ; he can marry only a virgin from Israel or the widow of another priest .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	23	( F ) Priests must teach my people the difference between what is sacred and what is ordinary , and between what is clean and what is unclean .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	24	They will make decisions in difficult legal cases , according to my own laws . They must also observe the religious festivals my Law requires and must always respect the Sabbath .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	25	( G ) Touching a dead body will make a person unclean . So a priest must not go near a dead body , unless it is one of his parents or children , or his brother or unmarried sister .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	26	If a priest touches a dead body , he is unclean and must go through a ceremony to make himself clean . Then seven days later ,
CEV	Ezekiel	44	27	he must go to the inner courtyard of the temple and offer a sacrifice for sin . After that , he may once again serve as my priest . I , the Lord God , have spoken .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	28	( H ) I myself will provide for my priests , and so they wo n't receive any land of their own .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	29	( I ) Instead , they will receive part of the grain sacrifices , as well as part of the sacrifices for sin and sacrifices to make things right . They will also be given everything in Israel that has been completely dedicated to me . [ c ]
CEV	Ezekiel	44	30	The first part of every harvest will belong to the priests . They will also receive part of all special gifts and offerings the Israelites bring to me . And whenever any of my people bake bread , they will give their first loaf as an offering to the priests , and I will bless the homes of the people when they do this .
CEV	Ezekiel	44	31	( J ) Priests must not eat any bird or animal that dies a natural death or that has been killed by a wild animal . Footnotes - 44.19 take off their priestly clothes … put on their regular clothes : See 42.14 . - 44.19 no one will touch … and be harmed : Ordinary people were forbidden to touch anything that was sacred . If they did , it was believed they would somehow be harmed . - 44.29 that has been completely dedicated to me : This translates a Hebrew word that describes property and things that were taken away from humans and given to God . In the early history of Israel , such things often had to be destroyed ( see Joshua 6.15-19 ) . Copyright ©

Land for Israel 's Ruler The Lord said : 7-8 The regions west and east of my sacred land and the city of Jerusalem will belong to the ruler of Israel . He will be given the region between the western edge of my land and the Mediterranean Sea , and between the eastern edge of my land and the Jordan River . This will mean that the length of his property will be the same as the sections of land given to the tribes . This property will belong to every ruler of Israel , so they will always be fair to my people and will let them live peacefully in the land given to their tribes . Israel 's Rulers Must Be Honest
CEV	Ezekiel	45	9	The Lord God said : You leaders of Israel have cheated and abused my people long enough ! I want you to stop sinning and start doing what is right and fair . You must never again force my people off their own land . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEV	Ezekiel	45	11	The ephah will be the standard dry measure , and the bath will be the standard liquid measure . Their size will be based on the homer , which will equal ten ephahs or ten baths . [ c ]

CEV	Ezekiel	45	60	shekels will equal one mina .
CEV	Ezekiel	45	13	Leaders of Israel , the people must bring you one sixtieth of their grain harvests as offerings to me .
CEV	Ezekiel	45	14	They will also bring one percent of their olive oil . These things will be measured according to the bath , and ten baths is the same as one homer or one cor .
CEV	Ezekiel	45	15	Finally , they must bring one sheep out of every
CEV	Ezekiel	45	200	from their flocks . These offerings will be used as grain sacrifices , as well as sacrifices to please me [ e ] and those to ask my blessing . [ f ] I , the Lord , will be pleased with these sacrifices and will forgive the sins of my people .
CEV	Ezekiel	45	16	The people of Israel will bring you these offerings .
CEV	Ezekiel	45	17	But during New Moon Festivals , Sabbath celebrations , and other religious feasts , you leaders will be responsible for providing animals for the sacrifices , as well as the grain and wine . All these will be used for the sacrifices for sin , the grain sacrifices , the sacrifices to please me , and those to ask my blessing . I will be pleased and will forgive the sins of my people .

CEV	Ezekiel	46	46	The Lord said : The east gate of the inner courtyard must remain closed during the six working days of each week . But on the Sabbath and on the first day of the month , this gate will be opened .

CEV	Ezekiel	47	7	where I saw dozens of trees on each side .
CEV	Ezekiel	47	8	The man said : This water flows eastward to the Jordan River valley and empties into the Dead Sea , where it turns the salt water into fresh water .
CEV	Ezekiel	47	9	Wherever this water flows , there will be all kinds of animals and fish , because it will bring life and fresh water to the Dead Sea .
CEV	Ezekiel	47	10	From En-Gedi to Eneglaim , people will fish in the sea and dry their nets along the coast . There will be as many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea as there are in the Mediterranean Sea .
CEV	Ezekiel	47	11	But the marshes along the shore will remain salty , so that people can use the salt from them .
CEV	Ezekiel	47	12	( B ) Fruit trees will grow all along this river and produce fresh fruit every month . The leaves will never dry out , because they will always have water from the stream that flows from the temple , and they will be used for healing people . The Borders of the Land 13-14 The Lord God said to the people of Israel : When the land is divided among the twelve tribes of Israel , the Joseph tribe [ a ] will receive two shares . Divide the land equally , because I promised your ancestors that this land would someday belong to their descendants . These are the borders of the land :
CEV	Ezekiel	47	15	The northern border will begin at the Mediterranean Sea , then continue eastward to Hethlon , to Lebo-Hamath , then across to Zedad ,

The northern border of Israel will run along the towns of Hethlon and Lebo-Hamath , and will end at Hazar-Enon , which is on the border between the kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath . The tribes will receive their share of land in the following order , from north to south : Dan , Asher , Naphtali , Manasseh , Ephraim , Reuben , and Judah . The Special Section of Land The Lord said :
CEV	Ezekiel	48	8	South of Judah 's territory will be a special section of land . Its length will be twelve and a half kilometers , and its width will run from the eastern border of Israel west to the Mediterranean Sea . My temple will be located in this section of land .

CEV	Ezekiel	48	10	I , the Lord , will give half of my sacred land to the priests . Their share will be twelve and a half kilometers long and five kilometers wide , and my temple will be right in the middle .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	11	Only priests who are descendants of Zadok will receive a share of this sacred land , because they remained faithful to me when the Levites and the rest of the Israelites started sinning .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	12	The land belonging to the priests will be the most sacred area and will lie south of the area that belongs to the Levites .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	13	I will give the other half of my sacred land to the Levites . Their share will also be twelve and a half kilometers long and five kilometers wide ,
CEV	Ezekiel	48	14	and they must never sell or trade any of this land—it is the best land and belongs to me .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	15	South of my sacred land will be a section twelve and a half kilometers long and three kilometers wide . It will not be sacred , but will belong to the people of Israel and will include the city of Jerusalem , together with its houses and pastureland .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	16	The city will be a square : Each side will be two kilometers long ,
CEV	Ezekiel	48	17	and an open area
CEV	Ezekiel	48	125	meters wide will surround the city .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	18	The land on the east and west sides of the city limits will be farmland for the people of Jerusalem ; both sections will be five kilometers long and three kilometers wide .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	19	People from the city will farm the land , no matter which tribe they belong to .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	20	And so the center of this special section of land will be for my sacred land , as well as for the city and its property . The land will be a square , twelve and a half kilometers on each side .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	21	The regions east and west of this square of land will belong to the ruler of Israel . His property will run east to the Jordan River and west to the Mediterranean Sea . In the very center of his property will be my sacred land , as well as the temple ,
CEV	Ezekiel	48	22	together with the share belonging to the Levites and the city of Jerusalem . The northern border of the ruler 's property will be the land that belongs to Judah , and the southern border will be the land that belongs to Benjamin . The Division of Land among Tribes in the South The Lord God said : 23-27 South of this special section will be the land that belongs to the rest of Israel 's tribes . Each tribe will receive a section of land that runs from the eastern border of Israel west to the Mediterranean Sea . The tribes will receive their share of land in the following order , from north to south : Benjamin , Simeon , Issachar , Zebulun , and Gad .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	28	Gad 's southern border is also the southern border of Israel . It will begin at the town of Tamar , then run southwest to the springs near Meribath-Kadesh . It will continue along the Egyptian Gorge and end at the Mediterranean Sea .
CEV	Ezekiel	48	29	That 's how the land of Israel will be divided among the twelve tribes . I , the Lord God , have spoken . The Gates of Jerusalem The Lord said : 30-34 ( A ) The city of Jerusalem will have twelve gates , three on each of the four sides of the city wall . These gates will be named after the twelve tribes of Israel . The gates of Reuben , Judah , and Levi will be in the north ; Joseph , Benjamin , and Dan will be in the east ; Simeon , Issachar , and Zebulun will be in the south ; Gad , Asher , and Naphtali will be in the west . Each side of the city wall will be two kilometers long ,
CEV	Ezekiel	48	35	and so the total length of the wall will be ten kilometers . The new name of the city will be “ The-Lord-Is-Here ! ” Footnotes - 48.9 ten : The Hebrew text has “ five ” ( but see 45.1 and the note there ) . Copyright ©

CEV	Daniel	1	1	( A ) In the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah , [ a ] King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia attacked Jerusalem .
CEV	Daniel	1	2	( B ) The Lord let Nebuchadnezzar capture Jehoiakim and take away some of the things used in God 's temple . And when the king returned to Babylonia , [ b ] he put these things in the temple of his own god .
CEV	Daniel	1	3	One day the king ordered Ashpenaz , his highest palace official , to choose some young men from the royal family of Judah and from other leading Jewish families .
CEV	Daniel	1	4	The king said , “ They must be healthy , handsome , smart , wise , educated , and fit to serve in the royal palace . Teach them how to speak and write our language
CEV	Daniel	1	5	and give them the same food and wine that I am served . Train them for three years , and then they can become court officials. ”
CEV	Daniel	1	6	Four of the young Jews chosen were Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , all from the tribe of Judah .
CEV	Daniel	1	7	But the king 's chief official gave them Babylonian names : Daniel became Belteshazzar , Hananiah became Shadrach , Mishael became Meshach , and Azariah became Abednego .
CEV	Daniel	1	8	Daniel made up his mind to eat and drink only what God had approved for his people to eat . And he asked the king 's chief official for permission not to eat the food and wine served in the royal palace .
CEV	Daniel	1	9	God had made the official friendly and kind to Daniel .
CEV	Daniel	1	10	But the man still told him , “ The king has decided what you must eat and drink . And I am afraid he will kill me , if you eat something else and end up looking worse than the other young men. ”
CEV	Daniel	1	11	The king 's official had put a guard in charge of Daniel and his three friends . So Daniel said to the guard ,
CEV	Daniel	1	12	“ For the next ten days , let us have only vegetables and water at mealtime .
CEV	Daniel	1	13	When the ten days are up , compare how we look with the other young men , and decide what to do with us. ”
CEV	Daniel	1	14	The guard agreed to do what Daniel had asked .
CEV	Daniel	1	15	Ten days later , Daniel and his friends looked healthier and better than the young men who had been served food from the royal palace .
CEV	Daniel	1	16	After this , the guard let them eat vegetables instead of the rich food and wine .
CEV	Daniel	1	17	God made the four young men smart and wise . They read a lot of books and became well educated . Daniel could also tell the meaning of dreams and visions .
CEV	Daniel	1	18	At the end of the three-year period set by King Nebuchadnezzar , his chief palace official brought all the young men to him .
CEV	Daniel	1	19	The king interviewed them and discovered that none of the others were as outstanding as Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah . So they were given positions in the royal court .
CEV	Daniel	1	20	From then on , whenever the king asked for advice , he found their wisdom was ten times better than that of any of his other advisors and magicians .
CEV	Daniel	1	21	Daniel served there until the first year of King Cyrus . [ c ] Copyright ©

CEV	Daniel	2	2	So he called in his counselors , advisors , magicians , and wise men ,
CEV	Daniel	2	3	and said , “ I am disturbed by a dream that I do n't understand , and I want you to explain it. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	4	They answered in Aramaic , [ a ] “ Your Majesty , we hope you live forever ! We are your servants . Please tell us your dream , and we will explain what it means. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	5	But the king replied , “ No ! I have made up my mind . If you do n't tell me both the dream and its meaning , you will be chopped to pieces and your houses will be torn down .
CEV	Daniel	2	6	However , if you do tell me both the dream and its meaning , you will be greatly rewarded and highly honored . Now tell me the dream and explain what it means. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	7	“ Your Majesty , ” they said , “ if you will only tell us your dream , we will interpret it for you. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	8	The king replied , “ You 're just stalling for time ,
CEV	Daniel	2	9	because you know what 's going to happen if you do n't come up with the answer . You 've decided to make up a bunch of lies , hoping I might change my mind . Now tell me the dream , and that will prove that you can interpret it. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	10	His advisors explained , “ Your Majesty , you are demanding the impossible ! No king , not even the most famous and powerful , has ever ordered his advisors , magicians , or wise men to do such a thing .
CEV	Daniel	2	11	It ca n't be done , except by the gods , and they do n't live here on earth. ” 12-13 This made the king so angry that he gave orders for every wise man in Babylonia to be put to death , including Daniel and his three friends . God Tells Nebuchadnezzar 's Dream to Daniel
CEV	Daniel	2	14	Arioch was the king 's official in charge of putting the wise men to death . He was on his way to have it done , when Daniel very wisely went to him
CEV	Daniel	2	15	and asked , “ Why did the king give such cruel [ b ] orders ? ” After Arioch explained what had happened ,
CEV	Daniel	2	16	Daniel rushed off and said to the king , “ If you will just give me some time , I 'll explain your dream. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	17	Daniel returned home and told his three friends .
CEV	Daniel	2	18	Then he said , “ Pray that the God who rules from heaven will be merciful and explain this mystery , so that we and the others wo n't be put to death. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	19	In a vision one night , Daniel was shown the dream and its meaning . Then he praised the God who rules from heaven :
CEV	Daniel	2	20	“ Our God , your name will be praised forever and forever . You are all-powerful , and you know everything .
CEV	Daniel	2	21	You control human events— you give rulers their power and take it away , and you are the source of wisdom and knowledge .
CEV	Daniel	2	22	“ You explain deep mysteries , because even the dark is light to you .
CEV	Daniel	2	23	You are the God who was worshiped by my ancestors . Now I thank you and praise you for making me wise and telling me the king 's dream , together with its meaning. ” Daniel Interprets the Dream
CEV	Daniel	2	24	Daniel went back to Arioch , the official in charge of executing the wise men . Daniel said , “ Do n't kill those men ! Take me to the king , and I will explain the meaning of his dream. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	25	Arioch rushed Daniel to the king and announced , “ Your Majesty , I have found out that one of the men brought here from Judah can explain your dream. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	26	The king asked Daniel , [ c ] “ Can you tell me my dream and what it means ? ”
CEV	Daniel	2	27	Daniel answered : Your Majesty , not even the smartest person in all the world can do what you are demanding . 28-29 But the God who rules from heaven can explain mysteries . And while you were sleeping , he showed you what will happen in the future .
CEV	Daniel	2	30	However , you must realize that these mysteries were n't explained to me because I am smarter than everyone else . Instead , it was done so that you would understand what you have seen .
CEV	Daniel	2	31	Your Majesty , what you saw standing in front of you was a huge and terrifying statue , shining brightly .
CEV	Daniel	2	32	Its head was made of gold , its chest and arms were silver , and from its waist down to its knees , it was bronze .
CEV	Daniel	2	33	From there to its ankles it was iron , and its feet were a mixture of iron and clay .
CEV	Daniel	2	34	As you watched , a stone was cut from a mountain—but not by human hands . The stone struck the feet , completely shattering the iron and clay .
CEV	Daniel	2	35	Then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold were crushed and blown away without a trace , like husks of wheat at threshing time . But the stone became a tremendous mountain that covered the entire earth .
CEV	Daniel	2	36	That was the dream , and now I 'll tell you what it means .
CEV	Daniel	2	37	Your Majesty , you are the greatest of kings , and God has highly honored you with power
CEV	Daniel	2	38	over all humans , animals , and birds . You are the head of gold .
CEV	Daniel	2	39	After you are gone , another kingdom will rule , but it wo n't be as strong . Then it will be followed by a kingdom of bronze that will rule the whole world .
CEV	Daniel	2	40	Next , a kingdom of iron will come to power , crushing and shattering everything . [ d ] 41-42 This fourth kingdom will be divided—it will be both strong and brittle , just as you saw that the feet and toes were a mixture of iron and clay .
CEV	Daniel	2	43	This kingdom will be the result of a marriage between kingdoms , but it will crumble , just as iron and clay do n't stick together . 44-45 During the time of those kings , the God who rules from heaven will set up an eternal kingdom that will never fall . It will be like the stone that was cut from the mountain , but not by human hands—the stone that crushed the iron , bronze , clay , silver , and gold . Your Majesty , in your dream the great God has told you what is going to happen , and you can trust this interpretation . Daniel Is Promoted
CEV	Daniel	2	46	King Nebuchadnezzar bowed low to the ground and worshiped Daniel . Then he gave orders for incense to be burned and a sacrifice of grain to be offered in honor of Daniel .
CEV	Daniel	2	47	The king said , “ Now I know that your God is above all other gods and kings , because he gave you the power to explain this mystery. ”
CEV	Daniel	2	48	The king then presented Daniel with a lot of gifts ; he promoted him to governor of Babylon Province and put him in charge of the other wise men .
CEV	Daniel	2	49	At Daniel 's request , the king appointed Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego to high positions in Babylon Province , and he let Daniel stay on as a palace official . Copyright ©

CEV	Daniel	3	3	So all of them came and stood in front of it .
CEV	Daniel	3	27	and the king 's high officials , governors , and advisors all crowded around them . The men were not burned , their hair was n't scorched , and their clothes did n't even smell like smoke .
CEV	Daniel	3	2	and he commanded his governors , advisors , treasurers , judges , and his other officials to come from everywhere in his kingdom to the dedication of the statue .
CEV	Daniel	3	4	Then an official stood up and announced : People of every nation and race , now listen to the king 's command !
CEV	Daniel	3	5	Trumpets , flutes , harps , and all other kinds of musical instruments will soon start playing . When you hear the music , you must bow down and worship the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up .
CEV	Daniel	3	6	Anyone who refuses will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace .
CEV	Daniel	3	7	As soon as the people heard the music , they bowed down and worshiped the gold statue that the king had set up .
CEV	Daniel	3	8	Some Babylonians used this as a chance to accuse the Jews to King Nebuchadnezzar .
CEV	Daniel	3	9	They said , “ Your Majesty , we hope you live forever !
CEV	Daniel	3	10	You commanded everyone to bow down and worship the gold statue when the music played .
CEV	Daniel	3	11	And you said that anyone who did not bow down and worship it would be thrown into a flaming furnace .
CEV	Daniel	3	12	Sir , you appointed three men to high positions in Babylon Province , but they have disobeyed you . Those Jews , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , refuse to worship your gods and the statue you have set up. ”
CEV	Daniel	3	13	King Nebuchadnezzar was furious . So he sent for the three young men and said ,
CEV	Daniel	3	14	“ I hear that you refuse to worship my gods and the gold statue I have set up .
CEV	Daniel	3	15	Now I am going to give you one more chance . If you bow down and worship the statue when you hear the music , everything will be all right . But if you do n't , you will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace . No god can save you from me. ”
CEV	Daniel	3	16	The three men replied , “ Your Majesty , we do n't need to defend ourselves .
CEV	Daniel	3	17	The God we worship can save us from you and your flaming furnace .
CEV	Daniel	3	18	But even if he does n't , we still wo n't worship your gods and the gold statue you have set up. ”
CEV	Daniel	3	19	Nebuchadnezzar 's face twisted with anger at the three men . And he ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual .
CEV	Daniel	3	20	Next , he commanded some of his strongest soldiers to tie up the men and throw them into the flaming furnace . 21-23 ( B ) The king wanted it done at that very moment . So the soldiers tied up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego and threw them into the flaming furnace with all of their clothes still on , including their turbans . The fire was so hot that flames leaped out and killed the soldiers .
CEV	Daniel	3	24	Suddenly the king jumped up and shouted , “ Were n't only three men tied up and thrown into the fire ? ” “ Yes , Your Majesty , ” his officers answered .
CEV	Daniel	3	25	“ But I see four men walking around in the fire , ” the king replied . “ None of them is tied up or harmed , and the fourth one looks like a god. ” [ a ]
CEV	Daniel	3	26	Nebuchadnezzar went closer to the flaming furnace and said to the three young men , “ You servants of the Most High God , come out at once ! ” They came out ,
CEV	Daniel	3	28	King Nebuchadnezzar said : Praise their God for sending an angel to rescue his servants ! They trusted their God and refused to obey my commands . Yes , they chose to die rather than to worship or serve any god except their own .
CEV	Daniel	3	29	And I wo n't allow people of any nation or race to say anything against their God . Anyone who does will be chopped up and their houses will be torn down , because no other god has such great power to save .
CEV	Daniel	3	30	After this happened , the king appointed Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego to even higher positions in Babylon Province . Footnotes - 3.25 a god : Aramaic “ a son of the gods ” or “ a son of God. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Daniel	4	4	I was enjoying a time of peace and prosperity ,
CEV	Daniel	4	2	I am glad to tell about the wonderful miracles God Most High has done for me .
CEV	Daniel	4	3	His miracles are mighty and marvelous . He will rule forever , and his kingdom will never end .
CEV	Daniel	4	5	when suddenly I had some horrifying dreams and visions .
CEV	Daniel	4	6	Then I commanded every wise man in Babylonia to appear in my court , so they could explain the meaning of my dream .
CEV	Daniel	4	7	After they arrived , I told them my dream , but they were not able to say what it meant .
CEV	Daniel	4	8	Finally , a young man named Daniel came in , and I told him the dream . The holy gods had given him special powers , and I had renamed him Belteshazzar after my own god .
CEV	Daniel	4	9	I said , “ Belteshazzar , not only are you the wisest of all advisors and counselors , but the holy gods have given you special powers to solve the most difficult mysteries . So listen to what I dreamed and tell me what it means :
CEV	Daniel	4	10	In my sleep I saw a very tall tree in the center of the world .
CEV	Daniel	4	11	It grew stronger and higher , until it reached to heaven and could be seen from anywhere on earth .
CEV	Daniel	4	12	It was covered with leaves and heavy with fruit— enough for all nations . Wild animals enjoyed its shade , birds nested in its branches , and all creatures on earth lived on its fruit .
CEV	Daniel	4	13	“ While I was in bed , having this vision , a holy angel [ a ] came down from heaven
CEV	Daniel	4	14	and shouted : ‘ Chop down the tree and cut off its branches ; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit . Make the animals leave its shade and send the birds flying from its branches .
CEV	Daniel	4	15	But leave its stump and roots in the ground , surrounded by grass and held by chains of iron and bronze . ‘ Make sure that this ruler lives like the animals out in the open fields , unprotected from the dew .
CEV	Daniel	4	16	Give him the mind of a wild animal for seven long years . [ b ]
CEV	Daniel	4	17	This punishment is given at the command of the holy angels . [ c ] It will show to all who live that God Most High controls all kingdoms and chooses for their rulers persons of humble birth. ’
CEV	Daniel	4	18	“ Daniel , [ d ] that was the dream that none of the wise men in my kingdom were able to understand . But I am sure that you will understand what it means , because the holy gods have given you some special powers. ”
CEV	Daniel	4	19	For a while , Daniel [ e ] was terribly confused and worried by what he was thinking . But I said , “ Do n't be bothered either by the dream or by what it means. ” Daniel replied : Your Majesty , I wish the dream had been against your enemies .
CEV	Daniel	4	20	You saw a tree that grew so big and strong that it reached up to heaven and could be seen from anywhere on earth .
CEV	Daniel	4	21	Its leaves were beautiful , and it produced enough fruit for all living creatures ; animals lived in its shade , and birds nested in its branches .
CEV	Daniel	4	22	Your Majesty , that tree is you . Your glorious reputation has reached heaven , and your kingdom covers the earth .
CEV	Daniel	4	23	Then you saw a holy angel [ f ] come down from heaven and say , “ Chop down the tree and destroy it ! But leave its stump and roots in the ground , fastened there by a chain of iron and bronze . Let it stay for seven years [ g ] out in the field with the wild animals , unprotected from the dew. ”
CEV	Daniel	4	24	Your Majesty , God Most High has sent you this message , and it means
CEV	Daniel	4	25	that you will be forced to live with the wild animals , far away from humans . You will eat grass like a wild animal and live outdoors for seven years , [ h ] until you learn that God Most High controls all earthly kingdoms and chooses their rulers .
CEV	Daniel	4	26	But he gave orders not to disturb the stump and roots . This is to show that you will be king once again , after you learn that the God who rules from heaven is in control .
CEV	Daniel	4	27	( A ) Your Majesty , please be willing to do what I say . Turn from your sins and start living right ; have mercy on those who are mistreated . Then all will go well with you for a long time . The Rest of Nebuchadnezzar 's Letter about His Second Dream 28-30 About twelve months later , I was walking on the flat roof of my royal palace and admiring the beautiful city of Babylon , when these things started happening to me . I was saying to myself , “ Just look at this wonderful capital city that I have built by my own power and for my own glory ! ”
CEV	Daniel	4	31	But before I could finish speaking , a voice from heaven interrupted : King Nebuchadnezzar , this kingdom is no longer yours .
CEV	Daniel	4	32	You will be forced to live with the wild animals , away from people . For seven years [ i ] you will eat grass , as though you were an ox , until you learn that God Most High is in control of all earthly kingdoms and that he is the one who chooses their rulers .
CEV	Daniel	4	33	This was no sooner said than done—I was forced to live like a wild animal ; I ate grass and was unprotected from the dew . As time went by , my hair grew longer than eagle feathers , and my fingernails looked like the claws of a bird .
CEV	Daniel	4	34	( B ) Finally , I prayed to God in heaven , and my mind was healed . Then I said : “ I praise and honor God Most High . God lives forever , and his kingdom will never end .
CEV	Daniel	4	35	To him the nations are far less than nothing ; God controls the stars in the sky and everyone on this earth . When God does something , we can not change it or even ask why. ”
CEV	Daniel	4	36	At that time my mind was healed , and once again I became the ruler of my glorious kingdom . My advisors and officials returned to me , and I had greater power than ever before .
CEV	Daniel	4	37	That 's why I say : “ Praise and honor the King who rules from heaven ! Everything he does is honest and fair , and he can shatter the power of those who are proud. ” Footnotes - 4.13 angel : The Aramaic text has “ watcher , ” which may be some special class of angel . - 4.16 long years : Aramaic “ times. ” - 4.17 angels : See the note at 4.13 . - 4.18 Daniel : See the note at 2.26 . - 4.19 Daniel : See the note at 2.26 . - 4.23 angel : See the note at 4.13 . - 4.23 years : Aramaic “ times. ” - 4.25 years : Aramaic “ times. ” - 4.32 years : Aramaic “ times. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Daniel	5	5	Suddenly a human hand was seen writing on the plaster wall of the palace . The hand was just behind the lampstand , and the king could see it writing .
CEV	Daniel	5	2	He got drunk and ordered his servants to bring in the gold and silver cups his father Nebuchadnezzar [ a ] had taken from the temple in Jerusalem . Belshazzar wanted the cups , so that he and all his wives and officials could drink from them . 3-4 ( A ) When the gold cups were brought in , everyone at the banquet drank from them and praised their idols made of gold , silver , bronze , iron , wood , and stone .
CEV	Daniel	5	6	He was so frightened that his face turned pale , his knees started shaking , and his legs became weak .
CEV	Daniel	5	7	The king called in his advisors , who claimed they could talk with the spirits of the dead and understand the meanings found in the stars . He told them , “ The man who can read this writing and tell me what it means will become the third most powerful man in my kingdom . He will wear robes of royal purple and a gold chain around his neck. ”
CEV	Daniel	5	8	All of King Belshazzar 's highest officials came in , but not one of them could read the writing or tell what it meant ,
CEV	Daniel	5	9	and they were completely puzzled . Now the king was more afraid than ever before , and his face turned white as a ghost .
CEV	Daniel	5	10	When the queen heard the king and his officials talking , she came in and said : Your Majesty , I hope you live forever ! Do n't be afraid or look so pale .
CEV	Daniel	5	11	In your kingdom there is a man who has been given special powers by the holy gods . When your father Nebuchadnezzar was king , this man was known to be as smart , intelligent , and wise as the gods themselves . Your father put him in charge of all who claimed they could talk with the spirits or understand the meanings in the stars or tell about the future .
CEV	Daniel	5	12	He also changed the man 's name from Daniel to Belteshazzar . Not only is he wise and intelligent , but he can explain dreams and riddles and solve difficult problems . Send for Daniel , and he will tell you what the writing means .
CEV	Daniel	5	13	When Daniel was brought in , the king said : So you are Daniel , one of the captives my father brought back from Judah !
CEV	Daniel	5	14	I was told that the gods have given you special powers and that you are intelligent and very wise .
CEV	Daniel	5	15	Neither my advisors nor the men who talk with the spirits of the dead could read this writing or tell me what it means .
CEV	Daniel	5	16	But I have been told that you understand everything and that you can solve difficult problems . Now then , if you can read this writing and tell me what it means , you will become the third most powerful man in my kingdom . You will wear royal purple robes and have a gold chain around your neck .
CEV	Daniel	5	17	Daniel answered : Your Majesty , I will read the writing and tell you what it means . But you may keep your gifts or give them to someone else .
CEV	Daniel	5	18	Sir , the Most High God made your father a great and powerful man and brought him much honor and glory .
CEV	Daniel	5	19	God did such great things for him that people of all nations and races shook with fear . Your father had the power of life or death over everyone , and he could honor or ruin anyone he chose .
CEV	Daniel	5	20	But when he became proud and stubborn , his glorious kingdom was taken from him .
CEV	Daniel	5	21	His mind became like that of an animal , and he was forced to stay away from people and live with wild donkeys . Your father ate grass like an ox , and he slept outside where his body was soaked with dew . He was forced to do this until he learned that the Most High God rules all kingdoms on earth and chooses their kings .
CEV	Daniel	5	22	King Belshazzar , you knew all of this , but you still refused to honor the Lord who rules from heaven .
CEV	Daniel	5	23	Instead , you turned against him and ordered the cups from his temple to be brought here , so that you and your wives and officials could drink wine from them . You praised idols made of silver , gold , bronze , iron , wood , and stone , even though they can not see or hear or think . You refused to worship the God who gives you breath and controls everything you do .
CEV	Daniel	5	24	That 's why he sent the hand to write this message on the wall . 25-28 The words written there are mene , which means “ numbered , ” tekel , which means “ weighed , ” and parsin , [ b ] which means “ divided. ” God has numbered the days of your kingdom and has brought it to an end . He has weighed you on his balance scales , and you fall short of what it takes to be king . So God has divided your kingdom between the Medes and the Persians .
CEV	Daniel	5	29	Belshazzar gave a command for Daniel to be made the third most powerful man in his kingdom and to be given a purple robe and a gold chain .

CEV	Daniel	6	6	They all went to the king and said : “ Your Majesty , we hope you live forever !
CEV	Daniel	6	120	states and placed a governor in charge of each one .
CEV	Daniel	6	2	In order to make sure that his government was run properly , Darius put three other officials in charge of the governors . One of these officials was Daniel .
CEV	Daniel	6	3	And he did his work so much better than the other governors and officials that the king decided to let him govern the whole kingdom .
CEV	Daniel	6	4	The other men tried to find something wrong with the way Daniel did his work for the king . But they could not accuse him of anything wrong , because he was honest and faithful and did everything he was supposed to do .
CEV	Daniel	6	5	Finally , they said to one another , “ We will never be able to bring any charge against Daniel , unless it has to do with his religion. ”
CEV	Daniel	6	7	( A ) All of your officials , leaders , advisors , and governors agree that you should make a law forbidding anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next
CEV	Daniel	6	30	days ? And does n't the law say that everyone who disobeys it will be thrown into a pit of lions ? ” “ Yes , that 's the law I made , ” the king agreed . “ And just like all written laws of the Medes and Persians , it can not be changed. ”
CEV	Daniel	6	8	Order this to be written and then sign it , so it can not be changed , just as no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed. ”
CEV	Daniel	6	9	So King Darius made the law and had it written down .
CEV	Daniel	6	10	Daniel heard about the law , but when he returned home , he went upstairs and prayed in front of the window that faced Jerusalem . In the same way that he had always done , he knelt down in prayer three times a day , giving thanks to God .
CEV	Daniel	6	11	The men who had spoken to the king watched Daniel and saw him praying to his God for help .
CEV	Daniel	6	12	They went back to the king and said , “ Did n't you make a law that forbids anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next
CEV	Daniel	6	13	The men then told the king , “ That Jew named Daniel , who was brought here as a captive , refuses to obey you or the law that you ordered to be written . And he still prays to his god three times a day. ”
CEV	Daniel	6	14	The king was really upset to hear about this , and for the rest of the day he tried to think how he could save Daniel .
CEV	Daniel	6	15	At sunset the men returned and said , “ Your Majesty , remember that no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed , not even by the king. ”
CEV	Daniel	6	16	( B ) So Darius ordered Daniel to be brought out and thrown into a pit of lions . But he said to Daniel , “ You have been faithful to your God , and I pray that he will rescue you. ”
CEV	Daniel	6	17	A stone was rolled over the pit , and it was sealed . Then Darius and his officials stamped the seal to show that no one should let Daniel out .
CEV	Daniel	6	18	All night long the king could not sleep . He did not eat anything , and he would not let anyone come in to entertain him .
CEV	Daniel	6	19	At daybreak the king got up and ran to the pit .
CEV	Daniel	6	20	He was anxious and shouted , “ Daniel , you were faithful and served your God . Was he able to save you from the lions ? ”
CEV	Daniel	6	21	Daniel answered , “ Your Majesty , I hope you live forever !
CEV	Daniel	6	22	( C ) My God knew that I was innocent , and he sent an angel to keep the lions from eating me . Your Majesty , I have never done anything to hurt you. ”
CEV	Daniel	6	23	The king was relieved to hear Daniel 's voice , and he gave orders for him to be taken out of the pit . Daniel 's faith in his God had kept him from being harmed .
CEV	Daniel	6	24	And the king ordered the men who had brought charges against Daniel to be thrown into the pit , together with their wives and children . But before they even reached the bottom , the lions ripped them to pieces .
CEV	Daniel	6	25	King Darius then sent this message to all people of every nation and race in the world : “ Greetings to all of you !
CEV	Daniel	6	26	I command everyone in my kingdom to worship and honor the God of Daniel . He is the living God , the one who lives forever . His power and his kingdom will never end .
CEV	Daniel	6	27	He rescues people and sets them free by working great miracles . Daniel 's God has rescued him from the power of the lions. ”
CEV	Daniel	6	28	All went well for Daniel while Darius was king , and even when Cyrus the Persian ruled . [ a ] Footnotes - 6.28 Cyrus the Persian ruled : 539–530 b.c . Copyright ©

CEV	Daniel	7	7	( C ) The fourth beast was stronger and more terrifying than the others . Its huge teeth were made of iron , and what it did n't grind with its teeth , it smashed with its feet . It was different from the others , and it had horns on its head—ten of them .
CEV	Daniel	7	3	( A ) when suddenly four powerful beasts came out of the sea . Each beast was different .
CEV	Daniel	7	4	( B ) The first was like a lion with the wings of an eagle . As I watched , its wings were pulled off . Then it was lifted to an upright position and made to stand on two feet , just like a human , and it was given a human mind .
CEV	Daniel	7	5	The second beast looked like a bear standing on its hind legs . [ b ] It held three ribs in its teeth , and it was told , “ Attack ! Eat all the flesh you want. ”
CEV	Daniel	7	6	The third beast was like a leopard—except that it had four wings and four heads . It was given authority to rule .
CEV	Daniel	7	8	( D ) Just as I was thinking about these horns , a smaller horn appeared , and three of the other horns were pulled up by the roots to make room for it . This horn had the eyes of a human and a mouth that spoke with great arrogance . Judgment Daniel wrote :
CEV	Daniel	7	9	( E ) Thrones were set up while I was watching , and the Eternal God [ c ] took his place . His clothing and his hair were white as snow . His throne was a blazing fire with fiery wheels ,
CEV	Daniel	7	10	. - 7.19 fourth beast : See verses 7,8 . - 7.22 Eternal God : See the note at 7.9 . - 7.25 for … time : Or “ for a year , two years , and half a year. ” Copyright ©
CEV	Daniel	7	11	I watched closely to see what would happen to this smaller horn because of the arrogant things it was saying . Then before my very eyes , the fourth beast was killed and its body destroyed by fire .
CEV	Daniel	7	12	The other three beasts had their authority taken from them , but they were allowed to live a while longer . [ e ]
CEV	Daniel	7	13	( G ) As I continued to watch the vision that night , I saw what looked like a son of man [ f ] coming with the clouds of heaven , and he was presented to the Eternal God . [ g ]
CEV	Daniel	7	14	( H ) He was crowned king and given power and glory , so that all people of every nation and race would serve him . He will rule forever , and his kingdom is eternal , never to be destroyed . The Meaning of Daniel 's Vision
CEV	Daniel	7	15	Daniel wrote : I was terrified by these visions , and I did n't know what to think .
CEV	Daniel	7	16	So I asked one of those standing there , [ h ] and he explained ,
CEV	Daniel	7	17	“ The four beasts are four earthly kingdoms .
CEV	Daniel	7	18	( I ) But God Most High will give his kingdom to his chosen ones , and it will be theirs forever and ever. ”
CEV	Daniel	7	19	I wanted to know more about the fourth beast , [ i ] because it was so different and much more terrifying than the others . What was the meaning of its iron teeth and bronze claws and of its feet that smashed what the teeth and claws had not ground and crushed ?
CEV	Daniel	7	20	I also wanted to know more about all ten of those horns on its head . I especially wanted to know more about the one that took the place of three of the others—the horn that had eyes and spoke with arrogance and seemed greater than the others .
CEV	Daniel	7	21	( J ) While I was looking , this horn attacked God 's chosen ones and was winning the battle .
CEV	Daniel	7	22	( K ) Then God Most High , the Eternal God , [ j ] came and judged in favor of his chosen ones , because the time had arrived for them to be given the kingdom .
CEV	Daniel	7	23	Then I was told by the one standing there : “ The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom to appear on earth . It will be different from all the others— it will trample the earth and crush it to pieces .
CEV	Daniel	7	24	( L ) All ten of those horns are kings who will come from this kingdom , and one more will follow . This horn will be different from the others , and it will conquer three other kings .
CEV	Daniel	7	25	( M ) “ This king will speak evil of God Most High , and he will be cruel to God 's chosen ones . He will try to change God 's Law and the sacred seasons . And he will be able to do this for a time , two times , and half a time . [ k ]
CEV	Daniel	7	26	But he will finally be judged , and his kingdom completely destroyed .
CEV	Daniel	7	27	( N ) “ Then the greatest kingdom of all will be given to the chosen ones of God Most High . His kingdom will be eternal , and all others will serve and obey him. ”
CEV	Daniel	7	28	That was what I saw and heard . I turned pale with fear and kept it all to myself . Footnotes - 7.1,2 first year of King Belshazzar :

CEV	Daniel	8	8	After this , the goat became even more powerful . But at the peak of his power , his mighty horn was broken , and four other mighty horns took its place—one pointing to the north and one to the east , one to the south and one to the west .
CEV	Daniel	8	2	in which I was in Susa , the chief city of Babylonia 's Elam Province . I was beside the Ulai River , [ b ]
CEV	Daniel	8	3	when I looked up and saw a ram standing there with two horns on its head—both of them were long , but the second one was longer than the first .
CEV	Daniel	8	4	The ram went charging toward the west , the north , and the south . No other animals were strong enough to oppose him , and nothing could save them from his power . So he did as he pleased and became even more powerful .
CEV	Daniel	8	5	I kept on watching and saw a goat come from the west and charge across the entire earth , without even touching the ground . Between his eyes was a powerful horn , [ c ]
CEV	Daniel	8	6	and with tremendous anger the goat started toward the ram that I had seen beside the river . [ d ]
CEV	Daniel	8	7	The goat was so fierce that its attack broke both horns of the ram , leaving him powerless . Then the goat trampled on the ram , and no one could do anything to help .
CEV	Daniel	8	9	A little horn came from one of these , and its power reached to the south , the east , and even to the holy land . [ e ]
CEV	Daniel	8	10	( A ) It became so strong that it attacked the stars in the sky , which were heaven 's army . [ f ] Then it threw some of them down to the earth and trampled on them . 11-12 It humiliated heaven 's army and dishonored its leader [ g ] by keeping him from offering the daily sacrifices . In fact , it was so terrible that it even disgraced the temple and wiped out true worship . It also did everything else it wanted to do .
CEV	Daniel	8	13	Then one of the holy angels asked another , “ When will the daily sacrifices be offered again ? What about this horrible rebellion ? When will the temple and heaven 's army no longer be trampled in the dust ? ”
CEV	Daniel	8	14	The other answered , “ It will be 2,300 evenings and mornings before the temple is dedicated and in use again. ” Gabriel Interprets the Vision
CEV	Daniel	8	15	Daniel wrote : I was trying to figure out the meaning of the vision , when someone suddenly appeared there beside me .
CEV	Daniel	8	16	( B ) And from beside the Ulai River , [ h ] a voice like that of a human said , “ Gabriel , help him understand the vision. ”
CEV	Daniel	8	17	Gabriel came over , and I fell to the ground in fear . Then he said , “ You are merely a human , but you need to understand that this vision is about the end of time. ”
CEV	Daniel	8	18	While he was speaking , I fell facedown in a deep sleep . But he lifted me to my feet
CEV	Daniel	8	19	and said : Listen , and I will tell you what will happen at the end of time , when God has chosen to show his anger .
CEV	Daniel	8	20	The two horns of the ram are the kings of Media and Persia ,
CEV	Daniel	8	21	the goat is the kingdom of Greece , and the powerful horn between his eyes is the first of its kings .
CEV	Daniel	8	22	After this horn is broken , four other kingdoms will appear , but they wo n't be as strong .
CEV	Daniel	8	23	When these rulers have become as evil as possible , their power will end , and then a king who is dangerous and can not be trusted will appear .
CEV	Daniel	8	24	He will gain strength , but not on his own , and he will cause terrible destruction . He will wipe out powerful leaders and God 's people as well .
CEV	Daniel	8	25	His deceitful lies will make him so successful , that he will think he is really great . Suddenly he will kill many people , and he will even attack God , the Supreme Ruler . But God will crush him !
CEV	Daniel	8	26	This vision about the evenings and mornings is true , but these things wo n't happen for a long time , so do n't tell it to others .
CEV	Daniel	8	27	After this , I was so worn out and weak that it was several days before I could get out of bed and go about my duties for the king . I was disturbed by this vision that made no sense to me . Footnotes - 8.1 third year … Babylonia :

CEV	Daniel	10	10	He raised me to my hands and knees
CEV	Daniel	10	2	Daniel wrote : For three weeks I was in sorrow .

CEV	Daniel	10	4	Then , on the twenty-fourth day of the first month , [ d ] I was standing on the banks of the great Tigris River ,

CEV	Daniel	11	11	( A ) But this will make the king of the south angry , and he will defeat this large army from the north .
CEV	Daniel	11	1	You also need to know that I protected and helped Darius the Mede [ a ] in his first year as king . The Angel 's Message to Daniel Part One : The Four Kings and Their Successors
CEV	Daniel	11	2	What I am going to tell you is certain to happen . Four kings will rule Persia , one after the other , but the fourth one will become much richer than the others . In fact , his wealth will make him so powerful that he will turn everyone against the kingdom of Greece .
CEV	Daniel	11	3	Then a mighty king will come to power and will be able to do whatever he pleases .
CEV	Daniel	11	4	But suddenly his kingdom will be crushed and scattered to the four corners of the earth , where four more kingdoms will rise . But these wo n't be ruled by his descendants or be as powerful as his kingdom .
CEV	Daniel	11	5	The king of the south will grow powerful . Then one of his generals will rebel and will rule an even larger kingdom .
CEV	Daniel	11	6	Years later the southern kingdom and the northern kingdom will make a treaty , and the daughter of the king of the south will marry the king of the north . But she will lose her power . Then she , her husband , their child , [ b ] and the servants who came with her will all be killed . After this ,
CEV	Daniel	11	7	one of her relatives will become the ruler of the southern kingdom . He will attack the army of the northern kingdom and capture its fortresses .
CEV	Daniel	11	8	Then he will carry their idols to Egypt , together with their precious treasures of silver and gold , but it will be a long time before he attacks the northern kingdom again . Some years later
CEV	Daniel	11	9	the king of the north will invade the southern kingdom , but he will be forced back to his own country .
CEV	Daniel	11	10	The sons of the king of the north will gather a huge army that will sweep down like a roaring flood , reaching all the way to the fortress of the southern kingdom .
CEV	Daniel	11	12	The king of the south will feel proud because of the many thousands he has killed . But his victories wo n't last long ,
CEV	Daniel	11	13	because the king of the north will gather a larger and more powerful army than ever before . Then in a few years , he will start invading other countries .
CEV	Daniel	11	14	At this time many of your own people will try to make this vision come true by rebelling against the king of the south , but their rebellion will fail .
CEV	Daniel	11	15	Then the army from the north will surround and capture a fortress in the south , and not even the most experienced troops of the southern kingdom will be able to make them retreat .
CEV	Daniel	11	16	The king who invaded from the north will do as he pleases , and he will even capture and destroy the holy land . [ c ]
CEV	Daniel	11	17	In fact , he will decide to invade the south with his entire army . Then he will attempt to make peace by giving the king of the south a bride from the northern kingdom , but this wo n't be successful .
CEV	Daniel	11	18	Afterwards , this proud king of the north will invade and conquer many of the nations along the coast , but a military leader will defeat him and make him lose his pride .
CEV	Daniel	11	19	He will retreat to his fortresses in his own country , but on the way he will be defeated and never again be seen .
CEV	Daniel	11	20	The next king of the north will try to collect taxes for the glory of his kingdom . However , he will come to a sudden end in some mysterious way , instead of in battle or because of someone 's anger . Part Two : The Evil King from the North
CEV	Daniel	11	21	The successor of this king of the north will be a worthless nobody , who does n't even come from a royal family . He will suddenly appear and gain control of the kingdom by treachery .
CEV	Daniel	11	22	Then he will destroy armies and remove God 's chosen high priest .
CEV	Daniel	11	23	He will make a treaty , but he will be deceitful and break it , even though he has only a few followers .
CEV	Daniel	11	24	Without warning , he will successfully invade a wealthy province , which is something his ancestors never did . Then he will divide among his followers all of its treasures and property . But none of this will last very long .
CEV	Daniel	11	25	He will gather a large and powerful army , and with great courage he will attack the king of the south . The king of the south will meet him with a much stronger army , but he will lose the battle , because he will be betrayed
CEV	Daniel	11	26	by members of the royal court . He will be ruined , and most of his army will be slaughtered .
CEV	Daniel	11	27	The two kings will meet around a table and tell evil lies to each other . But their plans will fail , because God has already decided what will happen .
CEV	Daniel	11	28	Then the king of the north will return to his country with great treasures . But on the way , he will attack the religion of God 's people and do whatever else he pleases .
CEV	Daniel	11	29	At the time God has decided , the king of the north will invade the southern kingdom again , but this time , things will be different .
CEV	Daniel	11	30	( B ) Ships from the west will come to attack him , and he will be discouraged . Then he will start back to his own country and take out his anger on the religion of God 's faithful people , while showing kindness to those who are unfaithful .
CEV	Daniel	11	31	( C ) He will send troops to pollute the temple and the fortress , and he will stop the daily sacrifices . Then he will set up that “ Horrible Thing ” that causes destruction .
CEV	Daniel	11	32	The king will use deceit to win followers from those who are unfaithful to God , but those who remain faithful will do everything possible to oppose him .
CEV	Daniel	11	33	Wise leaders will instruct many of the people . But for a while , some of these leaders will either be killed with swords or burned alive , or else robbed of their possessions and thrown into prison .
CEV	Daniel	11	34	They will receive only a little help in their time of trouble , and many of their followers will be treacherous .
CEV	Daniel	11	35	Some of those who are wise will suffer , so that God will make them pure and acceptable until the end , which will still come at the time he has decided .
CEV	Daniel	11	36	( D ) This king will do as he pleases . He will proudly claim to be greater than any god and will insult the only true God . Indeed , he will be successful until God is no longer angry with his people .
CEV	Daniel	11	37	This king will reject the gods his ancestors worshiped and the god preferred by women . [ d ] In fact , he will put himself above all gods

CEV	Daniel	12	8	I heard what the angel said , but I did n't understand . So I asked , “ Sir , how will it all end ? ” The angel in my vision then replied :
CEV	Daniel	12	9	Daniel , go about your business , because the meaning of this message will remain secret until the end of time .

CEV	Jonah	1	1	( A ) One day the Lord told Jonah , the son of Amittai ,
CEV	Jonah	1	2	to go to the great city of Nineveh [ a ] and say to the people , “ The Lord has seen your terrible sins . You are doomed ! ”
CEV	Jonah	1	3	Instead , Jonah ran from the Lord . He went to the seaport of Joppa and found a ship that was going to Spain . So he paid his fare , then got on the ship and sailed away to escape .
CEV	Jonah	1	4	But the Lord made a strong wind blow , and such a bad storm came up that the ship was about to be broken to pieces .
CEV	Jonah	1	5	The sailors were frightened , and they all started praying to their gods . They even threw the ship 's cargo overboard to make the ship lighter . All this time , Jonah was down below deck , sound asleep .
CEV	Jonah	1	6	The ship 's captain went to him and said , “ How can you sleep at a time like this ? Get up and pray to your God ! Maybe he will have pity on us and keep us from drowning. ”
CEV	Jonah	1	7	Finally , the sailors got together and said , “ Let 's ask our gods to show us [ b ] who caused all this trouble. ” It turned out to be Jonah .
CEV	Jonah	1	8	They started asking him , “ Are you the one who brought all this trouble on us ? What business are you in ? Where do you come from ? What is your country ? Who are your people ? ”
CEV	Jonah	1	9	Jonah answered , “ I 'm a Hebrew , and I worship the Lord God of heaven , who made the sea and the dry land. ”
CEV	Jonah	1	10	When the sailors heard this , they were frightened , because Jonah had already told them he was running from the Lord . Then they said , “ Do you know what you have done ? ”
CEV	Jonah	1	11	The storm kept getting worse , until finally the sailors asked him , “ What should we do with you to make the sea calm down ? ”
CEV	Jonah	1	12	Jonah told them , “ Throw me into the sea , and it will calm down . I 'm the cause of this terrible storm. ”
CEV	Jonah	1	13	The sailors tried their best to row to the shore . But they could not do it , and the storm kept getting worse every minute .
CEV	Jonah	1	14	So they prayed to the Lord , “ Please do n't let us drown for taking this man 's life . Do n't hold us guilty for killing an innocent man . All of this happened because you wanted it to. ”
CEV	Jonah	1	15	Then they threw Jonah overboard , and the sea calmed down .
CEV	Jonah	1	16	The sailors were so terrified that they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made all kinds of promises .

CEV	Jonah	4	5	Jonah then left through the east gate of the city and made a shelter to protect himself from the sun . He sat under the shelter , waiting to see what would happen to Nineveh .
CEV	Jonah	4	6	The Lord made a vine grow up to shade Jonah 's head and protect him from the sun . Jonah was very happy to have the vine ,
CEV	Jonah	4	7	but early the next morning the Lord sent a worm to chew on the vine , and the vine dried up .
CEV	Jonah	4	8	During the day the Lord sent a scorching wind , and the sun beat down on Jonah 's head , making him feel faint . Jonah was ready to die , and he shouted , “ I wish I were dead ! ”
CEV	Jonah	4	9	But the Lord asked , “ Jonah , do you have the right to be angry about the vine ? ” “ Yes , I do , ” he answered , “ and I 'm angry enough to die. ”
CEV	Jonah	4	10	But the Lord said : You are concerned about a vine that you did not plant or take care of , a vine that grew up in one night and died the next .
CEV	Jonah	4	11	In that city of Nineveh there are more than 120,000 people who can not tell right from wrong , and many cattle are also there . Do n't you think I should be concerned about that big city ? Copyright ©

CEV	Habakkuk	1	1	I am Habakkuk the prophet . And this is the message [ a ] that the Lord gave me . Habakkuk Complains to the Lord
CEV	Habakkuk	1	2	Our Lord , how long must I beg for your help before you listen ? How long before you save us from all this violence ?
CEV	Habakkuk	1	3	Why do you make me watch such terrible injustice ? Why do you allow violence , lawlessness , crime , and cruelty to spread everywhere ?
CEV	Habakkuk	1	4	Laws can not be enforced ; justice is always the loser ; criminals crowd out honest people and twist the laws around . The Lord Answers Habakkuk
CEV	Habakkuk	1	5	( A ) Look and be amazed at what 's happening among the nations ! Even if you were told , you would never believe what 's taking place now .
CEV	Habakkuk	1	6	( B ) I am sending the Babylonians . They are fierce and cruel— marching across the land , conquering cities and towns .
CEV	Habakkuk	1	7	How fearsome and frightening . Their only laws and rules are the ones they make up .
CEV	Habakkuk	1	8	Their cavalry troops are faster than leopards , more ferocious than wolves hunting at sunset , and swifter than hungry eagles suddenly swooping down .
CEV	Habakkuk	1	9	They are eager to destroy , [ b ] and they gather captives like handfuls of sand .
CEV	Habakkuk	1	10	They make fun of rulers and laugh at fortresses , while building dirt mounds so they can capture cities . [ c ]

CEV	Habakkuk	1	12	Holy Lord God , mighty rock , [ d ] you are eternal , and we [ e ] are safe from death . You are using those Babylonians to judge and punish others . [ f ]
CEV	Habakkuk	1	13	But you ca n't stand sin or wrong . So do n't sit by in silence while they gobble up people who are better than they are .
CEV	Habakkuk	1	14	The people you put on this earth are like fish or reptiles without a leader .
CEV	Habakkuk	1	15	Then an enemy comes along and takes them captive with hooks and nets . It makes him so happy
CEV	Habakkuk	1	16	that he offers sacrifices to his fishing nets , because they make him rich and provide choice foods .

CEV	Habakkuk	2	2	Then the Lord told me : “ I will give you my message in the form of a vision . Write it clearly enough to be read at a glance .

CEV	Habakkuk	2	5	Wine [ c ] is treacherous , and arrogant people are never satisfied . They are no less greedy than death itself— they open their mouths as wide as the world of the dead and swallow everyone .
CEV	Habakkuk	2	6	But they will be mocked with these words : You 're doomed ! You stored up stolen goods and cheated others of what belonged to them .
CEV	Habakkuk	2	7	But without warning , those you owe will demand payment . Then you will become a frightened victim .
CEV	Habakkuk	2	8	You robbed cities and nations everywhere on earth and murdered their people . Now those who survived will be as cruel to you .
CEV	Habakkuk	2	9	You 're doomed ! You made your family rich at the expense of others . You even said to yourself , “ I 'm above the law. ”

CEV	Habakkuk	2	15	You 're doomed ! You get your friends drunk , just to see them naked .
CEV	Habakkuk	2	16	Now you will be disgraced instead of praised . The Lord will make you drunk , and when others see you naked , you will lose their respect .
CEV	Habakkuk	2	17	You destroyed trees and animals on Mount Lebanon ; you were ruthless to towns and people everywhere . Now you will be terrorized . Idolatry Is Foolish
CEV	Habakkuk	2	18	What is an idol worth ? It 's merely a false god . Why trust a speechless image made from wood or metal by human hands ?
CEV	Habakkuk	2	19	What can you learn from idols covered with silver or gold ? They ca n't even breathe . Pity anyone who says to an idol of wood or stone , “ Get up and do something ! ”

CEV	Habakkuk	3	9	Your arrows were ready and obeyed your commands . [ e ] You split the earth apart with rivers and streams ;
CEV	Habakkuk	3	10	mountains trembled at the sight of you ; rain poured from the clouds ; ocean waves roared and rose .
CEV	Habakkuk	3	11	The sun and moon stood still , while your arrows and spears flashed like lightning .
CEV	Habakkuk	3	12	In your furious anger , you trampled on nations
CEV	Habakkuk	3	13	to rescue your people and save your chosen one . [ f ] You crushed a nation 's ruler and stripped his evil kingdom of its power . [ g ]
CEV	Habakkuk	3	14	His troops had come like a storm , hoping to scatter us and glad to gobble us up . To them we were refugees in hiding— but you smashed their heads with their own weapons . [ h ]
CEV	Habakkuk	3	15	Then your chariots churned the waters of the sea . Habakkuk 's Response to God 's Message

CEV	Haggai	1	6	You harvest less than you plant , you never have enough to eat or drink , your clothes do n't keep you warm , and your wages are stored in bags full of holes .
CEV	Haggai	1	7	Think about what I have said !
CEV	Haggai	1	8	But first , go to the hills and get wood for my temple , so I can take pride in it and be worshiped there .
CEV	Haggai	1	9	You expected much , but received only a little . And when you brought it home , I made that little disappear . Why have I done this ? It 's because you hurry off to build your own houses , while my temple is still in ruins .
CEV	Haggai	1	10	That 's also why the dew does n't fall and your harvest fails .
CEV	Haggai	1	11	And so , at my command everything will become barren—your farmland and pastures , your vineyards and olive trees , your animals and you yourselves . All your hard work will be for nothing .
CEV	Haggai	1	12	Zerubbabel and Joshua , together with the others who had returned from exile in Babylonia , obeyed the Lord 's message spoken by his prophet Haggai , and they started showing proper respect for the Lord .
CEV	Haggai	1	13	Haggai then told them that the Lord had promised to be with them .
CEV	Haggai	1	14	So the Lord God All-Powerful made everyone eager to work on his temple , especially Zerubbabel and Joshua .
CEV	Haggai	1	15	And the work began on the twenty-fourth day of that same month . Footnotes - 1.1 sixth month … king of Persia : Elul , the sixth month of the Hebrew calendar , from about mid-August to mid-September ; the second year of the rule of Darius was

CEV	Haggai	2	2	1-2 On the twenty-first day of the next month , [ a ] the Lord told Haggai the prophet to speak this message to Governor Zerubbabel , High Priest Joshua , and everyone else :
CEV	Haggai	2	3	( A ) Does anyone remember how glorious this temple used to be ? Now it looks like nothing .
CEV	Haggai	2	4	But cheer up ! Because I , the Lord All-Powerful , will be here to help you with the work ,
CEV	Haggai	2	5	( B ) just as I promised your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt . Do n't worry . My Spirit is [ b ] right here with you .
CEV	Haggai	2	6	( C ) Soon I will again shake the heavens and the earth , the sea and the dry land .
CEV	Haggai	2	7	I will shake the nations , and their treasures [ c ] will be brought here . Then the brightness of my glory will fill this temple .
CEV	Haggai	2	8	All silver and gold belong to me ,
CEV	Haggai	2	9	and I promise that this new temple will be more glorious than the first one . I will also bless this city [ d ] with peace . The Past and the Future
CEV	Haggai	2	10	, and when you wanted
CEV	Haggai	2	11	to ask the priests for their opinion on the following matters :
CEV	Haggai	2	12	Suppose meat ready to be sacrificed to God is being carried in the folds of someone 's clothing , and the clothing rubs against some bread or stew or wine or olive oil or any other food . Would those foods that were touched then become acceptable for sacrifice ? “ Of course not , ” the priests answered .
CEV	Haggai	2	13	( D ) Then Haggai said , “ Suppose someone has touched a dead body and is considered unacceptable to worship God . If that person touches these foods , would they become unclean ? ” “ Of course they would , ” the priests answered .
CEV	Haggai	2	14	So the Lord told Haggai to say : That 's how it is with this entire nation . Everything you do and every sacrifice you offer is unacceptable to me .
CEV	Haggai	2	15	But from now on , things will get better . Before you started laying the foundation for the temple ,
CEV	Haggai	2	16	you recalled what life was like in the past . [ f ] When you wanted
CEV	Haggai	2	200	kilograms of wheat , there were only
CEV	Haggai	2	50	jars of wine , there were only
CEV	Haggai	2	20	That same day the Lord spoke to Haggai again and said :
CEV	Haggai	2	17	I made all of your hard work useless by sending mildew , mold , and hail—but you still did not return to me , your Lord .
CEV	Haggai	2	18	Today you have completed the foundation for my temple , so listen to what your future will be like .
CEV	Haggai	2	19	Although you have not yet harvested any grain , grapes , figs , pomegranates , [ g ] or olives , I will richly bless you in the days ahead . God 's Promise to Zerubbabel
CEV	Haggai	2	21	Tell Governor Zerubbabel of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth
CEV	Haggai	2	22	and wipe out kings and their kingdoms . I will overturn war chariots , and then cavalry troops will start slaughtering each other .
CEV	Haggai	2	23	But tell my servant Zerubbabel that I , the Lord All-Powerful , have chosen him , and he will rule in my name .

CEV	Zechariah	1	4	Do n't be stubborn like your ancestors . They were warned by the earlier prophets [ b ] to give up their evil and turn back to me , but they paid no attention .
CEV	Zechariah	1	5	Where are your ancestors now ? Not even prophets live forever .
CEV	Zechariah	1	6	But my warnings and my words spoken by the prophets caught up with your ancestors . So they turned back to me and said , “ Lord All-Powerful , you have punished us for our sins , just as you had planned. ” First Vision : Horses and Riders 7-8 ( B ) On the twenty-fourth day of Shebat , [ c ] which was the eleventh month of that same year , [ d ] the Lord spoke to me in a vision during the night : In a valley among myrtle trees , [ e ] I saw someone on a red horse , with riders on red , brown , and white horses behind him .
CEV	Zechariah	1	9	An angel was there to explain things to me , and I asked , “ Sir , who are these riders ? ” “ I 'll tell you , ” the angel answered .
CEV	Zechariah	1	10	At once , the man standing among the myrtle trees said , “ These are the ones the Lord has sent to find out what 's happening on earth. ”
CEV	Zechariah	1	11	Then the riders spoke to the Lord 's angel , who was standing among the myrtle trees , and they said , “ We have gone everywhere and have discovered that the whole world is at peace. ”
CEV	Zechariah	1	12	At this , the angel said , “ Lord All-Powerful , for
CEV	Zechariah	1	70	years you have been angry with Jerusalem and the towns of Judah . When are you ever going to have mercy on them ? ”
CEV	Zechariah	1	13	The Lord 's answer was kind and comforting .
CEV	Zechariah	1	14	So the angel told me to announce : I , the Lord All-Powerful , am very protective of Jerusalem .
CEV	Zechariah	1	15	For a while I was angry at the nations , but now I am furious , because they have made things worse for Jerusalem and are not the least bit concerned .
CEV	Zechariah	1	16	And so , I will have pity on Jerusalem . The city will be completely rebuilt , and my temple will stand again .
CEV	Zechariah	1	17	I also promise that my towns will prosper—Jerusalem will once again be my chosen city , and I will comfort the people of Zion . Second Vision : Animal Horns
CEV	Zechariah	1	18	Next , I saw four animal horns . [ f ] 19-21 The angel who was sent to explain was there , and so I asked , “ What do these mean ? ” His answer was , “ These horns are the nations that scattered the people of Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem , and took away their freedom. ” Then the Lord showed me four blacksmiths , and I asked , “ What are they going to do ? ” He replied , “ They are going to terrify and crush those horns. ” Footnotes - 1.1 eighth month … second year … king of Persia : Bul , the eighth month of the Hebrew calendar , from about mid-October to mid-November ; the second year of the rule of Darius was

CEV	Zechariah	2	2	and I asked , “ Where are you going ? ” “ To measure Jerusalem , ” was the answer . “ To find out how wide and long it is. ”
CEV	Zechariah	2	3	The angel who had spoken to me came toward me , when another angel came up to him
CEV	Zechariah	2	4	and said , “ Hurry ! Tell that man with the measuring line that Jerusalem wo n't have any boundaries . It will be too full of people and animals even to have a wall .
CEV	Zechariah	2	5	The Lord himself has promised to be a protective wall of fire surrounding Jerusalem , and he will be its shining glory in the heart of the city. ” A Call to Action
CEV	Zechariah	2	6	The Lord says to his people , “ Run ! Escape from the land in the north , where I scattered you to the four winds .
CEV	Zechariah	2	7	Leave Babylonia and hurry back to Zion. ”
CEV	Zechariah	2	8	Then the glorious Lord All-Powerful ordered me to say to the nations that had raided and robbed Zion : Zion is as precious to the Lord as are his eyes . Whatever you do to Zion , you do to him .
CEV	Zechariah	2	9	And so , he will put you in the power of your slaves , and they will raid and rob you . Then you will know that I am a prophet of the Lord All-Powerful .
CEV	Zechariah	2	10	City of Zion , sing and celebrate ! The Lord has promised to come and live with you .
CEV	Zechariah	2	11	When he does , many nations will turn to him and become his people . At that time you will know that I am a prophet of the Lord All-Powerful .

CEV	Zechariah	3	3	Joshua 's clothes were filthy .
CEV	Zechariah	3	2	( B ) But the Lord said , “ Satan , you are wrong . Jerusalem is my chosen city , and this man was rescued like a stick from a flaming fire. ”
CEV	Zechariah	3	4	So the angel told some of the people to remove Joshua 's filthy clothes . Then he said to Joshua , “ This means you are forgiven . Now I will dress you in priestly clothes. ”
CEV	Zechariah	3	5	I spoke up and said , “ Also put a clean priestly turban on his head. ” Then they dressed him in priestly clothes and put the turban on him , while the Lord 's angel stood there watching .
CEV	Zechariah	3	6	After this , the angel encouraged Joshua by telling him that the Lord All-Powerful had promised :
CEV	Zechariah	3	7	If you truly obey me , I will put you in charge of my temple , including the courtyard around it , and you will be allowed to speak at any time with the angels standing beside me . [ a ]

CEV	Zechariah	4	4	But , sir , what do these mean ? ”
CEV	Zechariah	4	2	Then he asked , “ What do you see ? ” “ A solid gold lampstand with an oil container above it , ” I answered . “ On the stand are seven lamps , each with seven flames .
CEV	Zechariah	4	3	( A ) One olive tree is on the right side and another on the left of the oil container .
CEV	Zechariah	4	5	Then he asked , “ Do n't you know ? ” “ No sir , ” I replied .
CEV	Zechariah	4	6	( B ) So the angel explained that it was the following message of the Lord to Zerubbabel : [ a ] I am the Lord All-Powerful . So do n't depend on your own power or strength , but on my Spirit .
CEV	Zechariah	4	7	Zerubbabel , that mountain in front of you will be leveled to the ground . Then you will bring out the temple 's most important stone and shout , “ God has been very kind. ” [ b ]
CEV	Zechariah	4	8	The Lord spoke to me again and said :
CEV	Zechariah	4	9	Zerubbabel laid the foundation for the temple , and he will complete it . Then everyone will know that you were sent by me , the Lord All-Powerful .
CEV	Zechariah	4	10	( C ) Those who have made fun of this day of small beginnings will celebrate when they see Zerubbabel holding this important stone . [ c ] Those seven lamps represent my eyes—the eyes of the Lord—and they see everything on this earth .
CEV	Zechariah	4	11	( D ) Then I asked the angel , “ What about the olive trees on each side of the lampstand ? What do they represent ?
CEV	Zechariah	4	12	And what is the meaning of the two branches from which golden olive oil [ d ] flows through the two gold pipes ? ”
CEV	Zechariah	4	13	“ Do n't you know ? ” he asked . “ No sir , I do n't , ” was my answer .

CEV	Zechariah	5	5	Now the angel who was there to explain the visions came over and said , “ Look up and tell me what you see coming. ”
CEV	Zechariah	5	2	and the angel asked , “ What do you see ? ” “ A flying scroll , ” I answered . “ About nine meters long and four and a half meters wide. ”
CEV	Zechariah	5	3	Then he told me : This scroll puts a curse on everyone in the land who steals or tells lies . The writing on one side tells about the destruction of those who steal , while the writing on the other side tells about the destruction of those who lie .
CEV	Zechariah	5	4	The Lord All-Powerful has said , “ I am sending this scroll into the house of everyone who is a robber or tells lies in my name , and it will remain there until every piece of wood and stone in that house crumbles. ” Seventh Vision : A Woman in a Basket
CEV	Zechariah	5	6	“ I do n't know what it is , ” was my reply . “ It 's a big basket , ” he said . “ And it shows what everyone in the land has in mind. ” [ b ]
CEV	Zechariah	5	7	The lead cover of the basket was opened , and in the basket was a woman .
CEV	Zechariah	5	8	“ This woman represents evil , ” the angel explained . Then he threw her back into the basket and slammed the heavy cover down tight .
CEV	Zechariah	5	9	Right after this I saw two women coming through the sky with wings outstretched like a stork in the wind . Suddenly they lifted the basket into the air ,
CEV	Zechariah	5	10	and I asked the angel , “ Where are they taking the basket ? ”

CEV	Zechariah	9	11	( F ) When I made a sacred agreement with you , my people , we sealed it with blood . [ h ] Now some of you are captives in waterless pits , but I will come to your rescue

CEV	Zechariah	10	10	I will bring them home from Egypt and Assyria , then let them settle as far as Gilead and Lebanon , until the land overflows with them .
CEV	Zechariah	10	2	( A ) You ca n't believe idols and fortunetellers , or depend on the hope you receive from witchcraft and interpreters of dreams . But you have tried all of these , and now you are like sheep without a shepherd .
CEV	Zechariah	10	3	I , the Lord All-Powerful , am fiercely angry with you leaders , and I will punish you . I care for my people , the nation of Judah , and I will change this flock of sheep into charging war horses .
CEV	Zechariah	10	4	From this flock will come leaders who will be strong like cornerstones and tent pegs and weapons of war .
CEV	Zechariah	10	5	They will join in the fighting , and together they will trample their enemies like mud . They will fight , because I , the Lord , will be on their side . And they will crush the enemy cavalry .
CEV	Zechariah	10	6	I will strengthen the kingdoms of Judah and Israel . [ a ] And I will show mercy because I am the Lord , their God . I will answer their prayers and bring them home . Then it will seem as though I had never rejected them .
CEV	Zechariah	10	7	Israel [ b ] will be like a tribe of warriors celebrating with wine . When their children see this , they will also be happy because of me , the Lord .

CEV	Zechariah	11	11	The sheep dealers who saw me knew at once that this was a message from the Lord . 12-13 ( A ) I told them , “ Pay me my wages , if you think you should ; otherwise , forget it. ” So they handed me my wages , a measly
CEV	Zechariah	11	2	Cry , you cypress trees ! The glorious cedars have fallen and are rotting . Cry , you oak trees of Bashan ! The dense forest has been chopped down .
CEV	Zechariah	11	3	Listen ! Shepherds are crying . Their glorious pastures have been ruined . Listen ! Lions are roaring . The forests of the Jordan Valley are no more to be found . Worthless Shepherds
CEV	Zechariah	11	4	The Lord my God said to me : Tend those sheep doomed for slaughter !
CEV	Zechariah	11	5	The people who buy and butcher them go unpunished , while everyone who sells them says , “ Praise the Lord ! I 'm rich. ” Not even their shepherds have pity on them .
CEV	Zechariah	11	6	Tend those sheep because I , the Lord , will no longer have pity on the people of this earth . I 'll turn neighbor against neighbor and make them slaves of a king . They will bring disaster on the earth , and I 'll do nothing to rescue any of them .
CEV	Zechariah	11	7	So I became a shepherd of those sheep doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep dealers . [ a ] And I gave names to the two sticks I used for tending the sheep : One of them was named “ Mercy ” and the other “ Unity. ”
CEV	Zechariah	11	8	In less than a month , I became impatient with three shepherds who did n't like me , and I got rid of them .
CEV	Zechariah	11	9	Then I said , “ I refuse to be your shepherd . Let the sheep that are going to die , go on and die , and those that are going to be destroyed , go on and be destroyed . Then let the others eat one another alive. ”
CEV	Zechariah	11	10	On that same day , I broke the stick named “ Mercy ” to show that the Lord had canceled his agreement with all people .
CEV	Zechariah	11	30	pieces of silver . Then the Lord said , “ Throw the money into the treasury. ” [ b ] So I threw the money into the treasury at the Lord 's temple .
CEV	Zechariah	11	14	Then I broke the stick named “ Unity ” and canceled the ties between Judah and Israel .
CEV	Zechariah	11	15	Next , the Lord said to me , “ Act like a shepherd again—this time a worthless shepherd .
CEV	Zechariah	11	16	Once more I am going to let a worthless nobody rule the land—one who wo n't care for the strays or search for the young or heal the sick or feed the healthy . He will just dine on the fattest sheep , leaving nothing but a few bones. ”
CEV	Zechariah	11	17	You worthless shepherd , deserting the sheep ! I hope a sword will cripple your arm and blind your right eye . Copyright ©

CEV	Zechariah	12	2	I have decided that Jerusalem will become a bowl of wine that makes the neighboring nations drunk . And when Jerusalem is attacked , Judah will also be attacked . [ a ]
CEV	Zechariah	12	3	But I will turn Jerusalem into a heavy stone that crushes anyone who tries to lift it . When all nations on earth surround Jerusalem ,
CEV	Zechariah	12	4	I will blind every horse and make them panic , and every rider will be confused . But at the same time , I will watch over Judah .
CEV	Zechariah	12	5	Then every clan in Judah will realize that I , the Lord All-Powerful , am their God , and that I am the source of their strength .
CEV	Zechariah	12	6	At that time I will let the clans of Judah be like a ball of fire in a wood pile or a fiery torch in a hay stack . Then Judah will send the surrounding nations up in smoke . And once again the city of Jerusalem will be filled with people .
CEV	Zechariah	12	7	But I will first give victory to Judah , so the kingdom of David and the city of Jerusalem in all of their glory wo n't be thought of more highly than Judah itself .
CEV	Zechariah	12	8	I , the Lord God , will protect Jerusalem . Even the weakest person there will be as strong as David , and David 's kingdom will rule as though my very own angel were its leader .
CEV	Zechariah	12	9	I am determined to wipe out every nation that attacks Jerusalem . Mourning for the One Pierced with a Spear
CEV	Zechariah	12	10	( A ) I , the Lord , will make the descendants of David and the people of Jerusalem feel deep sorrow and pray when they see the one they pierced with a spear . They will mourn and weep for him , as parents weep over the death of their only child or their first-born .

CEV	Zechariah	13	2	The Lord All-Powerful says : When that time comes , I will get rid of every idol in the country , and they will be forgotten forever . I will also do away with their prophets and those evil spirits that control them .
CEV	Zechariah	13	3	If any such prophets ever appear again , their own parents must warn them that they will die for telling lies in my name—the name of the Lord . If those prophets do n't stop speaking , their parents must then kill them with a sword .
CEV	Zechariah	13	4	Those prophets will be ashamed of their so-called visions , and they wo n't deceive anyone by dressing like a true prophet .
CEV	Zechariah	13	5	Instead , they will say , “ I 'm no prophet . I 've been a farmer all my life. ” [ a ]
CEV	Zechariah	13	6	And if any of them are asked why they are wounded , [ b ] they will answer , “ It happened at the house of some friends. ” A Wounded Shepherd and Scattered Sheep
CEV	Zechariah	13	7	( A ) The Lord All-Powerful said : My sword , wake up ! Attack my shepherd and friend . Strike down the shepherd ! Scatter the little sheep , and I will destroy them .
CEV	Zechariah	13	8	Nowhere in the land will more than a third of them be left alive .
CEV	Zechariah	13	9	Then I will purify them and put them to the test , just as gold and silver are purified and tested . They will pray in my name , and I will answer them . I will say , “ You are my people , ” and they will reply , “ You , Lord , are our God ! ” Copyright ©

CEV	Zechariah	14	4	He will take his stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem , and the mountain will split in half , forming a wide valley that runs from east to west .
CEV	Zechariah	14	5	Then you people will escape from the Lord 's mountain , through this valley , which reaches to Azal . [ a ] You will run in all directions , just as everyone did when the earthquake struck [ b ] in the time of King Uzziah of Judah . Afterwards , the Lord my God will appear with his holy angels .
CEV	Zechariah	14	6	It will be a bright day that wo n't turn cloudy or cold . [ c ]
CEV	Zechariah	14	7	And the Lord has decided when it will happen—this time of unending day .
CEV	Zechariah	14	8	( A ) In both summer and winter , life-giving streams will flow from Jerusalem , half of them to the Dead Sea in the east and half to the Mediterranean Sea in the west .
CEV	Zechariah	14	9	Then there will be only one Lord who rules as King and whose name is worshiped everywhere on earth . 10-11 ( B ) From Geba down to Rimmon [ d ] south of Jerusalem , the entire country will be turned into flatlands , with Jerusalem still towering above . Then the city will be full of people , from Benjamin Gate , Old Gate Place , and Hananel Tower in the northeast part of the city over to Corner Gate in the northwest and down to King 's Wine Press in the south . Jerusalem will always be secure and will never again be destroyed .
CEV	Zechariah	14	12	Here is what the Lord will do to those who attack Jerusalem : While they are standing there , he will make their flesh rot and their eyes fall from their sockets and their tongues drop out .
CEV	Zechariah	14	13	The Lord will make them go into a frenzy and start attacking each other , 14-15 until even the people of Judah turn against those in Jerusalem . [ e ] This same terrible disaster will also strike every animal nearby , including horses , mules , camels , and donkeys . Finally , everything of value in the surrounding nations will be collected and brought to Jerusalem—gold , silver , and piles of clothing .

In fact , every ordinary cooking pot in Jerusalem will be just as sacred to the Lord All-Powerful as the bowls used at the altar .

CEV	Malachi	1	1	I am Malachi . And this is the message that the Lord gave me for Israel . The Lord 's Love for Israel
CEV	Malachi	1	2	( A ) ( B ) Israel , I , the Lord , have loved you . And yet you ask in what way have I loved you . Do n't forget that Esau was the brother of your ancestor Jacob , but I chose Jacob
CEV	Malachi	1	3	instead of Esau . And I turned Esau 's hill country into a barren desert where jackals [ a ] roam .
CEV	Malachi	1	4	Esau 's descendants may say , “ Although our nation Edom is in ruins , we will rebuild it. ” But I , the Lord All-Powerful , promise to tear down whatever they build . Then everyone will know that I will never stop being angry with them as long as they are so sinful .
CEV	Malachi	1	5	Israel , when you see this , you will shout , “ The Lord 's great reputation reaches beyond our borders. ” Judgment against Priests
CEV	Malachi	1	6	I , the Lord All-Powerful , have something to say to you priests . Children respect their fathers , and servants respect their masters . I am your father and your master , so why do n't you respect me ? You priests have insulted me , and now you ask , “ How did we insult you ? ”
CEV	Malachi	1	7	You embarrass me by offering worthless food on my altar . Then you ask , “ How have we embarrassed you ? ” You have done it by saying , “ What 's so great about the Lord 's altar ? ”
CEV	Malachi	1	8	( C ) But is n't it wrong to offer animals that are blind , lame , or sick ? Just try giving those animals to your governor . That certainly would n't please him or make him want to help you .
CEV	Malachi	1	9	I am the Lord God All-Powerful , and you had better try to please me . You have sinned . Now see if I will have mercy on any of you .
CEV	Malachi	1	10	I wish someone would lock the doors of my temple , so you would stop wasting time building fires on my altar . I am not pleased with you priests , and I refuse to accept any more of your offerings .
CEV	Malachi	1	11	From dawn until dusk my name is praised by every nation on this earth , as they burn incense and offer the proper sacrifices to me .
CEV	Malachi	1	12	But even you priests insult me by saying , “ There 's nothing special about the Lord 's altar , and these sacrifices are worthless. ”
CEV	Malachi	1	13	You get so disgusted that you even make vulgar signs at me . [ b ] And for an offering , you bring stolen [ c ] animals or those that are lame or sick . Should I accept these ?
CEV	Malachi	1	14	Instead of offering the acceptable animals you have promised , you bring me those that are unhealthy . I will punish you for this , because I am the great King , the Lord All-Powerful , and I am worshiped by nations everywhere . Copyright ©

CEV	Malachi	2	2	You had better take seriously the need to honor my name . Otherwise , when you give a blessing , I will turn it into a curse . In fact , I have already done this , because you have n't taken to heart your duties as priests .
CEV	Malachi	2	3	I will punish your descendants and rub your faces in the manure from your animal sacrifices , and then be done with you . [ a ]
CEV	Malachi	2	4	( A ) I am telling you this , so I can continue to keep my agreement with your ancestor Levi .
CEV	Malachi	2	5	( B ) I blessed him with a full life , as I had promised , and he kept his part of the agreement by honoring me and respecting my name .
CEV	Malachi	2	6	He taught the truth and never told lies , and he led a lot of people to turn from sin , because he obeyed me and lived right .
CEV	Malachi	2	7	You priests should be eager to spread knowledge , and everyone should come to you for instruction , because you speak for me , the Lord All-Powerful .
CEV	Malachi	2	8	But you have turned your backs on me . Your teachings have led others to do sinful things , and you have broken the agreement I made with your ancestor Levi .
CEV	Malachi	2	9	So I caused everyone to hate and despise you , because you disobeyed me and failed to treat all people alike . A Broken Agreement
CEV	Malachi	2	10	Do n't you know that we all have God as our Father ? Did n't the one God create each of us ? Then why do you cheat each other by breaking the agreement God made with your ancestors ?
CEV	Malachi	2	11	You people in Judah and Jerusalem have been unfaithful to the Lord . You have disgraced the temple that he loves , and you have committed the disgusting sin of marrying the worshipers of other gods .
CEV	Malachi	2	12	I pray that the Lord will no longer let those who are guilty belong to his people , even if they eagerly decide to offer the Lord a gift . [ b ]
CEV	Malachi	2	13	And what else are you doing ? You cry noisily and flood the Lord 's altar with your tears , because he is n't pleased with your offerings and refuses to accept them .
CEV	Malachi	2	14	And why is n't God pleased ? It 's because he knows that each of you men has been unfaithful to the wife you married when you were young . You promised that she would be your partner , but now you have broken that promise .
CEV	Malachi	2	15	Did n't God create you and your wife to become like one person ? [ c ] And why did he do this ? It was so you would have children , and then lead them to become God 's people . Do n't ever be unfaithful to your wife .
CEV	Malachi	2	16	The Lord God All-Powerful of Israel hates anyone who is cruel enough to divorce his wife . So take care never to be unfaithful !
CEV	Malachi	2	17	You have worn out the Lord with your words . And yet , you ask , “ How did we do that ? ” You did it by saying , “ The Lord is pleased with evil and does n't care about justice. ” Copyright ©

CEV	Malachi	3	3	The Lord will purify the descendants of Levi , [ a ] as though they were gold or silver . Then they will bring the proper offerings to the Lord ,

CEV	Malachi	3	4	and the offerings of the people of Judah and Jerusalem will please him , just as they did in the past . Do n't Cheat God
CEV	Malachi	3	5	The Lord All-Powerful said : I 'm now on my way to judge you . And I will quickly condemn all who practice witchcraft or cheat in marriage or tell lies in court or rob workers of their pay or mistreat widows and orphans or steal the property of foreigners or refuse to respect me .
CEV	Malachi	3	6	( C ) Descendants of Jacob , I am the Lord All-Powerful , and I never change . That 's why you have n't been wiped out ,
CEV	Malachi	3	7	even though you have ignored and disobeyed my laws ever since the time of your ancestors . But if you return to me , I will return to you . And yet you ask , “ How can we return ? ”
CEV	Malachi	3	8	You people are robbing me , your God . And , here you are , asking , “ How are we robbing you ? ” You are robbing me of the offerings and of the ten percent that belongs to me . [ b ]
CEV	Malachi	3	9	That 's why your whole nation is under a curse .
CEV	Malachi	3	10	( D ) I am the Lord All-Powerful , and I challenge you to put me to the test . Bring the entire ten percent into the storehouse , so there will be food in my house . Then I will open the windows of heaven and flood you with blessing after blessing . [ c ]
CEV	Malachi	3	11	I will also stop locusts [ d ] from destroying your crops and keeping your vineyards from producing .
CEV	Malachi	3	12	Everyone of every nation will talk about how I have blessed you and about your wonderful land . I , the Lord All-Powerful , have spoken !
CEV	Malachi	3	13	You have said horrible things about me , and yet you ask , “ What have we said ? ”
CEV	Malachi	3	14	Here is what you have said : “ It 's foolish to serve the Lord God All-Powerful . What do we get for obeying God and from going around looking sad ?
CEV	Malachi	3	15	See how happy those arrogant people are . Everyone who does wrong is successful , and when they put God to the test , they always get away with it. ” Faithfulness Is Rewarded
CEV	Malachi	3	16	All those who truly respected the Lord and honored his name started discussing these things , and when God saw what was happening , he had their names [ e ] written as a reminder in his book .
CEV	Malachi	3	17	Then the Lord All-Powerful said : You people are precious to me , and when I come to bring justice , I will protect you , just as parents protect an obedient child .
