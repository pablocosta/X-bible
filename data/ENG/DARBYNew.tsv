DARBY	Matthew	1	1	Book of the generation of Jesus Christ , Son of David , Son of Abraham .
DARBY	Matthew	1	2	Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob , and Jacob begat Juda and his brethren ;
DARBY	Matthew	1	3	and Juda begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom , and Esrom begat Aram ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	4	and Aram begat Aminadab , and Aminadab begat Naasson , and Naasson begat Salmon ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	5	and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	6	and Jesse begat David the king . And David begat Solomon , of her [ that had been the wife ] of Urias ;
DARBY	Matthew	1	7	and Solomon begat Roboam , and Roboam begat Abia , and Abia begat Asa ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	8	and Asa begat Josaphat , and Josaphat begat Joram , and Joram begat Ozias ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	9	and Ozias begat Joatham , and Joatham begat Achaz , and Achaz begat Ezekias ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	10	and Ezekias begat Manasses , and Manasses begat Amon , and Amon begat Josias ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	11	and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , at the time of the carrying away of Babylon .
DARBY	Matthew	1	12	And after the carrying away of Babylon , Jechonias begat Salathiel , and Salathiel begat Zorobabel ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	13	and Zorobabel begat Abiud , and Abiud begat Eliakim , and Eliakim begat Azor ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	14	and Azor begat Sadoc , and Sadoc begat Achim , and Achim begat Eliud ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	15	and Eliud begat Eliazar , and Eliazar begat Matthan , and Matthan begat Jacob ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	16	and Jacob begat Joseph , the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
DARBY	Matthew	1	17	All the generations , therefore , from Abraham to David [ were ] fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away of Babylon , fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the Christ , fourteen generations .
DARBY	Matthew	1	18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus : His mother , Mary , that is , having been betrothed to Joseph , before they came together , she was found to be with child of [ the ] Holy Spirit .
DARBY	Matthew	1	19	But Joseph , her husband , being [ a ] righteous [ man ] , and unwilling to expose her publicly , purposed to have put her away secretly ;
DARBY	Matthew	1	20	but while he pondered on these things , behold , an angel of [ the ] Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , Joseph , son of David , fear not to take to [ thee ] Mary , thy wife , for that which is begotten in her is of [ the ] Holy Spirit .
DARBY	Matthew	1	21	And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus , for * he * shall save his people from their sins .
DARBY	Matthew	1	22	Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [ the ] Lord , through the prophet , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	23	Behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which is , being interpreted , 'God with us . '
DARBY	Matthew	1	24	But Joseph , having awoke up from his sleep , did as the angel of [ the ] Lord had enjoined him , and took to [ him ] his wife ,
DARBY	Matthew	1	25	and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name Jesus .
DARBY	Matthew	2	2	Where is the king of the Jews that has been born ? for we have seen his star in the east , and have come to do him homage .
DARBY	Matthew	2	3	But Herod the king having heard [ of it ] , was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him ;
DARBY	Matthew	2	4	and , assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where the Christ should be born .
DARBY	Matthew	2	5	And they said to him , In Bethlehem of Judaea ; for thus it is written through the prophet :
DARBY	Matthew	2	6	And * thou * Bethlehem , land of Juda , art in no wise the least among the governors of Juda ; for out of thee shall go forth a leader who shall shepherd my people Israel .
DARBY	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod , having secretly called the magi , inquired of them accurately the time of the star that was appearing ;
DARBY	Matthew	2	8	and having sent them to Bethlehem , said , Go , search out accurately concerning the child , and when ye shall have found [ him ] bring me back word , so that * I * also may come and do him homage .
DARBY	Matthew	2	9	And they having heard the king went their way ; and lo , the star , which they had seen in the east , went before them until it came and stood over the place where the little child was .
DARBY	Matthew	2	10	And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
DARBY	Matthew	2	11	And having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother , and falling down did him homage . And having opened their treasures , they offered to him gifts , gold , and frankincense , and myrrh .
DARBY	Matthew	2	12	And being divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
DARBY	Matthew	2	13	Now , they having departed , behold , an angel of [ the ] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph , saying , Arise , take to [ thee ] the little child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and be there until I shall tell thee ; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it .
DARBY	Matthew	2	14	And , having arisen , he took to [ him ] the little child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt .
DARBY	Matthew	2	15	And he was there until the death of Herod , that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [ the ] Lord through the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
DARBY	Matthew	2	16	Then Herod , seeing that he had been mocked by the magi , was greatly enraged ; and sent and slew all the boys which [ were ] in Bethlehem , and in all its borders , from two years and under , according to the time which he had accurately inquired from the magi .
DARBY	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	2	18	A voice has been heard in Rama , weeping , and great lamentation : Rachel weeping [ for ] her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
DARBY	Matthew	2	19	But Herod having died , behold , an angel of [ the ] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	2	20	Arise , take to [ thee ] the little child and its mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they who sought the life of the little child are dead .
DARBY	Matthew	2	21	And he arose and took to [ him ] the little child and its mother , and came into the land of Israel ;
DARBY	Matthew	2	22	but having heard that 'Archelaus reigns over Judaea , instead of Herod his father , ' he was afraid to go there ; and having been divinely instructed in a dream , he went away into the parts of Galilee ,
DARBY	Matthew	2	23	and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth ; so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets , He shall be called a Nazaraean .
DARBY	Matthew	3	3	For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet , saying , Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness : prepare ye the way of [ the ] Lord , make straight his paths .
DARBY	Matthew	3	2	and saying , Repent , for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh .
DARBY	Matthew	3	4	And John himself had his garment of camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins , and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey .
DARBY	Matthew	3	5	Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the country round the Jordan ,
DARBY	Matthew	3	6	and were baptised by him in the Jordan , confessing their sins .
DARBY	Matthew	3	7	But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism , he said to them , Offspring of vipers , who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
DARBY	Matthew	3	8	Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance .
DARBY	Matthew	3	9	And do not think to say within yourselves , We have Abraham for [ our ] father ; for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham .
DARBY	Matthew	3	10	And already the axe is applied to the root of the trees ; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire .
DARBY	Matthew	3	11	* I * indeed baptise you with water to repentance , but he that comes after me is mightier than I , whose sandals I am not fit to bear ; * he * shall baptise you with [ the ] Holy Spirit and fire ;
DARBY	Matthew	3	12	whose winnowing fan [ is ] in his hand , and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor , and shall gather his wheat into the garner , but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
DARBY	Matthew	3	13	Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John , to be baptised of him ;
DARBY	Matthew	3	14	but John urgently forbad him , saying , * I * have need to be baptised of thee ; and comest * thou * to me ?
DARBY	Matthew	3	15	But Jesus answering said to him , Suffer [ it ] now ; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . Then he suffers him .
DARBY	Matthew	3	16	And Jesus , having been baptised , went up straightway from the water , and lo , the heavens were opened to him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming upon him :
DARBY	Matthew	3	17	and behold , a voice out of the heavens saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I have found my delight .
DARBY	Matthew	4	4	But he answering said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word which goes out through God 's mouth .
DARBY	Matthew	4	2	and having fasted forty days and forty nights , afterwards he hungered .
DARBY	Matthew	4	3	And the tempter coming up to him said , If thou be Son of God , speak , that these stones may become loaves of bread .
DARBY	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil takes him to the holy city , and sets him upon the edge of the temple ,
DARBY	Matthew	4	6	and says to him , If thou be Son of God cast thyself down ; for it is written , He shall give charge to his angels concerning thee , and on [ their ] hands shall they bear thee , lest in anywise thou strike thy foot against a stone .
DARBY	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said to him , It is again written , Thou shalt not tempt [ the ] Lord thy God .
DARBY	Matthew	4	8	Again the devil takes him to a very high mountain , and shews him all the kingdoms of the world , and their glory ,
DARBY	Matthew	4	9	and says to him , All these things will I give thee if , falling down , thou wilt do me homage .
DARBY	Matthew	4	10	Then says Jesus to him , Get thee away , Satan , for it is written , Thou shalt do homage to [ the ] Lord thy God , and him alone shalt thou serve .
DARBY	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil leaves him , and behold , angels came and ministered to him .
DARBY	Matthew	4	12	But having heard that John was delivered up , he departed into Galilee :
DARBY	Matthew	4	13	and having left Nazareth , he went and dwelt at Capernaum , which is on the sea-side in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthalim ,
DARBY	Matthew	4	14	that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	4	15	Land of Zabulon and land of Nepthalim , way of [ the ] sea beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the nations :
DARBY	Matthew	4	16	—the people sitting in darkness has seen a great light , and to those sitting in [ the ] country and shadow of death , to them has light sprung up .
DARBY	Matthew	4	17	From that time began Jesus to preach and to say , Repent , for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh .
DARBY	Matthew	4	18	And walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea , for they were fishers ;
DARBY	Matthew	4	19	and he says to them , Come after me , and I will make you fishers of men .
DARBY	Matthew	4	20	And they , having left their trawl-nets , immediately followed him .
DARBY	Matthew	4	21	And going on thence he saw other two brothers , James the [ son ] of Zebedee and John his brother , in the ship with Zebedee their father , mending their trawl-nets , and he called them ;
DARBY	Matthew	4	22	and they , having left the ship and their father , immediately followed him .
DARBY	Matthew	4	23	And [ Jesus ] went round the whole [ of ] Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people .
DARBY	Matthew	4	24	And his fame went out into the whole [ of ] Syria , and they brought to him all that were ill , suffering under various diseases and pains , and those possessed by demons , and lunatics , and paralytics ; and he healed them .
DARBY	Matthew	4	25	And great crowds followed him from Galilee , and Decapolis , and Jerusalem , and Judaea , and beyond the Jordan .
DARBY	Matthew	5	5	Blessed the meek , for * they * shall inherit the earth .
DARBY	Matthew	5	2	and , having opened his mouth , he taught them , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	5	3	Blessed [ are ] the poor in spirit , for * theirs * is the kingdom of the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	5	4	Blessed they that mourn , for * they * shall be comforted .
DARBY	Matthew	5	6	Blessed they who hunger and thirst after righteousness , for * they * shall be filled .
DARBY	Matthew	5	7	Blessed the merciful , for * they * shall find mercy .
DARBY	Matthew	5	8	Blessed the pure in heart , for * they * shall see God .
DARBY	Matthew	5	9	Blessed the peace-makers , for * they * shall be called sons of God .
DARBY	Matthew	5	10	Blessed they who are persecuted on account of righteousness , for * theirs * is the kingdom of the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	5	11	Blessed are ye when they may reproach and persecute you , and say every wicked thing against you , lying , for my sake .
DARBY	Matthew	5	12	Rejoice and exult , for your reward is great in the heavens ; for thus have they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
DARBY	Matthew	5	13	* Ye * are the salt of the earth ; but if the salt have become insipid , wherewith shall it be salted ? It is no longer fit for anything but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot by men .
DARBY	Matthew	5	14	* Ye * are the light of the world : a city situated on the top of a mountain can not be hid .
DARBY	Matthew	5	15	Nor do [ men ] light a lamp and put it under the bushel , but upon the lamp-stand , and it shines for all who are in the house .
DARBY	Matthew	5	16	Let your light thus shine before men , so that they may see your upright works , and glorify your Father who is in the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	5	17	Think not that I am come to make void the law or the prophets ; I am not come to make void , but to fulfil .
DARBY	Matthew	5	18	For verily I say unto you , Until the heaven and the earth pass away , one iota or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all come to pass .
DARBY	Matthew	5	19	Whosoever then shall do away with one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens ; but whosoever shall practise and teach [ them ] , * he * shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	5	20	For I say unto you , that unless your righteousness surpass [ that ] of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	5	21	Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients , Thou shalt not kill ; but whosoever shall kill shall be subject to the judgment .
DARBY	Matthew	5	22	But * I * say unto you , that every one that is lightly angry with his brother shall be subject to the judgment ; but whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be subject to [ be called before ] the sanhedrim ; but whosoever shall say , Fool , shall be subject to the penalty of the hell of fire .
DARBY	Matthew	5	23	If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar , and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee ,
DARBY	Matthew	5	24	leave there thy gift before the altar , and first go , be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
DARBY	Matthew	5	25	Make friends with thine adverse party quickly , whilst thou art in the way with him ; lest some time the adverse party deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
DARBY	Matthew	5	26	Verily I say to thee , Thou shalt in no wise come out thence till thou hast paid the last farthing .
DARBY	Matthew	5	27	Ye have heard that it has been said , Thou shalt not commit adultery .
DARBY	Matthew	5	28	But * I * say unto you , that every one who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
DARBY	Matthew	5	29	But if thy right eye be a snare to thee , pluck it out and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish , and not thy whole body be cast into hell .
DARBY	Matthew	5	30	And if thy right hand be a snare to thee , cut it off and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish , and not thy whole body be cast into hell .
DARBY	Matthew	5	31	It has been said too , Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a letter of divorce .
DARBY	Matthew	5	32	But * I * say unto you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , except for cause of fornication , makes her commit adultery , and whosoever marries one that is put away commits adultery .
DARBY	Matthew	5	33	Again , ye have heard that it has been said to the ancients , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt render to the Lord what thou hast sworn .
DARBY	Matthew	5	34	But * I * say unto you , Do not swear at all ; neither by the heaven , because it is [ the ] throne of God ;
DARBY	Matthew	5	35	nor by the earth , because it is [ the ] footstool of his feet ; nor by Jerusalem , because it is [ the ] city of the great King .
DARBY	Matthew	5	36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
DARBY	Matthew	5	37	But let your word be Yea , yea ; Nay , nay ; but what is more than these is from evil .
DARBY	Matthew	5	38	Ye have heard that it has been said , Eye for eye and tooth for tooth .
DARBY	Matthew	5	39	But * I * say unto you , not to resist evil ; but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek , turn to him also the other ;
DARBY	Matthew	5	40	and to him that would go to law with thee and take thy body coat , leave him thy cloak also .
DARBY	Matthew	5	41	And whoever will compel thee to go one mile , go with him two .
DARBY	Matthew	5	42	To him that asks of thee give , and from him that desires to borrow of thee turn not away .
DARBY	Matthew	5	43	Ye have heard that it has been said , Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy .
DARBY	Matthew	5	44	But * I * say unto you , Love your enemies , [ bless those who curse you , ] do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who [ insult you and ] persecute you ,
DARBY	Matthew	5	45	that ye may be [ the ] sons of your Father who is in [ the ] heavens ; for he makes his sun rise on evil and good , and sends rain on just and unjust .
DARBY	Matthew	5	46	For if ye should love those who love you , what reward have ye ? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same ?
DARBY	Matthew	5	47	And if ye should salute your brethren only , what do ye extraordinary ? Do not also the Gentiles the same ?
DARBY	Matthew	5	48	Be * ye * therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect .
DARBY	Matthew	6	6	But * thou * , when thou prayest , enter into thy chamber , and having shut thy door , pray to thy Father who is in secret , and thy Father who sees in secret will render [ it ] to thee .
DARBY	Matthew	6	2	When therefore thou doest alms , sound not a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , so that they may have glory from men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
DARBY	Matthew	6	3	But thou , when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does ;
DARBY	Matthew	6	4	so that thine alms may be in secret , and thy Father who sees in secret will render [ it ] to thee .
DARBY	Matthew	6	5	And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites ; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets so that they should appear to men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
DARBY	Matthew	6	7	But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as those who are of the nations : for they think they shall be heard through their much speaking .
DARBY	Matthew	6	8	Be not ye therefore like them , for your Father knows of what things ye have need before ye beg [ anything ] of him .
DARBY	Matthew	6	9	Thus therefore pray * ye * : Our Father who art in the heavens , let thy name be sanctified ,
DARBY	Matthew	6	10	let thy kingdom come , let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth ;
DARBY	Matthew	6	11	give us to-day our needed bread ,
DARBY	Matthew	6	12	and forgive us our debts , as we also forgive our debtors ,
DARBY	Matthew	6	13	and lead us not into temptation , but save us from evil .
DARBY	Matthew	6	14	For if ye forgive men their offences , your heavenly Father also will forgive you [ yours ] ,
DARBY	Matthew	6	15	but if ye do not forgive men their offences , neither will your Father forgive your offences .
DARBY	Matthew	6	16	And when ye fast , be not as the hypocrites , downcast in countenance ; for they disfigure their faces , so that they may appear fasting to men : verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
DARBY	Matthew	6	17	But * thou * , [ when ] fasting , anoint thy head and wash thy face ,
DARBY	Matthew	6	18	so that thou mayest not appear fasting unto men , but to thy Father who is in secret ; and thy Father who sees in secret shall render [ it ] to thee .
DARBY	Matthew	6	19	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth , where moth and rust spoils , and where thieves dig through and steal ;
DARBY	Matthew	6	20	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust spoils , and where thieves do not dig through nor steal ;
DARBY	Matthew	6	21	for where thy treasure is , there will be also thy heart .
DARBY	Matthew	6	22	The lamp of the body is the eye ; if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body will be light :
DARBY	Matthew	6	23	but if thine eye be wicked , thy whole body will be dark . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great the darkness !
DARBY	Matthew	6	24	No one can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and will love the other , or he will hold to the one and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .
DARBY	Matthew	6	25	For this cause I say unto you , Do not be careful about your life , what ye should eat and what ye should drink ; nor for your body what ye should put on . Is not the life more than food , and the body than raiment ?
DARBY	Matthew	6	26	Look at the birds of the heaven , that they sow not , nor reap , nor gather into granaries , and your heavenly Father nourishes them . Are * ye * not much more excellent than they ?
DARBY	Matthew	6	27	But which of you by carefulness can add to his growth one cubit ?
DARBY	Matthew	6	28	And why are ye careful about clothing ? Observe with attention the lilies of the field , how they grow : they toil not , neither do they spin ;
DARBY	Matthew	6	29	but I say unto you , that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these .
DARBY	Matthew	6	30	But if God so clothe the herbage of the field , which is to-day , and to-morrow is cast into [ the ] oven , will he not much rather you , O [ ye ] of little faith ?
DARBY	Matthew	6	31	Be not therefore careful , saying , What shall we eat ? or What shall we drink ? or What shall we put on ?
DARBY	Matthew	6	32	for all these things the nations seek after ; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things .
DARBY	Matthew	6	33	But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all these things shall be added unto you .
DARBY	Matthew	6	34	Be not careful therefore for the morrow , for the morrow shall be careful about itself . Sufficient to the day [ is ] its own evil .
DARBY	Matthew	7	7	Ask , and it shall be given to you . Seek , and ye shall find . Knock , and it shall be opened to you .
DARBY	Matthew	7	2	for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged ; and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you .
DARBY	Matthew	7	3	But why lookest thou on the mote that is in the eye of thy brother , but observest not the beam that is in thine eye ?
DARBY	Matthew	7	4	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Allow [ me ] , I will cast out the mote from thine eye ; and behold , the beam is in thine eye ?
DARBY	Matthew	7	5	Hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine eye , and then thou wilt see clearly to cast out the mote out of the eye of thy brother .
DARBY	Matthew	7	6	Give not that which is holy to the dogs , nor cast your pearls before the swine , lest they trample them with their feet , and turning round rend you .
DARBY	Matthew	7	8	For every one that asks receives ; and he that seeks finds ; and to him that knocks it shall be opened .
DARBY	Matthew	7	9	Or what man is there of you who , if his son shall ask of him a loaf of bread , will give him a stone ;
DARBY	Matthew	7	10	and if he ask a fish , will give him a serpent ?
DARBY	Matthew	7	11	If therefore * ye * , being wicked , know [ how ] to give good gifts to your children , how much rather shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to them that ask of him ?
DARBY	Matthew	7	12	Therefore all things whatever ye desire that men should do to you , thus do * ye * also do to them ; for this is the law and the prophets .
DARBY	Matthew	7	13	Enter in through the narrow gate , for wide the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction , and many are they who enter in through it .
DARBY	Matthew	7	14	For narrow the gate and straitened the way that leads to life , and they are few who find it .
DARBY	Matthew	7	15	But beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep 's clothing , but within are ravening wolves .
DARBY	Matthew	7	16	By their fruits ye shall know them . Do [ men ] gather a bunch of grapes from thorns , or from thistles figs ?
DARBY	Matthew	7	17	So every good tree produces good fruits , but the worthless tree produces bad fruits .
DARBY	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can not produce bad fruits , nor a worthless tree produce good fruits .
DARBY	Matthew	7	19	Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire .
DARBY	Matthew	7	20	By their fruits then surely ye shall know them .
DARBY	Matthew	7	21	Not every one who says to me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens , but he that does the will of my Father who is in the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	7	22	Many shall say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied through * thy * name , and through * thy * name cast out demons , and through * thy * name done many works of power ?
DARBY	Matthew	7	23	and then will I avow unto them , I never knew you . Depart from me , workers of lawlessness .
DARBY	Matthew	7	24	Whoever therefore hears these my words and does them , I will liken him to a prudent man , who built his house upon the rock ;
DARBY	Matthew	7	25	and the rain came down , and the streams came , and the winds blew and fell upon that house , and it did not fall , for it had been founded upon the rock .
DARBY	Matthew	7	26	And every one who hears these my words and does not do them , he shall be likened to a foolish man , who built his house upon the sand ;
DARBY	Matthew	7	27	and the rain came down , and the streams came , and the winds blew and beat upon that house , and it fell , and its fall was great .
DARBY	Matthew	7	28	And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished these words , the crowds were astonished at his doctrine ,
DARBY	Matthew	7	29	for he taught them as having authority , and not as their scribes .
DARBY	Matthew	8	8	And the centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not fit that thou shouldest enter under my roof ; but only speak a word , and my servant shall be healed .
DARBY	Matthew	8	2	And behold , a leper came up to [ him ] and did him homage , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou art able to cleanse me .
DARBY	Matthew	8	3	And he stretched out his hand and touched him , saying , I will ; be cleansed . And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
DARBY	Matthew	8	4	And Jesus says to him , See thou tell no man , but go , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift which Moses ordained , for a testimony to them .
DARBY	Matthew	8	5	And when he had entered into Capernaum , a centurion came to him , beseeching him ,
DARBY	Matthew	8	6	and saying , Lord , my servant lies paralytic in the house , suffering grievously .
DARBY	Matthew	8	7	And Jesus says to him , * I * will come and heal him .
DARBY	Matthew	8	9	For * I * also am a man under authority , having under me soldiers , and I say to this [ one ] , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my bondman , Do this , and he does it .
DARBY	Matthew	8	10	And when Jesus heard it , he wondered , and said to those who followed , Verily I say unto you , Not even in Israel have I found so great faith .
DARBY	Matthew	8	11	But I say unto you , that many shall come from [ the ] rising and setting [ sun ] , and shall lie down at table with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens ;
DARBY	Matthew	8	12	but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
DARBY	Matthew	8	13	And Jesus said to the centurion , Go , and as thou hast believed , be it to thee . And his servant was healed in that hour .
DARBY	Matthew	8	14	And when Jesus had come to Peter 's house , he saw his mother-in-law laid down and in a fever ;
DARBY	Matthew	8	15	and he touched her hand , and the fever left her , and she arose and served him .
DARBY	Matthew	8	16	And when the evening was come , they brought to him many possessed by demons , and he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all that were ill ;
DARBY	Matthew	8	17	so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet , saying , Himself took our infirmities and bore our diseases .
DARBY	Matthew	8	18	And Jesus , seeing great crowds around him , commanded to depart to the other side .
DARBY	Matthew	8	19	And a scribe came up and said to him , Teacher , I will follow thee whithersoever thou mayest go .
DARBY	Matthew	8	20	And Jesus says to him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven roosting-places ; but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head .
DARBY	Matthew	8	21	But another of his disciples said to him , Lord , suffer me first to go away and bury my father .
DARBY	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus said to him , Follow me , and leave the dead to bury their own dead .
DARBY	Matthew	8	23	And he went on board ship and his disciples followed him ;
DARBY	Matthew	8	24	and behold , [ the water ] became very agitated on the sea , so that the ship was covered by the waves ; but * he * slept .
DARBY	Matthew	8	25	And the disciples came and awoke him , saying , Lord save : we perish .
DARBY	Matthew	8	26	And he says to them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then , having arisen , he rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great calm .
DARBY	Matthew	8	27	But the men were astonished , saying , What sort [ of man ] is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ?
DARBY	Matthew	8	28	And there met him , when he came to the other side , to the country of the Gergesenes , two possessed by demons , coming out of the tombs , exceeding dangerous , so that no one was able to pass by that way .
DARBY	Matthew	8	29	And behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Son of God ? hast thou come here before the time to torment us ?
DARBY	Matthew	8	30	Now there was , a great way off from them , a herd of many swine feeding ;
DARBY	Matthew	8	31	and the demons besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , send us away into the herd of swine .
DARBY	Matthew	8	32	And he said to them , Go . And they , going out , departed into the herd of swine ; and lo , the whole herd [ of swine ] rushed down the steep slope into the sea , and died in the waters .
DARBY	Matthew	8	33	But they that fed them fled , and went away into the city and related everything , and what had happened as to those possessed by demons .
DARBY	Matthew	8	34	And behold , the whole city went out to meet Jesus ; and when they saw him , they begged [ him ] to go away out of their coasts .
DARBY	Matthew	9	9	And Jesus , passing on thence , saw a man sitting at the tax-office , called Matthew , and says to him , Follow me . And he rose up and followed him .
DARBY	Matthew	9	2	And behold , they brought to him a paralytic , laid upon a bed ; and Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , Be of good courage , child ; thy sins are forgiven .
DARBY	Matthew	9	3	And behold , certain of the scribes said to themselves , This [ man ] blasphemes .
DARBY	Matthew	9	4	And Jesus , seeing their thoughts , said , Why do * ye * think evil things in your hearts ?
DARBY	Matthew	9	5	For which is easier : to say , Thy sins are forgiven ; or to say , Rise up and walk ?
DARBY	Matthew	9	6	But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins , ( then he says to the paralytic , ) Rise up , take up thy bed and go to thy house .
DARBY	Matthew	9	7	And he rose up and went to his house .
DARBY	Matthew	9	8	But the crowds seeing [ it ] , were in fear , and glorified God who gave such power to men .
DARBY	Matthew	9	10	And it came to pass , as he lay at table in the house , that behold , many tax-gatherers and sinners came and lay at table with Jesus and his disciples .
DARBY	Matthew	9	11	And the Pharisees seeing [ it ] , said to his disciples , Why does your teacher eat with tax-gatherers and sinners ?
DARBY	Matthew	9	12	But [ Jesus ] hearing it , said , They that are strong have not need of a physician , but those that are ill.
DARBY	Matthew	9	13	But go and learn what [ that ] is—I will have mercy and not sacrifice ; for I have not come to call righteous [ men ] but sinners .
DARBY	Matthew	9	14	Then come to him the disciples of John , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees often fast , but thy disciples fast not ?
DARBY	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said to them , Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn so long as the bridegroom is with them ? But days will come when the bridegroom will have been taken away from them , and then they will fast .
DARBY	Matthew	9	16	But no one puts a patch of new cloth on an old garment , for its filling up takes from the garment and a worse rent takes place .
DARBY	Matthew	9	17	Nor do men put new wine into old skins , otherwise the skins burst and the wine is poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but they put new wine into new skins , and both are preserved together .
DARBY	Matthew	9	18	As he spoke these things to them , behold , a ruler coming in did homage to him , saying , My daughter has by this died ; but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live .
DARBY	Matthew	9	19	And Jesus rose up and followed him , and [ so did ] his disciples .
DARBY	Matthew	9	20	And behold , a woman , who had had a bloody flux [ for ] twelve years , came behind and touched the hem of his garment ;
DARBY	Matthew	9	21	for she said within herself , If I should only touch his garment I shall be healed .
DARBY	Matthew	9	22	But Jesus turning and seeing her , said , Be of good courage , daughter ; thy faith has healed thee . And the woman was healed from that hour .
DARBY	Matthew	9	23	And when Jesus was come to the house of the ruler , and saw the flute-players and the crowd making a tumult ,
DARBY	Matthew	9	24	he said , Withdraw , for the damsel is not dead , but sleeps . And they derided him .
DARBY	Matthew	9	25	But when the crowd had been put out , he went in and took her hand ; and the damsel rose up .
DARBY	Matthew	9	26	And the fame of it went out into all that land .
DARBY	Matthew	9	27	And as Jesus passed on thence , two blind [ men ] followed him , crying and saying , Have mercy on us , Son of David .
DARBY	Matthew	9	28	And when he was come to the house , the blind [ men ] came to him . And Jesus says to them , Do ye believe that I am able to do this ? They say to him , Yea , Lord .
DARBY	Matthew	9	29	Then he touched their eyes , saying , According to your faith , be it unto you .
DARBY	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened ; and Jesus charged them sharply , saying , See , let no man know it .
DARBY	Matthew	9	31	But they , when they were gone out , spread his name abroad in all that land .
DARBY	Matthew	9	32	But as these were going out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed by a demon .
DARBY	Matthew	9	33	And the demon having been cast out , the dumb spake . And the crowds were astonished , saying , It has never been seen thus in Israel .
DARBY	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , He casts out the demons through the prince of the demons .
DARBY	Matthew	9	35	And Jesus went round all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every bodily weakness .
DARBY	Matthew	9	36	But when he saw the crowds he was moved with compassion for them , because they were harassed , and cast away as sheep not having a shepherd .
DARBY	Matthew	9	37	Then saith he to his disciples , The harvest [ is ] great and the workmen [ are ] few ;
DARBY	Matthew	9	38	supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he send forth workmen unto his harvest .
DARBY	Matthew	10	10	nor scrip for the way , nor two body coats , nor sandals , nor a staff : for the workman is worthy of his nourishment .
DARBY	Matthew	10	2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these : first , Simon , who was called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the [ son ] of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
DARBY	Matthew	10	3	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the tax-gatherer ; James the [ son ] of Alphaeus , and Lebbaeus , who was surnamed Thaddaeus ;
DARBY	Matthew	10	4	Simon the Cananaean , and Judas the Iscariote , who also delivered him up .
DARBY	Matthew	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent out when he had charged them , saying , Go not off into [ the ] way of [ the ] nations , and into a city of Samaritans enter ye not ;
DARBY	Matthew	10	6	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
DARBY	Matthew	10	7	And as ye go , preach , saying , The kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh .
DARBY	Matthew	10	8	Heal [ the ] infirm , [ raise the dead ] , cleanse lepers , cast out demons : ye have received gratuitously , give gratuitously .
DARBY	Matthew	10	9	Do not provide yourselves with gold , or silver , or brass , for your belts ,
DARBY	Matthew	10	11	But into whatsoever city or village ye enter , inquire who in it is worthy , and there remain till ye go forth .
DARBY	Matthew	10	12	And as ye enter into a house salute it .
DARBY	Matthew	10	13	And if the house indeed be worthy , let your peace come upon it ; but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
DARBY	Matthew	10	14	And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , as ye go forth out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
DARBY	Matthew	10	15	Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in judgment-day than for that city .
DARBY	Matthew	10	16	Behold , * I * send you as sheep in the midst of wolves ; be therefore prudent as the serpents , and guileless as the doves .
DARBY	Matthew	10	17	But beware of men ; for they will deliver you up to sanhedrims , and scourge you in their synagogues ;
DARBY	Matthew	10	18	and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the nations .
DARBY	Matthew	10	19	But when they deliver you up , be not careful how or what ye shall speak ; for it shall be given to you in that hour what ye shall speak .
DARBY	Matthew	10	20	For * ye * are not the speakers , but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you .
DARBY	Matthew	10	21	But brother shall deliver up brother to death , and father child ; and children shall rise up against parents and shall put them to death ;
DARBY	Matthew	10	22	and ye shall be hated of all on account of my name . But he that has endured to [ the ] end , * he * shall be saved .
DARBY	Matthew	10	23	But when they persecute you in this city , flee to the other ; for verily I say to you , Ye shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come .
DARBY	Matthew	10	24	The disciple is not above his teacher , nor the bondman above his lord .
DARBY	Matthew	10	25	[ It is ] sufficient for the disciple that he should become as his teacher , and the bondman as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more those of his household ?
DARBY	Matthew	10	26	Fear them not therefore ; for there is nothing covered which shall not be revealed , and secret which shall not be known .
DARBY	Matthew	10	27	What I say to you in darkness speak in the light , and what ye hear in the ear preach upon the houses .
DARBY	Matthew	10	28	And be not afraid of those who kill the body , but can not kill the soul ; but fear rather him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
DARBY	Matthew	10	29	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father ;
DARBY	Matthew	10	30	but of you even the hairs of the head are all numbered .
DARBY	Matthew	10	31	Fear not therefore ; * ye * are better than many sparrows .
DARBY	Matthew	10	32	Every one therefore who shall confess me before men , * I * also will confess him before my Father who is in [ the ] heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	10	33	But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will * I * also deny before my Father who is in [ the ] heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	10	34	Do not think that I have come to send peace upon the earth : I have not come to send peace , but a sword .
DARBY	Matthew	10	35	For I have come to set a man at variance with his father , and the daughter with her mother , and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law ;
DARBY	Matthew	10	36	and they of his household [ shall be ] a man 's enemies .
DARBY	Matthew	10	37	He who loves father or mother above me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter above me is not worthy of me .
DARBY	Matthew	10	38	And he who does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me .
DARBY	Matthew	10	39	He that finds his life shall lose it , and he who has lost his life for my sake shall find it .
DARBY	Matthew	10	40	He that receives you receives me , and he that receives me receives him that sent me .
DARBY	Matthew	10	41	He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet , shall receive a prophet 's reward ; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man , shall receive a righteous man 's reward .
DARBY	Matthew	10	42	And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold [ water ] only , in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
DARBY	Matthew	11	11	Verily I say to you , that there is not arisen among [ the ] born of women a greater than John the baptist . But he who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he .
DARBY	Matthew	11	2	But John , having heard in the prison the works of the Christ , sent by his disciples ,
DARBY	Matthew	11	3	and said to him , Art * thou * the coming [ one ] ? or are we to wait for another ?
DARBY	Matthew	11	4	And Jesus answering said to them , Go , report to John what ye hear and see .
DARBY	Matthew	11	5	Blind [ men ] see and lame walk ; lepers are cleansed , and deaf hear ; and dead are raised , and poor have glad tidings preached to them :
DARBY	Matthew	11	6	and blessed is whosoever shall not be offended in me .
DARBY	Matthew	11	7	But as they went [ away ] , Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? a reed moved about by the wind ?
DARBY	Matthew	11	8	But what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in delicate raiment ? behold , those who wear delicate things are in the houses of kings .
DARBY	Matthew	11	9	But what went ye out to see ? a prophet ? Yea , I say to you , and more than a prophet :
DARBY	Matthew	11	10	this is he of whom it is written , Behold , * I * send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee .
DARBY	Matthew	11	12	But from the days of John the baptist until now , the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence , and [ the ] violent seize on it .
DARBY	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the law have prophesied unto John .
DARBY	Matthew	11	14	And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , who is to come .
DARBY	Matthew	11	15	He that has ears to hear , let him hear .
DARBY	Matthew	11	16	But to whom shall I liken this generation ? It is like children sitting in the markets , which , calling to their companions ,
DARBY	Matthew	11	17	say , We have piped to you , and ye have not danced : we have mourned to you , and ye have not wailed .
DARBY	Matthew	11	18	For John has come neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He has a demon .
DARBY	Matthew	11	19	The Son of man has come eating and drinking , and they say , Behold , a man [ that is ] eating and wine-drinking , a friend of tax-gatherers , and of sinners : —and wisdom has been justified by her children .
DARBY	Matthew	11	20	Then began he to reproach the cities in which most of his works of power had taken place , because they had not repented .
DARBY	Matthew	11	21	Woe to thee , Chorazin ! woe to thee Bethsaida ! for if the works of power which have taken place in you , had taken place in Tyre and Sidon , they had long ago repented in sackcloth and ashes .
DARBY	Matthew	11	22	But I say to you , that it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in judgment-day than for you .
DARBY	Matthew	11	23	And * thou * , Capernaum , who hast been raised up to heaven , shalt be brought down even to hades . For if the works of power which have taken place in thee , had taken place in Sodom , it had remained until this day .
DARBY	Matthew	11	24	But I say to you , that it shall be more tolerable for [ the ] land of Sodom in judgment-day than for thee .
DARBY	Matthew	11	25	At that time , Jesus answering said , I praise thee , Father , Lord of the heaven and of the earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them to babes .
DARBY	Matthew	11	26	Yea , Father , for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight .
DARBY	Matthew	11	27	All things have been delivered to me by my Father , and no one knows the Son but the Father , nor does any one know the Father , but the Son , and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal [ him ] .
DARBY	Matthew	11	28	Come to me , all ye who labour and are burdened , and * I * will give you rest .
DARBY	Matthew	11	29	Take my yoke upon you , and learn from me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart ; and ye shall find rest to your souls ;
DARBY	Matthew	11	30	for my yoke is easy , and my burden is light .
DARBY	Matthew	12	12	How much better then is a man than a sheep ! So that it is lawful to do well on the sabbath .
DARBY	Matthew	12	2	But the Pharisees , seeing [ it ] , said to him , Behold , thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on sabbath .
DARBY	Matthew	12	3	But he said to them , Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry , and they that were with him ?
DARBY	Matthew	12	4	How he entered into the house of God , and ate the shewbread , which it was not lawful for him to eat , nor for those with him , but for the priests only ?
DARBY	Matthew	12	5	Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
DARBY	Matthew	12	6	But I say unto you , that there is here what is greater than the temple .
DARBY	Matthew	12	7	But if ye had known what is : I will have mercy and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
DARBY	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath .
DARBY	Matthew	12	9	And , going away from thence , he came into their synagogue .
DARBY	Matthew	12	10	And behold , there was a man having his hand withered . And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath ? that they might accuse him .
DARBY	Matthew	12	11	But he said to them , What man shall there be of you who has one sheep , and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath , will not lay hold of it and raise [ it ] up ?
DARBY	Matthew	12	13	Then he says to the man , Stretch out thy hand . And he stretched [ it ] out , and it was restored sound as the other .
DARBY	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees , having gone out , took counsel against him , how they might destroy him .
DARBY	Matthew	12	15	But Jesus knowing [ it ] , withdrew thence , and great crowds followed him ; and he healed them all :
DARBY	Matthew	12	16	and charged them strictly that they should not make him publicly known :
DARBY	Matthew	12	17	that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	12	18	Behold my servant , whom I have chosen , my beloved , in whom my soul has found its delight . I will put my Spirit upon him , and he shall shew forth judgment to the nations .
DARBY	Matthew	12	19	He shall not strive or cry out , nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets ;
DARBY	Matthew	12	20	a bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , until he bring forth judgment unto victory ;
DARBY	Matthew	12	21	and on his name shall [ the ] nations hope .
DARBY	Matthew	12	22	Then was brought to him one possessed by a demon , blind and dumb , and he healed him , so that the dumb [ man ] spake and saw .
DARBY	Matthew	12	23	And all the crowds were amazed and said , Is this [ man ] the Son of David ?
DARBY	Matthew	12	24	But the Pharisees , having heard [ it ] , said , This [ man ] does not cast out demons , but by Beelzebub , prince of demons .
DARBY	Matthew	12	25	But he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation , and every city or house divided against itself will not subsist .
DARBY	Matthew	12	26	And if Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then shall his kingdom subsist ?
DARBY	Matthew	12	27	And if * I * cast out demons by Beelzebub , your sons , by whom do they cast [ them ] out ? For this reason * they * shall be your judges .
DARBY	Matthew	12	28	But if * I * by [ the ] Spirit of God cast out demons , then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you .
DARBY	Matthew	12	29	Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong [ man ] and plunder his goods , unless first he bind the strong [ man ] ? and then he will plunder his house .
DARBY	Matthew	12	30	He that is not with me is against me , and he that gathers not with me scatters .
DARBY	Matthew	12	31	For this reason I say unto you , Every sin and injurious speaking shall be forgiven to men , but speaking injuriously of the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men .
DARBY	Matthew	12	32	And whosoever shall have spoken a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him ; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this age nor in the coming [ one ] .
DARBY	Matthew	12	33	Either make the tree good , and its fruit good ; or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt . For from the fruit the tree is known .
DARBY	Matthew	12	34	Offspring of vipers ! how can ye speak good things , being wicked ? For of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks .
DARBY	Matthew	12	35	The good man out of the good treasure brings forth good things ; and the wicked man out of the wicked treasure brings forth wicked things .
DARBY	Matthew	12	36	But I say unto you , that every idle word which men shall say , they shall render an account of it in judgment-day :
DARBY	Matthew	12	37	for by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
DARBY	Matthew	12	38	Then answered him some of the scribes and Pharisees , saying , Teacher , we desire to see a sign from thee .
DARBY	Matthew	12	39	But he , answering , said to them , A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas the prophet .
DARBY	Matthew	12	40	For even as Jonas was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights , thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights .
DARBY	Matthew	12	41	Ninevites shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and behold , more than Jonas [ is ] here .
DARBY	Matthew	12	42	A queen of [ the ] south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it ; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , more than Solomon [ is ] here .
DARBY	Matthew	12	43	But when the unclean spirit has gone out of the man , he goes through dry places , seeking rest , and does not find [ it ] .
DARBY	Matthew	12	44	Then he says , I will return to my house whence I came out ; and having come , he finds [ it ] unoccupied , swept , and adorned .
DARBY	Matthew	12	45	Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits worse than himself , and entering in , they dwell there ; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first . Thus shall it be to this wicked generation also .
DARBY	Matthew	12	46	But while he was yet speaking to the crowds , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , seeking to speak to him .
DARBY	Matthew	12	47	Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren are standing without , seeking to speak to thee .
DARBY	Matthew	12	48	But he answering said to him that spoke to him , Who is my mother , and who are my brethren ?
DARBY	Matthew	12	49	And , stretching out his hand to his disciples , he said , Behold my mother and my brethren ;
DARBY	Matthew	12	50	for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in [ the ] heavens , he is my brother , and sister , and mother .
DARBY	Matthew	13	13	For this cause I speak to them in parables , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear nor understand ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	2	And great crowds were gathered together to him , so that going on board ship himself he sat down , and the whole crowd stood on the shore .
DARBY	Matthew	13	3	And he spoke to them many things in parables , saying , Behold , the sower went out to sow :
DARBY	Matthew	13	4	and as he sowed , some [ grains ] fell along the way , and the birds came and devoured them ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	5	and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth , and immediately they sprang up out of [ the ground ] because of not having [ any ] depth of earth ,
DARBY	Matthew	13	6	but when the sun rose they were burned up , and because of not having [ any ] root were dried up ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	7	and others fell upon the thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked them ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	8	and others fell upon the good ground , and produced fruit , one a hundred , one sixty , and one thirty .
DARBY	Matthew	13	9	He that has ears , let him hear .
DARBY	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples came up and said to him , Why speakest thou to them in parables ?
DARBY	Matthew	13	11	And he answering said to them , Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens , but to them it is not given ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	12	for whoever has , to him shall be given , and he shall be caused to be in abundance ; but he who has not , even what he has shall be taken away from him .
DARBY	Matthew	13	14	and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias , which says , Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand , and beholding ye shall behold and not see ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	15	for the heart of this people has grown fat , and they have heard heavily with their ears , and they have closed their eyes as asleep , lest they should see with the eyes , and hear with the ears , and understand with the heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
DARBY	Matthew	13	16	But blessed are * your * eyes because they see , and your ears because they hear ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	17	for verily I say unto you , that many prophets and righteous [ men ] have desired to see the things which ye behold and did not see [ them ] , and to hear the things which ye hear and did not hear [ them ] .
DARBY	Matthew	13	18	* Ye * , therefore , hear the parable of the sower .
DARBY	Matthew	13	19	From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [ it ] , the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart : this is he that is sown by the wayside .
DARBY	Matthew	13	20	But he that is sown on the rocky places—this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy ,
DARBY	Matthew	13	21	but has no root in himself , but is for a time only ; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word , he is immediately offended .
DARBY	Matthew	13	22	And he that is sown among the thorns—this is he who hears the word , and the anxious care of this life , and the deceit of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
DARBY	Matthew	13	23	But he that is sown upon the good ground—this is he who hears and understands the word , who bears fruit also , and produces , one a hundred , one sixty , and one thirty .
DARBY	Matthew	13	24	Another parable set he before them , saying , The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	25	but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat , and went away .
DARBY	Matthew	13	26	But when the blade shot up and produced fruit , then appeared the darnel also .
DARBY	Matthew	13	27	And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him , Sir , hast thou not sown good seed in thy field ? whence then has it darnel ?
DARBY	Matthew	13	28	And he said to them , A man [ that is ] an enemy has done this . And the bondmen said to him , Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [ up ] ?
DARBY	Matthew	13	29	But he said , No ; lest [ in ] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it .
DARBY	Matthew	13	30	Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest , and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen , Gather first the darnel , and bind it into bundles to burn it ; but the wheat bring together into my granary .
DARBY	Matthew	13	31	Another parable set he before them , saying , The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [ seed ] which a man took and sowed in his field ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	32	which is less indeed than all seeds , but when it is grown is greater than herbs , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches .
DARBY	Matthew	13	33	He spoke another parable to them : The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened .
DARBY	Matthew	13	34	All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables , and without a parable he did not speak to them ,
DARBY	Matthew	13	35	so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things hidden from [ the ] world 's foundation .
DARBY	Matthew	13	36	Then , having dismissed the crowds , he went into the house ; and his disciples came to him , saying , Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field .
DARBY	Matthew	13	37	But he answering said , He that sows the good seed is the Son of man ,
DARBY	Matthew	13	38	and the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the sons of the kingdom , but the darnel are the sons of the evil [ one ] ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil ; and the harvest is [ the ] completion of [ the ] age , and the harvestmen are angels .
DARBY	Matthew	13	40	As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire , thus it shall be in the completion of the age .
DARBY	Matthew	13	41	The Son of man shall send his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences , and those that practise lawlessness ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	42	and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
DARBY	Matthew	13	43	Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He that has ears , let him hear .
DARBY	Matthew	13	44	The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field , which a man having found has hid , and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has , and buys that field .
DARBY	Matthew	13	45	Again , the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls ;
DARBY	Matthew	13	46	and having found one pearl of great value , he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it .
DARBY	Matthew	13	47	Again , the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea , and which has gathered together of every kind ,
DARBY	Matthew	13	48	which , when it has been filled , having drawn up on the shore and sat down , they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out .
DARBY	Matthew	13	49	Thus shall it be in the completion of the age : the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just ,
DARBY	Matthew	13	50	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
DARBY	Matthew	13	51	Jesus says to them , Have ye understood all these things ? They say to him , Yea , [ Lord ] .
DARBY	Matthew	13	52	And he said to them , For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [ that is ] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old .
DARBY	Matthew	13	53	And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he withdrew thence .
DARBY	Matthew	13	54	And having come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and said , Whence has this [ man ] this wisdom and these works of power ?
DARBY	Matthew	13	55	Is not this the son of the carpenter ? Is not his mother called Mary , and his brethren James , and Joseph , and Simon , and Judas ?
DARBY	Matthew	13	56	And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence then has this [ man ] all these things ?
DARBY	Matthew	13	57	And they were offended in him . And Jesus said to them , A prophet is not without honour , unless in his country and in his house .
DARBY	Matthew	13	58	And he did not there many works of power , because of their unbelief .
DARBY	Matthew	14	14	And going out he saw a great crowd , and was moved with compassion about them , and healed their infirm .
DARBY	Matthew	14	2	and said to his servants , This is John the baptist : * he * is risen from the dead , and because of this these works of power display their force in him .
DARBY	Matthew	14	3	For Herod had seized John , and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother .
DARBY	Matthew	14	4	For John said to him , It is not lawful for thee to have her .
DARBY	Matthew	14	5	And [ while ] desiring to kill him , he feared the crowd , because they held him for a prophet .
DARBY	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod 's birthday was celebrated , the daughter of Herodias danced before them , and pleased Herod ;
DARBY	Matthew	14	7	whereupon he promised with oath to give her whatsoever she should ask .
DARBY	Matthew	14	8	But she , being set on by her mother , says , Give me here upon a dish the head of John the baptist .
DARBY	Matthew	14	9	And the king was grieved ; but on account of the oaths , and those lying at table with [ him ] , he commanded [ it ] to be given .
DARBY	Matthew	14	10	And he sent and beheaded John in the prison ;
DARBY	Matthew	14	11	and his head was brought upon a dish , and was given to the damsel , and she carried [ it ] to her mother .
DARBY	Matthew	14	12	And his disciples came and took the body and buried it , and came and brought word to Jesus .
DARBY	Matthew	14	13	And Jesus , having heard it , went away thence by ship to a desert place apart . And the crowds having heard [ of it ] followed him on foot from the cities .
DARBY	Matthew	14	15	But when even was come , his disciples came to him saying , The place is desert , and [ much of ] the [ day ] time already gone by ; dismiss the crowds , that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves .
DARBY	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said to them , They have no need to go : give * ye * them to eat .
DARBY	Matthew	14	17	But they say to him , We have not here save five loaves and two fishes .
DARBY	Matthew	14	18	And he said , Bring them here to me .
DARBY	Matthew	14	19	And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass , having taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed : and having broken the loaves , he gave [ them ] to the disciples , and the disciples [ gave them ] to the crowds .
DARBY	Matthew	14	20	And all ate and were filled , and they took up what was over and above of fragments twelve hand-baskets full .
DARBY	Matthew	14	21	But those that had eaten were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
DARBY	Matthew	14	22	And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship , and to go on before him to the other side , until he should have dismissed the crowds .
DARBY	Matthew	14	23	And having dismissed the crowds , he went up into the mountain apart to pray . And when even was come , he was alone there ,
DARBY	Matthew	14	24	but the ship was already in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves , for the wind was contrary .
DARBY	Matthew	14	25	But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them , walking on the sea .
DARBY	Matthew	14	26	And the disciples , seeing him walking on the sea , were troubled , saying , It is an apparition . And they cried out through fear .
DARBY	Matthew	14	27	But Jesus immediately spoke to them , saying , Take courage ; it is * I * : be not afraid .
DARBY	Matthew	14	28	And Peter answering him said , Lord , if it be * thou * , command me to come to thee upon the waters .
DARBY	Matthew	14	29	And he said , Come . And Peter , having descended from the ship , walked upon the waters to go to Jesus .
DARBY	Matthew	14	30	But seeing the wind strong he was afraid ; and beginning to sink he cried out , saying , Lord , save me .
DARBY	Matthew	14	31	And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him , and says to him , O thou of little faith , why didst thou doubt ?
DARBY	Matthew	14	32	And when they had gone up into the ship , the wind fell .
DARBY	Matthew	14	33	But those in the ship came and did homage to him , saying , Truly thou art God 's Son .
DARBY	Matthew	14	34	And having crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret .
DARBY	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place recognised him , they sent to that whole country around , and they brought to him all that were ill ,
DARBY	Matthew	14	36	and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment ; and as many as touched were made thoroughly well .
DARBY	Matthew	15	15	And Peter answering said to him , Expound to us this parable .
DARBY	Matthew	15	2	Why do thy disciples transgress what has been delivered by the ancients ? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread .
DARBY	Matthew	15	3	But he answering said to them , Why do * ye * also transgress the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching ?
DARBY	Matthew	15	4	For God commanded saying , Honour father and mother ; and , He that speaks ill of father or mother , let him die the death .
DARBY	Matthew	15	5	But * ye * say , Whosoever shall say to his father or mother , It is a gift , whatsoever [ it be ] by which [ received ] from me thou wouldest be profited :
DARBY	Matthew	15	6	and he shall in no wise honour his father or his mother ; and ye have made void the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching .
DARBY	Matthew	15	7	Hypocrites ! well has Esaias prophesied about you , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	15	8	This people honour me with the lips , but their heart is far away from me ;
DARBY	Matthew	15	9	but in vain do they worship me , teaching [ as ] teachings commandments of men .
DARBY	Matthew	15	10	And having called to [ him ] the crowd , he said to them , Hear and understand :
DARBY	Matthew	15	11	Not what enters into the mouth defiles the man ; but what goes forth out of the mouth , this defiles the man .
DARBY	Matthew	15	12	Then his disciples , coming up , said to him , Dost thou know that the Pharisees , having heard this word , have been offended ?
DARBY	Matthew	15	13	But he answering said , Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up .
DARBY	Matthew	15	14	Leave them alone ; they are blind leaders of blind : but if blind lead blind , both will fall into a ditch .
DARBY	Matthew	15	16	But he said , Are * ye * also still without intelligence ?
DARBY	Matthew	15	17	Do ye not yet apprehend , that everything that enters into the mouth finds its way into the belly , and is cast forth into the draught ?
DARBY	Matthew	15	18	but the things which go forth out of the mouth come out of the heart , and those defile man .
DARBY	Matthew	15	19	For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witnessings , blasphemies ;
DARBY	Matthew	15	20	these are the things which defile man ; but the eating with unwashen hands does not defile man .
DARBY	Matthew	15	21	And Jesus , going forth from thence , went away into the parts of Tyre and Sidon ;
DARBY	Matthew	15	22	and lo , a Canaanitish woman , coming out from those borders , cried [ to him ] saying , Have pity on me , Lord , Son of David ; my daughter is miserably possessed by a demon .
DARBY	Matthew	15	23	But he did not answer her a word . And his disciples came to [ him ] and asked him , saying , Dismiss her , for she cries after us .
DARBY	Matthew	15	24	But he answering said , I have not been sent save to the lost sheep of Israel 's house .
DARBY	Matthew	15	25	But she came and did him homage , saying , Lord , help me .
DARBY	Matthew	15	26	But he answering said , It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs .
DARBY	Matthew	15	27	But she said , Yea , Lord ; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters .
DARBY	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answering said to her , O woman , thy faith [ is ] great . Be it to thee as thou desirest . And her daughter was healed from * that * hour .
DARBY	Matthew	15	29	And Jesus , going away from thence , came towards the sea of Galilee , and he went up into the mountain and sat down there ;
DARBY	Matthew	15	30	and great crowds came to him , having with them lame , blind , dumb , crippled , and many others , and they cast them at his feet , and he healed them :
DARBY	Matthew	15	31	so that the crowds wondered , seeing dumb speaking , crippled sound , lame walking , and blind seeing ; and they glorified the God of Israel .
DARBY	Matthew	15	32	But Jesus , having called his disciples to [ him ] , said , I have compassion on the crowd , because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat , and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way .
DARBY	Matthew	15	33	And his disciples say to him , Whence should we have so many loaves in [ the ] wilderness as to satisfy so great a crowd ?
DARBY	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus says to them , How many loaves have ye ? But they said , Seven , and a few small fishes .
DARBY	Matthew	15	35	And he commanded the crowds to lie down on the ground ;
DARBY	Matthew	15	36	and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes , having given thanks , he broke [ them ] and gave [ them ] to his disciples , and the disciples to the crowd .
DARBY	Matthew	15	37	And all ate and were filled ; and they took up what was over and above of the fragments seven baskets full ;
DARBY	Matthew	15	38	but they that ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
DARBY	Matthew	15	39	And , having dismissed the crowds , he went on board ship and came to the borders of Magadan .
DARBY	Matthew	16	16	And Simon Peter answering said , * Thou * art the Christ , the Son of the living God .
DARBY	Matthew	16	2	But he answering said to them , When evening is come , ye say , Fine weather , for the sky is red ;
DARBY	Matthew	16	3	and in the morning , A storm to-day , for the sky is red [ and ] lowering ; ye know [ how ] to discern the face of the sky , but ye can not the signs of the times .
DARBY	Matthew	16	4	A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas . And he left them and went away .
DARBY	Matthew	16	5	And when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
DARBY	Matthew	16	6	And Jesus said to them , See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
DARBY	Matthew	16	7	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , Because we have taken no bread .
DARBY	Matthew	16	8	And Jesus knowing [ it ] , said , Why reason ye among yourselves , O ye of little faith , because ye have taken no bread ?
DARBY	Matthew	16	9	Do ye not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many hand-baskets ye took [ up ] ?
DARBY	Matthew	16	10	nor the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took [ up ] ?
DARBY	Matthew	16	11	How do ye not understand that [ it was ] not concerning bread I said to you , Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ?
DARBY	Matthew	16	12	Then they comprehended that he did not speak of being beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
DARBY	Matthew	16	13	But when Jesus was come into the parts of Caesarea-Philippi , he demanded of his disciples , saying , Who do men say that I the Son of man am ?
DARBY	Matthew	16	14	And they said , Some , John the baptist ; and others , Elias ; and others again , Jeremias or one of the prophets .
DARBY	Matthew	16	15	He says to them , But * ye * , who do ye say that I am ?
DARBY	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus answering said to him , Blessed art thou , Simon Bar-jona , for flesh and blood has not revealed [ it ] to thee , but my Father who is in the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	16	18	And * I * also , I say unto thee that * thou * art Peter , and on this rock I will build my assembly , and hades ' gates shall not prevail against it .
DARBY	Matthew	16	19	And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens ; and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens ; and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	16	20	Then he enjoined on his disciples that they should say to no man that he was the Christ .
DARBY	Matthew	16	21	From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples that he must go away to Jerusalem , and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised .
DARBY	Matthew	16	22	And Peter taking him to [ him ] began to rebuke him , saying , [ God ] be favourable to thee , Lord ; this shall in no wise be unto thee .
DARBY	Matthew	16	23	But turning round , he said to Peter , Get away behind me , Satan ; thou art an offence to me , for thy mind is not on the things that are of God , but on the things that are of men .
DARBY	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said to his disciples , If any one desires to come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me .
DARBY	Matthew	16	25	For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it .
DARBY	Matthew	16	26	For what does a man profit , if he should gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
DARBY	Matthew	16	27	For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels , and then he will render to each according to his doings .
DARBY	Matthew	16	28	Verily I say unto you , There are some of those standing here that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom .
DARBY	Matthew	17	17	And Jesus answering said , O unbelieving and perverted generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I bear with you ? Bring him here to me .
DARBY	Matthew	17	2	And he was transfigured before them . And his face shone as the sun , and his garments became white as the light ;
DARBY	Matthew	17	3	and lo , Moses and Elias appeared to them talking with him .
DARBY	Matthew	17	4	And Peter answering said to Jesus , Lord , it is good we should be here . If thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles : for thee one , and for Moses one , and one for Elias .
DARBY	Matthew	17	5	While he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and lo , a voice out of the cloud , saying , * This * is my beloved Son , in whom I have found my delight : hear him .
DARBY	Matthew	17	6	And the disciples hearing [ it ] fell upon their faces , and were greatly terrified .
DARBY	Matthew	17	7	And Jesus coming to [ them ] touched them , and said , Rise up , and be not terrified .
DARBY	Matthew	17	8	And lifting up their eyes , they saw no one but Jesus alone .
DARBY	Matthew	17	9	And as they descended from the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying , Tell the vision to no one , until the Son of man be risen up from among [ the ] dead .
DARBY	Matthew	17	10	And [ his ] disciples demanded of him saying , Why then say the scribes that Elias must first have come ?
DARBY	Matthew	17	11	And he answering said to them , Elias indeed comes first and will restore all things .
DARBY	Matthew	17	12	But I say unto you that Elias has already come , and they have not known him , but have done unto him whatever they would . Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer from them .
DARBY	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the baptist .
DARBY	Matthew	17	14	And when they came to the crowd , a man came to him , falling on his knees before him , and saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	17	15	Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is lunatic , and suffers sorely ; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water .
DARBY	Matthew	17	16	And I brought him to thy disciples , and they were not able to heal him .
DARBY	Matthew	17	18	And Jesus rebuked him , and the demon went out from him , and the boy was healed from that hour .
DARBY	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples , coming to Jesus apart , said [ to him ] , Why were not * we * able to cast him out ?
DARBY	Matthew	17	20	And he says to them , Because of your unbelief ; for verily I say unto you , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [ seed ] , ye shall say to this mountain , Be transported hence there , and it shall transport itself ; and nothing shall be impossible to you .
DARBY	Matthew	17	21	But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting .
DARBY	Matthew	17	22	And while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said to them , The Son of man is about to be delivered up into [ the ] hands of men ,
DARBY	Matthew	17	23	and they shall kill him ; and the third day he shall be raised up . And they were greatly grieved .
DARBY	Matthew	17	24	And when they came to Capernaum , those who received the didrachmas came to Peter and said , Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas ?
DARBY	Matthew	17	25	He says , Yes . And when he came into the house , Jesus anticipated him , saying , What dost thou think , Simon ? the kings of the earth , from whom do they receive custom or tribute ? from their own sons or from strangers ?
DARBY	Matthew	17	26	Peter says to him , From strangers . Jesus said to him , Then are the sons free .
DARBY	Matthew	17	27	But that we may not be an offence to them , go to the sea and cast a hook , and take the first fish that comes up , and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater ; take that and give it to them for me and thee .
DARBY	Matthew	18	18	Verily I say to you , Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven , and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven .
DARBY	Matthew	18	2	And Jesus having called a little child to [ him ] , set it in their midst ,
DARBY	Matthew	18	3	and said , Verily I say to you , Unless ye are converted and become as little children , ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	18	4	Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , * he * is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens ;
DARBY	Matthew	18	5	and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name , receives me .
DARBY	Matthew	18	6	But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me , it were profitable for him that a great millstone had been hanged upon his neck and he be sunk in the depths of the sea .
DARBY	Matthew	18	7	Woe to the world because of offences ! For it must needs be that offences come ; yet woe to that man by whom the offence comes !
DARBY	Matthew	18	8	And if thy hand or thy foot offend thee , cut it off and cast [ it ] from thee ; it is good for thee to enter into life lame or maimed , [ rather ] than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire .
DARBY	Matthew	18	9	And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out and cast [ it ] from thee ; it is good for thee to enter into life one-eyed , [ rather ] than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire .
DARBY	Matthew	18	10	See that ye do not despise one of these little ones ; for I say unto you that their angels in [ the ] heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in [ the ] heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	18	11	For the Son of man has come to save that which was lost .
DARBY	Matthew	18	12	What think ye ? If a certain man should have a hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , does he not , leaving the ninety and nine on the mountains , go and seek the one that has gone astray ?
DARBY	Matthew	18	13	And if it should come to pass that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoices more because of it than because of the ninety and nine not gone astray .
DARBY	Matthew	18	14	So it is not the will of your Father who is in [ the ] heavens that one of these little ones should perish .
DARBY	Matthew	18	15	But if thy brother sin against thee , go , reprove him between thee and him alone . If he hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
DARBY	Matthew	18	16	But if he do not hear [ thee ] , take with thee one or two besides , that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three .
DARBY	Matthew	18	17	But if he will not listen to them , tell it to the assembly ; and if also he will not listen to the assembly , let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer .
DARBY	Matthew	18	19	Again I say to you , that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter , whatsoever it may be that they shall ask , it shall come to them from my Father who is in [ the ] heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three are gathered together unto my name , there am I in the midst of them .
DARBY	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter came to him and said , Lord , how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him ? until seven times ?
DARBY	Matthew	18	22	Jesus says to him , I say not to thee until seven times , but until seventy times seven .
DARBY	Matthew	18	23	For this cause the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who would reckon with his bondmen .
DARBY	Matthew	18	24	And having begun to reckon , one debtor of ten thousand talents was brought to him .
DARBY	Matthew	18	25	But he not having anything to pay , [ his ] lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and his children , and everything that he had , and that payment should be made .
DARBY	Matthew	18	26	The bondman therefore falling down did him homage , saying , Lord , have patience with me and I will pay thee all .
DARBY	Matthew	18	27	And the lord of that bondman , being moved with compassion , loosed him and forgave him the loan .
DARBY	Matthew	18	28	But that bondman having gone out , found one of his fellow-bondmen who owed him a hundred denarii . And having seized him , he throttled him , saying , Pay [ me ] if thou owest anything .
DARBY	Matthew	18	29	His fellow-bondman therefore , having fallen down [ at his feet ] , besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee .
DARBY	Matthew	18	30	But he would not , but went away and cast him into prison , until he should pay what was owing .
DARBY	Matthew	18	31	But his fellow-bondmen , having seen what had taken place , were greatly grieved , and went and recounted to their lord all that had taken place .
DARBY	Matthew	18	32	Then his lord , having called him to [ him ] , says to him , Wicked bondman ! I forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me ;
DARBY	Matthew	18	33	shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-bondman , as * I * also had compassion on thee ?
DARBY	Matthew	18	34	And his lord being angry delivered him to the tormentors till he paid all that was owing to him .
DARBY	Matthew	18	35	Thus also my heavenly Father shall do to you if ye forgive not from your hearts every one his brother .
DARBY	Matthew	19	19	Honour thy father and thy mother , and Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
DARBY	Matthew	19	2	and great crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
DARBY	Matthew	19	3	And the Pharisees came to him tempting him , and saying , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
DARBY	Matthew	19	4	But he answering said [ to them ] , Have ye not read that he who made [ them ] , from the beginning made them male and female ,
DARBY	Matthew	19	5	and said , On account of this a man shall leave father and mother , and shall be united to his wife , and the two shall be one flesh ?
DARBY	Matthew	19	6	so that they are no longer two , but one flesh . What therefore God has joined together , let not man separate .
DARBY	Matthew	19	7	They say to him , Why then did Moses command to give a letter of divorce and to send [ her ] away ?
DARBY	Matthew	19	8	He says to them , Moses , in view of your hardheartedness , allowed you to put away your wives ; but from the beginning it was not thus .
DARBY	Matthew	19	9	But I say unto you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , not for fornication , and shall marry another , commits adultery ; and he who marries one put away commits adultery .
DARBY	Matthew	19	10	His disciples say to him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
DARBY	Matthew	19	11	And he said to them , All can not receive this word , but those to whom it has been given ;
DARBY	Matthew	19	12	for there are eunuchs which have been born thus from [ their ] mother 's womb ; and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs of men ; and there are eunuchs who have made eunuchs of themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens . He that is able to receive [ it ] , let him receive [ it ] .
DARBY	Matthew	19	13	Then there were brought to him little children that he might lay his hands on them and pray ; but the disciples rebuked them .
DARBY	Matthew	19	14	But Jesus said , Suffer little children , and do not hinder them from coming to me ; for the kingdom of the heavens is of such :
DARBY	Matthew	19	15	and having laid his hands upon them , he departed thence .
DARBY	Matthew	19	16	And lo , one coming up said to him , Teacher , what good thing shall I do that I may have life eternal ?
DARBY	Matthew	19	17	And he said to him , What askest thou me concerning goodness ? one is good . But if thou wouldest enter into life , keep the commandments .
DARBY	Matthew	19	18	He says to him , Which ? And Jesus said , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness ,
DARBY	Matthew	19	20	The young man says to him , All these have I kept ; what lack I yet ?
DARBY	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said to him , If thou wouldest be perfect , go , sell what thou hast and give to [ the ] poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me .
DARBY	Matthew	19	22	But the young man , having heard the word , went away grieved , for he had large possessions .
DARBY	Matthew	19	23	And Jesus said to his disciples , Verily I say unto you , A rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of the heavens ;
DARBY	Matthew	19	24	and again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to enter a needle 's eye than a rich man into the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Matthew	19	25	And when the disciples heard [ it ] they were exceedingly astonished , saying , Who then can be saved ?
DARBY	Matthew	19	26	But Jesus , looking on [ them ] , said to them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible .
DARBY	Matthew	19	27	Then Peter answering said to him , Behold , * we * have left all things and have followed thee ; what then shall happen to us ?
DARBY	Matthew	19	28	And Jesus said to them , Verily I say unto you , That * ye * who have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit down upon his throne of glory , * ye * also shall sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
DARBY	Matthew	19	29	And every one who has left houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , shall receive a hundredfold , and shall inherit life eternal .
DARBY	Matthew	19	30	But many first shall be last , and last first .
DARBY	Matthew	20	20	Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee , with her sons , doing homage , and asking something of him .
DARBY	Matthew	20	2	And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius the day , he sent them into his vineyard .
DARBY	Matthew	20	3	And having gone out about [ the ] third hour , he saw others standing in the market-place idle ;
DARBY	Matthew	20	4	and to them he said , Go also ye into the vineyard , and whatsoever may be just I will give you . And they went their way .
DARBY	Matthew	20	5	Again , having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour , he did likewise .
DARBY	Matthew	20	6	But about the eleventh [ hour ] , having gone out , he found others standing , and says to them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ?
DARBY	Matthew	20	7	They say to him , Because no man has hired us . He says to them , Go also ye into the vineyard [ and whatsoever may be just ye shall receive ] .
DARBY	Matthew	20	8	But when the evening was come , the lord of the vineyard says to his steward , Call the workmen and pay [ them ] their wages , beginning from the last even to the first .
DARBY	Matthew	20	9	And when they [ who came to work ] about the eleventh hour came , they received each a denarius .
DARBY	Matthew	20	10	And when the first came , they supposed that they would receive more , and they received also themselves each a denarius .
DARBY	Matthew	20	11	And on receiving it they murmured against the master of the house ,
DARBY	Matthew	20	12	saying , These last have worked one hour , and thou hast made them equal to us , who have borne the burden of the day and the heat .
DARBY	Matthew	20	13	But he answering said to one of them , [ My ] friend , I do not wrong thee . Didst thou not agree with me for a denarius ?
DARBY	Matthew	20	14	Take what is thine and go . But it is my will to give to this last even as to thee :
DARBY	Matthew	20	15	is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs ? Is thine eye evil because * I * am good ?
DARBY	Matthew	20	16	Thus shall the last be first , and the first last ; for many are called ones , but few chosen ones .
DARBY	Matthew	20	17	And Jesus , going up to Jerusalem , took the twelve disciples with [ him ] apart in the way , and said to them ,
DARBY	Matthew	20	18	Behold we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes , and they will condemn him to death ;
DARBY	Matthew	20	19	and they will deliver him up to the nations to mock and to scourge and to crucify , and the third day he shall rise again .
DARBY	Matthew	20	21	And he said to her , What wilt thou ? She says to him , Speak [ the word ] that these my two sons may sit , one on thy right hand and one on thy left in thy kingdom .
DARBY	Matthew	20	22	And Jesus answering said , Ye know not what ye ask . Can ye drink the cup which * I * am about to drink ? They say to him , We are able .
DARBY	Matthew	20	23	[ And ] he says to them , Ye shall drink indeed my cup , but to sit on my right hand and on [ my ] left , is not mine to give , but to those for whom it is prepared of my Father .
DARBY	Matthew	20	24	And the ten , having heard [ of it ] , were indignant about the two brothers .
DARBY	Matthew	20	25	But Jesus having called them to [ him ] , said , Ye know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them , and the great exercise authority over them .
DARBY	Matthew	20	26	It shall not be thus amongst you , but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your servant ;
DARBY	Matthew	20	27	and whosoever will be first among you , let him be your bondman ;
DARBY	Matthew	20	28	as indeed the Son of man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life a ransom for many .
DARBY	Matthew	20	29	And as they went out from Jericho a great crowd followed him .
DARBY	Matthew	20	30	And lo , two blind men , sitting by the wayside , having heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out saying , Have mercy on us , Lord , Son of David .
DARBY	Matthew	20	31	But the crowd rebuked them , that they might be silent . But they cried out the more , saying , Have mercy on us , Lord , Son of David .
DARBY	Matthew	20	32	And Jesus , having stopped , called them and said , What will ye that I shall do to you ?
DARBY	Matthew	20	33	They say to him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened .
DARBY	Matthew	20	34	And Jesus , moved with compassion , touched their eyes ; and immediately their eyes had sight restored to them , and they followed him .
DARBY	Matthew	21	21	And Jesus answering said to them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and do not doubt , not only shall ye do what [ is done ] to the fig-tree , but even if ye should say to this mountain , Be thou taken away and be thou cast into the sea , it shall come to pass .
DARBY	Matthew	21	2	saying to them , Go into the village over against you , and immediately ye will find an ass tied , and a colt with it ; loose [ them ] and lead [ them ] to me .
DARBY	Matthew	21	3	And if any one say anything to you , ye shall say , The Lord has need of them , and straightway he will send them .
DARBY	Matthew	21	4	But all this came to pass , that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	21	5	Say to the daughter of Zion , Behold thy King cometh to thee , meek , and mounted upon an ass , and upon a colt the foal of an ass .
DARBY	Matthew	21	6	But the disciples , having gone and done as Jesus had ordered them ,
DARBY	Matthew	21	7	brought the ass and the colt and put their garments upon them , and he sat on them .
DARBY	Matthew	21	8	But a very great crowd strewed their own garments on the way , and others kept cutting down branches from the trees and strewing them on the way .
DARBY	Matthew	21	9	And the crowds who went before him and who followed cried , saying , Hosanna to the Son of David ; blessed [ be ] he who comes in the name of [ the ] Lord ; hosanna in the highest .
DARBY	Matthew	21	10	And as he entered into Jerusalem , the whole city was moved , saying , Who is this ?
DARBY	Matthew	21	11	And the crowds said , This is Jesus the prophet who is from Nazareth of Galilee .
DARBY	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus entered into the temple [ of God ] , and cast out all that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those that sold the doves .
DARBY	Matthew	21	13	And he says to them , It is written , My house shall be called a house of prayer , but * ye * have made it a den of robbers .
DARBY	Matthew	21	14	And blind and lame came to him in the temple , and he healed them .
DARBY	Matthew	21	15	And when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders which he wrought , and the children crying in the temple and saying , Hosanna to the Son of David , they were indignant ,
DARBY	Matthew	21	16	and said to him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus says to them , Yea ; have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
DARBY	Matthew	21	17	And leaving them he went forth out of the city to Bethany , and there he passed the night .
DARBY	Matthew	21	18	But early in the morning , as he came back into the city , he hungered .
DARBY	Matthew	21	19	And seeing one fig-tree in the way , he came to it and found on it nothing but leaves only . And he says to it , Let there be never more fruit of thee for ever . And the fig-tree was immediately dried up .
DARBY	Matthew	21	20	And when the disciples saw [ it ] , they wondered , saying , How immediately is the fig-tree dried up !
DARBY	Matthew	21	22	And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
DARBY	Matthew	21	23	And when he came into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him [ as he was ] teaching , saying , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
DARBY	Matthew	21	24	And Jesus answering said to them , * I * also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , * I * also will tell you by what authority I do these things :
DARBY	Matthew	21	25	The baptism of John , whence was it ? of heaven or of men ? And they reasoned among themselves , saying , If we should say , Of heaven , he will say to us , Why then have ye not believed him ?
DARBY	Matthew	21	26	but if we should say , Of men , we fear the crowd , for all hold John for a prophet .
DARBY	Matthew	21	27	And answering Jesus they said , We do not know . * He * also said to them , Neither do * I * tell you by what authority I do these things .
DARBY	Matthew	21	28	But what think ye ? A man had two children , and coming to the first he said , Child , go to-day , work in [ my ] vineyard .
DARBY	Matthew	21	29	And he answering said , I will not ; but afterwards repenting himself he went .
DARBY	Matthew	21	30	And coming to the second he said likewise ; and he answering said , * I * [ go ] , sir , and went not .
DARBY	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two did the will of the father ? They say [ to him ] , The first . Jesus says to them , Verily I say unto you that the tax-gatherers and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you .
DARBY	Matthew	21	32	For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not ; but the tax-gatherers and the harlots believed him ; but * ye * when ye saw [ it ] repented not yourselves afterwards to believe him .
DARBY	Matthew	21	33	Hear another parable : There was a householder who planted a vineyard , and made a fence round it , and dug a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and left the country .
DARBY	Matthew	21	34	But when the time of fruit drew near , he sent his bondmen to the husbandmen to receive his fruits .
DARBY	Matthew	21	35	And the husbandmen took his bondmen , and beat one , killed another , and stoned another .
DARBY	Matthew	21	36	Again he sent other bondmen more than the first , and they did to them in like manner .
DARBY	Matthew	21	37	And at last he sent to them his son , saying , They will have respect for my son .
DARBY	Matthew	21	38	But the husbandmen , seeing the son , said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him and possess his inheritance .
DARBY	Matthew	21	39	And they took him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him .
DARBY	Matthew	21	40	When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes , what shall he do to those husbandmen ?
DARBY	Matthew	21	41	They say to him , He will miserably destroy those evil [ men ] , and let out the vineyard to other husbandmen , who shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
DARBY	Matthew	21	42	Jesus says to them , Have ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which they that builded rejected , this has become the corner-stone : this is of [ the ] Lord , and it is wonderful in our eyes ?
DARBY	Matthew	21	43	Therefore I say to you , that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it .
DARBY	Matthew	21	44	And he that falls on this stone shall be broken , but on whomsoever it shall fall , it shall grind him to powder .
DARBY	Matthew	21	45	And the chief priests and the Pharisees , having heard his parables , knew that he spoke about them .
DARBY	Matthew	21	46	And seeking to lay hold of him , they were afraid of the crowds , because they held him for a prophet .
DARBY	Matthew	22	22	And when they heard [ him ] , they wondered , and left him , and went away .
DARBY	Matthew	22	2	The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who made a wedding feast for his son ,
DARBY	Matthew	22	3	and sent his bondmen to call the persons invited to the wedding feast , and they would not come .
DARBY	Matthew	22	4	Again he sent other bondmen , saying , Say to the persons invited , Behold , I have prepared my dinner ; my oxen and my fatted beasts are killed , and all things ready ; come to the wedding feast .
DARBY	Matthew	22	5	But they made light of it , and went , one to his own land , and another to his commerce .
DARBY	Matthew	22	6	And the rest , laying hold of his bondmen , ill-treated and slew [ them ] .
DARBY	Matthew	22	7	And [ when ] the king [ heard of it he ] was wroth , and having sent his forces , destroyed those murderers and burned their city .
DARBY	Matthew	22	8	Then he says to his bondmen , The wedding feast is ready , but those invited were not worthy ;
DARBY	Matthew	22	9	go therefore into the thoroughfares of the highways , and as many as ye shall find invite to the wedding feast .
DARBY	Matthew	22	10	And those bondmen went out into the highways , and brought together all as many as they found , both evil and good ; and the wedding feast was furnished with guests .
DARBY	Matthew	22	11	And the king , having gone in to see the guests , beheld there a man not clothed with a wedding garment .
DARBY	Matthew	22	12	And he says to him , [ My ] friend , how camest thou in here not having on a wedding garment ? But he was speechless .
DARBY	Matthew	22	13	Then said the king to the servants , Bind him feet and hands , and take him away , and cast him out into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
DARBY	Matthew	22	14	For many are called ones , but few chosen ones .
DARBY	Matthew	22	15	Then went the Pharisees and held a council how they might ensnare him in speaking .
DARBY	Matthew	22	16	And they send out to him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , Teacher , we know that thou art true and teachest the way of God in truth , and carest not for any one , for thou regardest not men 's person ;
DARBY	Matthew	22	17	tell us therefore what thou thinkest : Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ?
DARBY	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus , knowing their wickedness , said , Why tempt ye me , hypocrites ?
DARBY	Matthew	22	19	Shew me the money of the tribute . And they presented to him a denarius .
DARBY	Matthew	22	20	And he says to them , Whose [ is ] this image and superscription ?
DARBY	Matthew	22	21	They say to him , Caesar 's . Then he says to them , Pay then what is Caesar 's to Caesar , and what is God 's to God .
DARBY	Matthew	22	23	On that day came to him Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection ; and they demanded of him ,
DARBY	Matthew	22	24	saying , Teacher , Moses said , If any one die , not having children , his brother shall marry his wife and shall raise up seed to his brother .
DARBY	Matthew	22	25	Now there were with us seven brethren ; and the first having married died , and not having seed , left his wife to his brother .
DARBY	Matthew	22	26	In like manner also the second and the third , unto the seven .
DARBY	Matthew	22	27	And last of all the woman also died .
DARBY	Matthew	22	28	In the resurrection therefore of which of the seven shall she be wife , for all had her ?
DARBY	Matthew	22	29	And Jesus answering said to them , Ye err , not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God .
DARBY	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are as angels of God in heaven .
DARBY	Matthew	22	31	But concerning the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read what was spoken to you by God , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	22	32	* I * am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not God of [ the ] dead , but of [ the ] living .
DARBY	Matthew	22	33	And when the crowds heard [ it ] they were astonished at his doctrine .
DARBY	Matthew	22	34	But the Pharisees , having heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , were gathered together .
DARBY	Matthew	22	35	And one of them , a lawyer , demanded , tempting him , and saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	22	36	Teacher , which is the great commandment in the law ?
DARBY	Matthew	22	37	And he said to him , Thou shalt love [ the ] Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy understanding .
DARBY	Matthew	22	38	This is [ the ] great and first commandment .
DARBY	Matthew	22	39	And [ the ] second is like it , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
DARBY	Matthew	22	40	On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets hang .
DARBY	Matthew	22	41	And the Pharisees being gathered together , Jesus demanded of them ,
DARBY	Matthew	22	42	saying , What think ye concerning the Christ ? whose son is he ? They say to him , David 's .
DARBY	Matthew	22	43	He says to them , How then does David in Spirit call him Lord , saying ,
DARBY	Matthew	22	44	The Lord said to my Lord , Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies under thy feet ?
DARBY	Matthew	22	45	If therefore David call him Lord , how is he his son ?
DARBY	Matthew	22	46	And no one was able to answer him a word , nor did any one dare from that day to question him any more .
DARBY	Matthew	23	23	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin , and ye have left aside the weightier matters of the law , judgment and mercy and faith : these ye ought to have done and not have left those aside .
DARBY	Matthew	23	2	saying , The scribes and the Pharisees have set themselves down in Moses ' seat :
DARBY	Matthew	23	3	all things therefore , whatever they may tell you , do and keep . But do not after their works , for they say and do not ,
DARBY	Matthew	23	4	but bind burdens heavy and hard to bear , and lay them on the shoulders of men , but will not move them with their finger .
DARBY	Matthew	23	5	And all their works they do to be seen of men : for they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders [ of their garments ] ,
DARBY	Matthew	23	6	and love the chief place in feasts and the first seats in the synagogues ,
DARBY	Matthew	23	7	and salutations in the market-places , and to be called of men , Rabbi , Rabbi .
DARBY	Matthew	23	8	But * ye * , be not ye called Rabbi ; for one is your instructor , and all * ye * are brethren .
DARBY	Matthew	23	9	And call not [ any one ] your father upon the earth ; for one is your Father , he who is in the heavens .
DARBY	Matthew	23	10	Neither be called instructors , for one is your instructor , the Christ .
DARBY	Matthew	23	11	But the greatest of you shall be your servant .
DARBY	Matthew	23	12	And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled , and whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted .
DARBY	Matthew	23	13	But woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men ; for * ye * do not enter , nor do ye suffer those that are entering to go in .
DARBY	Matthew	23	15	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye compass the sea and the dry [ land ] to make one proselyte , and when he is become [ such ] , ye make him twofold more [ the ] son of hell than yourselves .
DARBY	Matthew	23	16	Woe to you , blind guides , who say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor .
DARBY	Matthew	23	17	Fools and blind , for which is greater , the gold , or the temple which sanctifies the gold ?
DARBY	Matthew	23	18	And , Whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it is a debtor .
DARBY	Matthew	23	19	[ Fools and ] blind ones , for which is greater , the gift , or the altar which sanctifies the gift ?
DARBY	Matthew	23	20	He therefore that swears by the altar swears by it and by all things that are upon it .
DARBY	Matthew	23	21	And he that swears by the temple swears by it and by him that dwells in it .
DARBY	Matthew	23	22	And he that swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him that sits upon it .
DARBY	Matthew	23	24	Blind guides , who strain out the gnat , but drink down the camel .
DARBY	Matthew	23	25	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the dish , but within they are full of rapine and intemperance .
DARBY	Matthew	23	26	Blind Pharisee , make clean first the inside of the cup and of the dish , that their outside also may become clean .
DARBY	Matthew	23	27	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye are like whited sepulchres , which appear beautiful outwardly , but within are full of dead men 's bones and all uncleanness .
DARBY	Matthew	23	28	Thus also * ye * , outwardly ye appear righteous to men , but within are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness .
DARBY	Matthew	23	29	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the just ,
DARBY	Matthew	23	30	and ye say , If we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
DARBY	Matthew	23	31	So that ye bear witness of yourselves that ye are sons of those who slew the prophets :
DARBY	Matthew	23	32	and * ye * , fill ye up the measure of your fathers .
DARBY	Matthew	23	33	Serpents , offspring of vipers , how should ye escape the judgment of hell ?
DARBY	Matthew	23	34	Therefore , behold , * I * send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes ; and [ some ] of them ye will kill and crucify , and [ some ] of them ye will scourge in your synagogues , and will persecute from city to city ;
DARBY	Matthew	23	35	so that all righteous blood shed upon the earth should come upon * you * , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
DARBY	Matthew	23	36	Verily I say unto you , All these things shall come upon this generation .
DARBY	Matthew	23	37	Jerusalem , Jerusalem , [ the city ] that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her , how often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
DARBY	Matthew	23	38	Behold , your house is left unto you desolate ;
DARBY	Matthew	23	39	for I say unto you , Ye shall in no wise see me henceforth until ye say , Blessed [ be ] he that comes in the name of [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Matthew	24	24	For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall give great signs and wonders , so as to mislead , if possible , even the elect .
DARBY	Matthew	24	2	And he answering said to them , Do ye not see all these things ? Verily I say to you , Not a stone shall be left here upon a stone which shall not be thrown down .
DARBY	Matthew	24	3	And as he was sitting upon the mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be , and what is the sign of thy coming and [ the ] completion of the age ?
DARBY	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answering said to them , See that no one mislead you .
DARBY	Matthew	24	5	For many shall come in my name , saying , * I * am the Christ , and they shall mislead many .
DARBY	Matthew	24	6	But ye will hear of wars and rumours of wars . See that ye be not disturbed ; for all [ these things ] must take place , but it is not yet the end .
DARBY	Matthew	24	7	For nation shall rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be famines and pestilences , and earthquakes in divers places .
DARBY	Matthew	24	8	But all these [ are the ] beginning of throes .
DARBY	Matthew	24	9	Then shall they deliver you up to tribulation , and shall kill you ; and ye will be hated of all the nations for my name 's sake .
DARBY	Matthew	24	10	And then will many be offended , and will deliver one another up , and hate one another ;
DARBY	Matthew	24	11	and many false prophets shall arise and shall mislead many ;
DARBY	Matthew	24	12	and because lawlessness shall prevail , the love of the most shall grow cold ;
DARBY	Matthew	24	13	but he that has endured to the end , * he * shall be saved .
DARBY	Matthew	24	14	And these glad tidings of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole habitable earth , for a witness to all the nations , and then shall come the end .
DARBY	Matthew	24	15	When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation , which is spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in [ what is a ] holy place , ( he that reads let him understand , )
DARBY	Matthew	24	16	then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains ;
DARBY	Matthew	24	17	let not him that is on the house come down to take the things out of his house ;
DARBY	Matthew	24	18	and let not him that is in the field turn back to take his garment .
DARBY	Matthew	24	19	But woe to those that are with child , and those that give suck in those days .
DARBY	Matthew	24	20	But pray that your flight may not be in winter time nor on sabbath :
DARBY	Matthew	24	21	for then shall there be great tribulation , such as has not been from [ the ] beginning of [ the ] world until now , nor ever shall be ;
DARBY	Matthew	24	22	and if those days had not been cut short , no flesh had been saved ; but on account of the elect those days shall be cut short .
DARBY	Matthew	24	23	Then if any one say to you , Behold , here is the Christ , or here , believe [ it ] not .
DARBY	Matthew	24	25	Behold , I have told you beforehand .
DARBY	Matthew	24	26	If therefore they say to you , Behold , he is in the desert , go not forth ; behold , [ he is ] in the inner chambers , do not believe [ it ] .
DARBY	Matthew	24	27	For as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west , so shall be the coming of the Son of man .
DARBY	Matthew	24	28	[ For ] wherever the carcase is , there will be gathered the eagles .
DARBY	Matthew	24	29	But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened , and the moon not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken .
DARBY	Matthew	24	30	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven ; and then shall all the tribes of the land lament , and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
DARBY	Matthew	24	31	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from [ the one ] extremity of [ the ] heavens to [ the other ] extremity of them .
DARBY	Matthew	24	32	But learn the parable from the fig-tree : When already its branch becomes tender and produces leaves , ye know that the summer is near .
DARBY	Matthew	24	33	Thus also * ye * , when ye see all these things , know that it is near , at the doors .
DARBY	Matthew	24	34	Verily I say to you , This generation will not have passed away until all these things shall have taken place .
DARBY	Matthew	24	35	The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall in no wise pass away .
DARBY	Matthew	24	36	But of that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of the heavens , but [ my ] Father alone .
DARBY	Matthew	24	37	But as the days of Noe , so also shall be the coming of the Son of man .
DARBY	Matthew	24	38	For as they were in the days which were before the flood , eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day on which Noe entered into the ark ,
DARBY	Matthew	24	39	and they knew not till the flood came and took all away ; thus also shall be the coming of the Son of man .
DARBY	Matthew	24	40	Then two shall be in the field , one is taken and one is left ;
DARBY	Matthew	24	41	two [ women ] grinding at the mill , one is taken and one is left .
DARBY	Matthew	24	42	Watch therefore , for ye know not in what hour your Lord comes .
DARBY	Matthew	24	43	But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming , he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be dug through [ into ] .
DARBY	Matthew	24	44	Wherefore * ye * also , be ye ready , for in that hour that ye think not the Son of man comes .
DARBY	Matthew	24	45	Who then is the faithful and prudent bondman whom his lord has set over his household , to give them food in season ?
DARBY	Matthew	24	46	Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus .
DARBY	Matthew	24	47	Verily I say unto you , that he will set him over all his substance .
DARBY	Matthew	24	48	But if that evil bondman should say in his heart , My lord delays to come ,
DARBY	Matthew	24	49	and begin to beat his fellow-bondmen , and eat and drink with the drunken ;
DARBY	Matthew	24	50	the lord of that bondman shall come in a day when he does not expect it , and in an hour he knows not of ,
DARBY	Matthew	24	51	and shall cut him in two and appoint his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
DARBY	Matthew	25	25	and being afraid I went away and hid thy talent in the earth ; behold , thou hast that which is thine .
DARBY	Matthew	25	2	And five of them were prudent and five foolish .
DARBY	Matthew	25	3	They that were foolish took their torches and did not take oil with them ;
DARBY	Matthew	25	4	but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their torches .
DARBY	Matthew	25	5	Now the bridegroom tarrying , they all grew heavy and slept .
DARBY	Matthew	25	6	But in [ the ] middle of [ the ] night there was a cry , Behold , the bridegroom ; go forth to meet him .
DARBY	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their torches .
DARBY	Matthew	25	8	And the foolish said to the prudent , Give us of your oil , for our torches are going out .
DARBY	Matthew	25	9	But the prudent answered saying , [ We can not , ] lest it might not suffice for us and for you . Go rather to those that sell , and buy for yourselves .
DARBY	Matthew	25	10	But as they went away to buy , the bridegroom came , and the [ ones that were ] ready went in with him to the wedding feast , and the door was shut .
DARBY	Matthew	25	11	Afterwards come also the rest of the virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us ;
DARBY	Matthew	25	12	but he answering said , Verily I say unto you , I do not know you .
DARBY	Matthew	25	13	Watch therefore , for ye know not the day nor the hour .
DARBY	Matthew	25	14	For [ it is ] as [ if ] a man going away out of a country called his own bondmen and delivered to them his substance .
DARBY	Matthew	25	15	And to one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to each according to his particular ability , and immediately went away out of the country .
DARBY	Matthew	25	16	And he that had received the five talents went and trafficked with them , and made five other talents .
DARBY	Matthew	25	17	In like manner also he that [ had received ] the two , [ he also ] gained two others .
DARBY	Matthew	25	18	But he that had received the one went and dug in the earth , and hid the money of his lord .
DARBY	Matthew	25	19	And after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes and reckons with them .
DARBY	Matthew	25	20	And he that had received the five talents came to [ him ] and brought five other talents , saying , [ My ] lord , thou deliveredst me five talents ; behold , I have gained five other talents besides them .
DARBY	Matthew	25	21	His lord said to him , Well , good and faithful bondman , thou wast faithful over a few things , I will set thee over many things : enter into the joy of thy lord .
DARBY	Matthew	25	22	And he also that had received the two talents came to [ him ] and said , [ My ] lord , thou deliveredst me two talents ; behold , I have gained two other talents besides them .
DARBY	Matthew	25	23	His lord said to him , Well , good and faithful bondman , thou wast faithful over a few things , I will set thee over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
DARBY	Matthew	25	24	And he also that had received the one talent coming to [ him ] said , [ My ] lord , I knew thee that thou art a hard man , reaping where thou hadst not sowed , and gathering from where thou hadst not scattered ,
DARBY	Matthew	25	26	And his lord answering said to him , Wicked and slothful bondman , thou knewest that I reap where I had not sowed , and gather from where I had not scattered ;
DARBY	Matthew	25	27	thou oughtest then to have put my money to the money-changers , and when I came I should have got what is mine with interest .
DARBY	Matthew	25	28	Take therefore the talent from him , and give it to him that has the ten talents :
DARBY	Matthew	25	29	for to every one that has shall be given , and he shall be in abundance ; but from him that has not , that even which he has shall be taken from him .
DARBY	Matthew	25	30	And cast out the useless bondman into the outer darkness ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
DARBY	Matthew	25	31	But when the Son of man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , then shall he sit down upon his throne of glory ,
DARBY	Matthew	25	32	and all the nations shall be gathered before him ; and he shall separate them from one another , as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats ;
DARBY	Matthew	25	33	and he will set the sheep on his right hand , and the goats on [ his ] left .
DARBY	Matthew	25	34	Then shall the King say to those on his right hand , Come , blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from [ the ] world 's foundation :
DARBY	Matthew	25	35	for I hungered , and ye gave me to eat ; I thirsted , and ye gave me to drink ; I was a stranger , and ye took me in ;
DARBY	Matthew	25	36	naked , and ye clothed me ; I was ill , and ye visited me ; I was in prison , and ye came to me .
DARBY	Matthew	25	37	Then shall the righteous answer him saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungering , and nourished thee ; or thirsting , and gave thee to drink ?
DARBY	Matthew	25	38	and when saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ; or naked , and clothed thee ?
DARBY	Matthew	25	39	and when saw we thee ill , or in prison , and came to thee ?
DARBY	Matthew	25	40	And the King answering shall say to them , Verily , I say to you , Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it to me .
DARBY	Matthew	25	41	Then shall he say also to those on the left , Go from me , cursed , into eternal fire , prepared for the devil and his angels :
DARBY	Matthew	25	42	for I hungered , and ye gave me not to eat ; I thirsted , and ye gave me not to drink ;
DARBY	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger , and ye took me not in ; naked , and ye did not clothe me ; ill , and in prison , and ye did not visit me .
DARBY	Matthew	25	44	Then shall * they * also answer saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungering , or thirsting , or a stranger , or naked , or ill , or in prison , and have not ministered to thee ?
DARBY	Matthew	25	45	Then shall he answer them saying , Verily I say to you , Inasmuch as ye have not done it to one of these least , neither have ye done it to me .
DARBY	Matthew	25	46	And these shall go away into eternal punishment , and the righteous into life eternal .
DARBY	Matthew	26	26	And as they were eating , Jesus , having taken [ the ] bread and blessed , broke [ it ] and gave [ it ] to the disciples , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
DARBY	Matthew	26	2	Ye know that after two days the passover takes place , and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified .
DARBY	Matthew	26	3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together to the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas ,
DARBY	Matthew	26	4	and took counsel together in order that they might seize Jesus by subtlety and kill him ;
DARBY	Matthew	26	5	but they said , Not in the feast , that there be not a tumult among the people .
DARBY	Matthew	26	6	But Jesus being in Bethany , in Simon the leper 's house ,
DARBY	Matthew	26	7	a woman , having an alabaster flask of very precious ointment , came to him and poured it out upon his head as he lay at table .
DARBY	Matthew	26	8	But the disciples seeing it became indignant , saying , To what end [ was ] this waste ?
DARBY	Matthew	26	9	for this might have been sold for much and been given to the poor .
DARBY	Matthew	26	10	But Jesus knowing [ it ] said to them , Why do ye trouble the woman ? for she has wrought a good work toward me .
DARBY	Matthew	26	11	For ye have the poor always with you , but me ye have not always .
DARBY	Matthew	26	12	For in pouring out this ointment on my body , she has done it for my burying .
DARBY	Matthew	26	13	Verily I say to you , Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world , that also which this [ woman ] has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
DARBY	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the twelve , he who was called Judas Iscariote , went to the chief priests
DARBY	Matthew	26	15	and said , What are ye willing to give me , and * I * will deliver him up to you ? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver .
DARBY	Matthew	26	16	And from that time he sought a good opportunity that he might deliver him up .
DARBY	Matthew	26	17	Now on the first [ day ] of [ the feast of ] unleavened bread , the disciples came to Jesus , saying , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
DARBY	Matthew	26	18	And he said , Go into the city unto such a one , and say to him , The Teacher says , My time is near , I will keep the passover in thy house with my disciples .
DARBY	Matthew	26	19	And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them , and they prepared the passover .
DARBY	Matthew	26	20	And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve .
DARBY	Matthew	26	21	And as they were eating he said , Verily I say to you , that one of you shall deliver me up .
DARBY	Matthew	26	22	And being exceedingly grieved they began to say to him , each of them , Is it * I * , Lord ?
DARBY	Matthew	26	23	But he answering said , He that dips his hand with me in the dish , * he * it is who shall deliver me up .
DARBY	Matthew	26	24	The Son of man goes indeed , according as it is written concerning him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up ; it were good for that man if he had not been born .
DARBY	Matthew	26	25	And Judas , who delivered him up , answering said , Is it * I * , Rabbi ? He says to him , * Thou * hast said .
DARBY	Matthew	26	27	And having taken [ the ] cup and given thanks , he gave [ it ] to them , saying , Drink ye all of it .
DARBY	Matthew	26	28	For this is my blood , that of the [ new ] covenant , that shed for many for remission of sins .
DARBY	Matthew	26	29	But I say to you , that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father .
DARBY	Matthew	26	30	And having sung a hymn , they went out to the mount of Olives .
DARBY	Matthew	26	31	Then saith Jesus to them , All * ye * shall be offended in me during this night . For it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad .
DARBY	Matthew	26	32	But after that I shall be risen , I will go before you to Galilee .
DARBY	Matthew	26	33	And Peter answering said to him , If all shall be offended in thee , * I * will never be offended .
DARBY	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said to him , Verily I say to thee , that during this night , before [ the ] cock shall crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
DARBY	Matthew	26	35	Peter says to him , If I should needs die with thee , I will in no wise deny thee . Likewise said all the disciples also .
DARBY	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane , and says to the disciples , Sit here until I go away and pray yonder .
DARBY	Matthew	26	37	And taking with [ him ] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed .
DARBY	Matthew	26	38	Then he says to them , My soul is very sorrowful even unto death ; remain here and watch with me .
DARBY	Matthew	26	39	And going forward a little he fell upon his face , praying and saying , My Father , if it be possible let this cup pass from me ; but not as * I * will , but as * thou * [ wilt ] .
DARBY	Matthew	26	40	And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping , and says to Peter , Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me ?
DARBY	Matthew	26	41	Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed [ is ] ready , but the flesh weak .
DARBY	Matthew	26	42	Again going away a second time he prayed saying , My Father , if this can not pass [ from me ] unless I drink it , thy will be done .
DARBY	Matthew	26	43	And coming he found them again sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
DARBY	Matthew	26	44	And leaving them , he went away again and prayed the third time , saying the same thing .
DARBY	Matthew	26	45	Then he comes to the disciples and says to them , Sleep on now and take your rest ; behold , the hour has drawn nigh , and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners .
DARBY	Matthew	26	46	Arise , let us go ; behold , he that delivers me up has drawn nigh .
DARBY	Matthew	26	47	And while he was yet speaking , behold , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people .
DARBY	Matthew	26	48	Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , he it is : seize him .
DARBY	Matthew	26	49	And immediately coming up to Jesus he said , Hail , Rabbi , and covered him with kisses .
DARBY	Matthew	26	50	But Jesus said to him , [ My ] friend , for what purpose art thou come ? Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him .
DARBY	Matthew	26	51	And behold , one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword , and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear .
DARBY	Matthew	26	52	Then saith Jesus to him , Return thy sword to its place ; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword .
DARBY	Matthew	26	53	Or thinkest thou that I can not now call upon my Father , and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels ?
DARBY	Matthew	26	54	How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be ?
DARBY	Matthew	26	55	In that hour Jesus said to the crowds , Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me ? I sat daily [ with you ] teaching in the temple , and ye did not seize me .
DARBY	Matthew	26	56	But all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled . Then all the disciples left him and fled .
DARBY	Matthew	26	57	Now they that had seized Jesus led [ him ] away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
DARBY	Matthew	26	58	And Peter followed him at a distance , even to the palace of the high priest , and entering in sat with the officers to see the end .
DARBY	Matthew	26	59	And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrim sought false witness against Jesus , so that they might put him to death .
DARBY	Matthew	26	60	And they found none , though many false witnesses came forward . But at the last two false witnesses came forward
DARBY	Matthew	26	61	and said , * He * said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and in three days build it .
DARBY	Matthew	26	62	And the high priest standing up said to him , Answerest thou nothing ? What do these witness against thee ?
DARBY	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus was silent . And the high priest answering said to him , I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if * thou * art the Christ the Son of God .
DARBY	Matthew	26	64	Jesus says to him , * Thou * hast said . Moreover , I say to you , From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power , and coming on the clouds of heaven .
DARBY	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He has blasphemed : what need have we any more of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard the blasphemy .
DARBY	Matthew	26	66	What think ye ? And they answering said , He is liable to the penalty of death .
DARBY	Matthew	26	67	Then they spit in his face , and buffeted him , and some struck him with the palms of their hand ,
DARBY	Matthew	26	68	saying , Prophesy to us , Christ , Who is it who struck thee ?
DARBY	Matthew	26	69	But Peter sat without in the palace-court ; and a maid came to him , saying , And * thou * wast with Jesus the Galilaean .
DARBY	Matthew	26	70	But he denied before all , saying , I do not know what thou sayest .
DARBY	Matthew	26	71	And when he had gone out into the entrance , another [ maid ] saw him , and says to those there , This [ man ] also was with Jesus the Nazaraean .
DARBY	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied with an oath : I do not know the man .
DARBY	Matthew	26	73	And after a little , those who stood [ there ] , coming to [ him ] , said to Peter , Truly * thou * too art of them , for also thy speech makes thee manifest .
DARBY	Matthew	26	74	Then he began to curse and to swear , I know not the man . And immediately [ the ] cock crew .
DARBY	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , who had said [ to him ] , Before [ the ] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice . And he went forth without , and wept bitterly .
DARBY	Matthew	27	27	Then the soldiers of the governor , having taken Jesus with [ them ] to the praetorium , gathered against him the whole band ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	2	And having bound him they led him away , and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate , the governor .
DARBY	Matthew	27	3	Then Judas , who delivered him up , seeing that he had been condemned , filled with remorse , returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	4	saying , I have sinned [ in ] having delivered up guiltless blood . But they said , What is that to us ? see * thou * [ to that ] .
DARBY	Matthew	27	5	And having cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , he left the place , and went away and hanged himself .
DARBY	Matthew	27	6	And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said , It is not lawful to cast them into the Corban , since it is [ the ] price of blood .
DARBY	Matthew	27	7	And having taken counsel , they bought with them the field of the potter for a burying-ground for strangers .
DARBY	Matthew	27	8	Wherefore that field has been called Blood-field unto this day .
DARBY	Matthew	27	9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet , saying , And I took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was set a price on , whom [ they who were ] of the sons of Israel had set a price on ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	10	and they gave them for the field of the potter , according as [ the ] Lord commanded me .
DARBY	Matthew	27	11	But Jesus stood before the governor . And the governor questioned him , saying , Art * thou * the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said to him , Thou sayest .
DARBY	Matthew	27	12	And when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders , he answered nothing .
DARBY	Matthew	27	13	Then says Pilate to him , Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
DARBY	Matthew	27	14	And he answered him not so much as one word , so that the governor wondered exceedingly .
DARBY	Matthew	27	15	Now at [ the ] feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd , whom they would .
DARBY	Matthew	27	16	And they had then a notable prisoner , named Barabbas .
DARBY	Matthew	27	17	They therefore being gathered together , Pilate said to them , Whom will ye that I release to you , Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ?
DARBY	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that they had delivered him up through envy .
DARBY	Matthew	27	19	But , as he was sitting on the judgment-seat , his wife sent to him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that righteous [ man ] ; for I have suffered to-day many things in a dream because of him .
DARBY	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should beg for Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
DARBY	Matthew	27	21	And the governor answering said to them , Which of the two will ye that I release unto you ? And they said , Barabbas .
DARBY	Matthew	27	22	Pilate says to them , What then shall I do with Jesus , who is called Christ ? They all say , Let him be crucified .
DARBY	Matthew	27	23	And the governor said , What evil then has he done ? But they cried more than ever , saying , Let him be crucified .
DARBY	Matthew	27	24	And Pilate , seeing that it availed nothing , but that rather a tumult was arising , having taken water , washed his hands before the crowd , saying , I am guiltless of the blood of this righteous one : see * ye * [ to it ] .
DARBY	Matthew	27	25	And all the people answering said , His blood [ be ] on us and on our children .
DARBY	Matthew	27	26	Then he released to them Barabbas ; but Jesus , having scourged [ him ] , he delivered up that he might be crucified .
DARBY	Matthew	27	28	and having taken off his garment , put on him a scarlet cloak ;
DARBY	Matthew	27	29	and having woven a crown out of thorns , they put it on his head , and a reed in his right hand ; and , bowing the knee before him , they mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews !
DARBY	Matthew	27	30	And having spit upon him , they took the reed and beat [ him ] on his head .
DARBY	Matthew	27	31	And when they had mocked him , they took the cloak off him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him away to crucify .
DARBY	Matthew	27	32	And as they went forth they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name ; him they compelled to go [ with them ] that he might bear his cross .
DARBY	Matthew	27	33	And having come to a place called Golgotha , which means Place of a skull ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	34	they gave to him to drink vinegar mingled with gall ; and having tasted [ it ] , he would not drink .
DARBY	Matthew	27	35	And having crucified him , they parted his clothes amongst [ themselves ] , casting lots .
DARBY	Matthew	27	36	And sitting down , they kept guard over him there .
DARBY	Matthew	27	37	And they set up over his head his accusation written : This is Jesus , the King of the Jews .
DARBY	Matthew	27	38	Then are crucified with him two robbers , one on the right hand and one on the left .
DARBY	Matthew	27	39	But the passers-by reviled him , shaking their heads
DARBY	Matthew	27	40	and saying , Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days , save thyself . If thou art Son of God , descend from the cross .
DARBY	Matthew	27	41	[ And ] in like manner the chief priests also , mocking , with the scribes and elders , said ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	42	He saved others , himself he can not save . He is King of Israel : let him descend now from the cross , and we will believe on him .
DARBY	Matthew	27	43	He trusted upon God ; let him save him now if he will [ have ] him . For he said , I am Son of God .
DARBY	Matthew	27	44	And the robbers also who had been crucified with him cast the same reproaches on him .
DARBY	Matthew	27	45	Now from [ the ] sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land until [ the ] ninth hour ;
DARBY	Matthew	27	46	but about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
DARBY	Matthew	27	47	And some of those who stood there , when they heard [ it ] , said , This [ man ] calls for Elias .
DARBY	Matthew	27	48	And immediately one of them running and getting a sponge , having filled [ it ] with vinegar and fixed [ it ] on a reed , gave him to drink .
DARBY	Matthew	27	49	But the rest said , Let be ; let us see if Elias comes to save him .
DARBY	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus , having again cried with a loud voice , gave up the ghost .
DARBY	Matthew	27	51	And lo , the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom , and the earth was shaken , and the rocks were rent ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	52	and the tombs were opened ; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	53	and going out of the tombs after his arising , entered into the holy city and appeared unto many .
DARBY	Matthew	27	54	But the centurion , and they who were with him on guard over Jesus , seeing the earthquake and the things that took place , feared greatly , saying , Truly this [ man ] was Son of God .
DARBY	Matthew	27	55	And there were there many women beholding from afar off , who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to him ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	56	among whom was Mary of Magdala , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
DARBY	Matthew	27	57	Now when even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea , his name Joseph , who also himself was a disciple to Jesus .
DARBY	Matthew	27	58	* He * , going to Pilate , begged the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up .
DARBY	Matthew	27	59	And Joseph having got the body , wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn in the rock ; and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , went away .
DARBY	Matthew	27	61	But Mary of Magdala was there , and the other Mary , sitting opposite the sepulchre .
DARBY	Matthew	27	62	Now on the morrow , which is after the preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate ,
DARBY	Matthew	27	63	saying , Sir , we have called to mind that that deceiver said when he was still alive , After three days I arise .
DARBY	Matthew	27	64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured until the third day , lest his disciples should come and steal him away , and say to the people , He is risen from the dead ; and the last error shall be worse than the first .
DARBY	Matthew	27	65	And Pilate said to them , Ye have a watch : go , secure it as well as ye know how .
DARBY	Matthew	27	66	And they went and secured the sepulchre , having sealed the stone , with the watch [ besides ] .
DARBY	Matthew	28	28	Now late on sabbath , as it was the dusk of the next day after sabbath , came Mary of Magdala and the other Mary to look at the sepulchre .
DARBY	Matthew	28	2	And behold , there was a great earthquake ; for an angel of [ the ] Lord , descending out of heaven , came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it .
DARBY	Matthew	28	3	And his look was as lightning , and his clothing white as snow .
DARBY	Matthew	28	4	And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men .
DARBY	Matthew	28	5	And the angel answering said to the women , Fear not * ye * , for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one .
DARBY	Matthew	28	6	He is not here , for he is risen , as he said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay .
DARBY	Matthew	28	7	And go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and behold , he goes before you into Galilee , there shall ye see him . Behold , I have told you .
DARBY	Matthew	28	8	And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , they ran to bring his disciples word .
DARBY	Matthew	28	9	And as they went to bring his disciples word , behold also , Jesus met them , saying , Hail ! And they coming up took him by the feet , and did him homage .
DARBY	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus says to them , Fear not ; go , bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee , and there they shall see me .
DARBY	Matthew	28	11	And as they went , behold , some of the watch went into the city , and brought word to the chief priests of all that had taken place .
DARBY	Matthew	28	12	And having assembled with the elders , and having taken counsel , they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers ,
DARBY	Matthew	28	13	saying , Say that his disciples coming by night stole him [ while ] we [ were ] sleeping .
DARBY	Matthew	28	14	And if this should come to the hearing of the governor , * we * will persuade him , and save * you * from all anxiety .
DARBY	Matthew	28	15	And they took the money and did as they had been taught . And this report is current among the Jews until this day .
DARBY	Matthew	28	16	But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them .
DARBY	Matthew	28	17	And when they saw him , they did homage to him : but some doubted .
DARBY	Matthew	28	18	And Jesus coming up spoke to them , saying , All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth .
DARBY	Matthew	28	19	Go [ therefore ] and make disciples of all the nations , baptising them to the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit ;
DARBY	Matthew	28	20	teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you . And behold , * I * am with you all the days , until the completion of the age .
DARBY	Mark	1	1	Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ , Son of God ;
DARBY	Mark	1	2	as it is written in [ Isaiah ] the prophet , Behold , * I * send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way .
DARBY	Mark	1	3	Voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare the way of [ the ] Lord , make his paths straight .
DARBY	Mark	1	4	There came John baptising in the wilderness , and preaching [ the ] baptism of repentance for remission of sins .
DARBY	Mark	1	5	And there went out to him all the district of Judaea , and all they of Jerusalem , and were baptised by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
DARBY	Mark	1	6	And John was clothed in camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins , and ate locusts and wild honey .
DARBY	Mark	1	7	And he preached , saying , There comes he that is mightier than I after me , the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to stoop down and unloose .
DARBY	Mark	1	8	* I * indeed have baptised you with water , but * he * shall baptise you with [ the ] Holy Spirit .
DARBY	Mark	1	9	And it came to pass in those days [ that ] Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptised by John at the Jordan .
DARBY	Mark	1	10	And straightway going up from the water , he saw the heavens parting asunder , and the Spirit , as a dove , descending upon him .
DARBY	Mark	1	11	And there came a voice out of the heavens : * Thou * art my beloved Son , in thee I have found my delight .
DARBY	Mark	1	12	And immediately the Spirit drives him out into the wilderness .
DARBY	Mark	1	13	And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan , and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered to him .
DARBY	Mark	1	14	But after John was delivered up , Jesus came into Galilee preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of God ,
DARBY	Mark	1	15	and saying , The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh ; repent and believe in the glad tidings .
DARBY	Mark	1	16	And walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon , and Andrew , [ Simon 's ] brother , casting out a net in the sea , for they were fishers .
DARBY	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said to them , Come after me , and I will make you become fishers of men ;
DARBY	Mark	1	18	and straightway leaving their trawl-nets they followed him .
DARBY	Mark	1	19	And going on thence a little , he saw James the [ son ] of Zebedee , and John his brother , and these [ were ] in the ship repairing the trawl-nets ;
DARBY	Mark	1	20	and straightway he called them ; and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , they went away after him .
DARBY	Mark	1	21	And they go into Capernaum . And straightway on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught .
DARBY	Mark	1	22	And they were astonished at his doctrine , for he taught them as having authority , and not as the scribes .
DARBY	Mark	1	23	And there was in their synagogue a man [ possessed ] by an unclean spirit , and he cried out
DARBY	Mark	1	24	saying , Eh ! what have we to do with thee , Jesus , Nazarene ? Art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the holy one of God .
DARBY	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace and come out of him .
DARBY	Mark	1	26	And the unclean spirit , having torn him , and uttered a cry with a loud voice , came out of him .
DARBY	Mark	1	27	And all were amazed , so that they questioned together among themselves , saying , What is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him .
DARBY	Mark	1	28	And his fame went out straightway into the whole region of Galilee around .
DARBY	Mark	1	29	And straightway going out of the synagogue , they came with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew .
DARBY	Mark	1	30	And the mother-in-law of Simon lay in a fever . And straightway they speak to him about her .
DARBY	Mark	1	31	And he went up to [ her ] and raised her up , having taken her by the hand , and straightway the fever left her , and she served them .
DARBY	Mark	1	32	But evening being come , when the sun had gone down , they brought to him all that were suffering , and those possessed by demons ;
DARBY	Mark	1	33	and the whole city was gathered together at the door .
DARBY	Mark	1	34	And he healed many suffering from various diseases ; and he cast out many demons , and did not suffer the demons to speak because they knew him .
DARBY	Mark	1	35	And rising in the morning long before day , he went out and went away into a desert place , and there prayed .
DARBY	Mark	1	36	And Simon and those with him went after him :
DARBY	Mark	1	37	and having found him , they say to him , All seek thee .
DARBY	Mark	1	38	And he says to them , Let us go elsewhere into the neighbouring country towns , that I may preach there also , for for this purpose am I come forth .
DARBY	Mark	1	39	And he was preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee , and casting out demons .
DARBY	Mark	1	40	And there comes to him a leper , beseeching him , and falling on his knees to him , and saying to him , If thou wilt thou canst cleanse me .
DARBY	Mark	1	41	But Jesus , moved with compassion , having stretched out his hand , touched him , and says to him , I will , be thou cleansed .
DARBY	Mark	1	42	And as he spoke straightway the leprosy left him , and he was cleansed .
DARBY	Mark	1	43	And having sharply charged him , he straightway sent him away ,
DARBY	Mark	1	44	and says to him , See thou say nothing to any one , but go , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing what Moses ordained , for a testimony to them .
DARBY	Mark	1	45	But he , having gone forth , began to proclaim [ it ] much , and to spread the matter abroad , so that he could no longer enter openly into the city , but was without in desert places , and they came to him from every side .
DARBY	Mark	2	2	and straightway many were gathered together , so that there was no longer any room , not even at the door ; and he spoke the word to them .
DARBY	Mark	2	3	And there come to him [ men ] bringing a paralytic , borne by four ;
DARBY	Mark	2	4	and , not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd , they uncovered the roof where he was , and having dug [ it ] up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay .
DARBY	Mark	2	5	But Jesus , seeing their faith , says to the paralytic , Child , thy sins are forgiven [ thee ] .
DARBY	Mark	2	6	But certain of the scribes were there sitting , and reasoning in their hearts ,
DARBY	Mark	2	7	Why does this [ man ] thus speak ? he blasphemes . Who is able to forgive sins except God alone ?
DARBY	Mark	2	8	And straightway Jesus , knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves , said to them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
DARBY	Mark	2	9	Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , [ Thy ] sins are forgiven [ thee ] ; or to say , Arise , and take up thy couch and walk ?
DARBY	Mark	2	10	But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins , he says to the paralytic ,
DARBY	Mark	2	11	To thee I say , Arise , take up thy couch and go to thine house .
DARBY	Mark	2	12	And he rose up straightway , and , having taken up his couch , went out before [ them ] all , so that all were amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it thus .
DARBY	Mark	2	13	And he went out again by the sea , and all the crowd came to him , and he taught them .
DARBY	Mark	2	14	And passing by , he saw Levi the [ son ] of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office , and says to him , Follow me . And he rose up and followed him .
DARBY	Mark	2	15	And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house , that many tax-gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples ; for they were many , and they followed him .
DARBY	Mark	2	16	And the scribes and the Pharisees , seeing him eating with sinners and tax-gatherers , said to his disciples , Why [ is it ] that he eats and drinks with tax-gatherers and sinners ?
DARBY	Mark	2	17	And Jesus having heard [ it ] says to them , They that are strong have not need of a physician , but those who are ill . I have not come to call righteous [ men ] , but sinners .
DARBY	Mark	2	18	And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting ; and they come and say to him , Why do the disciples of John and [ the disciples ] of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ?
DARBY	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said to them , Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they can not fast .
DARBY	Mark	2	20	But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them , and then shall they fast in that day .
DARBY	Mark	2	21	No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment : otherwise its new filling-up takes from the old [ stuff ] , and there is a worse rent .
DARBY	Mark	2	22	And no one puts new wine into old skins ; otherwise the wine bursts the skins , and the wine is poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but new wine is to be put into new skins .
DARBY	Mark	2	23	And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields ; and his disciples began to walk on , plucking the ears .
DARBY	Mark	2	24	And the Pharisees said to him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful ?
DARBY	Mark	2	25	And * he * said to them , Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered , * he * and those with him ,
DARBY	Mark	2	26	how he entered into the house of God , in [ the section of ] Abiathar [ the ] high priest , and ate the shew-bread , which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat , and gave even to those that were with him ?
DARBY	Mark	2	27	And he said to them , The sabbath was made on account of man , not man on account of the sabbath ;
DARBY	Mark	2	28	so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath also .
DARBY	Mark	3	3	And he says to the man who had his hand dried up , Rise up [ and come ] into the midst .
DARBY	Mark	3	2	And they watched him if he would heal him on the sabbath , that they might accuse him .
DARBY	Mark	3	4	And he says to them , Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? But they were silent .
DARBY	Mark	3	5	And looking round upon them with anger , distressed at the hardening of their heart , he says to the man , Stretch out thy hand . And he stretched [ it ] out , and his hand was restored .
DARBY	Mark	3	6	And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him , how they might destroy him .
DARBY	Mark	3	7	And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea ; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea ,
DARBY	Mark	3	8	and from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea and beyond the Jordan ; and they of around Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , having heard what things he did , came to him .
DARBY	Mark	3	9	And he spoke to his disciples , in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd , that they might not press upon him .
DARBY	Mark	3	10	For he healed many , so that they beset him that they might touch him , as many as had plagues .
DARBY	Mark	3	11	And the unclean spirits , when they beheld him , fell down before him , and cried saying , * Thou * art the Son of God .
DARBY	Mark	3	12	And he rebuked them much , that they might not make him manifest .
DARBY	Mark	3	13	And he goes up into the mountain , and calls whom he himself would , and they went to him .
DARBY	Mark	3	14	And he appointed twelve that they might be with him , and that he might send them to preach ,
DARBY	Mark	3	15	and to have power [ to heal diseases , and ] to cast out demons .
DARBY	Mark	3	16	And he gave to Simon the surname of Peter ;
DARBY	Mark	3	17	and James the [ son ] of Zebedee , and John the brother of James , and he gave them the surname of Boanerges , that is , Sons of thunder ;
DARBY	Mark	3	18	and Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the [ son ] of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Cananaean ,
DARBY	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariote , who also delivered him up . And they come to [ the ] house .
DARBY	Mark	3	20	And again a crowd comes together , so that they can not even eat bread .
DARBY	Mark	3	21	And his relatives having heard [ of it ] went out to lay hold on him , for they said , He is out of his mind .
DARBY	Mark	3	22	And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said , He has Beelzebub , and , By the prince of the demons he casts out demons .
DARBY	Mark	3	23	And having called them to [ him ] , he said to them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ?
DARBY	Mark	3	24	And if a kingdom has become divided against itself , that kingdom can not subsist .
DARBY	Mark	3	25	And if a house has become divided against itself , that house can not subsist .
DARBY	Mark	3	26	And if Satan rise up against himself , and is divided , he can not subsist , but has an end .
DARBY	Mark	3	27	But no one can , having entered into his house , plunder the goods of the strong [ man ] unless he first bind the strong [ man ] , and then he will plunder his house .
DARBY	Mark	3	28	Verily I say unto you , that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men , and all the injurious speeches [ with ] which they may speak injuriously ;
DARBY	Mark	3	29	but whosoever shall speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit , to eternity has no forgiveness ; but lies under the guilt of an everlasting sin ;
DARBY	Mark	3	30	—because they said , He has an unclean spirit .
DARBY	Mark	3	31	And his brethren and his mother come , and standing without sent to him calling him .
DARBY	Mark	3	32	And a crowd sat around him . And they said to him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren seek thee without .
DARBY	Mark	3	33	And he answered them , saying , Who is my mother or my brethren ?
DARBY	Mark	3	34	And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him , he says , Behold my mother and my brethren :
DARBY	Mark	3	35	for whosoever shall do the will of God , * he * is my brother , and sister , and mother .
DARBY	Mark	4	4	And it came to pass as he sowed , one fell by the wayside , and the birds came and devoured it .
DARBY	Mark	4	2	And he taught them many things in parables . And he said to them in his doctrine ,
DARBY	Mark	4	3	Hearken : Behold , the sower went forth to sow .
DARBY	Mark	4	5	And another fell on the rocky ground , where it had not much earth , and immediately it sprung up out [ of the ground ] because it had no depth of earth ;
DARBY	Mark	4	6	and when the sun arose it was burnt up , and because of its not having any root , it withered .
DARBY	Mark	4	7	And another fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
DARBY	Mark	4	8	And another fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing ; and bore , one thirty , and one sixty , and one a hundred .
DARBY	Mark	4	9	And he said , He that has ears to hear , let him hear .
DARBY	Mark	4	10	And when he was alone , those about him with the twelve asked him [ as to ] the parables .
DARBY	Mark	4	11	And he said to them , To you is given [ to know ] the mystery of the kingdom of God ; but to them who are without , all things are done in parables ,
DARBY	Mark	4	12	that beholding they may behold and not see , and hearing they may hear and not understand , lest it may be , they should be converted and they should be forgiven .
DARBY	Mark	4	13	And he says to them , Do ye not know this parable ? and how will ye be acquainted with all the parables ?
DARBY	Mark	4	14	The sower sows the word :
DARBY	Mark	4	15	and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown , and when they hear , immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them .
DARBY	Mark	4	16	And these are they in like manner who are sown upon the rocky places , who when they hear the word , immediately receive it with joy ,
DARBY	Mark	4	17	and they have no root in themselves , but are for a time : then , tribulation arising , or persecution on account of the word , immediately they are offended .
DARBY	Mark	4	18	And others are they who are sown among the thorns : these are they who have heard the word ,
DARBY	Mark	4	19	and the cares of life , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things , entering in , choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
DARBY	Mark	4	20	And these are they who have been sown on the good ground , such as hear the word and receive it , and bear fruit ; one thirty , and one sixty , and one a hundred [ fold ] .
DARBY	Mark	4	21	And he said to them , Does the lamp come that it should be put under the bushel or under the couch ? [ Is it ] not that it should be set upon the lamp-stand ?
DARBY	Mark	4	22	For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest ; nor does any secret thing take place , but that it should come to light .
DARBY	Mark	4	23	If any one have ears to hear , let him hear .
DARBY	Mark	4	24	And he said to them , Take heed what ye hear ; with what measure ye mete , it shall be meted to you ; and there shall be [ more ] added to you .
DARBY	Mark	4	25	For whosoever has , to him shall be given ; and he who has not , even what he has shall be taken from him .
DARBY	Mark	4	26	And he said , Thus is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast the seed upon the earth ,
DARBY	Mark	4	27	and should sleep and rise up night and day , and the seed should sprout and grow , he does not know how .
DARBY	Mark	4	28	The earth bears fruit of itself , first [ the ] blade , then an ear , then full corn in the ear .
DARBY	Mark	4	29	But when the fruit is produced , immediately he sends the sickle , for the harvest is come .
DARBY	Mark	4	30	And he said , How should we liken the kingdom of God , or with what comparison should we compare it ?
DARBY	Mark	4	31	As to a grain of mustard [ seed ] , which , when it is sown upon the earth , is less than all seeds which are upon the earth ,
DARBY	Mark	4	32	and when it has been sown , mounts up and becomes greater than all herbs , and produces great branches , so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shadow .
DARBY	Mark	4	33	And with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear ,
DARBY	Mark	4	34	but without a parable spoke he not to them ; and in private he explained all things to his disciples .
DARBY	Mark	4	35	And on that day , when evening was come , he says to them , Let us go over to the other side :
DARBY	Mark	4	36	and having sent away the crowd , they take him with [ them ] , as he was , in the ship . But other ships also were with him .
DARBY	Mark	4	37	And there comes a violent gust of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it already filled .
DARBY	Mark	4	38	And * he * was in the stern sleeping on the cushion . And they awake him up and say to him , Teacher , dost thou not care that we are perishing ?
DARBY	Mark	4	39	And awaking up he rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , Silence ; be mute . And the wind fell , and there was a great calm .
DARBY	Mark	4	40	And he said to them , Why are ye [ thus ] fearful ? how [ is it ] ye have not faith ?
DARBY	Mark	4	41	And they feared [ with ] great fear , and said one to another , Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
DARBY	Mark	5	5	And continually night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying and cutting himself with stones .
DARBY	Mark	5	2	And immediately on his going out of the ship there met him out of the tombs a man possessed by an unclean spirit ,
DARBY	Mark	5	3	who had his dwelling in the tombs ; and no one was able to bind him , not even with chains ;
DARBY	Mark	5	4	because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn asunder by him , and the fetters were shattered ; and no one was able to subdue him .
DARBY	Mark	5	6	But seeing Jesus from afar off , he ran and did him homage ,
DARBY	Mark	5	7	and crying with a loud voice he says , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I adjure thee by God , torment me not .
DARBY	Mark	5	8	For he said to him , Come forth , unclean spirit , out of the man .
DARBY	Mark	5	9	And he asked him , What is thy name ? And he says to him , Legion is my name , because we are many .
DARBY	Mark	5	10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
DARBY	Mark	5	11	Now there was there just at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding ;
DARBY	Mark	5	12	and they besought him , saying , Send us into the swine that we may enter into them .
DARBY	Mark	5	13	And Jesus [ immediately ] allowed them . And the unclean spirits going out entered into the swine , and the herd rushed down the steep slope , into the sea ( about two thousand ) , and were choked in the sea .
DARBY	Mark	5	14	And those that were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the country . And they went out to see what it was that had taken place .
DARBY	Mark	5	15	And they come to Jesus , and they see the possessed of demons sitting [ and ] clothed and sensible , [ him ] that had had the legion : and they were afraid .
DARBY	Mark	5	16	And they that had seen [ it ] related to them how it had happened to the [ man ] possessed by demons , and concerning the swine .
DARBY	Mark	5	17	And they began to beg him to depart from their coasts .
DARBY	Mark	5	18	And as he went on board ship , the man that had been possessed by demons besought him that he might be with him .
DARBY	Mark	5	19	And he suffered him not , but says to him , Go to thine home to thine own people , and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee , and has had mercy on thee .
DARBY	Mark	5	20	And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him ; and all wondered .
DARBY	Mark	5	21	And Jesus having passed over in the ship again to the other side , a great crowd gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
DARBY	Mark	5	22	And [ behold ] there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue , by name Jairus , and seeing him , falls down at his feet ;
DARBY	Mark	5	23	and he besought him much , saying , My little daughter is at extremity ; [ I pray ] that thou shouldest come and lay thy hands upon her so that she may be healed , and may live .
DARBY	Mark	5	24	And he went with him , and a large crowd followed him and pressed on him .
DARBY	Mark	5	25	And a certain woman who had had a flux of blood twelve years ,
DARBY	Mark	5	26	and had suffered much under many physicians , and had spent everything she had and had found no advantage from it , but had rather got worse ,
DARBY	Mark	5	27	having heard concerning Jesus , came in the crowd behind and touched his clothes ;
DARBY	Mark	5	28	for she said , If I shall touch but his clothes I shall be healed .
DARBY	Mark	5	29	And immediately her fountain of blood was dried up , and she knew in her body that she was cured from the scourge .
DARBY	Mark	5	30	And immediately Jesus , knowing in himself the power that had gone out of him , turning round in the crowd said , Who has touched my clothes ?
DARBY	Mark	5	31	And his disciples said to him , Thou seest the crowd pressing on thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
DARBY	Mark	5	32	And he looked round about to see her who had done this .
DARBY	Mark	5	33	But the woman , frightened and trembling , knowing what had taken place in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
DARBY	Mark	5	34	And he said to her , Daughter , thy faith has healed thee ; go in peace , and be well of thy scourge .
DARBY	Mark	5	35	While he was yet speaking , they come from the ruler of the synagogue 's [ house ] , saying , Thy daughter has died , why troublest thou the teacher any further ?
DARBY	Mark	5	36	But Jesus [ immediately ] , having heard the word spoken , says to the ruler of the synagogue , Fear not ; only believe .
DARBY	Mark	5	37	And he suffered no one to accompany him save Peter and James , and John the brother of James .
DARBY	Mark	5	38	And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and sees the tumult , and people weeping and wailing greatly .
DARBY	Mark	5	39	And entering in he says to them , Why do ye make a tumult and weep ? the child has not died , but sleeps .
DARBY	Mark	5	40	And they derided him . But he , having put [ them ] all out , takes with [ him ] the father of the child , and the mother , and those that were with him , and enters in where the child was lying .
DARBY	Mark	5	41	And having laid hold of the hand of the child , he says to her , Talitha koumi , which is , interpreted , Damsel , I say to thee , Arise .
DARBY	Mark	5	42	And immediately the damsel arose and walked , for she was twelve years old . And they were astonished with great astonishment .
DARBY	Mark	5	43	And he charged them much that no one should know this ; and he desired that [ something ] should be given her to eat .
DARBY	Mark	6	6	And he wondered because of their unbelief . And he went round the villages in a circuit , teaching .
DARBY	Mark	6	2	And when sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue , and many hearing were amazed , saying , Whence [ has ] this [ man ] these things ? and what [ is ] the wisdom that is given to him , and such works of power are done by his hands ?
DARBY	Mark	6	3	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and brother of James , and Joses , and Judas , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were offended in him .
DARBY	Mark	6	4	But Jesus said to them , A prophet is not despised save in his own country , and among [ his ] kinsmen , and in his own house .
DARBY	Mark	6	5	And he could not do any work of power there , save that laying his hands on a few infirm persons he healed [ them ] .
DARBY	Mark	6	7	And he calls the twelve to [ him ] ; and he began to send them out two [ and ] two , and gave to them power over the unclean spirits ;
DARBY	Mark	6	8	and he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their belt ;
DARBY	Mark	6	9	but be shod with sandals , and put not on two body-coats .
DARBY	Mark	6	10	And he said to them , Wheresoever ye shall enter into a house , there remain till ye shall go thence .
DARBY	Mark	6	11	And whatsoever place shall not receive you nor hear you , departing thence , shake off the dust which is under your feet for a testimony to them .
DARBY	Mark	6	12	And they went forth and preached that they should repent ;
DARBY	Mark	6	13	and they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many infirm , and healed them .
DARBY	Mark	6	14	And Herod the king heard [ of him ] ( for his name had become public ) , and said , John the baptist is risen from among [ the ] dead , and on this account works of power are wrought by him .
DARBY	Mark	6	15	And others said , It is Elias ; and others said , It is a prophet , as one of the prophets .
DARBY	Mark	6	16	But Herod when he heard [ it ] said , John whom * I * beheaded , he it is ; * he * is risen [ from among the dead ] .
DARBY	Mark	6	17	For the same Herod had sent and seized John , and had bound him in prison on account of Herodias , the wife of Philip his brother , because he had married her .
DARBY	Mark	6	18	For John said to Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have the wife of thy brother .
DARBY	Mark	6	19	But Herodias kept it [ in her mind ] against him , and wished to kill him , and could not :
DARBY	Mark	6	20	for Herod feared John knowing that he was a just and holy man , and kept him safe ; and having heard him , did many things , and heard him gladly .
DARBY	Mark	6	21	And a holiday being come , when Herod , on his birthday , made a supper to his grandees , and to the chiliarchs , and the chief [ men ] of Galilee ;
DARBY	Mark	6	22	and the daughter of the same Herodias having come in , and danced , pleased Herod and those that were with [ him ] at table ; and the king said to the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and I will give it thee .
DARBY	Mark	6	23	And he swore to her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask me I will give thee , to half of my kingdom .
DARBY	Mark	6	24	And she went out , and said to her mother , What should I ask ? And she said , The head of John the baptist .
DARBY	Mark	6	25	And immediately going in with haste to the king , she asked saying , I desire that thou give me directly upon a dish the head of John the baptist .
DARBY	Mark	6	26	And the king , [ while ] made very sorry , on account of the oaths and those lying at table with [ him ] would not break his word with her .
DARBY	Mark	6	27	And immediately the king , having sent one of the guard , ordered his head to be brought . And he went out and beheaded him in the prison ,
DARBY	Mark	6	28	and brought his head upon a dish , and gave it to the damsel , and the damsel gave it to her mother .
DARBY	Mark	6	29	And his disciples having heard [ it ] , came and took up his body , and laid it in a tomb .
DARBY	Mark	6	30	And the apostles are gathered together to Jesus . And they related to him all things , [ both ] what they had done and what they had taught .
DARBY	Mark	6	31	And he said to them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little . For those coming and those going were many , and they had not leisure even to eat .
DARBY	Mark	6	32	And they went away apart into a desert place by ship .
DARBY	Mark	6	33	And many saw them going , and recognised them , and ran together there on foot , out of all the cities , and got [ there ] before them .
DARBY	Mark	6	34	And on leaving [ the ship ] [ Jesus ] saw a great crowd , and he was moved with compassion for them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd . And he began to teach them many things .
DARBY	Mark	6	35	And when it was already late in the day , his disciples coming to him say , The place is desert , and it is already late in the day ;
DARBY	Mark	6	36	send them away that they may go into the country and villages around , and buy themselves bread , for they have not anything they can eat .
DARBY	Mark	6	37	And he answering said to them , Give * ye * them to eat . And they say to him , Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them to eat ?
DARBY	Mark	6	38	And he says to them , How many loaves have ye ? Go [ and ] see . And when they knew they say , Five , and two fishes .
DARBY	Mark	6	39	And he ordered them to make them all sit down by companies on the green grass .
DARBY	Mark	6	40	And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties .
DARBY	Mark	6	41	And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes , looking up to heaven , he blessed , and broke the loaves , and gave [ them ] to his disciples that they might set [ them ] before them . And the two fishes he divided among all .
DARBY	Mark	6	42	And they all ate and were satisfied .
DARBY	Mark	6	43	And they took up of fragments the fillings of twelve hand-baskets , and of the fishes .
DARBY	Mark	6	44	And those that ate of the loaves were five thousand men .
DARBY	Mark	6	45	And immediately he compelled his disciples to go on board ship , and to go on before to the other side to Bethsaida , while * he * sends the crowd away .
DARBY	Mark	6	46	And , having dismissed them , he departed into the mountain to pray .
DARBY	Mark	6	47	And when evening was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and * he * alone upon the land .
DARBY	Mark	6	48	And seeing them labouring in rowing , for the wind was contrary to them , about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking on the sea , and would have passed them by .
DARBY	Mark	6	49	But they , seeing him walking on the sea , thought that it was an apparition , and cried out .
DARBY	Mark	6	50	For all saw him and were troubled . And immediately he spoke with them , and says to them , Be of good courage : it is * I * ; be not afraid .
DARBY	Mark	6	51	And he went up to them into the ship , and the wind fell . And they were exceedingly beyond measure astonished in themselves and wondered ;
DARBY	Mark	6	52	for they understood not through the loaves : for their heart was hardened .
DARBY	Mark	6	53	And having passed over , they came to the land of Gennesaret and made the shore .
DARBY	Mark	6	54	And on their coming out of the ship , immediately recognising him ,
DARBY	Mark	6	55	they ran through that whole country around , and began to carry about those that were ill on couches , where they heard that he was .
DARBY	Mark	6	56	And wherever he entered into villages , or cities , or the country , they laid the sick in the market-places , and besought him that they might touch if it were only the hem of his garment ; and as many as touched him were healed .
DARBY	Mark	7	7	But in vain do they worship me , teaching [ as their ] teachings commandments of men .
DARBY	Mark	7	2	and seeing some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is , unwashed , hands ,
DARBY	Mark	7	3	( for the Pharisees and all the Jews , unless they wash their hands diligently , do not eat , holding what has been delivered by the ancients ;
DARBY	Mark	7	4	and [ on coming ] from the market-place , unless they are washed , they do not eat ; and there are many other things which they have received to hold , the washing of cups and vessels , and brazen utensils , and couches ) ,
DARBY	Mark	7	5	then the Pharisees and the scribes ask him , Why do thy disciples not walk according to what has been delivered by the ancients , but eat the bread with defiled hands ?
DARBY	Mark	7	6	But he answering said to them , Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honour me with their lips , but their heart is far away from me .
DARBY	Mark	7	8	[ For ] , leaving the commandment of God , ye hold what is delivered by men [ to keep ] —washings of vessels and cups , and many other such like things ye do .
DARBY	Mark	7	9	And he said to them , Well do ye set aside the commandment of God , that ye may observe what is delivered by yourselves [ to keep ] .
DARBY	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , Honour thy father and thy mother ; and , he who speaks ill of father or mother , let him surely die .
DARBY	Mark	7	11	But * ye * say , If a man say to his father or his mother , [ It is ] corban ( that is , gift ) , whatsoever thou mightest have profit from me by …
DARBY	Mark	7	12	And ye no longer suffer him to do anything for his father or his mother ;
DARBY	Mark	7	13	making void the word of God by your traditional teaching which ye have delivered ; and many such like things ye do .
DARBY	Mark	7	14	And having called again the crowd , he said to them , Hear me , all [ of you ] , and understand :
DARBY	Mark	7	15	There is nothing from outside a man entering into him which can defile him ; but the things which go out from him , those it is which defile the man .
DARBY	Mark	7	16	If any one have ears to hear , let him hear .
DARBY	Mark	7	17	And when he went indoors from the crowd , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
DARBY	Mark	7	18	And he says to them , Are * ye * also thus unintelligent ? Do ye not perceive that all that is outside entering into the man can not defile him ,
DARBY	Mark	7	19	because it does not enter into his heart but into his belly , and goes out into the draught , purging all meats ?
DARBY	Mark	7	20	And he said , That which goes forth out of the man , that defiles the man .
DARBY	Mark	7	21	For from within , out of the heart of men , go forth evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
DARBY	Mark	7	22	thefts , covetousness , wickednesses , deceit , licentiousness , a wicked eye , injurious language , haughtiness , folly ;
DARBY	Mark	7	23	all these wicked things go forth from within and defile the man .
DARBY	Mark	7	24	And he rose up and went away thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon ; and having entered into a house he would not have any one know [ it ] , and he could not be hid .
DARBY	Mark	7	25	But immediately a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having heard of him , came and fell at his feet
DARBY	Mark	7	26	( and the woman was a Greek , Syrophenician by race ) , and asked him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter .
DARBY	Mark	7	27	But [ Jesus ] said to her , Suffer the children to be first filled ; for it is not right to take the children 's bread and cast it to the dogs .
DARBY	Mark	7	28	But she answered and says to him , Yea , Lord ; for even the dogs under the table eat of the children 's crumbs .
DARBY	Mark	7	29	And he said to her , Because of this word , go thy way , the demon is gone out of thy daughter .
DARBY	Mark	7	30	And having gone away to her house she found the demon gone out , and her daughter lying on the bed .
DARBY	Mark	7	31	And again having left the borders of Tyre and Sidon , he came to the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis .
DARBY	Mark	7	32	And they bring to him a deaf [ man ] who could not speak right , and they beseech him that he might lay his hand on him .
DARBY	Mark	7	33	And having taken him away from the crowd apart , he put his fingers to his ears ; and having spit , he touched his tongue ;
DARBY	Mark	7	34	and looking up to heaven he groaned , and says to him , Ephphatha , that is , Be opened .
DARBY	Mark	7	35	And immediately his ears were opened , and the band of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right .
DARBY	Mark	7	36	And he charged them that they should speak to no one [ of it ] . But so much the more * he * charged them , so much the more abundantly * they * proclaimed it ;
DARBY	Mark	7	37	and they were astonished above measure , saying , He does all things well ; he makes both the deaf to hear , and the speechless to speak .
DARBY	Mark	8	8	And they ate and were satisfied . And they took up of fragments that remained seven baskets .
DARBY	Mark	8	2	I have compassion on the crowd , because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat ,
DARBY	Mark	8	3	and if I should dismiss them to their home fasting , they will faint on the way ; for some of them are come from far .
DARBY	Mark	8	4	And his disciples answered him , Whence shall one be able to satisfy these with bread here in a desert place ?
DARBY	Mark	8	5	And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven .
DARBY	Mark	8	6	And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground . And having taken the seven loaves , he gave thanks , and broke [ them ] and gave [ them ] to his disciples , that they might set [ them ] before [ them ] ; and they set [ them ] before the crowd .
DARBY	Mark	8	7	And they had a few small fishes , and having blessed them , he desired these also to be set before [ them ] .
DARBY	Mark	8	9	And they [ that had eaten ] were about four thousand ; and he sent them away .
DARBY	Mark	8	10	And immediately going on board ship with his disciples , he came into the parts of Dalmanutha .
DARBY	Mark	8	11	And the Pharisees went out and began to dispute against him , seeking from him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
DARBY	Mark	8	12	And groaning in his spirit , he says , Why does this generation seek a sign ? Verily I say unto you , A sign shall in no wise be given to this generation .
DARBY	Mark	8	13	And he left them , and going again on board ship , went away to the other side .
DARBY	Mark	8	14	And they forgot to take bread , and save one loaf , they had not [ any ] with them in the ship .
DARBY	Mark	8	15	And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and [ of ] the leaven of Herod .
DARBY	Mark	8	16	And they reasoned with one another , [ saying ] , It is because we have no bread .
DARBY	Mark	8	17	And Jesus knowing [ it ] , says to them , Why reason ye because ye have no bread ? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand ? Have ye your heart [ yet ] hardened ?
DARBY	Mark	8	18	Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
DARBY	Mark	8	19	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many hand-baskets full of fragments took ye up ? They say to him , Twelve .
DARBY	Mark	8	20	And when the seven for the four thousand , the filling of how many baskets of fragments took ye up ? And they said , Seven .
DARBY	Mark	8	21	And he said to them , How do ye not yet understand ?
DARBY	Mark	8	22	And he comes to Bethsaida ; and they bring him a blind man , and beseech him that he might touch him .
DARBY	Mark	8	23	And taking hold of the hand of the blind man he led him forth out of the village , and having spit upon his eyes , he laid his hands upon him , and asked him if he beheld anything .
DARBY	Mark	8	24	And having looked up , he said , I behold men , for I see [ them ] , as trees , walking .
DARBY	Mark	8	25	Then he laid his hands again upon his eyes , and he saw distinctly , and was restored and saw all things clearly .
DARBY	Mark	8	26	And he sent him to his house , saying , Neither enter into the village , nor tell [ it ] to any one in the village .
DARBY	Mark	8	27	And Jesus went forth and his disciples , into the villages of Caesarea-Philippi . And by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , Who do men say that I am ?
DARBY	Mark	8	28	And they answered him , saying , John the baptist ; and others , Elias ; but others , One of the prophets .
DARBY	Mark	8	29	And he asked them , But * ye * , who do ye say that I am ? And Peter answering says to him , * Thou * art the Christ .
DARBY	Mark	8	30	And he charged them straitly , in order that they should tell no man about him .
DARBY	Mark	8	31	And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and of the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise [ again ] .
DARBY	Mark	8	32	And he spoke the thing openly . And Peter , taking him to [ him ] , began to rebuke him .
DARBY	Mark	8	33	But he , turning round and seeing his disciples , rebuked Peter , saying , Get away behind me , Satan , for thy mind is not on the things that are of God , but on the things that are of men .
DARBY	Mark	8	34	And having called the crowd with his disciples , he said to them , Whoever desires to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross and follow me .
DARBY	Mark	8	35	For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it , but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's shall save it .
DARBY	Mark	8	36	For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul ?
DARBY	Mark	8	37	for what should a man give in exchange for his soul ?
DARBY	Mark	8	38	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , of him shall the Son of man also be ashamed when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels .
DARBY	Mark	9	9	And as they descended from the mountain , he charged them that they should relate to no one what they had seen , unless when the Son of man should be risen from among [ the ] dead .
DARBY	Mark	9	2	And after six days Jesus takes with [ him ] Peter and James and John , and takes them up on a high mountain by themselves apart . And he was transfigured before them :
DARBY	Mark	9	3	and his garments became shining , exceeding white [ as snow ] , such as fuller on earth could not whiten [ them ] .
DARBY	Mark	9	4	And there appeared to them Elias with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus .
DARBY	Mark	9	5	And Peter answering says to Jesus , Rabbi , it is good that we should be here ; and let us make three tabernacles , for thee one , and for Moses one , and for Elias one .
DARBY	Mark	9	6	For he knew not what he should say , for they were filled with fear .
DARBY	Mark	9	7	And there came a cloud overshadowing them , and there came a voice out of the cloud , * This * is my beloved Son : hear him .
DARBY	Mark	9	8	And suddenly having looked around , they no longer saw any one , but Jesus alone with themselves .
DARBY	Mark	9	10	And they kept that saying , questioning among themselves , what rising from among [ the ] dead was .
DARBY	Mark	9	11	And they asked him saying , Why do the scribes say that Elias must first have come ?
DARBY	Mark	9	12	And he answering said to them , Elias indeed , having first come , restores all things ; and how is it written of the Son of man that he must suffer much , and be set at nought :
DARBY	Mark	9	13	but I say unto you that Elias also is come , and they have done to him whatever they would , as it is written of him .
DARBY	Mark	9	14	And when he came to the disciples he saw a great crowd around them , and scribes disputing against them .
DARBY	Mark	9	15	And immediately all the crowd seeing him were amazed , and running to [ him ] , saluted him .
DARBY	Mark	9	16	And he asked them , What do ye question with them about ?
DARBY	Mark	9	17	And one out of the crowd answered him , Teacher , I brought to thee my son , who has a dumb spirit ;
DARBY	Mark	9	18	and wheresoever it seizes him it tears him , and he foams and gnashes his teeth , and he is withering away . And I spoke to thy disciples , that they might cast him out , and they could not .
DARBY	Mark	9	19	But he answering them says , O unbelieving generation ! how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I bear with you ? bring him to me .
DARBY	Mark	9	20	And they brought him to him . And seeing him the spirit immediately tore him ; and falling upon the earth he rolled foaming .
DARBY	Mark	9	21	And he asked his father , How long a time is it that it has been like this with him ? And he said , From childhood ;
DARBY	Mark	9	22	and often it has cast him both into fire and into waters that it might destroy him : but if thou couldst [ do ] anything , be moved with pity on us , and help us .
DARBY	Mark	9	23	And Jesus said to him , The 'if thou couldst ' is [ if thou couldst ] believe : all things are possible to him that believes .
DARBY	Mark	9	24	And immediately the father of the young child crying out said [ with tears ] , I believe , help mine unbelief .
DARBY	Mark	9	25	But Jesus , seeing that [ the ] crowd was running up together , rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , * I * command thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
DARBY	Mark	9	26	And having cried out and torn [ him ] much , he came out ; and he became as if dead , so that the most said , He is dead .
DARBY	Mark	9	27	But Jesus , having taken hold of him by the hand , lifted him up , and he arose .
DARBY	Mark	9	28	And when he was entered into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Wherefore could not * we * cast him out ?
DARBY	Mark	9	29	And he said to them , This kind can go out by nothing but by prayer and fasting .
DARBY	Mark	9	30	And going forth from thence they went through Galilee ; and he would not that any one knew it ;
DARBY	Mark	9	31	for he taught his disciples and said to them , The Son of man is delivered into men 's hands , and they shall kill him ; and having been killed , after three days he shall rise again .
DARBY	Mark	9	32	But they understood not the saying , and feared to ask him .
DARBY	Mark	9	33	And he came to Capernaum , and being in the house , he asked them , Of what were ye reasoning by the way ?
DARBY	Mark	9	34	And they remained silent , for by the way they had been reasoning with one another who [ was ] greatest .
DARBY	Mark	9	35	And sitting down he called the twelve ; and he says to them , If any one would be first , he shall be last of all , and minister of all .
DARBY	Mark	9	36	And taking a little child he set it in their midst , and having taken it in his arms he said to them ,
DARBY	Mark	9	37	Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name , receives me ; and whosoever shall receive me , does not receive me , but him who sent me .
DARBY	Mark	9	38	And John answered him saying , Teacher , we saw some one casting out demons in thy name , who does not follow us , and we forbad him , because he does not follow us .
DARBY	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , Forbid him not ; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name , and be able soon [ after ] to speak ill of me ;
DARBY	Mark	9	40	for he who is not against us is for us .
DARBY	Mark	9	41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in [ my ] name , because ye are Christ 's , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
DARBY	Mark	9	42	And whosoever shall be a snare to one of the little ones who believe [ in me ] , it were better for him if a millstone were hung about his neck , and he cast into the sea .
DARBY	Mark	9	43	And if thy hand serve as a snare to thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having thy two hands to go away into hell , into the fire unquenchable ;
DARBY	Mark	9	44	[ where their worm dies not , and the fire is not quenched ] .
DARBY	Mark	9	45	And if thy foot serve as a snare to thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life lame , than having thy two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire unquenchable ;
DARBY	Mark	9	46	[ where their worm dies not , and the fire is not quenched ] .
DARBY	Mark	9	47	And if thine eye serve as a snare to thee , cast it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire ,
DARBY	Mark	9	48	where their worm dies not , and the fire is not quenched .
DARBY	Mark	9	49	For every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
DARBY	Mark	9	50	Salt [ is ] good , but if the salt is become saltless , wherewith will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another .
DARBY	Mark	10	10	And again in the house the disciples asked him concerning this .
DARBY	Mark	10	2	And Pharisees coming to [ him ] asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away [ his ] wife ? ( tempting him ) .
DARBY	Mark	10	3	But he answering said to them , What did Moses command you ?
DARBY	Mark	10	4	And they said , Moses allowed to write a bill of divorce , and to put away .
DARBY	Mark	10	5	And Jesus answering said to them , In view of your hard-heartedness he wrote this commandment for you ;
DARBY	Mark	10	6	but from [ the ] beginning of [ the ] creation God made them male and female .
DARBY	Mark	10	7	For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united to his wife ,
DARBY	Mark	10	8	and the two shall be one flesh : so that they are no longer two but one flesh .
DARBY	Mark	10	9	What therefore God has joined together , let not man separate .
DARBY	Mark	10	11	And he says to them , Whosoever shall put away his wife and shall marry another , commits adultery against her .
DARBY	Mark	10	12	And if a woman put away her husband and shall marry another , she commits adultery .
DARBY	Mark	10	13	And they brought little children to him that he might touch them . But the disciples rebuked those that brought [ them ] .
DARBY	Mark	10	14	But Jesus seeing [ it ] , was indignant , and said to them , Suffer the little children to come to me ; forbid them not ; for of such is the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Mark	10	15	Verily I say to you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , shall in no wise enter into it .
DARBY	Mark	10	16	And having taken them in his arms , having laid his hands on them , he blessed them .
DARBY	Mark	10	17	And as he went forth into the way , a person ran up to [ him ] , and kneeling to him asked him , Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
DARBY	Mark	10	18	But Jesus said to him , Why callest thou me good ? no one is good but one , [ that is ] God .
DARBY	Mark	10	19	Thou knowest the commandments : Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Do not defraud , Honour thy father and mother .
DARBY	Mark	10	20	And he answering said to him , Teacher , all these things have I kept from my youth .
DARBY	Mark	10	21	And Jesus looking upon him loved him , and said to him , One thing lackest thou : go , sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me , [ taking up the cross ] .
DARBY	Mark	10	22	But he , sad at the word , went away grieved , for he had large possessions .
DARBY	Mark	10	23	And Jesus looking around says to his disciples , How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
DARBY	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were amazed at his words . And Jesus again answering says to them , Children , how difficult it is that those who trust in riches should enter into the kingdom of God !
DARBY	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Mark	10	26	And they were exceedingly astonished , saying to one another , And who can be saved ?
DARBY	Mark	10	27	But Jesus looking on them says , With men it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God .
DARBY	Mark	10	28	Peter began to say to him , Behold , * we * have left all things and have followed thee .
DARBY	Mark	10	29	Jesus answering said , Verily I say to you , There is no one who has left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , [ or wife ] , or children , or lands , for my sake and for the sake of the gospel ,
DARBY	Mark	10	30	that shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time : houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions , and in the coming age life eternal .
DARBY	Mark	10	31	But many first shall be last , and the last first .
DARBY	Mark	10	32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was going on before them ; and they were amazed , and were afraid as they followed . And taking the twelve again to [ him ] , he began to tell them what was going to happen to him :
DARBY	Mark	10	33	Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of man shall be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him up to the nations :
DARBY	Mark	10	34	and they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him ; and after three days he shall rise again .
DARBY	Mark	10	35	And there come to him James and John , the sons of Zebedee , saying [ to him ] , Teacher , we would that whatsoever we may ask thee , thou wouldst do it for us .
DARBY	Mark	10	36	And he said to them , What would ye that I should do for you ?
DARBY	Mark	10	37	And they said to him , Give to us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and one on thy left hand , in thy glory .
DARBY	Mark	10	38	And Jesus said to them , Ye do not know what ye ask . Are ye able to drink the cup which * I * drink , or be baptised with the baptism that * I * am baptised with ?
DARBY	Mark	10	39	And they said to him , We are able . And Jesus said to them , The cup that * I * drink ye will drink and with the baptism that * I * am baptised with ye will be baptised ,
DARBY	Mark	10	40	but to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give , but for those for whom it is prepared .
DARBY	Mark	10	41	And the ten having heard [ of it ] , began to be indignant about James and John .
DARBY	Mark	10	42	But Jesus having called them to [ him ] , says to them , Ye know that those who are esteemed to rule over the nations exercise lordship over them ; and their great men exercise authority over them ;
DARBY	Mark	10	43	but it is not thus among you ; but whosoever would be great among you , shall be your minister ;
DARBY	Mark	10	44	and whosoever would be first of you shall be bondman of all .
DARBY	Mark	10	45	For also the Son of man did not come to be ministered to , but to minister , and give his life a ransom for many .
DARBY	Mark	10	46	And they come to Jericho , and as he was going out from Jericho , and his disciples and a large crowd , the son of Timaeus , Bartimaeus , the blind [ man ] , sat by the wayside begging .
DARBY	Mark	10	47	And having heard that it was Jesus the Nazaraean , he began to cry out and to say , O Son of David , Jesus , have mercy on me .
DARBY	Mark	10	48	And many rebuked him , that he might be silent ; but he cried so much the more , Son of David , have mercy on me .
DARBY	Mark	10	49	And Jesus , standing still , desired him to be called . And they call the blind [ man ] , saying to him , Be of good courage , rise up , he calls thee .
DARBY	Mark	10	50	And , throwing away his garment , he started up and came to Jesus .
DARBY	Mark	10	51	And Jesus answering says to him , What wilt thou that I shall do to thee ? And the blind [ man ] said to him , Rabboni , that I may see .
DARBY	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said to him , Go , thy faith has healed thee . And he saw immediately , and followed him in the way .
DARBY	Mark	11	11	And he entered into Jerusalem and into the temple ; and having looked round on all things , the hour being already late , he went out to Bethany with the twelve .
DARBY	Mark	11	2	and says to them , Go into the village which is over against you , and immediately on entering into it ye will find a colt tied , upon which no [ child ] of man has ever sat : loose it and lead it [ here ] .
DARBY	Mark	11	3	And if any one say to you , Why do ye this ? say , The Lord has need of it ; and straightway he sends it hither .
DARBY	Mark	11	4	And they departed , and found a colt bound to the door without at the crossway , and they loose him .
DARBY	Mark	11	5	And some of those who stood there said to them , What are ye doing , loosing the colt ?
DARBY	Mark	11	6	And they said to them as Jesus had commanded . And they let them [ do it ] .
DARBY	Mark	11	7	And they led the colt to Jesus , and cast their clothes upon it , and he sat on it ;
DARBY	Mark	11	8	and many strewed their clothes on the way , and others cut down branches from the trees [ and went on strewing them on the way ] .
DARBY	Mark	11	9	And those going on before and those following cried out , Hosanna ! blessed [ be ] he that comes in [ the ] Lord 's name .
DARBY	Mark	11	10	Blessed [ be ] the coming kingdom of our father David . Hosanna in the highest !
DARBY	Mark	11	12	And on the morrow , when they were gone out of Bethany , he hungered .
DARBY	Mark	11	13	And seeing from afar off a fig-tree which had leaves , he came , if perhaps he might find something on it . And having come up to it he found nothing but leaves , for it was not the time of figs .
DARBY	Mark	11	14	And answering he said to it , Let no one eat fruit of thee any more for ever . And his disciples heard [ it ] .
DARBY	Mark	11	15	And they come to Jerusalem , and entering into the temple , he began to cast out those who sold and who bought in the temple , and he overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of the dove-sellers ,
DARBY	Mark	11	16	and suffered not that any one should carry any package through the temple .
DARBY	Mark	11	17	And he taught saying to them , Is it not written , My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? but * ye * have made it a den of robbers .
DARBY	Mark	11	18	And the chief priests and the scribes heard [ it ] , and they sought how they might destroy him ; for they feared him , because all the crowd were astonished at his doctrine .
DARBY	Mark	11	19	And when it was evening he went forth without the city .
DARBY	Mark	11	20	And passing by early in the morning they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots .
DARBY	Mark	11	21	And Peter , remembering [ what Jesus had said ] , says to him , Rabbi , see , the fig-tree which thou cursedst is dried up .
DARBY	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answering says to them , Have faith in God .
DARBY	Mark	11	23	Verily I say to you , that whosoever shall say to this mountain , Be thou taken away and cast into the sea , and shall not doubt in his heart , but believe that what he says takes place , whatever he shall say shall come to pass for him .
DARBY	Mark	11	24	For this reason I say to you , All things whatsoever ye pray for and ask , believe that ye receive it , and it shall come to pass for you .
DARBY	Mark	11	25	And when ye stand praying , forgive if ye have anything against any one , that your Father also who is in the heavens may forgive you your offences .
DARBY	Mark	11	26	But if * ye * do not forgive , neither will your Father who is in the heavens forgive your offences .
DARBY	Mark	11	27	And they come again to Jerusalem . And as he walked about in the temple , the chief priests and the scribes and the elders come to him ,
DARBY	Mark	11	28	and they say to him , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority , that thou shouldest do these things ?
DARBY	Mark	11	29	And Jesus answering said to them , * I * also will ask you one thing , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things :
DARBY	Mark	11	30	The baptism of John , was it of heaven , or of men ? answer me .
DARBY	Mark	11	31	And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we should say , Of heaven , he will say , Why [ then ] have ye not believed him ?
DARBY	Mark	11	32	but should we say , Of men—they feared the people ; for all held of John that he was truly a prophet .
DARBY	Mark	11	33	And they answering say to Jesus , We do not know . And Jesus [ answering ] says to them , Neither do * I * tell you by what authority I do these things .
DARBY	Mark	12	12	And they sought to lay hold of him , and they feared the crowd ; for they knew that he had spoken the parable of them . And they left him and went away .
DARBY	Mark	12	2	And he sent a bondman to the husbandmen at the season , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
DARBY	Mark	12	3	But they took him , and beat [ him ] , and sent [ him ] away empty .
DARBY	Mark	12	4	And again he sent to them another bondman ; and [ at ] him they [ threw stones , and ] struck [ him ] on the head , and sent [ him ] away with insult .
DARBY	Mark	12	5	And [ again ] he sent another , and him they killed ; and many others , beating some and killing some .
DARBY	Mark	12	6	Having yet therefore one beloved son , he sent also him to them the last , saying , They will have respect for my son .
DARBY	Mark	12	7	But those husbandmen said to one another , This is the heir : come , let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours .
DARBY	Mark	12	8	And they took him and killed him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard .
DARBY	Mark	12	9	What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others .
DARBY	Mark	12	10	Have ye not even read this scripture , The stone which they that builded rejected , this has become the corner-stone :
DARBY	Mark	12	11	this is of [ the ] Lord , and it is wonderful in our eyes ?
DARBY	Mark	12	13	And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , that they might catch him in speaking .
DARBY	Mark	12	14	And they come and say to him , Teacher , we know that thou art true , and carest not for any one ; for thou regardest not men 's person , but teachest the way of God with truth : Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not ?
DARBY	Mark	12	15	Should we give , or should we not give ? But he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? Bring me a denarius that I may see [ it ] .
DARBY	Mark	12	16	And they brought [ it ] . And he says to them , Whose [ is ] this image and superscription ? And they said to him , Caesar 's .
DARBY	Mark	12	17	And Jesus answering said to them , Pay what is Caesar 's to Caesar , and what is God 's to God . And they wondered at him .
DARBY	Mark	12	18	And Sadducees come to him , that say there is no resurrection ; and they demanded of him saying ,
DARBY	Mark	12	19	Teacher , Moses wrote to us that if any one 's brother die , and leave a wife behind , and leave no children , that his brother shall take his wife , and raise up seed to his brother .
DARBY	Mark	12	20	There were seven brethren ; and the first took a wife , and dying did not leave seed ;
DARBY	Mark	12	21	and the second took her and died , and neither did he leave seed ; and the third likewise .
DARBY	Mark	12	22	And the seven [ took her and ] did not leave seed . Last of all the woman also died .
DARBY	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection , when they shall rise again , of which of them shall she be wife , for the seven had her as wife ?
DARBY	Mark	12	24	And Jesus answering said to them , Do not ye therefore err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God ?
DARBY	Mark	12	25	For when they rise from among [ the ] dead they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as angels [ who are ] in the heavens .
DARBY	Mark	12	26	But concerning the dead that they rise , have ye not read in the book of Moses , in [ the section of ] the bush , how God spoke to him , saying , * I * [ am ] the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
DARBY	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of [ the ] dead , but of [ the ] living . * Ye * therefore greatly err .
DARBY	Mark	12	28	And one of the scribes who had come up , and had heard them reasoning together , perceiving that he had answered them well , demanded of him , Which is [ the ] first commandment of all ?
DARBY	Mark	12	29	And Jesus answered him , [ The ] first commandment of all [ is ] , Hear , Israel : the Lord our God is one Lord ;
DARBY	Mark	12	30	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thine understanding , and with all thy strength . This is [ the ] first commandment .
DARBY	Mark	12	31	And a second like it [ is ] this : Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . There is not another commandment greater than these .
DARBY	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said to him , Right , teacher ; thou hast spoken according to [ the ] truth . For he is one , and there is none other besides him ;
DARBY	Mark	12	33	and to love him with all the heart , and with all the intelligence , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love one 's neighbour as one 's self , is more than all the burnt-offerings and sacrifices .
DARBY	Mark	12	34	And Jesus , seeing that he had answered intelligently , said to him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no one dared question him any more .
DARBY	Mark	12	35	And Jesus answering said [ as he was ] teaching in the temple , How do the scribes say that the Christ is son of David ?
DARBY	Mark	12	36	[ for ] David himself said [ speaking ] in the Holy Spirit , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies [ as ] footstool of thy feet .
DARBY	Mark	12	37	David himself [ therefore ] calls him Lord , and whence is he his son ? And the mass of the people heard him gladly .
DARBY	Mark	12	38	And he said to them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , who like to walk about in long robes , and salutations in the marketplaces ,
DARBY	Mark	12	39	and first seats in the synagogues , and first places at suppers ;
DARBY	Mark	12	40	who devour the houses of widows , and as a pretext make long prayers . These shall receive a severer judgment .
DARBY	Mark	12	41	And Jesus , having sat down opposite the treasury , saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury ; and many rich cast in much .
DARBY	Mark	12	42	And a poor widow came and cast in two mites , which is a farthing .
DARBY	Mark	12	43	And having called his disciples to [ him ] he said to them , Verily I say unto you , This poor widow has cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury :
DARBY	Mark	12	44	for all have cast in of that which they had in abundance , but she of her destitution has cast in all that she had , the whole of her living .
DARBY	Mark	13	13	And ye will be hated of all on account of my name ; but he that has endured to the end , * he * shall be saved .
DARBY	Mark	13	2	And Jesus answering said to him , Seest thou these great buildings ? not a stone shall be left upon a stone , which shall not be thrown down .
DARBY	Mark	13	3	And as he sat on the mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately ,
DARBY	Mark	13	4	Tell us , when shall these things be , and what is the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled ?
DARBY	Mark	13	5	And Jesus answering them began to say , Take heed lest any one mislead you .
DARBY	Mark	13	6	For many shall come in my name , saying , It is * I * , and shall mislead many .
DARBY	Mark	13	7	But when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be not disturbed , for [ this ] must happen , but the end is not yet .
DARBY	Mark	13	8	For nation shall rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be earthquakes in [ different ] places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these things [ are the ] beginnings of throes .
DARBY	Mark	13	9	But * ye * , take heed to yourselves , for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrims and to synagogues : ye shall be beaten and brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them ;
DARBY	Mark	13	10	and the gospel must first be preached to all the nations .
DARBY	Mark	13	11	But when they shall lead you away to deliver you up , be not careful beforehand as to what ye shall say , [ nor prepare your discourse ] : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ; for * ye * are not the speakers , but the Holy Spirit .
DARBY	Mark	13	12	But brother shall deliver up brother to death , and father child ; and children shall rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
DARBY	Mark	13	14	But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not , ( he that reads let him consider [ it ] , ) then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains ;
DARBY	Mark	13	15	and him that is upon the housetop not come down into the house , nor enter [ into it ] to take away anything out of his house ;
DARBY	Mark	13	16	and him that is in the field not return back to take his garment .
DARBY	Mark	13	17	But woe to those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days !
DARBY	Mark	13	18	And pray that it may not be in winter time ;
DARBY	Mark	13	19	for those days shall be distress such as there has not been the like since [ the ] beginning of creation which God created , until now , and never shall be ;
DARBY	Mark	13	20	and if [ the ] Lord had not cut short those days , no flesh should have been saved ; but on account of the elect whom he has chosen , he has cut short those days .
DARBY	Mark	13	21	And then if any one say to you , Lo , here [ is ] the Christ , or Lo , there , believe [ it ] not .
DARBY	Mark	13	22	For false Christs and false prophets will arise , and give signs and wonders to deceive , if possible , even the elect .
DARBY	Mark	13	23	But do * ye * take heed : behold , I have told you all things beforehand .
DARBY	Mark	13	24	But in those days , after that distress , the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give its light ;
DARBY	Mark	13	25	and the stars of heaven shall be falling down , and the powers which are in the heavens shall be shaken ;
DARBY	Mark	13	26	and then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory ;
DARBY	Mark	13	27	and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from end of earth to end of heaven .
DARBY	Mark	13	28	But learn the parable from the fig-tree : when its branch already becomes tender and puts forth the leaves , ye know that the summer is near .
DARBY	Mark	13	29	Thus also * ye * , when ye see these things happening , know that it is near , at the doors .
DARBY	Mark	13	30	Verily I say unto you , This generation shall in no wise pass away , till all these things take place .
DARBY	Mark	13	31	The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall in no wise pass away .
DARBY	Mark	13	32	But of that day or of that hour no one knows , neither the angels who are in heaven , nor the Son , but the Father .
DARBY	Mark	13	33	Take heed , watch and pray , for ye do not know when the time is :
DARBY	Mark	13	34	[ it is ] as a man gone out of the country , having left his house and given to his bondmen the authority , and to each one his work , and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch .
DARBY	Mark	13	35	Watch therefore , for ye do not know when the master of the house comes : evening , or midnight , or cock-crow , or morning ;
DARBY	Mark	13	36	lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
DARBY	Mark	13	37	But what I say to you , I say to all , Watch .
DARBY	Mark	14	14	And wheresoever he enters , say to the master of the house , The Teacher says , Where is my guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples ?
DARBY	Mark	14	2	For they said , Not in the feast , lest perhaps there be a tumult of the people .
DARBY	Mark	14	3	And when he was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , as he lay at table , there came a woman having an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard , very costly ; and having broken the alabaster flask , she poured it out upon his head .
DARBY	Mark	14	4	And there were some indignant in themselves , and saying , Why has this waste been made of the ointment ?
DARBY	Mark	14	5	for this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor . And they spoke very angrily at her .
DARBY	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said , Let her alone ; why do ye trouble her ? she has wrought a good work as to me ;
DARBY	Mark	14	7	for ye have the poor always with you , and whenever ye would ye can do them good ; but me ye have not always .
DARBY	Mark	14	8	What * she * could she has done . She has beforehand anointed my body for the burial .
DARBY	Mark	14	9	And verily I say unto you , Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world , what this [ woman ] has done shall be also spoken of for a memorial of her .
DARBY	Mark	14	10	And Judas Iscariote , one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them ;
DARBY	Mark	14	11	and they , when they heard it , rejoiced , and promised him to give money . And he sought how he could opportunely deliver him up .
DARBY	Mark	14	12	And the first day of unleavened bread , when they slew the passover , his disciples say to him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare , that thou mayest eat the passover ?
DARBY	Mark	14	13	And he sends two of his disciples , and says to them , Go into the city , and a man shall meet you carrying a pitcher of water ; follow him .
DARBY	Mark	14	15	and * he * will shew you a large upper room furnished ready . There make ready for us .
DARBY	Mark	14	16	And his disciples went away and came into the city , and found as he had said to them ; and they made ready the passover .
DARBY	Mark	14	17	And when evening was come , he comes with the twelve .
DARBY	Mark	14	18	And as they lay at table and were eating , Jesus said , Verily I say to you , One of you shall deliver me up ; he who is eating with me .
DARBY	Mark	14	19	And they began to be grieved , and to say to him , one by one , Is it * I * ? [ and another , Is it * I * ? ]
DARBY	Mark	14	20	But he answered and said to them , One of the twelve , he who dips with me in the dish .
DARBY	Mark	14	21	The Son of man goes indeed as it is written concerning him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up ; [ it were ] good for that man if he had not been born .
DARBY	Mark	14	22	And as they were eating , Jesus , having taken bread , when he had blessed , broke [ it ] , and gave [ it ] to them , and said , Take [ this ] : this is my body .
DARBY	Mark	14	23	And having taken [ the ] cup , when he had given thanks , he gave [ it ] to them , and they all drank out of it .
DARBY	Mark	14	24	And he said to them , This is my blood , that of the [ new ] covenant , that shed for many .
DARBY	Mark	14	25	Verily I say to you , I will no more drink at all of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Mark	14	26	And having sung a hymn , they went out to the mount of Olives .
DARBY	Mark	14	27	And Jesus says to them , All ye shall be offended , for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered abroad .
DARBY	Mark	14	28	But after I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee .
DARBY	Mark	14	29	But Peter said to him , Even if all should be offended , yet not * I * .
DARBY	Mark	14	30	And Jesus says to him , Verily I say to thee , that thou to-day , in this night , before [ the ] cock shall crow twice , thou shalt thrice deny me .
DARBY	Mark	14	31	But he said [ so much ] exceedingly the more , If I should have to die with thee , I will in no wise deny thee . And likewise said they all too .
DARBY	Mark	14	32	And they come to a place of which the name [ is ] Gethsemane , and he says to his disciples , Sit here while I shall pray .
DARBY	Mark	14	33	And he takes with him Peter and James and John , and he began to be amazed and oppressed in spirit .
DARBY	Mark	14	34	And he says to them , My soul is full of grief even unto death ; abide here and watch .
DARBY	Mark	14	35	And , going forward a little , he fell upon the earth ; and he prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
DARBY	Mark	14	36	And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible to thee : take away this cup from me ; but not what * I * will , but what * thou * [ wilt ] .
DARBY	Mark	14	37	And he comes and finds them sleeping . And he says to Peter , Simon , dost thou sleep ? Hast thou not been able to watch one hour ?
DARBY	Mark	14	38	Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation . The spirit indeed [ is ] willing , but the flesh weak .
DARBY	Mark	14	39	And going away , he prayed again , saying the same thing .
DARBY	Mark	14	40	And returning , he found them again sleeping , for their eyes were heavy ; and they knew not what they should answer him .
DARBY	Mark	14	41	And he comes the third time and says to them , Sleep on now , and take your rest . It is enough ; the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners .
DARBY	Mark	14	42	Arise , let us go ; behold , he that delivers me up has drawn nigh .
DARBY	Mark	14	43	And immediately , while he was yet speaking , Judas comes up , [ being ] one of the twelve , and with him a great crowd , with swords and sticks , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
DARBY	Mark	14	44	Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign between them , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that is he ; seize him , and lead [ him ] away safely .
DARBY	Mark	14	45	And being come , straightway coming up to him , he says , Rabbi , Rabbi ; and he covered him with kisses .
DARBY	Mark	14	46	And they laid their hands upon him and seized him .
DARBY	Mark	14	47	But a certain one of those who stood by , having drawn his sword , struck the bondman of the high priest , and took off his ear .
DARBY	Mark	14	48	And Jesus answering said to them , Are ye come out as against a robber , with swords and sticks to take me ?
DARBY	Mark	14	49	I was daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye did not seize me ; but [ it is ] that the scriptures may be fulfilled .
DARBY	Mark	14	50	And all left him and fled .
DARBY	Mark	14	51	And a certain young man followed him with a linen cloth cast about his naked [ body ] ; and [ the young men ] seize him ;
DARBY	Mark	14	52	but he , leaving the linen cloth behind [ him ] , fled from them naked .
DARBY	Mark	14	53	And they led away Jesus to the high priest . And there come together to him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
DARBY	Mark	14	54	And Peter followed him at a distance , till [ he was ] within the court of the high priest 's palace ; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself in the light [ of the fire ] .
DARBY	Mark	14	55	And the chief priests and the whole sanhedrim sought testimony against Jesus to cause him to be put to death , and did not find [ any ] .
DARBY	Mark	14	56	For many bore false witness against him , and their testimony did not agree .
DARBY	Mark	14	57	And certain persons rose up and bore false witness against him , saying ,
DARBY	Mark	14	58	* We * heard him saying , * I * will destroy this temple which is made with hands , and in the course of three days I will build another not made with hands .
DARBY	Mark	14	59	And neither thus did their testimony agree .
DARBY	Mark	14	60	And the high priest , rising up before them all , asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? What do these testify against thee ?
DARBY	Mark	14	61	But he was silent , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and says to him , * Thou * art the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ?
DARBY	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , * I * am , and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power , and coming with the clouds of heaven .
DARBY	Mark	14	63	And the high priest , having rent his clothes , says , What need have we any more of witnesses ?
DARBY	Mark	14	64	Ye have heard the blasphemy ; what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
DARBY	Mark	14	65	And some began to spit upon him , and cover up his face , and buffet him , and say to him , Prophesy ; and the officers struck him with the palms of their hands .
DARBY	Mark	14	66	And Peter being below in the palace-court , there comes one of the maids of the high priest ,
DARBY	Mark	14	67	and seeing Peter warming himself , having looked at him , says , And * thou * wast with the Nazarene , Jesus .
DARBY	Mark	14	68	But he denied , saying , I know not nor understand what thou sayest . And he went out into the vestibule ; and a cock crew .
DARBY	Mark	14	69	And the maid , seeing him , again began to say to those that stood by , This is [ one ] of them .
DARBY	Mark	14	70	And he again denied . And again , after a little , those that stood by said to Peter , Truly thou art [ one ] of them , for also thou art a Galilean .
DARBY	Mark	14	71	But he began to curse and to swear , I know not this man of whom ye speak .
DARBY	Mark	14	72	And the second time a cock crew . And Peter remembered the word that Jesus said to him , Before [ the ] cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice ; and when he thought thereon he wept .
DARBY	Mark	15	15	And Pilate , desirous of contenting the crowd , released to them Barabbas , and delivered up Jesus , when he had scourged him , that he might be crucified .
DARBY	Mark	15	2	And Pilate asked him , Art * thou * the King of the Jews ? And he answered and said to him , * Thou * sayest .
DARBY	Mark	15	3	And the chief priests accused him urgently .
DARBY	Mark	15	4	And Pilate asked him again , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? See of how many things they bear witness against thee .
DARBY	Mark	15	5	But Jesus still answered nothing , so that Pilate marvelled .
DARBY	Mark	15	6	But at [ the ] feast he released to them one prisoner , whomsoever they begged [ of him ] .
DARBY	Mark	15	7	Now there was the [ person ] named Barabbas bound with those who had made insurrection with [ him ] , [ and ] that had committed murder in the insurrection .
DARBY	Mark	15	8	And the crowd crying out began to beg [ that he would do ] to them as he had always done .
DARBY	Mark	15	9	But Pilate answered them saying , Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews ?
DARBY	Mark	15	10	for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up through envy .
DARBY	Mark	15	11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that he might rather release Barabbas to them .
DARBY	Mark	15	12	And Pilate answering said to them again , What will ye then that I do [ to him ] whom ye call King of the Jews ?
DARBY	Mark	15	13	And they cried out again , Crucify him .
DARBY	Mark	15	14	And Pilate said to them , What evil then has he done ? But they cried out the more urgently , Crucify him .
DARBY	Mark	15	16	And the soldiers led him away into the court which is [ called the ] praetorium , and they call together the whole band .
DARBY	Mark	15	17	And they clothe him with purple , and bind round on him a crown of thorns which they had plaited .
DARBY	Mark	15	18	And they began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews !
DARBY	Mark	15	19	And they struck his head with a reed , and spat on him , and , bending the knee , did him homage .
DARBY	Mark	15	20	And when they had mocked him , they took the purple off him , and put his own clothes on him ; and they lead him out that they may crucify him .
DARBY	Mark	15	21	And they compel to go [ with them ] a certain passer-by , Simon , a Cyrenian , coming from the field , the father of Alexander and Rufus , that he might carry his cross .
DARBY	Mark	15	22	And they bring him to the place [ called ] Golgotha , which , being interpreted , is Place of a skull .
DARBY	Mark	15	23	And they offered him wine [ to drink ] medicated with myrrh ; but he did not take [ it ] .
DARBY	Mark	15	24	And having crucified him , they part his clothes amongst [ themselves ] , casting lots on them , what each one should take .
DARBY	Mark	15	25	And it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
DARBY	Mark	15	26	And the superscription of what he was accused of was written up : The King of the Jews .
DARBY	Mark	15	27	And with him they crucify two robbers , one on his right hand , and one on his left .
DARBY	Mark	15	28	[ And the scripture was fulfilled which says , And he was reckoned with the lawless . ]
DARBY	Mark	15	29	And they that passed by reviled him , shaking their heads , and saying , Aha , thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days ,
DARBY	Mark	15	30	save thyself , and descend from the cross .
DARBY	Mark	15	31	In like manner the chief priests also , with the scribes , mocking with one another , said , He saved others ; himself he can not save .
DARBY	Mark	15	32	Let the Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and may believe . And they that were crucified with him reproached him .
DARBY	Mark	15	33	And when [ the ] sixth hour was come , there came darkness over the whole land until [ the ] ninth hour ;
DARBY	Mark	15	34	and at the ninth hour , Jesus cried with a loud voice , [ saying ] , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
DARBY	Mark	15	35	And some of those who stood by , when they heard [ it ] , said , Behold , he calls for Elias .
DARBY	Mark	15	36	And one , running and filling a sponge with vinegar , fixed it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone , let us see if Elias comes to take him down .
DARBY	Mark	15	37	And Jesus , having uttered a loud cry , expired .
DARBY	Mark	15	38	And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom .
DARBY	Mark	15	39	And the centurion who stood by over against him , when he saw that he had expired having thus cried out , said , Truly this man was Son of God .
DARBY	Mark	15	40	And there were women also looking on from afar off , among whom were both Mary of Magdala , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ;
DARBY	Mark	15	41	who also , when he was in Galilee , followed him and ministered to him ; and many others who came up with him to Jerusalem .
DARBY	Mark	15	42	And when it was already evening , since it was [ the ] preparation , that is , [ the day ] before a sabbath ,
DARBY	Mark	15	43	Joseph of Arimathaea , an honourable councillor , who also himself was awaiting the kingdom of God , coming , emboldened himself and went in to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus .
DARBY	Mark	15	44	And Pilate wondered if he were already dead ; and having called to [ him ] the centurion , he inquired of him if he had long died .
DARBY	Mark	15	45	And when he knew from the centurion , he granted the body to Joseph .
DARBY	Mark	15	46	And having bought fine linen , [ and ] having taken him down , he swathed him in the fine linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was cut out of rock , and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre .
DARBY	Mark	15	47	And Mary of Magdala and Mary the [ mother ] of Joses saw where he was put .
DARBY	Mark	16	16	He that believes and is baptised shall be saved , and he that disbelieves shall be condemned .
DARBY	Mark	16	2	And very early on the first [ day ] of the week they come to the sepulchre , the sun having risen .
DARBY	Mark	16	3	And they said to one another , Who shall roll us away the stone out of the door of the sepulchre ?
DARBY	Mark	16	4	And when they looked , they see that the stone has been rolled [ away ] , for it was very great .
DARBY	Mark	16	5	And entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right , clothed in a white robe , and they were amazed and alarmed ;
DARBY	Mark	16	6	but he says to them , Be not alarmed . Ye seek Jesus , the Nazarene , the crucified one . He is risen , he is not here ; behold the place where they had put him .
DARBY	Mark	16	7	But go , tell his disciples and Peter , he goes before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him , as he said to you .
DARBY	Mark	16	8	And they went out , and fled from the sepulchre . And trembling and excessive amazement possessed them , and they said nothing to any one , for they were afraid .
DARBY	Mark	16	9	Now when he had risen very early , the first [ day ] of the week , he appeared first to Mary of Magdala , out of whom he had cast seven demons .
DARBY	Mark	16	10	* She * went and brought word to those that had been with him , [ who were ] grieving and weeping .
DARBY	Mark	16	11	And when these heard that he was alive and had been seen of her , they disbelieved [ it ] .
DARBY	Mark	16	12	And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked , going into the country ;
DARBY	Mark	16	13	and * they * went and brought word to the rest ; neither did they believe them .
DARBY	Mark	16	14	Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven , and reproached [ them with ] their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they had not believed those who had seen him risen .
DARBY	Mark	16	15	And he said to them , Go into all the world , and preach the glad tidings to all the creation .
DARBY	Mark	16	17	And these signs shall follow those that have believed : in my name they shall cast out demons ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
DARBY	Mark	16	18	they shall take up serpents ; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them ; they shall lay hands upon the infirm , and they shall be well .
DARBY	Mark	16	19	The Lord therefore , after he had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven , and sat at the right hand of God .
DARBY	Mark	16	20	And they , going forth , preached everywhere , the Lord working with [ them ] , and confirming the word by the signs following upon [ it ] .
DARBY	Luke	1	1	Forasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a relation concerning the matters fully believed among us ,
DARBY	Luke	1	2	as those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word have delivered them to us ,
DARBY	Luke	1	3	it has seemed good to * me * also , accurately acquainted from the origin with all things , to write to thee with method , most excellent Theophilus ,
DARBY	Luke	1	4	that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed .
DARBY	Luke	1	5	There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest , by name Zacharias , of the course of Abia , and his wife of the daughters of Aaron , and her name Elizabeth .
DARBY	Luke	1	6	And they were both just before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless .
DARBY	Luke	1	7	And they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they were both advanced in years .
DARBY	Luke	1	8	And it came to pass , as he fulfilled his priestly service before God in the order of his course ,
DARBY	Luke	1	9	it fell to him by lot , according to the custom of the priesthood , to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense .
DARBY	Luke	1	10	And all the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense .
DARBY	Luke	1	11	And an angel of [ the ] Lord appeared to him , standing on the right of the altar of incense .
DARBY	Luke	1	12	And Zacharias was troubled , seeing [ him ] , and fear fell upon him .
DARBY	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , Fear not , Zacharias , because thy supplication has been heard , and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
DARBY	Luke	1	14	And he shall be to thee joy and rejoicing , and many shall rejoice at his birth .
DARBY	Luke	1	15	For he shall be great before [ the ] Lord , and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with [ the ] Holy Spirit , even from his mother 's womb .
DARBY	Luke	1	16	And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to [ the ] Lord their God .
DARBY	Luke	1	17	And * he * shall go before him in [ the ] spirit and power of Elias , to turn hearts of fathers to children , and disobedient ones to [ the ] thoughts of just [ men ] , to make ready for [ the ] Lord a prepared people .
DARBY	Luke	1	18	And Zacharias said to the angel , How shall I know this , for * I * am an old man , and my wife advanced in years ?
DARBY	Luke	1	19	And the angel answering , said to him , * I * am Gabriel , who stand before God , and I have been sent to speak to thee , and to bring these glad tidings to thee ;
DARBY	Luke	1	20	and behold , thou shalt be silent and not able to speak , till the day in which these things shall take place , because thou hast not believed my words , the which shall be fulfilled in their time .
DARBY	Luke	1	21	And the people were awaiting Zacharias , and they wondered at his delaying in the temple .
DARBY	Luke	1	22	But when he came out he could not speak to them , and they recognised that he had seen a vision in the temple . And he was making signs to them , and continued dumb .
DARBY	Luke	1	23	And it came to pass , when the days of his service were completed , he departed to his house .
DARBY	Luke	1	24	Now after these days , Elizabeth his wife conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
DARBY	Luke	1	25	Thus has [ the ] Lord done to me in [ these ] days in which he looked upon [ me ] to take away my reproach among men .
DARBY	Luke	1	26	But in the sixth month , the angel Gabriel was sent of God to a city of Galilee , of which [ the ] name [ was ] Nazareth ,
DARBY	Luke	1	27	to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name [ was ] Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name [ was ] Mary .
DARBY	Luke	1	28	And the angel came in to her , and said , Hail , [ thou ] favoured one ! the Lord [ is ] with thee : [ blessed art * thou * amongst women ] .
DARBY	Luke	1	29	But she , [ seeing ] [ the angel ] , was troubled at his word , and reasoned in her mind what this salutation might be .
DARBY	Luke	1	30	And the angel said to her , Fear not , Mary , for thou hast found favour with God ;
DARBY	Luke	1	31	and behold , thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus .
DARBY	Luke	1	32	* He * shall be great , and shall be called Son of [ the ] Highest ; and [ the ] Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father ;
DARBY	Luke	1	33	and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the ages , and of his kingdom there shall not be an end .
DARBY	Luke	1	34	But Mary said to the angel , How shall this be , since I know not a man ?
DARBY	Luke	1	35	And the angel answering said to her , [ The ] Holy Spirit shall come upon thee , and power of [ the ] Highest overshadow thee , wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God .
DARBY	Luke	1	36	And behold , Elizabeth , thy kinswoman , she also has conceived a son in her old age , and this is the sixth month to her that was called barren :
DARBY	Luke	1	37	for nothing shall be impossible with God .
DARBY	Luke	1	38	And Mary said , Behold the bondmaid of [ the ] Lord ; be it to me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her .
DARBY	Luke	1	39	And Mary , rising up in those days , went into the hill country with haste , to a city of Judah ,
DARBY	Luke	1	40	and entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elizabeth .
DARBY	Luke	1	41	And it came to pass , as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elizabeth was filled with [ the ] Holy Spirit ,
DARBY	Luke	1	42	and cried out with a loud voice and said , Blessed [ art ] * thou * amongst women , and blessed the fruit of thy womb .
DARBY	Luke	1	43	And whence [ is ] this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
DARBY	Luke	1	44	For behold , as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears , the babe leaped with joy in my womb .
DARBY	Luke	1	45	And blessed [ is ] she that has believed , for there shall be a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Luke	1	46	And Mary said , My soul magnifies the Lord ,
DARBY	Luke	1	47	and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour .
DARBY	Luke	1	48	For he has looked upon the low estate of his bondmaid ; for behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
DARBY	Luke	1	49	For the Mighty One has done to me great things , and holy [ is ] his name ;
DARBY	Luke	1	50	and his mercy [ is ] to generations and generations to them that fear him .
DARBY	Luke	1	51	He has wrought strength with his arm ; he has scattered haughty [ ones ] in the thought of their heart .
DARBY	Luke	1	52	He has put down rulers from thrones , and exalted the lowly .
DARBY	Luke	1	53	He has filled the hungry with good things , and sent away the rich empty .
DARBY	Luke	1	54	He has helped Israel his servant , in order to remember mercy ,
DARBY	Luke	1	55	( as he spoke to our fathers , ) to Abraham and to his seed for ever .
DARBY	Luke	1	56	And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her house .
DARBY	Luke	1	57	But the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth that she should bring forth , and she gave birth to a son .
DARBY	Luke	1	58	And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that [ the ] Lord had magnified his mercy with her , and they rejoiced with her .
DARBY	Luke	1	59	And it came to pass on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they called it after the name of his father , Zacharias .
DARBY	Luke	1	60	And his mother answering said , No ; but he shall be called John .
DARBY	Luke	1	61	And they said to her , There is no one among thy kinsfolk who is called by this name .
DARBY	Luke	1	62	And they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called .
DARBY	Luke	1	63	And having asked for a writing-table , he wrote saying , John is his name . And they all wondered .
DARBY	Luke	1	64	And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue , and he spake , blessing God .
DARBY	Luke	1	65	And fear came upon all who dwelt round about them ; and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these things were the subject of conversation .
DARBY	Luke	1	66	And all who heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , What then will this child be ? And [ the ] Lord 's hand was with him .
DARBY	Luke	1	67	And Zacharias his father was filled with [ the ] Holy Spirit , and prophesied , saying ,
DARBY	Luke	1	68	Blessed be [ the ] Lord the God of Israel , because he has visited and wrought redemption for his people ,
DARBY	Luke	1	69	and raised up a horn of deliverance for us in the house of David his servant ;
DARBY	Luke	1	70	as he spoke by [ the ] mouth of his holy prophets , who have been since the world began ;
DARBY	Luke	1	71	deliverance from our enemies and out of the hand of all who hate us ;
DARBY	Luke	1	72	to fulfil mercy with our fathers and remember his holy covenant ,
DARBY	Luke	1	73	[ the ] oath which he swore to Abraham our father ,
DARBY	Luke	1	74	to give us , that , saved out of the hand of our enemies , we should serve him without fear
DARBY	Luke	1	75	in piety and righteousness before him all our days .
DARBY	Luke	1	76	And * thou * , child , shalt be called [ the ] prophet of [ the ] Highest ; for thou shalt go before the face of [ the ] Lord to make ready his ways ;
DARBY	Luke	1	77	to give knowledge of deliverance to his people by [ the ] remission of their sins
DARBY	Luke	1	78	on account of [ the ] bowels of mercy of our God ; wherein [ the ] dayspring from on high has visited us ,
DARBY	Luke	1	79	to shine upon them who were sitting in darkness and in [ the ] shadow of death , to guide our feet into [ the ] way of peace .
DARBY	Luke	1	80	—And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit ; and he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel .
DARBY	Luke	2	2	The census itself first took place when Cyrenius had the government of Syria .
DARBY	Luke	2	3	And all went to be inscribed in the census roll , each to his own city :
DARBY	Luke	2	4	and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city Nazareth to Judaea , to David 's city , the which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ,
DARBY	Luke	2	5	to be inscribed in the census roll with Mary who was betrothed to him [ as his ] wife , she being great with child .
DARBY	Luke	2	6	And it came to pass , while they were there , the days of her giving birth [ to her child ] were fulfilled ,
DARBY	Luke	2	7	and she brought forth her first-born son , and wrapped him up in swaddling-clothes and laid him in the manger , because there was no room for them in the inn .
DARBY	Luke	2	8	And there were shepherds in that country abiding without , and keeping watch by night over their flock .
DARBY	Luke	2	9	And lo , an angel of [ the ] Lord was there by them , and [ the ] glory of [ the ] Lord shone around them , and they feared [ with ] great fear .
DARBY	Luke	2	10	And the angel said to them , Fear not , for behold , I announce to you glad tidings of great joy , which shall be to all the people ;
DARBY	Luke	2	11	for to-day a Saviour has been born to you in David 's city , who is Christ [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Luke	2	12	And this is the sign to you : ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes , and lying in a manger .
DARBY	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host , praising God and saying ,
DARBY	Luke	2	14	Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good pleasure in men .
DARBY	Luke	2	15	And it came to pass , as the angels departed from them into heaven , that the shepherds said to one another , Let us make our way then now as far as Bethlehem , and let us see this thing that is come to pass , which the Lord has made known to us .
DARBY	Luke	2	16	And they came with haste , and found both Mary and Joseph , and the babe lying in the manger ;
DARBY	Luke	2	17	and having seen [ it ] they made known about the country the thing which had been said to them concerning this child .
DARBY	Luke	2	18	And all who heard [ it ] wondered at the things said to them by the shepherds .
DARBY	Luke	2	19	But Mary kept all these things [ in her mind ] , pondering [ them ] in her heart .
DARBY	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen , as it had been said to them .
DARBY	Luke	2	21	And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him , his name was called Jesus , which was the name given by the angel before he had been conceived in the womb .
DARBY	Luke	2	22	And when the days were fulfilled for their purifying according to the law of Moses , they brought him to Jerusalem to present [ him ] to the Lord
DARBY	Luke	2	23	( as it is written in the law of [ the ] Lord : Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ) ,
DARBY	Luke	2	24	and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of [ the ] Lord : A pair of turtle doves , or two young pigeons .
DARBY	Luke	2	25	And behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon ; and this man was just and pious , awaiting the consolation of Israel , and [ the ] Holy Spirit was upon him .
DARBY	Luke	2	26	And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit , that he should not see death before he should see [ the ] Lord 's Christ .
DARBY	Luke	2	27	And he came in the Spirit into the temple ; and as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law ,
DARBY	Luke	2	28	* he * received him into his arms , and blessed God , and said ,
DARBY	Luke	2	29	Lord , now thou lettest thy bondman go , according to thy word , in peace ;
DARBY	Luke	2	30	for mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
DARBY	Luke	2	31	which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples ;
DARBY	Luke	2	32	a light for revelation of [ the ] Gentiles and [ the ] glory of thy people Israel .
DARBY	Luke	2	33	And his father and mother wondered at the things which were said concerning him .
DARBY	Luke	2	34	And Simeon blessed them , and said to Mary his mother , Lo , this [ child ] is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel , and for a sign spoken against ;
DARBY	Luke	2	35	( and even a sword shall go through thine own soul ; ) so that [ the ] thoughts may be revealed from many hearts .
DARBY	Luke	2	36	And there was a prophetess , Anna , daughter of Phanuel , of [ the ] tribe of Asher , who was far advanced in years , having lived with [ her ] husband seven years from her virginity ,
DARBY	Luke	2	37	and herself a widow up to eighty-four years ; who did not depart from the temple , serving night and day with fastings and prayers ;
DARBY	Luke	2	38	and she coming up the same hour gave praise to the Lord , and spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Luke	2	39	And when they had completed all things according to the law of [ the ] Lord , they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth .
DARBY	Luke	2	40	And the child grew and waxed strong [ in spirit ] , filled with wisdom , and God 's grace was upon him .
DARBY	Luke	2	41	And his parents went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover .
DARBY	Luke	2	42	And when he was twelve years old , and they went up [ to Jerusalem ] according to the custom of the feast
DARBY	Luke	2	43	and had completed the days , as they returned , the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem , and his parents knew not [ of it ] ;
DARBY	Luke	2	44	but , supposing him to be in the company that journeyed together , they went a day 's journey , and sought him among their relations and acquaintances :
DARBY	Luke	2	45	and not having found him they returned to Jerusalem seeking him .
DARBY	Luke	2	46	And it came to pass , after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers and hearing them and asking them questions .
DARBY	Luke	2	47	And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
DARBY	Luke	2	48	And when they saw him they were amazed : and his mother said to him , Child , why hast thou dealt thus with us ? behold , thy father and I have sought thee distressed .
DARBY	Luke	2	49	And he said to them , Why [ is it ] that ye have sought me ? did ye not know that I ought to be [ occupied ] in my Father 's business ?
DARBY	Luke	2	50	And they understood not the thing that he said to them .
DARBY	Luke	2	51	And he went down with them and came to Nazareth , and he was in subjection to them . And his mother kept all these things in her heart .
DARBY	Luke	2	52	And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature , and in favour with God and men .
DARBY	Luke	3	3	And he came into all the district round the Jordan , preaching [ the ] baptism of repentance for [ the ] remission of sins ,
DARBY	Luke	3	2	in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , [ the ] word of God came upon John , the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness .
DARBY	Luke	3	4	as it is written in [ the ] book of [ the ] words of Esaias the prophet : Voice of one crying in the wilderness : Prepare ye the way of [ the ] Lord , make straight his paths .
DARBY	Luke	3	5	Every gorge shall be filled up , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low , and the crooked [ places ] shall become a straight [ path ] , and the rough places smooth ways ,
DARBY	Luke	3	6	and all flesh shall see the salvation of God .
DARBY	Luke	3	7	He said therefore to the crowds which went out to be baptised by him , Offspring of vipers , who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
DARBY	Luke	3	8	Produce therefore fruits worthy of repentance ; and begin not to say in yourselves , We have Abraham for [ our ] father , for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham .
DARBY	Luke	3	9	And already also the axe is applied to the root of the trees ; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into [ the ] fire .
DARBY	Luke	3	10	And the crowds asked him saying , What should we do then ?
DARBY	Luke	3	11	And he answering says to them , He that has two body-coats , let him give to him that has none ; and he that has food , let him do likewise .
DARBY	Luke	3	12	And tax-gatherers came also to be baptised , and they said to him , Teacher , what should we do ?
DARBY	Luke	3	13	And he said to them , Take no more [ money ] than what is appointed to you .
DARBY	Luke	3	14	And persons engaged in military service also asked him saying , And we , what should we do ? And he said to them , Oppress no one , nor accuse falsely , and be satisfied with your pay .
DARBY	Luke	3	15	But as the people were in expectation , and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John whether * he * might be the Christ ,
DARBY	Luke	3	16	John answered all , saying , * I * indeed baptise you with water , but the mightier than I is coming , the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to unloose ; * he * shall baptise you with [ the ] Holy Spirit and fire ;
DARBY	Luke	3	17	whose winnowing-fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly purge his threshing-floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner , but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
DARBY	Luke	3	18	Exhorting then many other things also he announced [ his ] glad tidings to the people .
DARBY	Luke	3	19	But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him as to Herodias , the wife of his brother , and as to all the wicked things which Herod had done ,
DARBY	Luke	3	20	added this also to all [ the rest ] , that he shut up John in prison .
DARBY	Luke	3	21	And it came to pass , all the people having been baptised , and Jesus having been baptised and praying , that the heaven was opened ,
DARBY	Luke	3	22	and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him ; and a voice came out of heaven , * Thou * art my beloved Son , in thee I have found my delight .
DARBY	Luke	3	23	And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old ; being as was supposed son of Joseph ; of Eli ,
DARBY	Luke	3	24	of Matthat , of Levi , of Melchi , of Janna , of Joseph ,
DARBY	Luke	3	25	of Mattathias , of Amos , of Naoum , of Esli , of Naggai ,
DARBY	Luke	3	26	of Maath , of Mattathias , of Semei , of Joseph , of Juda ,
DARBY	Luke	3	27	of Joannes , of Resa , of Zorobabel , of Salathiel , of Neri ,
DARBY	Luke	3	28	of Melchi , of Addi , of Cosam , of Elmodam , of Er ,
DARBY	Luke	3	29	of Joses , of Eliezer , of Joreim , of Matthat , of Levi ,
DARBY	Luke	3	30	of Simeon , of Juda , of Joseph , of Jonan , of Eliakim ,
DARBY	Luke	3	31	of Meleas , of Menan , of Mattatha , of Nathan , of David ,
DARBY	Luke	3	32	of Jesse , of Obed , of Booz , of Salmon , of Naasson ,
DARBY	Luke	3	33	of Aminadab , of Aram , of Esrom , of Phares , of Juda ,
DARBY	Luke	3	34	of Jacob , of Isaac , of Abraham , of Terah , of Nachor ,
DARBY	Luke	3	35	of Seruch , of Ragau , of Phalek , of Eber , of Sala ,
DARBY	Luke	3	36	of Cainan , of Arphaxad , of Sem , of Noe , of Lamech ,
DARBY	Luke	3	37	of Methusala , of Enoch , of Jared , of Maleleel , of Cainan ,
DARBY	Luke	3	38	of Enos , of Seth , of Adam , of God .
DARBY	Luke	4	4	And Jesus answered unto him saying , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
DARBY	Luke	4	2	forty days , tempted of the devil ; and in those days he did not eat anything , and when they were finished he hungered .
DARBY	Luke	4	3	And the devil said to him , If thou be Son of God , speak to this stone , that it become bread .
DARBY	Luke	4	5	And [ the devil ] , leading him up into a high mountain , shewed him all the kingdoms of the habitable world in a moment of time .
DARBY	Luke	4	6	And the devil said to him , I will give thee all this power , and their glory ; for it is given up to me , and to whomsoever I will I give it .
DARBY	Luke	4	7	If therefore * thou * wilt do homage before me , all [ of it ] shall be thine .
DARBY	Luke	4	8	And Jesus answering him said , It is written , Thou shalt do homage to [ the ] Lord thy God , and him alone shalt thou serve .
DARBY	Luke	4	9	And he led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the edge of the temple , and said to him , If thou be Son of God , cast thyself down hence ;
DARBY	Luke	4	10	for it is written , He shall give charge to his angels concerning thee to keep thee ;
DARBY	Luke	4	11	and on [ their ] hands shall they bear thee , lest in any wise thou strike thy foot against a stone .
DARBY	Luke	4	12	And Jesus answering said to him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt [ the ] Lord thy God .
DARBY	Luke	4	13	And the devil , having completed every temptation , departed from him for a time .
DARBY	Luke	4	14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee ; and a rumour went out into the whole surrounding country about him ;
DARBY	Luke	4	15	and * he * taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
DARBY	Luke	4	16	And he came to Nazareth , where he was brought up ; and he entered , according to his custom , into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up to read .
DARBY	Luke	4	17	And [ the ] book of the prophet Esaias was given to him ; and having unrolled the book he found the place where it was written ,
DARBY	Luke	4	18	[ The ] Spirit of [ the ] Lord is upon me , because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to [ the ] poor ; he has sent me to preach to captives deliverance , and to [ the ] blind sight , to send forth [ the ] crushed delivered ,
DARBY	Luke	4	19	to preach [ the ] acceptable year of [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Luke	4	20	And having rolled up the book , when he had delivered it up to the attendant , he sat down ; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him .
DARBY	Luke	4	21	And he began to say to them , To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears .
DARBY	Luke	4	22	And all bore witness to him , and wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth . And they said , Is not this the son of Joseph ?
DARBY	Luke	4	23	And he said to them , Ye will surely say to me this parable , Physician , heal thyself ; whatsoever we have heard has taken place in Capernaum do here also in thine own country .
DARBY	Luke	4	24	And he said , Verily I say to you , that no prophet is acceptable in his [ own ] country .
DARBY	Luke	4	25	But of a truth I say to you , There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months , so that a great famine came upon all the land ,
DARBY	Luke	4	26	and to none of them was Elias sent but to Sarepta of Sidonia , to a woman [ that was ] a widow .
DARBY	Luke	4	27	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian .
DARBY	Luke	4	28	And they were all filled with rage in the synagogue , hearing these things ;
DARBY	Luke	4	29	and rising up they cast him forth out of the city , and led him up to the brow of the mountain upon which their city was built , so that they might throw him down the precipice ;
DARBY	Luke	4	30	but * he * , passing through the midst of them , went his way ,
DARBY	Luke	4	31	and descended to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbaths .
DARBY	Luke	4	32	And they were astonished at his doctrine , for his word was with authority .
DARBY	Luke	4	33	And there was in the synagogue a man having a spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried with a loud voice ,
DARBY	Luke	4	34	saying , Eh ! what have we to do with thee , Jesus , Nazarene ? hast thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy [ One ] of God .
DARBY	Luke	4	35	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out from him . And the demon , having thrown him down into the midst , came out from him without doing him any injury .
DARBY	Luke	4	36	And astonishment came upon all , and they spoke to one another , saying , What word [ is ] this ? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits , and they come out .
DARBY	Luke	4	37	And a rumour went out into every place of the country round concerning him .
DARBY	Luke	4	38	And rising up out of the synagogue , he entered into the house of Simon . But Simon 's mother-in-law was suffering under a bad fever ; and they asked him for her .
DARBY	Luke	4	39	And standing over her , he rebuked the fever , and it left her ; and forthwith standing up she served them .
DARBY	Luke	4	40	And when the sun went down , all , as many as had persons sick with divers diseases , brought them to him , and having laid his hands on every one of them , he healed them ;
DARBY	Luke	4	41	and demons also went out from many , crying out and saying , * Thou * art the Son of God . And rebuking them , he suffered them not to speak , because they knew him to be the Christ .
DARBY	Luke	4	42	And when it was day he went out , and went into a desert place , and the crowds sought after him , and came up to him , and [ would have ] kept him back that he should not go from them .
DARBY	Luke	4	43	But he said to them , I must needs announce the glad tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also , for for this I have been sent forth .
DARBY	Luke	4	44	And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee .
DARBY	Luke	5	5	And Simon answering said to him , Master , having laboured through the whole night we have taken nothing , but at thy word I will let down the net .
DARBY	Luke	5	2	and he saw two ships standing by the lake , but the fishermen , having come down from them , were washing their nets .
DARBY	Luke	5	3	And getting into one of the ships , which was Simon 's , he asked him to draw out a little from the land ; and he sat down and taught the crowds out of the ship .
DARBY	Luke	5	4	But when he ceased speaking , he said to Simon , Draw out into the deep [ water ] and let down your nets for a haul .
DARBY	Luke	5	6	And having done this , they enclosed a great multitude of fishes . And their net broke .
DARBY	Luke	5	7	And they beckoned to their partners who were in the other ship to come and help them , and they came , and filled both the ships , so that they were sinking .
DARBY	Luke	5	8	But Simon Peter , seeing it , fell at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , Lord .
DARBY	Luke	5	9	For astonishment had laid hold on him , and on all those who were with him , at the haul of fishes which they had taken ;
DARBY	Luke	5	10	and in like manner also on James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , Fear not ; henceforth thou shalt be catching men .
DARBY	Luke	5	11	And having run the ships on shore , leaving all they followed him .
DARBY	Luke	5	12	And it came to pass as he was in one of the cities , that behold , there was a man full of leprosy , and seeing Jesus , falling upon his face , he besought him saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou art able to cleanse me .
DARBY	Luke	5	13	And stretching forth his hand he touched him , saying , I will ; be thou cleansed : and immediately the leprosy departed from him .
DARBY	Luke	5	14	And he enjoined him to tell no one ; but go , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing as Moses ordained , for a testimony to them .
DARBY	Luke	5	15	But the report concerning him was spread abroad still more , and great crowds came together to hear , and to be healed from their infirmities .
DARBY	Luke	5	16	And * he * withdrew himself , and was about in the desert [ places ] and praying .
DARBY	Luke	5	17	And it came to pass on one of the days , that * he * was teaching , and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and [ out of ] Jerusalem ; and [ the ] Lord 's power was [ there ] to heal them .
DARBY	Luke	5	18	And lo , men bringing upon a couch a man who was paralysed ; and they sought to bring him in , and put [ him ] before him .
DARBY	Luke	5	19	And not finding what way to bring him in , on account of the crowd , going up on the housetop they let him down through the tiles , with his little couch , into the midst before Jesus .
DARBY	Luke	5	20	And seeing their faith , he said , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
DARBY	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason [ in their minds ] , saying , Who is this who speaks blasphemies ? Who is able to forgive sins but God alone ?
DARBY	Luke	5	22	But Jesus , knowing their reasonings , answering said to them , Why reason ye in your hearts ?
DARBY	Luke	5	23	which is easier , to say , Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ?
DARBY	Luke	5	24	But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins , he said to the paralysed man , I say to thee , Arise , and take up thy little couch and go to thine house .
DARBY	Luke	5	25	And immediately standing up before them , having taken up that whereon he was laid , he departed to his house , glorifying God .
DARBY	Luke	5	26	And astonishment seized all , and they glorified God , and were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to-day .
DARBY	Luke	5	27	And after these things he went forth and saw a tax-gatherer , Levi by name , sitting at the receipt of taxes , and said to him , Follow me .
DARBY	Luke	5	28	And having left all , rising up , he followed him .
DARBY	Luke	5	29	And Levi made a great entertainment for him in his house , and there was a great crowd of tax-gatherers and others who were at table with them .
DARBY	Luke	5	30	And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured at his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with tax-gatherers and sinners ?
DARBY	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answering said to them , They that are in sound health have not need of a physician , but those that are ill.
DARBY	Luke	5	32	I am not come to call righteous [ persons ] , but sinful [ ones ] to repentance .
DARBY	Luke	5	33	And they said to him , Why do the disciples of John fast often and make supplications , in like manner those also of the Pharisees , but thine eat and drink ?
DARBY	Luke	5	34	And he said to them , Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast when the bridegroom is with them ?
DARBY	Luke	5	35	But days will come when also the bridegroom will have been taken away from them ; then shall they fast in those days .
DARBY	Luke	5	36	And he spoke also a parable to them : No one puts a piece of a new garment upon an old garment , otherwise he will both rend the new , and the piece which is from the new will not suit with the old .
DARBY	Luke	5	37	And no one puts new wine into old skins , otherwise the new wine will burst the skins , and it will be poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ;
DARBY	Luke	5	38	but new wine is to be put into new skins , and both are preserved .
DARBY	Luke	5	39	And no one having drunk old wine [ straightway ] wishes for new , for he says , The old is better .
DARBY	Luke	6	6	And it came to pass on another sabbath also that he entered into the synagogue and taught ; and there was a man there , and his right hand was withered .
DARBY	Luke	6	2	But some of the Pharisees said to them , Why do ye what is not lawful to do on the sabbath ?
DARBY	Luke	6	3	And Jesus answering said to them , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did when he hungered , he and those who were with him ,
DARBY	Luke	6	4	how he entered into the house of God and took the shewbread and ate , and gave to those also who were with him , which it is not lawful that [ any ] eat , unless the priests alone ?
DARBY	Luke	6	5	And he said to them , The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also .
DARBY	Luke	6	7	And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching if he would heal on the sabbath , that they might find something of which to accuse him .
DARBY	Luke	6	8	But * he * knew their thoughts , and said to the man who had the withered hand , Get up , and stand in the midst . And having risen up he stood [ there ] .
DARBY	Luke	6	9	Jesus therefore said to them , I will ask you if it is lawful on the sabbath to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy [ it ] ?
DARBY	Luke	6	10	And having looked around on them all , he said to him , Stretch out thy hand . And he did [ so ] and his hand was restored as the other .
DARBY	Luke	6	11	But * they * were filled with madness , and they spoke together among themselves what they should do to Jesus .
DARBY	Luke	6	12	And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the mountain to pray , and he spent the night in prayer to God .
DARBY	Luke	6	13	And when it was day he called his disciples , and having chosen out twelve from them , whom also he named apostles :
DARBY	Luke	6	14	Simon , to whom also he gave the name of Peter , and Andrew his brother , [ and ] James and John , [ and ] Philip and Bartholomew ,
DARBY	Luke	6	15	[ and ] Matthew and Thomas , James the [ son ] of Alphaeus and Simon who was called Zealot ,
DARBY	Luke	6	16	[ and ] Judas [ brother ] of James , and Judas Iscariote , who was also [ his ] betrayer ;
DARBY	Luke	6	17	and having descended with them , he stood on a level place , and a crowd of his disciples , and a great multitude of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem , and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
DARBY	Luke	6	18	and those that were beset by unclean spirits were healed .
DARBY	Luke	6	19	And all the crowd sought to touch him , for power went out from him and healed all .
DARBY	Luke	6	20	And * he * , lifting up his eyes upon his disciples , said , Blessed [ are ] ye poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Luke	6	21	Blessed ye that hunger now , for ye shall be filled . Blessed ye that weep now , for ye shall laugh .
DARBY	Luke	6	22	Blessed are ye when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you [ from them ] , and shall reproach [ you ] , and cast out your name as wicked , for the Son of man 's sake :
DARBY	Luke	6	23	rejoice in that day and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in the heaven , for after this manner did their fathers act toward the prophets .
DARBY	Luke	6	24	But woe to you rich , for ye have received your consolation .
DARBY	Luke	6	25	Woe to you that are filled , for ye shall hunger . Woe to you who laugh now , for ye shall mourn and weep .
DARBY	Luke	6	26	Woe , when all men speak well of you , for after this manner did their fathers to the false prophets .
DARBY	Luke	6	27	But to you that hear I say , Love your enemies ; do good to those that hate you ;
DARBY	Luke	6	28	bless those that curse you ; pray for those who use you despitefully .
DARBY	Luke	6	29	To him that smites thee on the cheek , offer also the other ; and from him that would take away thy garment , forbid not thy body-coat also .
DARBY	Luke	6	30	To every one that asks of thee , give ; and from him that takes away what is thine , ask it not back .
DARBY	Luke	6	31	And as ye wish that men should do to you , do * ye * also to them in like manner .
DARBY	Luke	6	32	And if ye love those that love you , what thank is it to you ? for even sinners love those that love them .
DARBY	Luke	6	33	And if ye do good to those that do good to you , what thank is it to you ? for even sinners do the same .
DARBY	Luke	6	34	And if ye lend to those from whom ye hope to receive , what thank is it to you ? [ for ] even sinners lend to sinners that they may receive the like .
DARBY	Luke	6	35	But love your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing in return , and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be sons of [ the ] Highest ; for * he * is good to the unthankful and wicked .
DARBY	Luke	6	36	Be ye therefore merciful , even as your Father also is merciful .
DARBY	Luke	6	37	And judge not , and ye shall not be judged ; condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned . Remit , and it shall be remitted to you .
DARBY	Luke	6	38	Give , and it shall be given to you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall be given into your bosom : for with the same measure with which ye mete it shall be measured to you again .
DARBY	Luke	6	39	And he spoke also a parable to them : Can a blind [ man ] lead a blind [ man ] ? shall not both fall into [ the ] ditch ?
DARBY	Luke	6	40	The disciple is not above his teacher , but every one that is perfected shall be as his teacher .
DARBY	Luke	6	41	But why lookest thou on the mote which is in the eye of thy brother , but perceivest not the beam which is in thine own eye ?
DARBY	Luke	6	42	or how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , allow [ me ] , I will cast out the mote that is in thine eye , thyself not seeing the beam that is in thine eye ? Hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine eye , and then thou shalt see clear to cast out the mote which is in the eye of thy brother .
DARBY	Luke	6	43	For there is no good tree which produces corrupt fruit , nor a corrupt tree which produces good fruit ;
DARBY	Luke	6	44	for every tree is known by its own fruit , for figs are not gathered from thorns , nor grapes vintaged from a bramble .
DARBY	Luke	6	45	The good man , out of the good treasure of his heart , brings forth good ; and the wicked [ man ] out of the wicked , brings forth what is wicked : for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks .
DARBY	Luke	6	46	And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things that I say ?
DARBY	Luke	6	47	Every one that comes to me , and hears my words and does them , I will shew you to whom he is like .
DARBY	Luke	6	48	He is like a man building a house , who dug and went deep , and laid a foundation on the rock ; but a great rain coming , the stream broke upon that house , and could not shake it , for it had been founded on the rock .
DARBY	Luke	6	49	And he that has heard and not done , is like a man who has built a house on the ground without [ a ] foundation , on which the stream broke , and immediately it fell , and the breach of that house was great .
DARBY	Luke	7	7	Wherefore neither did I count myself worthy to come to thee . But say by a word and my servant shall be healed .
DARBY	Luke	7	2	And a certain centurion 's bondman who was dear to him was ill and about to die ;
DARBY	Luke	7	3	and having heard of Jesus , he sent to him elders of the Jews , begging him that he might come and save his bondman .
DARBY	Luke	7	4	But they , being come to Jesus , besought him diligently , saying , He is worthy to whom thou shouldest grant this ,
DARBY	Luke	7	5	for he loves our nation , and himself has built the synagogue for us .
DARBY	Luke	7	6	And Jesus went with them . But already , when he was not far from the house , the centurion sent to him friends , saying to him , Lord , do not trouble thyself , for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof .
DARBY	Luke	7	8	For * I * also am a man placed under authority , having under myself soldiers , and I say to this [ one ] , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my bondman , Do this , and he does [ it ] .
DARBY	Luke	7	9	And Jesus hearing this wondered at him , and turning to the crowd following him said , I say to you , Not even in Israel have I found so great faith .
DARBY	Luke	7	10	And they who had been sent returning to the house found the bondman , who was ill , in good health .
DARBY	Luke	7	11	And it came to pass afterwards he went into a city called Nain , and many of his disciples and a great crowd went with him .
DARBY	Luke	7	12	And as he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , a dead man was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she a widow , and a very considerable crowd of the city [ was ] with her .
DARBY	Luke	7	13	And the Lord , seeing her , was moved with compassion for her , and said to her , Weep not ;
DARBY	Luke	7	14	and coming up he touched the bier , and the bearers stopped . And he said , Youth , I say to thee , Wake up .
DARBY	Luke	7	15	And the dead sat up and began to speak ; and he gave him to his mother .
DARBY	Luke	7	16	And fear seized on all , and they glorified God , saying , A great prophet has been raised up amongst us ; and God has visited his people .
DARBY	Luke	7	17	And this report went out in all Judaea concerning him , and in all the surrounding country .
DARBY	Luke	7	18	And the disciples of John brought him word concerning all these things :
DARBY	Luke	7	19	and John , having called two of his disciples , sent to Jesus , saying , Art * thou * he that is coming , or are we to wait for another ?
DARBY	Luke	7	20	But the men having come to him said , John the baptist has sent us to thee , saying , Art * thou * he that is coming , or are we to wait for another ?
DARBY	Luke	7	21	In that hour he healed many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits , and to many blind he granted sight .
DARBY	Luke	7	22	And Jesus answering said to them , Go , bring back word to John of what ye have seen and heard : that blind see , lame walk , lepers are cleansed , deaf hear , dead are raised , poor are evangelized ;
DARBY	Luke	7	23	and blessed is whosoever shall not be offended in me .
DARBY	Luke	7	24	And the messengers of John having departed , he began to speak to the crowds concerning John : What went ye out into the wilderness to behold ? a reed shaken by the wind ?
DARBY	Luke	7	25	But what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in delicate garments ? Behold , those who are in splendid clothing and live luxuriously are in the courts of kings .
DARBY	Luke	7	26	But what went ye out to see ? a prophet ? Yea , I say to you , and [ what is ] more excellent than a prophet .
DARBY	Luke	7	27	This is he concerning whom it is written , Behold , * I * send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee ;
DARBY	Luke	7	28	for I say unto you , Among them that are born of women a greater [ prophet ] is no one than John [ the baptist ] ; but he who is a little one in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
DARBY	Luke	7	29	( And all the people who heard [ it ] , and the tax-gatherers , justified God , having been baptised with the baptism of John ;
DARBY	Luke	7	30	but the Pharisees and the lawyers rendered null as to themselves the counsel of God , not having been baptised by him . )
DARBY	Luke	7	31	To whom therefore shall I liken the men of this generation , and to whom are they like ?
DARBY	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the market-place , and calling one to another and saying , We have piped to you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
DARBY	Luke	7	33	For John the baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and ye say , He has a demon .
DARBY	Luke	7	34	The Son of man has come eating and drinking , and ye say , Behold an eater and wine-drinker , a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners ;
DARBY	Luke	7	35	and wisdom has been justified of all her children .
DARBY	Luke	7	36	But one of the Pharisees begged him that he would eat with him . And entering into the house of the Pharisee he took his place at table ;
DARBY	Luke	7	37	and behold , a woman in the city , who was a sinner , and knew that he was sitting at meat in the house of the Pharisee , having taken an alabaster box of myrrh ,
DARBY	Luke	7	38	and standing at his feet behind [ him ] weeping , began to wash his feet with tears ; and she wiped them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed [ them ] with the myrrh .
DARBY	Luke	7	39	And the Pharisee who had invited him , seeing it , spoke with himself saying , This [ person ] if he were a prophet would have known who and what the woman is who touches him , for she is a sinner .
DARBY	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answering said to him , Simon , I have somewhat to say to thee . And he says , Teacher , say [ it ] .
DARBY	Luke	7	41	There were two debtors of a certain creditor : one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty ;
DARBY	Luke	7	42	but as they had nothing to pay , he forgave both of them [ their debt ] : [ say , ] which of them therefore will love him most ?
DARBY	Luke	7	43	And Simon answering said , I suppose he to whom he forgave the most . And he said to him , Thou hast rightly judged .
DARBY	Luke	7	44	And turning to the woman he said to Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thy house ; thou gavest me not water on my feet , but * she * has washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with her hair .
DARBY	Luke	7	45	Thou gavest me not a kiss , but * she * from the time I came in has not ceased kissing my feet .
DARBY	Luke	7	46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint , but * she * has anointed my feet with myrrh .
DARBY	Luke	7	47	For which cause I say to thee , Her many sins are forgiven ; for she loved much ; but he to whom little is forgiven loves little .
DARBY	Luke	7	48	And he said to her , Thy sins are forgiven .
DARBY	Luke	7	49	And they that were with [ them ] at table began to say within themselves , Who is this who forgives also sins ?
DARBY	Luke	7	50	And he said to the woman , Thy faith has saved thee ; go in peace .
DARBY	Luke	8	8	and other fell into the good ground , and having sprung up bore fruit a hundredfold . As he said these things he cried , He that has ears to hear , let him hear .
DARBY	Luke	8	2	and certain women who had been healed of wicked spirits and infirmities , Mary who was called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ,
DARBY	Luke	8	3	and Joanna , wife of Chuza , Herod 's steward , and Susanna , and many others , who ministered to him of their substance .
DARBY	Luke	8	4	And a great crowd coming together , and those who were coming to him out of each city , he spoke by parable :
DARBY	Luke	8	5	The sower went out to sow his seed ; and as he sowed , some fell along the way , and it was trodden under foot , and the birds of the heaven devoured it up ;
DARBY	Luke	8	6	and other fell upon the rock , and having sprung up , it was dried up because it had not moisture ;
DARBY	Luke	8	7	and other fell in the midst of the thorns , and the thorns having sprung up with [ it ] choked it ;
DARBY	Luke	8	9	And his disciples asked him [ saying ] , What may this parable be ?
DARBY	Luke	8	10	And he said , To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God , but to the rest in parables , in order that seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand .
DARBY	Luke	8	11	But the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
DARBY	Luke	8	12	But those by the wayside are those who hear ; then comes the devil and takes away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved .
DARBY	Luke	8	13	But those upon the rock , those who when they hear receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , who believe for a time , and in time of trial fall away .
DARBY	Luke	8	14	But that that fell where the thorns were , these are they who having heard go away and are choked under cares and riches and pleasures of life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
DARBY	Luke	8	15	But that in the good ground , these are they who in an honest and good heart , having heard the word keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
DARBY	Luke	8	16	And no one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch , but sets it on a lamp-stand , that they who enter in may see the light .
DARBY	Luke	8	17	For there is nothing hid which shall not become manifest , nor secret which shall not be known and come to light .
DARBY	Luke	8	18	Take heed therefore how ye hear ; for whosoever has , to him shall be given , and whosoever has not , even what he seems to have shall be taken from him .
DARBY	Luke	8	19	And his mother and his brethren came to him , and could not get to him because of the crowd .
DARBY	Luke	8	20	And it was told him [ saying ] , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , wishing to see thee .
DARBY	Luke	8	21	But he answering said to them , My mother and my brethren are those who hear the word of God and do [ it ] .
DARBY	Luke	8	22	And it came to pass on one of the days , that * he * entered into a ship , himself and his disciples ; and he said to them , Let us pass over to the other side of the lake ; and they set off from shore .
DARBY	Luke	8	23	And as they sailed , he fell asleep ; and a sudden squall of wind came down on the lake , and they were filled [ with water ] , and were in danger ;
DARBY	Luke	8	24	and coming to [ him ] they woke him up , saying , Master , master , we perish . But he , rising up , rebuked the wind and the raging of the water ; and they ceased , and there was a calm .
DARBY	Luke	8	25	And he said to them , Where is your faith ? And , being afraid , they were astonished , saying to one another , Who then is this , that he commands even the winds and the water , and they obey him ?
DARBY	Luke	8	26	And they arrived in the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee .
DARBY	Luke	8	27	And as he got out [ of the ship ] on the land , a certain man out of the city met him , who had demons a long time , and put on no clothes , and did not abide in a house , but in the tombs .
DARBY	Luke	8	28	But seeing Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus Son of the Most High God ? I beseech thee torment me not .
DARBY	Luke	8	29	For he had commanded the unclean spirit to go out from the man . For very often it had seized him ; and he had been bound , kept with chains and fetters ; and breaking the bonds he was driven by the demon into the deserts .
DARBY	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him saying , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion : for many demons had entered into him .
DARBY	Luke	8	31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go away into the bottomless pit .
DARBY	Luke	8	32	And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain , and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into those ; and he suffered them .
DARBY	Luke	8	33	And the demons , going out from the man , entered into the swine , and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake , and were choked .
DARBY	Luke	8	34	But they that fed [ them ] , seeing what had happened , fled , and told [ it ] to the city and to the country .
DARBY	Luke	8	35	And they went out to see what had happened , and came to Jesus , and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting , clothed and sensible , at the feet of Jesus . And they were afraid .
DARBY	Luke	8	36	And they also who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been healed .
DARBY	Luke	8	37	And all the multitude of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them , for they were possessed with great fear ; and * he * , entering into the ship , returned .
DARBY	Luke	8	38	But the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him that he might be with him . But he sent him away , saying ,
DARBY	Luke	8	39	Return to thine house and relate how great things God has done for thee . And he went away through the whole city , publishing how great things Jesus had done for him .
DARBY	Luke	8	40	And it came to pass when Jesus returned , the crowd received him gladly , for they were all expecting him .
DARBY	Luke	8	41	And behold , a man came , whose name was Jairus , and he was [ a ] ruler of the synagogue , and falling at the feet of Jesus besought him to come to his house ,
DARBY	Luke	8	42	because he had an only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was dying . And as he went the crowds thronged him .
DARBY	Luke	8	43	And a woman who had a flux of blood since twelve years , who , having spent all her living on physicians , could not be cured by any one ,
DARBY	Luke	8	44	coming up behind , touched the hem of his garment , and immediately her flux of blood stopped .
DARBY	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , Who has touched me ? But all denying , Peter and those with him said , Master , the crowds close thee in and press upon thee , and sayest thou , Who has touched me ?
DARBY	Luke	8	46	And Jesus said , Some one has touched me , for * I * have known that power has gone out from me .
DARBY	Luke	8	47	And the woman , seeing that she was not hid , came trembling , and falling down before him declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him , and how she was immediately healed .
DARBY	Luke	8	48	And he said to her , [ Be of good courage , ] daughter ; thy faith has healed thee ; go in peace .
DARBY	Luke	8	49	While he was yet speaking , comes some one from the ruler of the synagogue , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; do not trouble the teacher .
DARBY	Luke	8	50	But Jesus , hearing it , answered him saying , Fear not : only believe , and she shall be made well .
DARBY	Luke	8	51	And when he came to the house he suffered no one to go in but Peter and John and James and the father of the child and the mother .
DARBY	Luke	8	52	And all were weeping and lamenting her . But he said , Do not weep , for she has not died , but sleeps .
DARBY	Luke	8	53	And they derided him , knowing that she had died .
DARBY	Luke	8	54	But * he * , having turned them all out and taking hold of her hand , cried saying , Child , arise .
DARBY	Luke	8	55	And her spirit returned , and immediately she rose up ; and he commanded [ something ] to eat to be given to her .
DARBY	Luke	8	56	And her parents were amazed ; but he enjoined them to tell no one what had happened .
DARBY	Luke	9	9	And Herod said , John * I * have beheaded , but who is this of whom I hear such things ? and he sought to see him .
DARBY	Luke	9	2	and sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick .
DARBY	Luke	9	3	And he said to them , Take nothing for the way , neither staff , nor scrip , nor bread , nor money ; nor to have two body-coats apiece .
DARBY	Luke	9	4	And into whatsoever house ye enter , there abide and thence go forth .
DARBY	Luke	9	5	And as many as may not receive you , going forth from that city , shake off even the dust from your feet for a witness against them .
DARBY	Luke	9	6	And going forth they passed through the villages , announcing the glad tidings and healing everywhere .
DARBY	Luke	9	7	And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things which were done [ by him ] , and was in perplexity , because it was said by some that John was risen from among [ the ] dead ,
DARBY	Luke	9	8	and by some that Elias had appeared , and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again .
DARBY	Luke	9	10	And the apostles having returned related to him whatever they had done . And he took them and withdrew apart into [ a desert place of ] a city called Bethsaida .
DARBY	Luke	9	11	But the crowds knowing [ it ] followed him ; and he received them and spake to them of the kingdom of God , and cured those that had need of healing .
DARBY	Luke	9	12	But the day began to decline , and the twelve came and said to him , Send away the crowd that they may go into the villages around , and [ into ] the fields , and lodge and find victuals , for here we are in a desert place .
DARBY	Luke	9	13	And he said to them , Give * ye them to eat . And they said , We have not more than five loaves and two fishes , unless * we * should go and buy food for all this people ;
DARBY	Luke	9	14	for they were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit down in companies by fifties .
DARBY	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and made them all sit down .
DARBY	Luke	9	16	And taking the five loaves and the two fishes , looking up to heaven he blessed them , and broke and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd .
DARBY	Luke	9	17	And they all ate and were filled ; and there was taken up of what had remained over and above to them in fragments twelve hand-baskets .
DARBY	Luke	9	18	And it came to pass as he was praying alone , his disciples were with him , and he asked them saying , Who do the crowds say that I am ?
DARBY	Luke	9	19	But they answering said , John the baptist ; but others , Elias ; and others , that one of the old prophets has risen again .
DARBY	Luke	9	20	And he said to them , But * ye * , who do ye say that I am ? And Peter answering said , The Christ of God .
DARBY	Luke	9	21	But , earnestly charging them , he enjoined [ them ] to say this to no man ,
DARBY	Luke	9	22	saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
DARBY	Luke	9	23	And he said to [ them ] all , If any one will come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me ;
DARBY	Luke	9	24	for whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it , but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake , * he * shall save it .
DARBY	Luke	9	25	For what shall a man profit if he shall have gained the whole world , and have destroyed , or come under the penalty of the loss of himself ?
DARBY	Luke	9	26	For whosoever shall have been ashamed of me and of my words , of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his glory , and [ in that ] of the Father , and of the holy angels .
DARBY	Luke	9	27	But I say unto you of a truth , There are some of those standing here who shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Luke	9	28	And it came to pass after these words , about eight days , that taking Peter and John and James he went up into a mountain to pray .
DARBY	Luke	9	29	And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white [ and ] effulgent .
DARBY	Luke	9	30	And lo , two men talked with him , who were Moses and Elias ,
DARBY	Luke	9	31	who , appearing in glory , spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Luke	9	32	But Peter and those with him were oppressed with sleep : but having fully awoke up they saw his glory , and the two men who stood with him .
DARBY	Luke	9	33	And it came to pass as they departed from him , Peter said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here ; and let us make three tabernacles , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said .
DARBY	Luke	9	34	But as he was saying these things , there came a cloud and overshadowed them , and they feared as they entered into the cloud :
DARBY	Luke	9	35	and there was a voice out of the cloud saying , * This * is my beloved Son : hear him .
DARBY	Luke	9	36	And as the voice was [ heard ] Jesus was found alone : and * they * kept silence , and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen .
DARBY	Luke	9	37	And it came to pass on the following day , when they came down from the mountain , a great crowd met him .
DARBY	Luke	9	38	And lo , a man from the crowd cried out saying , Teacher , I beseech thee look upon my son , for he is mine only child :
DARBY	Luke	9	39	and behold , a spirit takes him , and suddenly he cries out , and it tears him with foaming , and with difficulty departs from him after crushing him .
DARBY	Luke	9	40	And I besought thy disciples that they might cast him out , and they could not .
DARBY	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answering said , O unbelieving and perverted generation , how long shall I be with you and suffer you ? Bring hither thy son .
DARBY	Luke	9	42	But as he was yet coming , the demon tore him and dragged him all together . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child and gave him back to his father .
DARBY	Luke	9	43	And all were astonished at the glorious greatness of God . And as all wondered at all the things which [ Jesus ] did , he said to his disciples ,
DARBY	Luke	9	44	Do * ye * let these words sink into your ears . For the Son of man is about to be delivered into men 's hands .
DARBY	Luke	9	45	But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them that they should not perceive it . And they feared to ask him concerning this saying .
DARBY	Luke	9	46	And a reasoning came in amongst them , who should be [ the ] greatest of them .
DARBY	Luke	9	47	And Jesus , seeing the reasoning of their heart , having taken a little child set it by him ,
DARBY	Luke	9	48	and said to them , Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receives me , and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me . For he who is the least among you all , * he * is great .
DARBY	Luke	9	49	And John answering said , Master , we saw some one casting out demons in thy name , and we forbad him , because he follows not with us .
DARBY	Luke	9	50	And Jesus said to him , Forbid [ him ] not , for he that is not against you is for you .
DARBY	Luke	9	51	And it came to pass when the days of his receiving up were fulfilled , that * he * stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem .
DARBY	Luke	9	52	And he sent messengers before his face . And having gone they entered into a village of the Samaritans that they might make ready for him .
DARBY	Luke	9	53	And they did not receive him , because his face was [ turned as ] going to Jerusalem .
DARBY	Luke	9	54	And his disciples James and John seeing [ it ] said , Lord , wilt thou that we speak [ that ] fire come down from heaven and consume them , as also Elias did ?
DARBY	Luke	9	55	But turning he rebuked them [ and said , Ye know not of what spirit ye are ] .
DARBY	Luke	9	56	And they went to another village .
DARBY	Luke	9	57	And it came to pass as they went in the way , one said to him , I will follow thee wheresoever thou goest , Lord .
DARBY	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said to him , The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven roosting-places , but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head .
DARBY	Luke	9	59	And he said to another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , allow me to go first and bury my father .
DARBY	Luke	9	60	But Jesus said to him , Suffer the dead to bury their own dead , but do * thou * go and announce the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Luke	9	61	And another also said , I will follow thee , Lord , but first allow me to bid adieu to those at my house .
DARBY	Luke	9	62	But Jesus said to him , No one having laid his hand on [ the ] plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Luke	10	10	But into whatsoever city ye may have entered and they do not receive you , go out into its streets and say ,
DARBY	Luke	10	2	And he said to them , The harvest indeed [ is ] great , but the workmen few ; supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest that he may send out workmen into his harvest .
DARBY	Luke	10	3	Go : behold * I * send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves .
DARBY	Luke	10	4	Carry neither purse nor scrip nor sandals , and salute no one on the way .
DARBY	Luke	10	5	And into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , Peace to this house .
DARBY	Luke	10	6	And if a son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it ; but if not it shall turn to you again .
DARBY	Luke	10	7	And in the same house abide , eating and drinking such things as they have ; for the workman is worthy of his hire . Remove not from house to house .
DARBY	Luke	10	8	And into whatsoever city ye may enter and they receive you , eat what is set before you ,
DARBY	Luke	10	9	and heal the sick in it , and say to them , The kingdom of God is come nigh to you .
DARBY	Luke	10	11	Even the dust of your city , which cleaves to us on the feet , do we shake off against you ; but know this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh .
DARBY	Luke	10	12	I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that city .
DARBY	Luke	10	13	Woe to thee , Chorazin ! woe to thee , Bethsaida ! for if the works of power which have taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon , they had long ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
DARBY	Luke	10	14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you .
DARBY	Luke	10	15	And * thou * , Capernaum , who hast been raised up to heaven , shalt be brought down even to hades .
DARBY	Luke	10	16	He that hears you hears me ; and he that rejects you rejects me ; and he that rejects me rejects him that sent me .
DARBY	Luke	10	17	And the seventy returned with joy , saying , Lord , even the demons are subject to us through thy name .
DARBY	Luke	10	18	And he said to them , I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven .
DARBY	Luke	10	19	Behold , I give you the power of treading upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy , and nothing shall in anywise injure you .
DARBY	Luke	10	20	Yet in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subjected to you , but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens .
DARBY	Luke	10	21	In the same hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said , I praise thee , Father , Lord of the heaven and of the earth , that thou hast hid these things from wise and prudent , and hast revealed them to babes : yea , Father , for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight .
DARBY	Luke	10	22	All things have been delivered to me by my Father , and no one knows who the Son is but the Father , and who the Father is but the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal [ him ] .
DARBY	Luke	10	23	And having turned to the disciples privately he said , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see .
DARBY	Luke	10	24	For I say to you that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye behold , and did not see [ them ] ; and to hear the things which ye hear , and did not hear [ them ] .
DARBY	Luke	10	25	And behold , a certain lawyer stood up tempting him , and saying , Teacher , having done what , shall I inherit life eternal ?
DARBY	Luke	10	26	And he said to him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
DARBY	Luke	10	27	But he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thine understanding ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
DARBY	Luke	10	28	And he said to him , Thou hast answered right : this do and thou shalt live .
DARBY	Luke	10	29	But he , desirous of justifying himself , said to Jesus , And who is my neighbour ?
DARBY	Luke	10	30	And Jesus replying said , A certain man descended from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell into [ the hands of ] robbers , who also , having stripped him and inflicted wounds , went away leaving him in a half-dead state .
DARBY	Luke	10	31	And a certain priest happened to go down that way , and seeing him , passed on on the opposite side ;
DARBY	Luke	10	32	and in like manner also a Levite , being at the spot , came and looked [ at him ] and passed on on the opposite side .
DARBY	Luke	10	33	But a certain Samaritan journeying came to him , and seeing [ him ] , was moved with compassion ,
DARBY	Luke	10	34	and came up [ to him ] and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine ; and having put him on his own beast , took him to [ the ] inn and took care of him .
DARBY	Luke	10	35	And on the morrow [ as he left ] , taking out two denarii he gave them to the innkeeper , and said to him , Take care of him , and whatsoever thou shalt expend more , * I * will render to thee on my coming back .
DARBY	Luke	10	36	Which [ now ] of these three seems to thee to have been neighbour of him who fell into [ the hands of ] the robbers ?
DARBY	Luke	10	37	And he said , He that shewed him mercy . And Jesus said to him , Go , and do * thou * likewise .
DARBY	Luke	10	38	And it came to pass as they went that * he * entered into a certain village ; and a certain woman , Martha by name , received him into her house .
DARBY	Luke	10	39	And she had a sister called Mary , who also , having sat down at the feet of Jesus was listening to his word .
DARBY	Luke	10	40	Now Martha was distracted with much serving , and coming up she said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Speak to her therefore that she may help me .
DARBY	Luke	10	41	But Jesus answering said to her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things ;
DARBY	Luke	10	42	but there is need of one , and Mary has chosen the good part , the which shall not be taken from her .
DARBY	Luke	11	11	But of whom of you that is a father shall a son ask bread , and [ the father ] shall give him a stone ? or also a fish , and instead of a fish shall give him a serpent ?
DARBY	Luke	11	2	And he said to them , When ye pray , say , Father , thy name be hallowed ; thy kingdom come ;
DARBY	Luke	11	3	give us our needed bread for each day ;
DARBY	Luke	11	4	and remit us our sins , for we also remit to every one indebted to us ; and lead us not into temptation .
DARBY	Luke	11	5	And he said to them , Who among you shall have a friend , and shall go to him at midnight and say to him , Friend , let me have three loaves ,
DARBY	Luke	11	6	since a friend of mine on a journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ;
DARBY	Luke	11	7	and he within answering should say , Do not disturb me ; the door is already shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise up to give [ it ] thee ?
DARBY	Luke	11	8	—I say to you , Although he will not get up and give [ them ] to him because he is his friend , because of his shamelessness , at any rate , he will rise and give him as many as he wants .
DARBY	Luke	11	9	And * I * say to you , Ask , and it shall be given to you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened to you .
DARBY	Luke	11	10	For every one that asks receives ; and he that seeks finds ; and to him that knocks it will be opened .
DARBY	Luke	11	12	or if also he shall ask an egg , shall give him a scorpion ?
DARBY	Luke	11	13	If therefore * ye * , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give [ the ] Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
DARBY	Luke	11	14	And he was casting out a demon , and it was dumb ; and it came to pass , the demon being gone out , the dumb [ man ] spoke . And the crowds wondered .
DARBY	Luke	11	15	But some from among them said , By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casts he out demons .
DARBY	Luke	11	16	And others tempting [ him ] sought from him a sign out of heaven .
DARBY	Luke	11	17	But * he * , knowing their thoughts , said to them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation : and a house set against a house falls ;
DARBY	Luke	11	18	and if also Satan is divided against himself , how shall his kingdom subsist ? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub .
DARBY	Luke	11	19	But if * I * by Beelzebub cast out demons , your sons—by whom do they cast [ them ] out ? For this reason * they * shall be your judges .
DARBY	Luke	11	20	But if by the finger of God I cast out demons , then the kingdom of God is come upon you .
DARBY	Luke	11	21	When the strong [ man ] armed keeps his own house , his goods are in peace ;
DARBY	Luke	11	22	but when the stronger than he coming upon [ him ] overcomes him , he takes away his panoply in which he trusted , and he will divide the spoil [ he has taken ] from him .
DARBY	Luke	11	23	He that is not with me is against me , and he that gathers not with me scatters .
DARBY	Luke	11	24	When the unclean spirit has gone out of the man , he goes through dry places seeking rest ; and not finding [ any ] he says , I will return to my house whence I came out .
DARBY	Luke	11	25	And having come , he finds it swept and adorned .
DARBY	Luke	11	26	Then he goes and takes seven other spirits worse than himself , and entering in , they dwell there ; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first .
DARBY	Luke	11	27	And it came to pass as he spake these things , a certain woman , lifting up her voice out of the crowd , said to him , Blessed is the womb that has borne thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked .
DARBY	Luke	11	28	But * he * said , Yea rather , blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep [ it ] .
DARBY	Luke	11	29	But as the crowds thronged together , he began to say , This generation is a wicked generation : it seeks a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it but the sign of Jonas .
DARBY	Luke	11	30	For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites , thus shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
DARBY	Luke	11	31	A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them : for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , more than Solomon is here .
DARBY	Luke	11	32	Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and behold , more than Jonas is here .
DARBY	Luke	11	33	But no one having lit a lamp sets it in secret , nor under the corn-measure , but on the lamp-stand , that they who enter in may see the light .
DARBY	Luke	11	34	The lamp of the body is thine eye : when thine eye is simple , thy whole body also is light ; but when it is wicked , thy body also is dark .
DARBY	Luke	11	35	See therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
DARBY	Luke	11	36	If therefore thy whole body [ is ] light , not having any part dark , it shall be all light as when the lamp lights thee with its brightness .
DARBY	Luke	11	37	But as he spoke , a certain Pharisee asked him that he would dine with him ; and entering in he placed himself at table .
DARBY	Luke	11	38	But the Pharisee seeing [ it ] wondered that he had not first washed before dinner .
DARBY	Luke	11	39	But the Lord said to him , Now do ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish , but your inward [ parts ] are full of plunder and wickedness .
DARBY	Luke	11	40	Fools , has not he who has made the outside made the inside also ?
DARBY	Luke	11	41	But rather give alms of what ye have , and behold , all things are clean to you .
DARBY	Luke	11	42	But woe unto you , Pharisees , for ye pay tithes of mint and rue and every herb , and pass by the judgment and the love of God : these ye ought to have done , and not have left those aside .
DARBY	Luke	11	43	Woe unto you , Pharisees , for ye love the first seat in the synagogues and salutations in the market-places .
DARBY	Luke	11	44	Woe unto you , for ye are as the sepulchres which appear not , and the men walking over them do not know [ it ] .
DARBY	Luke	11	45	And one of the doctors of the law answering says to him , Teacher , in saying these things thou insultest us also .
DARBY	Luke	11	46	And he said , To you also woe , doctors of the law , for ye lay upon men burdens heavy to bear , and yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
DARBY	Luke	11	47	Woe unto you , for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , but your fathers killed them .
DARBY	Luke	11	48	Ye bear witness then , and consent to the works of your fathers ; for * they * killed them , and * ye * build [ their sepulchres ] .
DARBY	Luke	11	49	For this reason also the wisdom of God has said , I will send to them prophets and apostles , and of these shall they kill and drive out by persecution ,
DARBY	Luke	11	50	that the blood of all the prophets which has been poured out from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation ,
DARBY	Luke	11	51	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias , who perished between the altar and the house ; yea , I say to you , it shall be required of this generation .
DARBY	Luke	11	52	Woe unto you , the doctors of the law , for ye have taken away the key of knowledge ; yourselves have not entered in , and those who were entering in ye have hindered .
DARBY	Luke	11	53	And as he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him urgently , and to make him speak of many things ;
DARBY	Luke	11	54	watching him , [ and seeking ] to catch something out of his mouth , [ that they might accuse him ] .
DARBY	Luke	12	12	for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said .
DARBY	Luke	12	2	but there is nothing covered up which shall not be revealed , nor secret that shall not be known ;
DARBY	Luke	12	3	therefore whatever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light , and what ye have spoken in the ear in chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
DARBY	Luke	12	4	But I say to you , my friends , Fear not those who kill the body and after this have no more that they can do .
DARBY	Luke	12	5	But I will shew you whom ye shall fear : Fear him who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell ; yea , I say to you , Fear * him * .
DARBY	Luke	12	6	Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria ? and one of them is not forgotten before God .
DARBY	Luke	12	7	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore , ye are better than many sparrows .
DARBY	Luke	12	8	But I say to you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , the Son of man will confess him also before the angels of God ;
DARBY	Luke	12	9	but he that shall have denied me before men shall be denied before the angels of God ;
DARBY	Luke	12	10	and whoever shall say a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him ; but to him that speaks injuriously against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven .
DARBY	Luke	12	11	But when they bring you before the synagogues and rulers and the authorities , be not careful how or what ye shall answer , or what ye shall say ;
DARBY	Luke	12	13	And a person said to him out of the crowd , Teacher , speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me .
DARBY	Luke	12	14	But he said to him , Man , who established me [ as ] a judge or a divider over you ?
DARBY	Luke	12	15	And he said to them , Take heed and keep yourselves from all covetousness , for [ it is ] not because a man is in abundance [ that ] his life is in his possessions .
DARBY	Luke	12	16	And he spoke a parable to them , saying , The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly .
DARBY	Luke	12	17	And he reasoned within himself saying , What shall I do ? for I have not [ a place ] where I shall lay up my fruits .
DARBY	Luke	12	18	And he said , This will I do : I will take away my granaries and build greater , and there I will lay up all my produce and my good things ;
DARBY	Luke	12	19	and I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much good things laid by for many years ; repose thyself , eat , drink , be merry .
DARBY	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , Fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee ; and whose shall be what thou hast prepared ?
DARBY	Luke	12	21	Thus is he who lays up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God .
DARBY	Luke	12	22	And he said to his disciples , For this cause I say unto you , Be not careful for life , what ye shall eat , nor for the body , what ye shall put on .
DARBY	Luke	12	23	The life is more than food , and the body than raiment .
DARBY	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens , that they sow not nor reap ; which have neither storehouse nor granary ; and God feeds them . How much better are * ye * than the birds ?
DARBY	Luke	12	25	But which of you by being careful can add to his stature one cubit ?
DARBY	Luke	12	26	If therefore ye can not [ do ] even what is least , why are ye careful about the rest ?
DARBY	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies how they grow : they neither toil nor spin ; but I say unto you , Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these .
DARBY	Luke	12	28	But if God thus clothe the grass , which to-day is in the field and to-morrow is cast into [ the ] oven , how much rather you , O ye of little faith ?
DARBY	Luke	12	29	And * ye * , seek not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink , and be not in anxiety ;
DARBY	Luke	12	30	for all these things do the nations of the world seek after , and your Father knows that ye have need of these things ;
DARBY	Luke	12	31	but seek his kingdom , and [ all ] these things shall be added to you .
DARBY	Luke	12	32	Fear not , little flock , for it has been the good pleasure of your Father to give you the kingdom .
DARBY	Luke	12	33	Sell what ye possess and give alms ; make to yourselves purses which do not grow old , a treasure which does not fail in the heavens , where thief does not draw near nor moth destroy .
DARBY	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there also will your heart be .
DARBY	Luke	12	35	Let your loins be girded about , and lamps burning ;
DARBY	Luke	12	36	and * ye * like men who wait their own lord whenever he may leave the wedding , that when he comes and knocks , they may open to him immediately .
DARBY	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those bondmen whom the lord [ on ] coming shall find watching ; verily I say unto you , that he will gird himself and make them recline at table , and coming up will serve them .
DARBY	Luke	12	38	And if he come in the second watch , and come in the third watch , and find [ them ] thus , blessed are those [ bondmen ] .
DARBY	Luke	12	39	But this know , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be dug through .
DARBY	Luke	12	40	And ye therefore , be * ye * ready , for in the hour in which ye do not think [ it ] , the Son of man comes .
DARBY	Luke	12	41	And Peter said to him , Lord , sayest thou this parable to us , or also to all ?
DARBY	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , Who then is the faithful and prudent steward , whom his lord will set over his household , to give the measure of corn in season ?
DARBY	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that bondman whom his lord [ on ] coming shall find doing thus ;
DARBY	Luke	12	44	verily I say unto you , that he will set him over all that he has .
DARBY	Luke	12	45	But if that bondman should say in his heart , My lord delays to come , and begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants , and to eat and to drink and to be drunken ,
DARBY	Luke	12	46	the lord of that bondman shall come in a day when he does not expect it , and in an hour he knows not of , and shall cut him in two and appoint his portion with the unbelievers .
DARBY	Luke	12	47	But that bondman who knew his own lord 's will , and had not prepared [ himself ] nor done his will , shall be beaten with many [ stripes ] ;
DARBY	Luke	12	48	but he who knew [ it ] not , and did things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few . And to every one to whom much has been given , much shall be required from him ; and to whom [ men ] have committed much , they will ask from him the more .
DARBY	Luke	12	49	I have come to cast a fire on the earth ; and what will I if already it has been kindled ?
DARBY	Luke	12	50	But I have a baptism to be baptised with , and how am I straitened until it shall have been accomplished !
DARBY	Luke	12	51	Think ye that I have come to give peace in the earth ? Nay , I say to you , but rather division :
DARBY	Luke	12	52	for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided ; three shall be divided against two , and two against three :
DARBY	Luke	12	53	father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against mother ; a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .
DARBY	Luke	12	54	And he said also to the crowds , When ye see a cloud rising out of the west , straightway ye say , A shower is coming ; and so it happens .
DARBY	Luke	12	55	And when [ ye see ] the south wind blow , ye say , There will be heat ; and it happens .
DARBY	Luke	12	56	Hypocrites , ye know how to judge of the appearance of the earth and of the heaven ; how [ is it then that ] ye do not discern this time ?
DARBY	Luke	12	57	And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
DARBY	Luke	12	58	For as thou goest with thine adverse party before a magistrate , strive in the way to be reconciled with him , lest he drag thee away to the judge , and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison .
DARBY	Luke	12	59	I say unto thee , Thou shalt in no wise come out thence until thou hast paid the very last mite .
DARBY	Luke	13	13	And he laid his hands upon her ; and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God .
DARBY	Luke	13	2	And he answering said to them , Think ye that these Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans because they suffered such things ?
DARBY	Luke	13	3	No , I say to you , but if ye repent not , ye shall all perish in the same manner .
DARBY	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them , think ye that * they * were debtors beyond all the men who dwell in Jerusalem ?
DARBY	Luke	13	5	No , I say to you , but if ye repent not , ye shall all perish in like manner .
DARBY	Luke	13	6	And he spoke this parable : A certain [ man ] had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit upon it and did not find [ any ] .
DARBY	Luke	13	7	And he said to the vinedresser , Behold , [ these ] three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree and find none : cut it down ; why does it also render the ground useless ?
DARBY	Luke	13	8	But he answering says to him , Sir , let it alone for this year also , until I shall dig about it and put dung ,
DARBY	Luke	13	9	and if it shall bear fruit—but if not , after that thou shalt cut it down .
DARBY	Luke	13	10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath .
DARBY	Luke	13	11	And lo , [ there was ] a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and she was bent together and wholly unable to lift her head up .
DARBY	Luke	13	12	And Jesus , seeing her , called to [ her ] , and said to her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
DARBY	Luke	13	14	But the ruler of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus healed on the sabbath , answering said to the crowd , There are six days in which [ people ] ought to work ; in these therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day .
DARBY	Luke	13	15	The Lord therefore answered him and said , Hypocrites ! does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the manger and leading [ it ] away , water [ it ] ?
DARBY	Luke	13	16	And this [ woman ] , who is a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has bound , lo , [ these ] eighteen years , ought she not to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
DARBY	Luke	13	17	And as he said these things , all who were opposed to him were ashamed ; and all the crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things which were being done by him .
DARBY	Luke	13	18	And he said , To what is the kingdom of God like ? and to what shall I liken it ?
DARBY	Luke	13	19	It is like a grain of mustard [ seed ] which a man took and cast into his garden ; and it grew and became a great tree , and the birds of heaven lodged in its branches .
DARBY	Luke	13	20	And again he said , To what shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
DARBY	Luke	13	21	It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened .
DARBY	Luke	13	22	And he went through one city and village after another , teaching , and journeying to Jerusalem .
DARBY	Luke	13	23	And one said to him , Sir , [ are ] such as are to be saved few in number ? But he said unto them ,
DARBY	Luke	13	24	Strive with earnestness to enter in through the narrow door , for many , I say to you , will seek to enter in and will not be able .
DARBY	Luke	13	25	From the time that the master of the house shall have risen up and shall have shut the door , and ye shall begin to stand without and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , open to us ; and he answering shall say to you , I know you not whence ye are :
DARBY	Luke	13	26	then shall ye begin to say , We have eaten in thy presence and drunk , and thou hast taught in our streets ;
DARBY	Luke	13	27	and he shall say , I tell you , I do not know you whence ye are ; depart from me , all [ ye ] workers of iniquity .
DARBY	Luke	13	28	There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but yourselves cast out .
DARBY	Luke	13	29	And they shall come from east and west , and from north and south , and shall lie down at table in the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Luke	13	30	And behold , there are last who shall be first , and there are first who shall be last .
DARBY	Luke	13	31	The same hour certain Pharisees came up , saying to him , Get out , and go hence , for Herod is desirous to kill thee .
DARBY	Luke	13	32	And he said to them , Go , tell that fox , Behold , I cast out demons and accomplish cures to-day and to-morrow , and the third [ day ] I am perfected ;
DARBY	Luke	13	33	but I must needs walk to-day and to-morrow and the [ day ] following , for it must not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Luke	13	34	Jerusalem , Jerusalem , the [ city ] that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her , how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen her brood under her wings , and ye would not .
DARBY	Luke	13	35	Behold , your house is left unto you ; and I say unto you , that ye shall not see me until it come that ye say , Blessed [ is ] he that comes in the name of [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Luke	14	14	and thou shalt be blessed ; for they have not [ the means ] to recompense thee ; for it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the just .
DARBY	Luke	14	2	And behold , there was a certain dropsical [ man ] before him .
DARBY	Luke	14	3	And Jesus answering spoke unto the doctors of the law and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath ?
DARBY	Luke	14	4	But they were silent . And taking him he healed him and let him go .
DARBY	Luke	14	5	And answering he said to them , Of which of you shall an ass or ox fall into a well , that he does not straightway pull him up on the sabbath day ?
DARBY	Luke	14	6	And they were not able to answer him to these things .
DARBY	Luke	14	7	And he spoke a parable to those that were invited , remarking how they chose out the first places , saying to them ,
DARBY	Luke	14	8	When thou art invited by any one to a wedding , do not lay thyself down in the first place at table , lest perhaps a more honourable than thou be invited by him ,
DARBY	Luke	14	9	and he who invited thee and him come and say to thee , Give place to this [ man ] , and then thou begin with shame to take the last place .
DARBY	Luke	14	10	But when thou hast been invited , go and put thyself down in the last place , that when he who has invited thee comes , he may say to thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have honour before all that are lying at table with thee ;
DARBY	Luke	14	11	for every one that exalts himself shall be abased , and he that abases himself shall be exalted .
DARBY	Luke	14	12	And he said also to him that had invited him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , nor thy kinsfolk , nor rich neighbours , lest it may be they also should invite thee in return , and a recompense be made thee .
DARBY	Luke	14	13	But when thou makest a feast , call poor , crippled , lame , blind :
DARBY	Luke	14	15	And one of those that were lying at table with [ them ] , hearing these things , said to him , Blessed [ is ] he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Luke	14	16	And he said to him , A certain man made a great supper and invited many .
DARBY	Luke	14	17	And he sent his bondman at the hour of supper to say to those who were invited , Come , for already all things are ready .
DARBY	Luke	14	18	And all began , without exception , to excuse themselves . The first said to him , I have bought land , and I must go out and see it ; I pray thee hold me for excused .
DARBY	Luke	14	19	And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them ; I pray thee hold me for excused .
DARBY	Luke	14	20	And another said , I have married a wife , and on this account I can not come .
DARBY	Luke	14	21	And the bondman came up and brought back word of these things to his lord . Then the master of the house , in anger , said to his bondman , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring here the poor and crippled and lame and blind .
DARBY	Luke	14	22	And the bondman said , Sir , it is done as thou hast commanded , and there is still room .
DARBY	Luke	14	23	And the lord said to the bondman , Go out into the ways and fences and compel to come in , that my house may be filled ;
DARBY	Luke	14	24	for I say to you , that not one of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper .
DARBY	Luke	14	25	And great crowds went with him ; and , turning round , he said to them ,
DARBY	Luke	14	26	If any man come to me , and shall not hate his own father and mother , and wife , and children , and brothers , and sisters , yea , and his own life too , he can not be my disciple ;
DARBY	Luke	14	27	and whoever does not carry his cross and come after me can not be my disciple .
DARBY	Luke	14	28	For which of you , desirous of building a tower , does not first sit down and count the cost , if he have what [ is needed ] to complete it ;
DARBY	Luke	14	29	in order that , having laid the foundation of it , and not being able to finish it , all who see it do not begin to mock at him ,
DARBY	Luke	14	30	saying , This man began to build and was not able to finish ?
DARBY	Luke	14	31	Or what king , going on his way to engage in war with another king , does not , sitting down first , take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him coming against him with twenty thousand ?
DARBY	Luke	14	32	and if not , while he is yet far off , having sent an embassy , he asks for terms of peace .
DARBY	Luke	14	33	Thus then every one of you who forsakes not all that is his own can not be my disciple .
DARBY	Luke	14	34	Salt [ then ] [ is ] good , but if the salt also has become savourless , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
DARBY	Luke	14	35	It is proper neither for land nor for dung ; it is cast out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
DARBY	Luke	15	15	And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country , and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
DARBY	Luke	15	2	and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , This [ man ] receives sinners and eats with them .
DARBY	Luke	15	3	And he spoke to them this parable , saying ,
DARBY	Luke	15	4	What man of you having a hundred sheep , and having lost one of them , does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
DARBY	Luke	15	5	and having found it , he lays it upon his own shoulders , rejoicing ;
DARBY	Luke	15	6	and being come to the house , calls together the friends and the neighbours , saying to them , Rejoice with me , for I have found my lost sheep .
DARBY	Luke	15	7	I say unto you , that thus there shall be joy in heaven for one repenting sinner , [ more ] than for ninety and nine righteous who have no need of repentance .
DARBY	Luke	15	8	Or , what woman having ten drachmas , if she lose one drachma , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully till she find it ?
DARBY	Luke	15	9	and having found it she calls together the friends and neighbours , saying , Rejoice with me , for I have found the drachma which I had lost .
DARBY	Luke	15	10	Thus , I say unto you , there is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner .
DARBY	Luke	15	11	And he said , A certain man had two sons ;
DARBY	Luke	15	12	and the younger of them said to his father , Father , give to me the share of the property that falls [ to me ] . And he divided to them what he was possessed of .
DARBY	Luke	15	13	And after not many days the younger son gathering all together went away into a country a long way off , and there dissipated his property , living in debauchery .
DARBY	Luke	15	14	But when he had spent all there arose a violent famine throughout that country , and he began to be in want .
DARBY	Luke	15	16	And he longed to fill his belly with the husks which the swine were eating ; and no one gave to him .
DARBY	Luke	15	17	And coming to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have abundance of bread , and * I * perish here by famine .
DARBY	Luke	15	18	I will rise up and go to my father , and I will say to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and before thee ;
DARBY	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
DARBY	Luke	15	20	And he rose up and went to his own father . But while he was yet a long way off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell upon his neck , and covered him with kisses .
DARBY	Luke	15	21	And the son said to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and before thee ; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son .
DARBY	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his bondmen , Bring out the best robe and clothe him in [ it ] , and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet ;
DARBY	Luke	15	23	and bring the fatted calf and kill it , and let us eat and make merry :
DARBY	Luke	15	24	for this my son was dead and has come to life , was lost and has been found . And they began to make merry .
DARBY	Luke	15	25	And his elder son was in the field ; and as , coming [ up ] , he drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing .
DARBY	Luke	15	26	And having called one of the servants , he inquired what these things might be .
DARBY	Luke	15	27	And he said to him , Thy brother is come , and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and well .
DARBY	Luke	15	28	But he became angry and would not go in . And his father went out and besought him .
DARBY	Luke	15	29	But he answering said to his father , Behold , so many years I serve thee , and never have I transgressed a commandment of thine ; and to me hast thou never given a kid that I might make merry with my friends :
DARBY	Luke	15	30	but when this thy son , who has devoured thy substance with harlots , is come , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
DARBY	Luke	15	31	But he said to him , Child , * thou * art ever with me , and all that is mine is thine .
DARBY	Luke	15	32	But it was right to make merry and rejoice , because this thy brother was dead and has come to life again , and was lost and has been found .
DARBY	Luke	16	16	The law and the prophets [ were ] until John : from that time the glad tidings of the kingdom of God are announced , and every one forces his way into it .
DARBY	Luke	16	2	And having called him , he said to him , What [ is ] this that I hear of thee ? give the reckoning of thy stewardship , for thou canst be no longer steward .
DARBY	Luke	16	3	And the steward said within himself , What shall I do ; for my lord is taking the stewardship from me ? I am not able to dig ; I am ashamed to beg .
DARBY	Luke	16	4	I know what I will do , that when I shall have been removed from the stewardship I may be received into their houses .
DARBY	Luke	16	5	And having called to [ him ] each one of the debtors of his own lord , he said to the first , How much owest thou to my lord ?
DARBY	Luke	16	6	And he said , A hundred baths of oil . And he said to him , Take thy writing and sit down quickly and write fifty .
DARBY	Luke	16	7	Then he said to another , And thou , how much dost thou owe ? And he said , A hundred cors of wheat . And he says to him , Take thy writing and write eighty .
DARBY	Luke	16	8	And the lord praised the unrighteous steward because he had done prudently . For the sons of this world are , for their own generation , more prudent than the sons of light .
DARBY	Luke	16	9	And * I * say to you , Make to yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness , that when it fails ye may be received into the eternal tabernacles .
DARBY	Luke	16	10	He that is faithful in the least is faithful also in much ; and he that is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much .
DARBY	Luke	16	11	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who shall entrust to you the true ?
DARBY	Luke	16	12	and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another 's , who shall give to you your own ?
DARBY	Luke	16	13	No servant can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and will love the other , or he will cleave to the one and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .
DARBY	Luke	16	14	And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things , and mocked him .
DARBY	Luke	16	15	And he said to them , * Ye * are they who justify themselves before men , but God knows your hearts ; for what amongst men is highly thought of is an abomination before God .
DARBY	Luke	16	17	But it is easier that the heaven and the earth should pass away than that one tittle of the law should fail .
DARBY	Luke	16	18	Every one who puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery ; and every one that marries one put away from a husband commits adultery .
DARBY	Luke	16	19	Now there was a rich man and he was clothed in purple and fine linen , making good cheer in splendour every day .
DARBY	Luke	16	20	And [ there was ] a poor man , by name Lazarus , [ who ] was laid at his gateway full of sores ,
DARBY	Luke	16	21	and desiring to be filled with the crumbs which fell from the table of the rich man ; but the dogs also coming licked his sores .
DARBY	Luke	16	22	And it came to pass that the poor man died , and that he was carried away by the angels into the bosom of Abraham . And the rich man also died and was buried .
DARBY	Luke	16	23	And in hades lifting up his eyes , being in torments , he sees Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
DARBY	Luke	16	24	And he crying out said , Father Abraham , have compassion on me , and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , for I am suffering in this flame .
DARBY	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , Child , recollect that * thou * hast fully received thy good things in thy lifetime , and likewise Lazarus evil things . But now he is comforted here , and * thou * art in suffering .
DARBY	Luke	16	26	And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm is fixed , so that those who desire to pass hence to you can not , nor do they who [ desire to cross ] from there pass over unto us .
DARBY	Luke	16	27	And he said , I beseech thee then , father , that thou wouldest send him to the house of my father ,
DARBY	Luke	16	28	for I have five brothers , so that he may earnestly testify to them , that they also may not come to this place of torment .
DARBY	Luke	16	29	But Abraham says to him , They have Moses and the prophets : let them hear them .
DARBY	Luke	16	30	But he said , Nay , father Abraham , but if one from the dead should go to them , they will repent .
DARBY	Luke	16	31	And he said to him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , not even if one rise from among [ the ] dead will they be persuaded .
DARBY	Luke	17	17	And Jesus answering said , Were not the ten cleansed ? but the nine , where [ are they ] ?
DARBY	Luke	17	2	It would be [ more ] profitable for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea , than that he should be a snare to one of these little ones .
DARBY	Luke	17	3	Take heed to yourselves : if thy brother should sin , rebuke him ; and if he should repent , forgive him .
DARBY	Luke	17	4	And if he should sin against thee seven times in the day , and seven times should return to thee , saying , I repent , thou shalt forgive him .
DARBY	Luke	17	5	And the apostles said to the Lord , Give more faith to us .
DARBY	Luke	17	6	But the Lord said , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [ seed ] , ye had said to this sycamine tree , Be thou rooted up , and be thou planted in the sea , and it would have obeyed you .
DARBY	Luke	17	7	But which of you [ is there ] who , having a bondman ploughing or shepherding , when he comes in out of the field , will say , Come and lie down immediately to table ?
DARBY	Luke	17	8	But will he not say to him , Prepare what I shall sup on , and gird thyself and serve me that I may eat and drink ; and after that * thou * shalt eat and drink ?
DARBY	Luke	17	9	Is he thankful to the bondman because he has done what was ordered ? I judge not .
DARBY	Luke	17	10	Thus * ye * also , when ye shall have done all things that have been ordered you , say , We are unprofitable bondmen ; we have done what it was our duty to do .
DARBY	Luke	17	11	And it came to pass as he was going up to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
DARBY	Luke	17	12	And as he entered into a certain village ten leprous men met him , who stood afar off .
DARBY	Luke	17	13	And they lifted up [ their ] voice saying , Jesus , Master , have compassion on us .
DARBY	Luke	17	14	And seeing [ them ] he said to them , Go , shew yourselves to the priests . And it came to pass as they were going they were cleansed .
DARBY	Luke	17	15	And one of them , seeing that he was cured , turned back , glorifying God with a loud voice ,
DARBY	Luke	17	16	and fell on [ his ] face at his feet giving him thanks : and * he * was a Samaritan .
DARBY	Luke	17	18	There have not been found to return and give glory to God save this stranger .
DARBY	Luke	17	19	And he said to him , Rise up and go thy way : thy faith has made thee well .
DARBY	Luke	17	20	And having been asked by the Pharisees , When is the kingdom of God coming ? he answered them and said , The kingdom of God does not come with observation ;
DARBY	Luke	17	21	nor shall they say , Lo here , or , Lo there ; for behold , the kingdom of God is in the midst of you .
DARBY	Luke	17	22	And he said to the disciples , Days are coming , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and shall not see [ it ] .
DARBY	Luke	17	23	And they will say to you , Lo here , or Lo there ; go not , nor follow [ them ] .
DARBY	Luke	17	24	For as the lightning shines which lightens from [ one end ] under heaven to [ the other end ] under heaven , thus shall the Son of man be in his day .
DARBY	Luke	17	25	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation .
DARBY	Luke	17	26	And as it took place in the days of Noe , thus also shall it be in the days of the Son of man :
DARBY	Luke	17	27	they ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , and the flood came and destroyed all [ of them ] ;
DARBY	Luke	17	28	and in like manner as took place in the days of Lot : they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
DARBY	Luke	17	29	but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom , it rained fire and sulphur from heaven , and destroyed all [ of them ] :
DARBY	Luke	17	30	after this [ manner ] shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed .
DARBY	Luke	17	31	In that day , he who shall be on the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not go down to take it away ; and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
DARBY	Luke	17	32	Remember the wife of Lot .
DARBY	Luke	17	33	Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it , and whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it .
DARBY	Luke	17	34	I say to you , In that night there shall be two [ men ] upon one bed ; one shall be seized and the other shall be let go .
DARBY	Luke	17	35	Two [ women ] shall be grinding together ; the one shall be seized and the other shall be let go .
DARBY	Luke	17	36	[ Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be seized and the other let go . ]
DARBY	Luke	17	37	And answering they say to him , Where , Lord ? And he said to them , Where the body [ is ] , there the eagles will be gathered together .
DARBY	Luke	18	18	And a certain ruler asked him saying , Good teacher , having done what , shall I inherit eternal life ?
DARBY	Luke	18	2	saying , There was a judge in a city , not fearing God and not respecting man :
DARBY	Luke	18	3	and there was a widow in that city , and she came to him , saying , Avenge me of mine adverse party .
DARBY	Luke	18	4	And he would not for a time ; but afterwards he said within himself , If even I fear not God and respect not man ,
DARBY	Luke	18	5	at any rate because this widow annoys me I will avenge her , that she may not by perpetually coming completely harass me .
DARBY	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge says .
DARBY	Luke	18	7	And shall not God at all avenge his elect , who cry to him day and night , and he bears long as to them ?
DARBY	Luke	18	8	I say unto you that he will avenge them speedily . But when the Son of man comes , shall he indeed find faith on the earth ?
DARBY	Luke	18	9	And he spoke also to some , who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and made nothing of all the rest [ of men ] , this parable :
DARBY	Luke	18	10	Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a tax-gatherer .
DARBY	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee , standing , prayed thus to himself : God , I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men , rapacious , unjust , adulterers , or even as this tax-gatherer .
DARBY	Luke	18	12	I fast twice in the week , I tithe everything I gain .
DARBY	Luke	18	13	And the tax-gatherer , standing afar off , would not lift up even his eyes to heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , O God , have compassion on me , the sinner .
DARBY	Luke	18	14	I say unto you , This [ man ] went down to his house justified rather than that [ other ] . For every one who exalts himself shall be humbled , and he that humbles himself shall be exalted .
DARBY	Luke	18	15	And they brought to him also infants that he might touch them , but the disciples when they saw [ it ] rebuked them .
DARBY	Luke	18	16	But Jesus calling them to [ him ] said , Suffer little children to come to me , and do not forbid them , for of such is the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Luke	18	17	Verily I say to you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein .
DARBY	Luke	18	19	But Jesus said to him , Why callest thou me good ? There is none good but one , God .
DARBY	Luke	18	20	Thou knowest the commandments : Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother .
DARBY	Luke	18	21	And he said , All these things have I kept from my youth .
DARBY	Luke	18	22	And when Jesus had heard this , he said to him , One thing is lacking to thee yet : Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens , and come , follow me .
DARBY	Luke	18	23	But when he heard this he became very sorrowful , for he was very rich .
DARBY	Luke	18	24	But when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful , he said , How difficultly shall those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God ;
DARBY	Luke	18	25	for it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle 's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Luke	18	26	And those who heard it said , And who can be saved ?
DARBY	Luke	18	27	But he said , The things that are impossible with men are possible with God .
DARBY	Luke	18	28	And Peter said , Behold , * we * have left all things and have followed thee .
DARBY	Luke	18	29	And he said to them , Verily I say to you , There is no one who has left home , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake ,
DARBY	Luke	18	30	who shall not receive manifold more at this time , and in the coming age life eternal .
DARBY	Luke	18	31	And he took the twelve to [ him ] and said to them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written of the Son of man by the prophets shall be accomplished ;
DARBY	Luke	18	32	for he shall be delivered up to the nations , and shall be mocked , and insulted , and spit upon .
DARBY	Luke	18	33	And when they have scourged [ him ] they will kill him ; and on the third day he will rise again .
DARBY	Luke	18	34	And they understood nothing of these things . And this word was hidden from them , and they did not know what was said .
DARBY	Luke	18	35	And it came to pass when he came into the neighbourhood of Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging .
DARBY	Luke	18	36	And when he heard the crowd passing , he inquired what this might be .
DARBY	Luke	18	37	And they told him that Jesus the Nazaraean was passing by .
DARBY	Luke	18	38	And he called out saying , Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me .
DARBY	Luke	18	39	And those [ who were ] going before rebuked him that he might be silent ; but * he * cried out so much the more , Son of David , have mercy on me .
DARBY	Luke	18	40	And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be led to him . And when he drew nigh he asked him [ saying ] ,
DARBY	Luke	18	41	What wilt thou that I shall do to thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may see .
DARBY	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said to him , See : thy faith has healed thee .
DARBY	Luke	18	43	And immediately he saw , and followed him , glorifying God . And all the people when they saw [ it ] gave praise to God .
DARBY	Luke	19	19	And he said also to this one , And * thou * , be over five cities .
DARBY	Luke	19	2	And behold , [ there was ] a man by name called Zacchaeus , and he was chief tax-gatherer , and he was rich .
DARBY	Luke	19	3	And he sought to see Jesus who he was : and he could not for the crowd , because he was little in stature .
DARBY	Luke	19	4	And running on before , he got up into a sycamore that he might see him , for he was going to pass that [ way ] .
DARBY	Luke	19	5	And when he came up to the place , Jesus looked up and saw him , and said to him , Zacchaeus , make haste and come down , for to-day I must remain in thy house .
DARBY	Luke	19	6	And he made haste and came down , and received him with joy .
DARBY	Luke	19	7	And all murmured when they saw [ it ] , saying , He has turned in to lodge with a sinful man .
DARBY	Luke	19	8	But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor , and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation , I return [ him ] fourfold .
DARBY	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said to him , To-day salvation is come to this house , inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham ;
DARBY	Luke	19	10	for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost .
DARBY	Luke	19	11	But as they were listening to these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was near to Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to be immediately manifested .
DARBY	Luke	19	12	He said therefore , A certain high-born man went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and return .
DARBY	Luke	19	13	And having called his own ten bondmen , he gave to them ten minas , and said to them , Trade while I am coming .
DARBY	Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him , and sent an embassy after him , saying , We will not that this [ man ] should reign over us .
DARBY	Luke	19	15	And it came to pass on his arrival back again , having received the kingdom , that he desired these bondmen to whom he gave the money to be called to him , in order that he might know what every one had gained by trading .
DARBY	Luke	19	16	And the first came up , saying , [ My ] Lord , thy mina has produced ten minas .
DARBY	Luke	19	17	And he said to him , Well [ done ] , thou good bondman ; because thou hast been faithful in that which is least , be thou in authority over ten cities .
DARBY	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying , [ My ] Lord , thy mina has made five minas .
DARBY	Luke	19	20	And another came , saying , [ My ] Lord , lo , [ there is ] thy mina , which I have kept laid up in a towel .
DARBY	Luke	19	21	For I feared thee because thou art a harsh man : thou takest up what thou hast not laid down , and thou reapest what thou hast not sowed .
DARBY	Luke	19	22	He says to him , Out of thy mouth will I judge thee , wicked bondman : thou knewest that * I * am a harsh man , taking up what I have not laid down and reaping what I have not sowed .
DARBY	Luke	19	23	And why didst thou not give my money to [ the ] bank ; and * I * should have received it , at my coming , with interest ?
DARBY	Luke	19	24	And he said to those that stood by , Take from him the mina and give [ it ] to him who has the ten minas .
DARBY	Luke	19	25	And they said to him , Lord , he has ten minas .
DARBY	Luke	19	26	For I say unto you , that to every one that has shall be given ; but from him that has not , that even which he has shall be taken from him .
DARBY	Luke	19	27	Moreover those mine enemies , who would not [ have ] me to reign over them , bring them here and slay [ them ] before me .
DARBY	Luke	19	28	And having said these things , he went on before , going up to Jerusalem .
DARBY	Luke	19	29	And it came to pass as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mountain called [ the mount ] of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
DARBY	Luke	19	30	saying , Go into the village over against [ you ] , in which ye will find , on entering it , a colt tied up , on which no [ child ] of man ever sat at any time : loose it and lead it [ here ] .
DARBY	Luke	19	31	And if any one ask you , Why do ye loose [ it ] ? thus shall ye say to him , Because the Lord has need of it .
DARBY	Luke	19	32	And they that were sent , having gone their way , found as he had said to them .
DARBY	Luke	19	33	And as they were loosing the colt , its masters said to them , Why loose ye the colt ?
DARBY	Luke	19	34	And they said , Because the Lord has need of it .
DARBY	Luke	19	35	And they led it to Jesus ; and having cast their own garments on the colt , they put Jesus on [ it ] .
DARBY	Luke	19	36	And as he went , they strewed their clothes in the way .
DARBY	Luke	19	37	And as he drew near , already at the descent of the mount of Olives , all the multitude of the disciples began , rejoicing , to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen ,
DARBY	Luke	19	38	saying , Blessed the King that comes in the name of [ the ] Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
DARBY	Luke	19	39	And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him , Teacher , rebuke thy disciples .
DARBY	Luke	19	40	And he answering said to them , I say unto you , If these shall be silent , the stones will cry out .
DARBY	Luke	19	41	And as he drew near , seeing the city , he wept over it ,
DARBY	Luke	19	42	saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , even at least in this thy day , the things that are for thy peace : but now they are hid from thine eyes ;
DARBY	Luke	19	43	for days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall make a palisaded mound about thee , and shall close thee around , and keep thee in on every side ,
DARBY	Luke	19	44	and shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children in thee ; and shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone : because thou knewest not the season of thy visitation .
DARBY	Luke	19	45	And entering into the temple , he began to cast out those that sold and bought in it ,
DARBY	Luke	19	46	saying to them , It is written , My house is a house of prayer , but * ye * have made it a den of robbers .
DARBY	Luke	19	47	And he was teaching day by day in the temple : and the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
DARBY	Luke	19	48	and did not find what they could do , for all the people hung on him to hear .
DARBY	Luke	20	20	And having watched [ him ] , they sent out suborned persons , pretending to be just men , that they might take hold of him in [ his ] language , so that they might deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor .
DARBY	Luke	20	2	and spoke to him saying , Tell us by what authority thou doest these things , or who is it who has given thee this authority ?
DARBY	Luke	20	3	And he answering said to them , * I * also will ask you [ one ] thing , and tell me :
DARBY	Luke	20	4	The baptism of John , was it of heaven or of men ?
DARBY	Luke	20	5	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , If we should say , Of heaven , he will say , Why have ye not believed him ?
DARBY	Luke	20	6	but if we should say , Of men , the whole people will stone us , for they are persuaded that John was a prophet .
DARBY	Luke	20	7	And they answered , they did not know whence .
DARBY	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said to them , Neither do * I * tell you by what authority I do these things .
DARBY	Luke	20	9	And he began to speak to the people this parable : A man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen , and left the country for a long time .
DARBY	Luke	20	10	And in the season he sent to the husbandmen a bondman , that they might give to him of the fruit of the vineyard ; but the husbandmen , having beaten him , sent [ him ] away empty .
DARBY	Luke	20	11	And again he sent another bondman ; but they , having beaten him also , and cast insult upon him , sent [ him ] away empty .
DARBY	Luke	20	12	And again he sent a third ; and they , having wounded him also , cast [ him ] out .
DARBY	Luke	20	13	And the lord of the vineyard said , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : perhaps when they see him they will respect [ him ] .
DARBY	Luke	20	14	But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir ; [ come , ] let us kill him , that the inheritance may become ours .
DARBY	Luke	20	15	And having cast him forth out of the vineyard , they killed [ him ] . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them ?
DARBY	Luke	20	16	He will come and destroy those husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . And when they heard it they said , May it never be !
DARBY	Luke	20	17	But he looking at them said , What then is this that is written , The stone which they that builded rejected , this has become the corner-stone ?
DARBY	Luke	20	18	Every one falling on this stone shall be broken , but on whomsoever it shall fall , it shall grind him to powder .
DARBY	Luke	20	19	And the chief priests and the scribes sought the same hour to lay hands on him , and they feared the people ; for they knew that he had spoken this parable of them .
DARBY	Luke	20	21	And they asked him saying , Teacher , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , and acceptest no [ man 's ] person , but teachest with truth the way of God :
DARBY	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar , or not ?
DARBY	Luke	20	23	But perceiving their deceit he said to them , Why do ye tempt me ?
DARBY	Luke	20	24	Shew me a denarius . Whose image and superscription has it ? And answering they said , Caesar 's .
DARBY	Luke	20	25	And he said to them , Pay therefore what is Caesar 's to Caesar , and what is God 's to God .
DARBY	Luke	20	26	And they were not able to take hold of him in [ his ] expressions before the people , and , wondering at his answer , they were silent .
DARBY	Luke	20	27	And some of the Sadducees , who deny that there is any resurrection , coming up [ to him ] ,
DARBY	Luke	20	28	demanded of him saying , Teacher , Moses wrote to us , If any one 's brother , who has a wife , die , and he die childless , his brother shall take the wife and raise up seed to his brother .
DARBY	Luke	20	29	There were then seven brethren : and the first , having taken a wife , died childless ;
DARBY	Luke	20	30	and the second [ took the woman , and * he * died childless ] ;
DARBY	Luke	20	31	and the third took her : and in like manner also the seven left no children and died ;
DARBY	Luke	20	32	and last of all the woman also died .
DARBY	Luke	20	33	In the resurrection therefore of which of them does she become wife , for the seven had her as wife ?
DARBY	Luke	20	34	And Jesus said to them , The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage ,
DARBY	Luke	20	35	but they who are counted worthy to have part in that world , and the resurrection from among [ the ] dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ;
DARBY	Luke	20	36	for neither can they die any more , for they are equal to angels , and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection .
DARBY	Luke	20	37	But that the dead rise , even Moses shewed in [ the section of ] the bush , when he called [ the ] Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob ;
DARBY	Luke	20	38	but he is not God of [ the ] dead but of [ the ] living ; for all live for him .
DARBY	Luke	20	39	And some of the scribes answering said , Teacher , thou hast well spoken .
DARBY	Luke	20	40	For they did not dare any more to ask him anything .
DARBY	Luke	20	41	And he said to them , How do they say that the Christ is David 's son ,
DARBY	Luke	20	42	and David himself says in the book of Psalms , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand
DARBY	Luke	20	43	until I put thine enemies [ as ] footstool of thy feet ?
DARBY	Luke	20	44	David therefore calls him Lord , and how is he his son ?
DARBY	Luke	20	45	And , as all the people were listening , he said to his disciples ,
DARBY	Luke	20	46	Beware of the scribes , who like to walk about in long robes , and who love salutations in the market-places , and first seats in the synagogues , and first places at suppers ;
DARBY	Luke	20	47	who devour the houses of widows , and as a pretext make long prayers . These shall receive a severer judgment .
DARBY	Luke	21	21	Then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains , and those who are in the midst of it depart out , and those who are in the country not enter into it ;
DARBY	Luke	21	2	but he saw also a certain poor widow casting therein two mites .
DARBY	Luke	21	3	And he said , Verily I say unto you , that this poor widow has cast in more than all ;
DARBY	Luke	21	4	for all these out of their abundance have cast into the gifts [ of God ] ; but she out of her need has cast in all the living which she had .
DARBY	Luke	21	5	And as some spoke of the temple , that it was adorned with goodly stones and consecrated offerings , he said ,
DARBY	Luke	21	6	[ As to ] these things which ye are beholding , days are coming in which there shall not be left stone upon stone which shall not be thrown down .
DARBY	Luke	21	7	And they asked him saying , Teacher , when then shall these things be ; and what [ is ] the sign when these things are going to take place ?
DARBY	Luke	21	8	And he said , See that ye be not led astray , for many shall come in my name , saying , * I * am [ he ] , and the time is drawn nigh : go ye not [ therefore ] after them .
DARBY	Luke	21	9	And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults , be not terrified , for these things must first take place , but the end is not immediately .
DARBY	Luke	21	10	Then he said to them , Nation shall rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ;
DARBY	Luke	21	11	there shall be both great earthquakes in different places , and famines and pestilences ; and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven .
DARBY	Luke	21	12	But before all these things they shall lay their hands upon you and persecute you , delivering [ you ] up to synagogues and prisons , bringing [ you ] before kings and governors on account of my name ;
DARBY	Luke	21	13	but it shall turn out to you for a testimony .
DARBY	Luke	21	14	Settle therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand [ your ] defence ,
DARBY	Luke	21	15	for * I * will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your opposers shall not be able to reply to or resist .
DARBY	Luke	21	16	But ye will be delivered up even by parents and brethren and relations and friends , and they shall put to death [ some ] from among you ,
DARBY	Luke	21	17	and ye will be hated of all for my name 's sake .
DARBY	Luke	21	18	And a hair of your head shall in no wise perish .
DARBY	Luke	21	19	By your patient endurance gain your souls .
DARBY	Luke	21	20	But when ye see Jerusalem encompassed with armies , then know that its desolation is drawn nigh .
DARBY	Luke	21	22	for these are days of avenging , that all the things that are written may be accomplished .
DARBY	Luke	21	23	But woe to them that are with child and to them who give suck in those days , for there shall be great distress upon the land and wrath upon this people .
DARBY	Luke	21	24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and be led captive into all the nations ; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of [ the ] nations until [ the ] times of [ the ] nations be fulfilled .
DARBY	Luke	21	25	And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars , and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity [ at ] the roar of the sea and rolling waves ,
DARBY	Luke	21	26	men ready to die through fear and expectation of what is coming on the habitable earth , for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken .
DARBY	Luke	21	27	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
DARBY	Luke	21	28	But when these things begin to come to pass , look up and lift up your heads , because your redemption draws nigh .
DARBY	Luke	21	29	And he spoke a parable to them : Behold the fig-tree and all the trees ;
DARBY	Luke	21	30	when they already sprout , ye know of your own selves , [ on ] looking [ at them ] , that already the summer is near .
DARBY	Luke	21	31	So also * ye * , when ye see these things take place , know that the kingdom of God is near .
DARBY	Luke	21	32	Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall in no wise pass away until all come to pass .
DARBY	Luke	21	33	The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall in no wise pass away .
DARBY	Luke	21	34	But take heed to yourselves lest possibly your hearts be laden with surfeiting and drinking and cares of life , and that day come upon you suddenly unawares ;
DARBY	Luke	21	35	for as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell upon the face of the whole earth .
DARBY	Luke	21	36	Watch therefore , praying at every season , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things which are about to come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man .
DARBY	Luke	21	37	And by day he was teaching in the temple , and by night , going out , he remained abroad on the mountain called [ the mount ] of Olives ;
DARBY	Luke	21	38	and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him .
DARBY	Luke	22	22	and the Son of man indeed goes as it is determined , but woe unto that man by whom he is delivered up .
DARBY	Luke	22	2	and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people .
DARBY	Luke	22	3	And Satan entered into Judas , who was surnamed Iscariote , being of the number of the twelve .
DARBY	Luke	22	4	And he went away and spoke with the chief priests and captains as to how he should deliver him up to them .
DARBY	Luke	22	5	And they were rejoiced , and agreed to give him money .
DARBY	Luke	22	6	And he came to an agreement to do it , and sought an opportunity to deliver him up to them away from the crowd .
DARBY	Luke	22	7	And the day of unleavened bread came , in which the passover was to be killed .
DARBY	Luke	22	8	And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare the passover for us , that we may eat [ it ] .
DARBY	Luke	22	9	But they said to him , Where wilt thou that we prepare [ it ] ?
DARBY	Luke	22	10	And he said to them , Behold , as ye enter into the city a man will meet you , carrying an earthen pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he goes in ;
DARBY	Luke	22	11	and ye shall say to the master of the house , The Teacher says to thee , Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples ?
DARBY	Luke	22	12	And * he * will shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
DARBY	Luke	22	13	And having gone they found it as he had said to them ; and they prepared the passover .
DARBY	Luke	22	14	And when the hour was come , he placed himself at table , and the [ twelve ] apostles with him .
DARBY	Luke	22	15	And he said to them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer .
DARBY	Luke	22	16	For I say unto you , that I will not eat any more at all of it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
DARBY	Luke	22	17	And having received a cup , when he had given thanks he said , Take this and divide it among yourselves .
DARBY	Luke	22	18	For I say unto you , that I will not drink at all of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God come .
DARBY	Luke	22	19	And having taken a loaf , when he had given thanks , he broke [ it ] , and gave [ it ] to them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
DARBY	Luke	22	20	In like manner also the cup , after having supped , saying , This cup [ is ] the new covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you .
DARBY	Luke	22	21	Moreover , behold , the hand of him that delivers me up [ is ] with me on the table ;
DARBY	Luke	22	23	And * they * began to question together among themselves who then it could be of them who was about to do this .
DARBY	Luke	22	24	And there was also a strife among them which of them should be held to be [ the ] greatest .
DARBY	Luke	22	25	And he said to them , The kings of the nations rule over them , and they that exercise authority over them are called benefactors .
DARBY	Luke	22	26	But * ye * [ shall ] not [ be ] thus ; but let the greater among you be as the younger , and the leader as he that serves .
DARBY	Luke	22	27	For which [ is ] greater , he that is at table or he that serves ? [ Is ] not he that is at table ? But * I * am in the midst of you as the one that serves .
DARBY	Luke	22	28	But * ye * are they who have persevered with me in my temptations .
DARBY	Luke	22	29	And * I * appoint unto you , as my Father has appointed unto me , a kingdom ,
DARBY	Luke	22	30	that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
DARBY	Luke	22	31	And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan has demanded to have you , to sift [ you ] as wheat ;
DARBY	Luke	22	32	but * I * have besought for thee that thy faith fail not ; and * thou * , when once thou hast been restored , confirm thy brethren .
DARBY	Luke	22	33	And he said to him , Lord , with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death .
DARBY	Luke	22	34	And he said , I tell thee , Peter , [ the ] cock shall not crow to-day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
DARBY	Luke	22	35	And he said to them , When I sent you without purse and scrip and sandals , did ye lack anything ? And they said , Nothing .
DARBY	Luke	22	36	He said therefore to them , But now he that has a purse let him take [ it ] , in like manner also a scrip , and he that has none let him sell his garment and buy a sword ;
DARBY	Luke	22	37	for I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned with [ the ] lawless : for also the things concerning me have an end .
DARBY	Luke	22	38	And they said , Lord , behold here are two swords . And he said to them , It is enough .
DARBY	Luke	22	39	And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives , and the disciples also followed him .
DARBY	Luke	22	40	And when he was at the place he said to them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation .
DARBY	Luke	22	41	And he was withdrawn from them about a stone 's throw , and having knelt down he prayed ,
DARBY	Luke	22	42	saying , Father , if thou wilt remove this cup from me : —but then , not my will , but thine be done .
DARBY	Luke	22	43	And an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him .
DARBY	Luke	22	44	And being in conflict he prayed more intently . And his sweat became as great drops of blood , falling down upon the earth .
DARBY	Luke	22	45	And rising up from his prayer , coming to the disciples , he found them sleeping from grief .
DARBY	Luke	22	46	And he said to them , Why sleep ye ? rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation .
DARBY	Luke	22	47	As he was yet speaking , behold , a crowd , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went on before them , and drew near to Jesus to kiss him .
DARBY	Luke	22	48	And Jesus said to him , Judas , deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss ?
DARBY	Luke	22	49	And they who were around him , seeing what was going to follow , said [ to him ] , Lord , shall we smite with [ the ] sword ?
DARBY	Luke	22	50	And a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the high priest and took off his right ear .
DARBY	Luke	22	51	And Jesus answering said , Suffer thus far ; and having touched his ear , he healed him .
DARBY	Luke	22	52	And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders , who were come against him , Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks ?
DARBY	Luke	22	53	When I was day by day with you in the temple ye did not stretch out your hands against me ; but this is your hour and the power of darkness .
DARBY	Luke	22	54	And having laid hold on him , they led him [ away ] , and they led [ him ] into the house of the high priest . And Peter followed afar off .
DARBY	Luke	22	55	And they having lit a fire in the midst of the court and sat down together , Peter sat among them .
DARBY	Luke	22	56	And a certain maid , having seen him sitting by the light , and having fixed her eyes upon him , said , And this [ man ] was with him .
DARBY	Luke	22	57	But he denied [ him ] , saying , Woman , I do not know him .
DARBY	Luke	22	58	And after a short time another seeing him said , And * thou * art of them . But Peter said , Man , I am not .
DARBY	Luke	22	59	And after the lapse of about one hour another stoutly maintained it , saying , In truth this [ man ] also was with him , for also he is a Galilaean .
DARBY	Luke	22	60	And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he was yet speaking , [ the ] cock crew .
DARBY	Luke	22	61	And the Lord , turning round , looked at Peter ; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he said to him , Before [ the ] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice .
DARBY	Luke	22	62	And Peter , going forth without , wept bitterly .
DARBY	Luke	22	63	And the men who held him mocked him , beating [ him ] ;
DARBY	Luke	22	64	and covering him up , asked him saying , Prophesy , who is it that struck thee ?
DARBY	Luke	22	65	And they said many other injurious things to him .
DARBY	Luke	22	66	And when it was day , the elderhood of the people , both [ the ] chief priests and scribes , were gathered together , and led him into their council , saying ,
DARBY	Luke	22	67	If * thou * art the Christ , tell us . And he said to them , If I tell you , ye will not at all believe ;
DARBY	Luke	22	68	and if I should ask [ you ] , ye would not answer me at all , nor let me go ;
DARBY	Luke	22	69	but henceforth shall the Son of man be sitting on the right hand of the power of God .
DARBY	Luke	22	70	And they all said , * Thou * then art the Son of God ? And he said to them , * Ye * say that I am .
DARBY	Luke	22	71	And they said , What need have we any more of witness , for we have heard ourselves out of his mouth ?
DARBY	Luke	23	23	But they were urgent with loud voices , begging that he might be crucified . And their voices [ and those of the chief priests ] prevailed .
DARBY	Luke	23	2	And they began to accuse him , saying , We have found this [ man ] perverting our nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ , a king .
DARBY	Luke	23	3	And Pilate demanded of him saying , Art * thou * the king of the Jews ? And he answering him said , Thou sayest .
DARBY	Luke	23	4	And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds , I find no guilt in this man .
DARBY	Luke	23	5	But they insisted , saying , He stirs up the people , teaching throughout all Judaea , beginning from Galilee even on to here .
DARBY	Luke	23	6	But Pilate , having heard Galilee [ named ] , demanded if the man were a Galilaean ;
DARBY	Luke	23	7	and having learned that he was of Herod 's jurisdiction , remitted him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days .
DARBY	Luke	23	8	And when Herod saw Jesus he greatly rejoiced , for he had been a long while desirous of seeing him , because of hearing many things concerning him , and he hoped to see some sign done by him ;
DARBY	Luke	23	9	and he questioned him in many words , but * he * answered him nothing .
DARBY	Luke	23	10	And the chief priests and the scribes stood and accused him violently .
DARBY	Luke	23	11	And Herod with his troops having set him at nought and mocked him , having put a splendid robe upon him , sent him back to Pilate .
DARBY	Luke	23	12	And Pilate and Herod became friends with one another the same day , for they had been at enmity before between themselves .
DARBY	Luke	23	13	And Pilate , having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
DARBY	Luke	23	14	said to them , Ye have brought to me this man as turning away the people [ to rebellion ] , and behold , I , having examined him before you , have found nothing criminal in this man as to the things of which ye accuse him ;
DARBY	Luke	23	15	nor Herod either , for I remitted you to him , and behold , nothing worthy of death is done by him .
DARBY	Luke	23	16	Having chastised him therefore , I will release him .
DARBY	Luke	23	17	( Now he was obliged to release one for them at the feast . )
DARBY	Luke	23	18	But they cried out in a mass saying , Away with this [ man ] and release Barabbas to us ;
DARBY	Luke	23	19	who was one who , for a certain tumult which had taken place in the city , and [ for ] murder , had been cast into prison .
DARBY	Luke	23	20	Pilate therefore , desirous to release Jesus , again addressed [ them ] .
DARBY	Luke	23	21	But they cried out in reply saying , Crucify , crucify him .
DARBY	Luke	23	22	And he said the third time to them , What evil then has this [ man ] done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will chastise him therefore and release him .
DARBY	Luke	23	24	And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take place .
DARBY	Luke	23	25	And he released him who , for tumult and murder , had been cast into prison , whom they begged for , and Jesus he delivered up to their will .
DARBY	Luke	23	26	And as they led him away , they laid hold on a certain Simon , a Cyrenian , coming from the field , and put the cross upon him to bear it behind Jesus .
DARBY	Luke	23	27	And a great multitude of the people , and of women who wailed and lamented him , followed him .
DARBY	Luke	23	28	And Jesus turning round to them said , Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep over me , but weep over yourselves and over your children ;
DARBY	Luke	23	29	for behold , days are coming in which they will say , Blessed [ are ] the barren , and wombs that have not borne , and breasts that have not given suck .
DARBY	Luke	23	30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall upon us ; and to the hills , Cover us :
DARBY	Luke	23	31	for if these things are done in the green tree , what shall take place in the dry ?
DARBY	Luke	23	32	Now two others also , malefactors , were led with him to be put to death .
DARBY	Luke	23	33	And when they came to the place which is called Skull , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , the other on the left .
DARBY	Luke	23	34	And Jesus said , Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . And , parting out his garments , they cast lots .
DARBY	Luke	23	35	And the people stood beholding , and the rulers also [ with them ] sneered , saying , He has saved others ; let him save himself if this is the Christ , the chosen one of God .
DARBY	Luke	23	36	And the soldiers also made game of him , coming up offering him vinegar ,
DARBY	Luke	23	37	and saying , If * thou * be the king of the Jews , save thyself .
DARBY	Luke	23	38	And there was also an inscription [ written ] over him in Greek , and Roman , and Hebrew letters : This is the King of the Jews .
DARBY	Luke	23	39	Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke insultingly to him , saying , Art not thou the Christ ? save thyself and us .
DARBY	Luke	23	40	But the other answering rebuked him , saying , Dost * thou * too not fear God , thou that art under the same judgment ?
DARBY	Luke	23	41	and * we * indeed justly , for we receive the just recompense of what we have done ; but this [ man ] has done nothing amiss .
DARBY	Luke	23	42	And he said to Jesus , Remember me , [ Lord , ] when thou comest in thy kingdom .
DARBY	Luke	23	43	And Jesus said to him , Verily I say to thee , To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise .
DARBY	Luke	23	44	And it was about [ the ] sixth hour , and there came darkness over the whole land until [ the ] ninth hour .
DARBY	Luke	23	45	And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple rent in the midst .
DARBY	Luke	23	46	And Jesus , having cried with a loud voice , said , Father , into thy hands I commit my spirit . And having said this , he expired .
DARBY	Luke	23	47	Now the centurion , seeing what took place , glorified God , saying , In very deed this man was just .
DARBY	Luke	23	48	And all the crowds who had come together to that sight , having seen the things that took place , returned , beating [ their ] breasts .
DARBY	Luke	23	49	And all those who knew him stood afar off , the women also who had followed him from Galilee , beholding these things .
DARBY	Luke	23	50	And behold , a man named Joseph , who was a councillor , a good man and a just
DARBY	Luke	23	51	( this [ man ] had not assented to their counsel and deed ) , of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews , who also waited , [ himself also , ] for the kingdom of God
DARBY	Luke	23	52	—he having gone to Pilate begged the body of Jesus ;
DARBY	Luke	23	53	and having taken it down , wrapped it in fine linen and placed him in a tomb hewn in the rock , where no one had ever been laid .
DARBY	Luke	23	54	And it was preparation day , and [ the ] sabbath twilight was coming on .
DARBY	Luke	23	55	And women , who had come along with him out of Galilee , having followed , saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed .
DARBY	Luke	23	56	And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments , and remained quiet on the sabbath , according to the commandment .
DARBY	Luke	24	24	And some of those with us went to the sepulchre , and found it so , as the women also had said , but him they saw not .
DARBY	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre .
DARBY	Luke	24	3	And when they had entered they found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
DARBY	Luke	24	4	And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it , that behold , two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment .
DARBY	Luke	24	5	And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground , they said to them , Why seek ye the living one among the dead ?
DARBY	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spoke to you , being yet in Galilee ,
DARBY	Luke	24	7	saying , The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners , and be crucified , and rise the third day .
DARBY	Luke	24	8	And they remembered his words ;
DARBY	Luke	24	9	and , returning from the sepulchre , related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest .
DARBY	Luke	24	10	Now it was Mary of Magdala , and Johanna , and Mary the [ mother ] of James , and the others with them , who told these things to the apostles .
DARBY	Luke	24	11	And their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale , and they disbelieved them .
DARBY	Luke	24	12	But Peter , rising up , ran to the sepulchre , and stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone , and went away home , wondering at what had happened .
DARBY	Luke	24	13	And behold , two of them were going on the same day to a village distant sixty stadia from Jerusalem , called Emmaus ;
DARBY	Luke	24	14	and they conversed with one another about all these things which had taken place .
DARBY	Luke	24	15	And it came to pass as they conversed and reasoned , that Jesus himself drawing nigh , went with them ;
DARBY	Luke	24	16	but their eyes were holden so as not to know him .
DARBY	Luke	24	17	And he said to them , What discourses are these which pass between you as ye walk , and are downcast ?
DARBY	Luke	24	18	And one [ of them ] , named Cleopas , answering said to him , Thou sojournest alone in Jerusalem , and dost not know what has taken place in it in these days ?
DARBY	Luke	24	19	And he said to them , What things ? And they said to him , The things concerning Jesus the Nazaraean , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ;
DARBY	Luke	24	20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to [ the ] judgment of death and crucified him .
DARBY	Luke	24	21	But * we * had hoped that * he * was [ the one ] who is about to redeem Israel . But then , besides all these things , it is now , to-day , the third day since these things took place .
DARBY	Luke	24	22	And withal , certain women from amongst us astonished us , having been very early at the sepulchre ,
DARBY	Luke	24	23	and , not having found his body , came , saying that they also had seen a vision of angels , who say that he is living .
DARBY	Luke	24	25	And * he * said to them , O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
DARBY	Luke	24	26	Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory ?
DARBY	Luke	24	27	And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets , he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
DARBY	Luke	24	28	And they drew near to the village where they were going , and * he * made as though he would go farther .
DARBY	Luke	24	29	And they constrained him , saying , Stay with us , for it is toward evening and the day is declining . And he entered in to stay with them .
DARBY	Luke	24	30	And it came to pass as he was at table with them , having taken the bread , he blessed , and having broken it , gave it to them .
DARBY	Luke	24	31	And their eyes were opened , and they recognised him . And he disappeared from them .
DARBY	Luke	24	32	And they said to one another , Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way , [ and ] as he opened the scriptures to us ?
DARBY	Luke	24	33	And rising up the same hour , they returned to Jerusalem . And they found the eleven , and those with them , gathered together ,
DARBY	Luke	24	34	saying , The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon .
DARBY	Luke	24	35	And they related what [ had happened ] on the way , and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread .
DARBY	Luke	24	36	And as they were saying these things , he himself stood in their midst , and says to them , Peace [ be ] unto you .
DARBY	Luke	24	37	But they , being confounded and being frightened , supposed they beheld a spirit .
DARBY	Luke	24	38	And he said to them , Why are ye troubled ? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts ?
DARBY	Luke	24	39	behold my hands and my feet , that it is * I * myself . Handle me and see , for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having .
DARBY	Luke	24	40	And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet .
DARBY	Luke	24	41	But while they yet did not believe for joy , and were wondering , he said to them , Have ye anything here to eat ?
DARBY	Luke	24	42	And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb ;
DARBY	Luke	24	43	and he took it and ate before them .
DARBY	Luke	24	44	And he said to them , These [ are ] the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you , that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled .
DARBY	Luke	24	45	Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures ,
DARBY	Luke	24	46	and said to them , Thus it is written , and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer , and to rise from among the dead the third day ;
DARBY	Luke	24	47	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem .
DARBY	Luke	24	48	And * ye * are witnesses of these things .
DARBY	Luke	24	49	And behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you ; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high .
DARBY	Luke	24	50	And he led them out as far as Bethany , and having lifted up his hands , he blessed them .
DARBY	Luke	24	51	And it came to pass as he was blessing them , he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven .
DARBY	Luke	24	52	And * they * , having done him homage , returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
DARBY	Luke	24	53	and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God .
DARBY	John	1	1	In [ the ] beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
DARBY	John	1	2	* He * was in the beginning with God .
DARBY	John	1	3	All things received being through him , and without him not one [ thing ] received being which has received being .
DARBY	John	1	4	In him was life , and the life was the light of men .
DARBY	John	1	5	And the light appears in darkness , and the darkness apprehended it not .
DARBY	John	1	6	There was a man sent from God , his name John .
DARBY	John	1	7	He came for witness , that he might witness concerning the light , that all might believe through him .
DARBY	John	1	8	* He * was not the light , but that he might witness concerning the light .
DARBY	John	1	9	The true light was that which , coming into the world , lightens every man .
DARBY	John	1	10	He was in the world , and the world had [ its ] being through him , and the world knew him not .
DARBY	John	1	11	He came to his own , and his own received him not ;
DARBY	John	1	12	but as many as received him , to them gave he [ the ] right to be children of God , to those that believe on his name ;
DARBY	John	1	13	who have been born , not of blood , nor of flesh 's will , nor of man 's will , but of God .
DARBY	John	1	14	And the Word became flesh , and dwelt among us ( and we have contemplated his glory , a glory as of an only-begotten with a father ) , full of grace and truth ;
DARBY	John	1	15	( John bears witness of him , and he has cried , saying , This was he of whom I said , He that comes after me is preferred before me , for he was before me ; )
DARBY	John	1	16	for of his fulness we all have received , and grace upon grace .
DARBY	John	1	17	For the law was given by Moses : grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ .
DARBY	John	1	18	No one has seen God at any time ; the only-begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , * he * hath declared [ him ] .
DARBY	John	1	19	And this is the witness of John , when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him , Thou , who art thou ?
DARBY	John	1	20	And he acknowledged and denied not , and acknowledged , I am not the Christ .
DARBY	John	1	21	And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he says , I am not . Art thou the prophet ? And he answered , No .
DARBY	John	1	22	They said therefore to him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to those who sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ?
DARBY	John	1	23	He said , I [ am ] [ the ] voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the path of [ the ] Lord , as said Esaias the prophet .
DARBY	John	1	24	And they were sent from among the Pharisees .
DARBY	John	1	25	And they asked him and said to him , Why baptisest thou then , if thou art not the Christ , nor Elias , nor the prophet ?
DARBY	John	1	26	John answered them saying , I baptise with water . In the midst of you stands , whom ye do not know ,
DARBY	John	1	27	he who comes after me , the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose .
DARBY	John	1	28	These things took place in Bethany , across the Jordan , where John was baptising .
DARBY	John	1	29	On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him , and says , Behold the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world .
DARBY	John	1	30	He it is of whom I said , A man comes after me who takes a place before me , because he * was * before me ;
DARBY	John	1	31	and I knew him not ; but that he might be manifested to Israel , therefore have I come baptising with water .
DARBY	John	1	32	And John bore witness , saying , I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven , and it abode upon him .
DARBY	John	1	33	And I knew him not ; but he who sent me to baptise with water , * he * said to me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him , he it is who baptises with [ the ] Holy Spirit .
DARBY	John	1	34	And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God .
DARBY	John	1	35	Again , on the morrow , there stood John and two of his disciples .
DARBY	John	1	36	And , looking at Jesus as he walked , he says , Behold the Lamb of God .
DARBY	John	1	37	And the two disciples heard him speaking , and followed Jesus .
DARBY	John	1	38	But Jesus having turned , and seeing them following , says to them , What seek ye ? And * they * said to him , Rabbi ( which , being interpreted , signifies Teacher ) , where abidest thou ?
DARBY	John	1	39	He says to them , Come and see . They went therefore , and saw where he abode ; and they abode with him that day . It was about the tenth hour .
DARBY	John	1	40	Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two who heard [ this ] from John and followed him .
DARBY	John	1	41	He first finds his own brother Simon , and says to him , We have found the Messias ( which being interpreted is Christ ) .
DARBY	John	1	42	And he led him to Jesus . Jesus looking at him said , Thou art Simon , the son of Jonas ; thou shalt be called Cephas ( which interpreted is stone ) .
DARBY	John	1	43	On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee , and Jesus finds Philip , and says to him , Follow me .
DARBY	John	1	44	And Philip was from Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter .
DARBY	John	1	45	Philip finds Nathanael , and says to him , We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law , and the prophets , Jesus , the son of Joseph , who is from Nazareth .
DARBY	John	1	46	And Nathanael said to him , Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? Philip says to him , Come and see .
DARBY	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and says of him , Behold [ one ] truly an Israelite , in whom there is no guile .
DARBY	John	1	48	Nathanael says to him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said to him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig-tree , I saw thee .
DARBY	John	1	49	Nathanael answered and said to him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God , thou art the King of Israel .
DARBY	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said to him , Because I said to thee , I saw thee under the fig-tree , believest thou ? Thou shalt see greater things than these .
DARBY	John	1	51	And he says to him , Verily , verily , I say to you , Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man .
DARBY	John	2	2	And Jesus also , and his disciples , were invited to the marriage .
DARBY	John	2	3	And wine being deficient , the mother of Jesus says to him , They have no wine .
DARBY	John	2	4	Jesus says to her , What have I to do with thee , woman ? mine hour has not yet come .
DARBY	John	2	5	His mother says to the servants , Whatever he may say to you , do .
DARBY	John	2	6	Now there were standing there six stone water-vessels , according to the purification of the Jews , holding two or three measures each .
DARBY	John	2	7	Jesus says to them , Fill the water-vessels with water . And they filled them up to the brim .
DARBY	John	2	8	And he says to them , Draw out now , and carry [ it ] to the feast-master . And they carried [ it ] .
DARBY	John	2	9	But when the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine ( and knew not whence it was , but the servants knew who drew the water ) , the feast-master calls the bridegroom ,
DARBY	John	2	10	and says to him , Every man sets on first the good wine , and when [ men ] have well drunk , then the inferior ; thou hast kept the good wine till now .
DARBY	John	2	11	This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
DARBY	John	2	12	After this he descended to Capernaum , he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples ; and there they abode not many days .
DARBY	John	2	13	And the passover of the Jews was near , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
DARBY	John	2	14	And he found in the temple the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves , and the money-changers sitting ;
DARBY	John	2	15	and , having made a scourge of cords , he cast [ them ] all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the change of the money-changers , and overturned the tables ,
DARBY	John	2	16	and said to the sellers of doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father 's house a house of merchandise .
DARBY	John	2	17	[ And ] his disciples remembered that it is written , The zeal of thy house devours me .
DARBY	John	2	18	The Jews therefore answered and said to him , What sign shewest thou to us , that thou doest these things ?
DARBY	John	2	19	Jesus answered and said to them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up .
DARBY	John	2	20	The Jews therefore said , Forty and six years was this temple building , and thou wilt raise it up in three days ?
DARBY	John	2	21	But * he * spoke of the temple of his body .
DARBY	John	2	22	When therefore he was raised from among [ the ] dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this , and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken .
DARBY	John	2	23	And when he was in Jerusalem , at the passover , at the feast , many believed on his name , beholding his signs which he wrought .
DARBY	John	2	24	But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them , because he knew all [ men ] ,
DARBY	John	2	25	and that he had not need that any should testify of man , for himself knew what was in man .
DARBY	John	3	3	Jesus answered and said to him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except any one be born anew he can not see the kingdom of God .
DARBY	John	3	2	he came to him by night , and said to him , Rabbi , we know that thou art come a teacher from God , for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him .
DARBY	John	3	4	Nicodemus says to him , How can a man be born being old ? can he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born ?
DARBY	John	3	5	Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except any one be born of water and of Spirit , he can not enter into the kingdom of God .
DARBY	John	3	6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
DARBY	John	3	7	Do not wonder that I said to thee , It is needful that * ye * should be born anew .
DARBY	John	3	8	The wind blows where it will , and thou hearest its voice , but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes : thus is every one that is born of the Spirit .
DARBY	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said to him , How can these things be ?
DARBY	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said to him , Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things !
DARBY	John	3	11	Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that which we know , and we bear witness of that which we have seen , and ye receive not our witness .
DARBY	John	3	12	If I have said the earthly things to you , and ye believe not , how , if I say the heavenly things to you , will ye believe ?
DARBY	John	3	13	And no one has gone up into heaven , save he who came down out of heaven , the Son of man who is in heaven .
DARBY	John	3	14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , thus must the Son of man be lifted up ,
DARBY	John	3	15	that every one who believes on him may [ not perish , but ] have life eternal .
DARBY	John	3	16	For God so loved the world , that he gave his only-begotten Son , that whosoever believes on him may not perish , but have life eternal .
DARBY	John	3	17	For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may judge the world , but that the world may be saved through him .
DARBY	John	3	18	He that believes on him is not judged : but he that believes not has been already judged , because he has not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God .
DARBY	John	3	19	And this is the judgment , that light is come into the world , and men have loved darkness rather than light ; for their works were evil .
DARBY	John	3	20	For every one that does evil hates the light , and does not come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are ;
DARBY	John	3	21	but he that practises the truth comes to the light , that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God .
DARBY	John	3	22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he abode with them and baptised .
DARBY	John	3	23	And John also was baptising in Aenon , near Salim , because there was a great deal of water there ; and they came to [ him ] and were baptised :
DARBY	John	3	24	for John was not yet cast into prison .
DARBY	John	3	25	There was therefore a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification .
DARBY	John	3	26	And they came to John and said to him , Rabbi , he who was with thee beyond the Jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , he baptises , and all come to him .
DARBY	John	3	27	John answered and said , A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven .
DARBY	John	3	28	Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said , I am not the Christ , but , that I am sent before him .
DARBY	John	3	29	He that has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices in heart because of the voice of the bridegroom : this my joy then is fulfilled .
DARBY	John	3	30	He must increase , but I must decrease .
DARBY	John	3	31	He who comes from above is above all . He who has his origin in the earth is of the earth , and speaks [ as ] of the earth . He who comes out of heaven is above all ,
DARBY	John	3	32	[ and ] what he has seen and has heard , this he testifies ; and no one receives his testimony .
DARBY	John	3	33	He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true ;
DARBY	John	3	34	for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for God gives not the Spirit by measure .
DARBY	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son , and has given all things [ to be ] in his hand .
DARBY	John	3	36	He that believes on the Son has life eternal , and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life , but the wrath of God abides upon him .
DARBY	John	4	4	And he must needs pass through Samaria .
DARBY	John	4	2	( however , Jesus himself did not baptise , but his disciples ) ,
DARBY	John	4	3	he left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee .
DARBY	John	4	5	He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar , near to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
DARBY	John	4	6	Now a fountain of Jacob 's was there ; Jesus therefore , being wearied with the way he had come , sat just as he was at the fountain . It was about the sixth hour .
DARBY	John	4	7	A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water . Jesus says to her , Give me to drink
DARBY	John	4	8	( for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions ) .
DARBY	John	4	9	The Samaritan woman therefore says to him , How dost thou , being a Jew , ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman ? for Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans .
DARBY	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said to her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that says to thee , Give me to drink , thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
DARBY	John	4	11	The woman says to him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : whence then hast thou the living water ?
DARBY	John	4	12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , and his sons , and his cattle ?
DARBY	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her , Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again ;
DARBY	John	4	14	but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever , but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water , springing up into eternal life .
DARBY	John	4	15	The woman says to him , Sir , give me this water , that I may not thirst nor come here to draw .
DARBY	John	4	16	Jesus says to her , Go , call thy husband , and come here .
DARBY	John	4	17	The woman answered and said , I have not a husband . Jesus says to her , Thou hast well said , I have not a husband ;
DARBY	John	4	18	for thou hast had five husbands , and he whom now thou hast is not thy husband : this thou hast spoken truly .
DARBY	John	4	19	The woman says to him , Sir , I see that thou art a prophet .
DARBY	John	4	20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain , and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship .
DARBY	John	4	21	Jesus says to her , Woman , believe me , [ the ] hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father .
DARBY	John	4	22	Ye worship ye know not what ; we worship what we know , for salvation is of the Jews .
DARBY	John	4	23	But [ the ] hour is coming and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth ; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers .
DARBY	John	4	24	God [ is ] a spirit ; and they who worship him must worship [ him ] in spirit and truth .
DARBY	John	4	25	The woman says to him , I know that Messiah is coming , who is called Christ ; when * he * comes he will tell us all things .
DARBY	John	4	26	Jesus says to her , I who speak to thee am [ he ] .
DARBY	John	4	27	And upon this came his disciples , and wondered that he spoke with a woman ; yet no one said , What seekest thou ? or , Why speakest thou with her ?
DARBY	John	4	28	The woman then left her waterpot and went away into the city , and says to the men ,
DARBY	John	4	29	Come , see a man who told me all things I had ever done : is not he the Christ ?
DARBY	John	4	30	They went out of the city and came to him .
DARBY	John	4	31	But meanwhile the disciples asked him saying , Rabbi , eat .
DARBY	John	4	32	But he said to them , I have food to eat which ye do not know .
DARBY	John	4	33	The disciples therefore said to one another , Has any one brought him [ anything ] to eat ?
DARBY	John	4	34	Jesus says to them , My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me , and that I should finish his work .
DARBY	John	4	35	Do not ye say , that there are yet four months and the harvest comes ? Behold , I say to you , Lift up your eyes and behold the fields , for they are already white to harvest .
DARBY	John	4	36	He that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto life eternal , that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together .
DARBY	John	4	37	For in this is [ verified ] the true saying , It is one who sows and another who reaps .
DARBY	John	4	38	I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured ; others have laboured , and ye have entered into their labours .
DARBY	John	4	39	But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman who bore witness , He told me all things that I had ever done .
DARBY	John	4	40	When therefore the Samaritans came to him they asked him to abide with them , and he abode there two days .
DARBY	John	4	41	And more a great deal believed on account of his word ;
DARBY	John	4	42	and they said to the woman , [ It is ] no longer on account of thy saying that we believe , for we have heard him ourselves , and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world .
DARBY	John	4	43	But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee ,
DARBY	John	4	44	for Jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour in his own country .
DARBY	John	4	45	When therefore he came into Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast , for they also went to the feast .
DARBY	John	4	46	He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain courtier in Capernaum whose son was sick .
DARBY	John	4	47	He , having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee , went to him and asked [ him ] that he would come down and heal his son , for he was about to die .
DARBY	John	4	48	Jesus therefore said to him , Unless ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe .
DARBY	John	4	49	The courtier says to him , Sir , come down ere my child die .
DARBY	John	4	50	Jesus says to him , Go , thy son lives . And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him , and went his way .
DARBY	John	4	51	But already , as he was going down , his servants met him and brought [ him ] word saying , Thy child lives .
DARBY	John	4	52	He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better . And they said to him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
DARBY	John	4	53	The father therefore knew that [ it was ] in that hour in which Jesus said to him , Thy son lives ; and he believed , himself and his whole house .
DARBY	John	4	54	This second sign again did Jesus , being come out of Judaea into Galilee .
DARBY	John	5	5	But there was a certain man there who had been suffering under his infirmity thirty and eight years .
DARBY	John	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem , at the sheepgate , a pool , which is called in Hebrew , Bethesda , having five porches .
DARBY	John	5	3	In these lay a multitude of sick , blind , lame , withered , [ awaiting the moving of the water .
DARBY	John	5	4	For an angel descended at a certain season in the pool and troubled the water . Whoever therefore first went in after the troubling of the water became well , whatever disease he laboured under . ]
DARBY	John	5	6	Jesus seeing this [ man ] lying [ there ] , and knowing that he was [ in that state ] now a great length of time , says to him , Wouldest thou become well ?
DARBY	John	5	7	The infirm [ man ] answered him , Sir , I have not a man , in order , when the water has been troubled , to cast me into the pool ; but while I am coming another descends before me .
DARBY	John	5	8	Jesus says to him , Arise , take up thy couch and walk .
DARBY	John	5	9	And immediately the man became well , and took up his couch and walked : and on that day was sabbath .
DARBY	John	5	10	The Jews therefore said to the healed [ man ] , It is sabbath , it is not permitted thee to take up thy couch .
DARBY	John	5	11	He answered them , He that made me well , * he * said to me , Take up thy couch and walk .
DARBY	John	5	12	They asked him [ therefore ] , Who is the man who said to thee , Take up thy couch and walk ?
DARBY	John	5	13	But he that had been healed knew not who it was , for Jesus had slidden away , there being a crowd in the place .
DARBY	John	5	14	After these things Jesus finds him in the temple , and said to him , Behold , thou art become well : sin no more , that something worse do not happen to thee .
DARBY	John	5	15	The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
DARBY	John	5	16	And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus [ and sought to kill him ] , because he had done these things on sabbath .
DARBY	John	5	17	But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto and I work .
DARBY	John	5	18	For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he had not only violated the sabbath , but also said that God was his own Father , making himself equal with God .
DARBY	John	5	19	Jesus therefore answered and said to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing : for whatever things * he * does , these things also the Son does in like manner .
DARBY	John	5	20	For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does ; and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may wonder .
DARBY	John	5	21	For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens [ them ] , thus the Son also quickens whom he will :
DARBY	John	5	22	for neither does the Father judge any one , but has given all judgment to the Son ;
DARBY	John	5	23	that all may honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He who honours not the Son , honours not the Father who has sent him .
DARBY	John	5	24	Verily , verily , I say unto you , that he that hears my word , and believes him that has sent me , has life eternal , and does not come into judgment , but is passed out of death into life .
DARBY	John	5	25	Verily , verily , I say unto you , that an hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God , and they that have heard shall live .
DARBY	John	5	26	For even as the Father has life in himself , so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself ,
DARBY	John	5	27	and has given him authority to execute judgment [ also ] , because he is Son of man .
DARBY	John	5	28	Wonder not at this , for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice ,
DARBY	John	5	29	and shall go forth ; those that have practised good , to resurrection of life , and those that have done evil , to resurrection of judgment .
DARBY	John	5	30	I can not do anything of myself ; as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righteous , because I do not seek my will , but the will of him that has sent me .
DARBY	John	5	31	If I bear witness concerning myself , my witness is not true .
DARBY	John	5	32	It is another who bears witness concerning me , and I know that the witness which he bears concerning me is true .
DARBY	John	5	33	Ye have sent unto John , and he has borne witness to the truth .
DARBY	John	5	34	But I do not receive witness from man , but I say this that * ye * might be saved .
DARBY	John	5	35	* He * was the burning and shining lamp , and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light .
DARBY	John	5	36	But I have the witness [ that is ] greater than [ that ] of John ; for the works which the Father has given me that I should complete them , the works themselves which I do , bear witness concerning me that the Father has sent me .
DARBY	John	5	37	And the Father who has sent me himself has borne witness concerning me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor have seen his shape ,
DARBY	John	5	38	and ye have not his word abiding in you ; for whom * he * hath sent , him ye do not believe .
DARBY	John	5	39	Ye search the scriptures , for ye think that in them ye have life eternal , and they it is which bear witness concerning me ;
DARBY	John	5	40	and ye will not come to me that ye might have life .
DARBY	John	5	41	I do not receive glory from men ,
DARBY	John	5	42	but I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
DARBY	John	5	43	I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not ; if another come in his own name , him ye will receive .
DARBY	John	5	44	How can ye believe , who receive glory one of another , and seek not the glory which [ comes ] from God alone ?
DARBY	John	5	45	Think not that I will accuse you to the Father : there is [ one ] who accuses you , Moses , on whom ye trust ;
DARBY	John	5	46	for if ye had believed Moses , ye would have believed me , for he wrote of me .
DARBY	John	5	47	But if ye do not believe his writings , how shall ye believe my words ?
DARBY	John	6	6	But this he said trying him , for he knew what he was going to do .
DARBY	John	6	2	and a great crowd followed him , because they saw the signs which he wrought upon the sick .
DARBY	John	6	3	And Jesus went up into the mountain , and there sat with his disciples :
DARBY	John	6	4	but the passover , the feast of the Jews , was near .
DARBY	John	6	5	Jesus then , lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great crowd is coming to him , says to Philip , Whence shall we buy loaves that these may eat ?
DARBY	John	6	7	Philip answered him , Loaves for two hundred denarii are not sufficient for them , that each may have some little [ portion ] .
DARBY	John	6	8	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , says to him ,
DARBY	John	6	9	There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes ; but this , what is it for so many ?
DARBY	John	6	10	[ And ] Jesus said , Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place : the men therefore sat down , in number about five thousand .
DARBY	John	6	11	And Jesus took the loaves , and having given thanks , distributed [ them ] to those that were set down ; and in like manner of the small fishes as much as they would .
DARBY	John	6	12	And when they had been filled , he says to his disciples , Gather together the fragments which are over and above , that nothing may be lost .
DARBY	John	6	13	They gathered [ them ] therefore together , and filled twelve hand-baskets full of fragments of the five barley loaves , which were over and above to those that had eaten .
DARBY	John	6	14	The men therefore , having seen the sign which Jesus had done , said , This is truly the prophet which is coming into the world .
DARBY	John	6	15	Jesus therefore knowing that they were going to come and seize him , that they might make [ him ] king , departed again to the mountain himself alone .
DARBY	John	6	16	But when evening was come , his disciples went down to the sea ,
DARBY	John	6	17	and having gone on board ship , they went over the sea to Capernaum . And it had already become dark , and Jesus had not come to them ,
DARBY	John	6	18	and the sea was agitated by a strong wind blowing .
DARBY	John	6	19	Having rowed then about twenty-five or thirty stadia , they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the ship ; and they were frightened .
DARBY	John	6	20	But he says to them , It is I : be not afraid .
DARBY	John	6	21	They were willing therefore to receive him into the ship ; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they went .
DARBY	John	6	22	On the morrow the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea , having seen that there was no other little ship there except that into which his disciples had got , and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples into the ship , but [ that ] his disciples had gone away alone ;
DARBY	John	6	23	( but other little ships out of Tiberias came near to the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks ; )
DARBY	John	6	24	when therefore the crowd saw that Jesus was not there , nor his disciples , * they * got into the ships , and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
DARBY	John	6	25	And having found him the other side of the sea , they said to him , Rabbi , when art thou arrived here ?
DARBY	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say to you , Ye seek me not because ye have seen signs , but because ye have eaten of the loaves and been filled .
DARBY	John	6	27	Work not [ for ] the food which perishes , but [ for ] the food which abides unto life eternal , which the Son of man shall give to you ; for him has the Father sealed , [ even ] God .
DARBY	John	6	28	They said therefore to him , What should we do that we may work the works of God ?
DARBY	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom * he * has sent .
DARBY	John	6	30	They said therefore to him , What sign then doest thou that we may see and believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
DARBY	John	6	31	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , as it is written , He gave them bread out of heaven to eat .
DARBY	John	6	32	Jesus therefore said to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , [ It is ] not Moses that has given you the bread out of heaven ; but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven .
DARBY	John	6	33	For the bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world .
DARBY	John	6	34	They said therefore to him , Lord , ever give to us this bread .
DARBY	John	6	35	[ And ] Jesus said to them , I am the bread of life : he that comes to me shall never hunger , and he that believes on me shall never thirst at any time .
DARBY	John	6	36	But I have said to you , that ye have also seen me and do not believe .
DARBY	John	6	37	All that the Father gives me shall come to me , and him that comes to me I will not at all cast out .
DARBY	John	6	38	For I am come down from heaven , not that I should do * my * will , but the will of him that has sent me .
DARBY	John	6	39	And this is the will of him that has sent me , that of all that he has given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up in the last day .
DARBY	John	6	40	For this is the will of my Father , that every one who sees the Son , and believes on him , should have life eternal ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
DARBY	John	6	41	The Jews therefore murmured about him , because he said , I am the bread which has come down out of heaven .
DARBY	John	6	42	And they said , Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we have known ? how then does * he * say , I am come down out of heaven ?
DARBY	John	6	43	Jesus therefore answered and said to them , Murmur not among yourselves .
DARBY	John	6	44	No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him , and I will raise him up in the last day .
DARBY	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . Every one that has heard from the Father [ himself ] , and has learned [ of him ] , comes to me ;
DARBY	John	6	46	not that any one has seen the Father , except he who is of God , he has seen the Father .
DARBY	John	6	47	Verily , verily , I say to you , He that believes [ on me ] has life eternal .
DARBY	John	6	48	I am the bread of life .
DARBY	John	6	49	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and died .
DARBY	John	6	50	This is the bread which comes down out of heaven , that one may eat of it and not die .
DARBY	John	6	51	I am the living bread which has come down out of heaven : if any one shall have eaten of this bread he shall live for ever ; but the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
DARBY	John	6	52	The Jews therefore contended among themselves , saying , How can he give us this flesh to eat ?
DARBY	John	6	53	Jesus therefore said to them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man , and drunk his blood , ye have no life in yourselves .
DARBY	John	6	54	He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal , and I will raise him up at the last day :
DARBY	John	6	55	for my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink .
DARBY	John	6	56	He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I in him .
DARBY	John	6	57	As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father , * he * also who eats me shall live also on account of me .
DARBY	John	6	58	This is the bread which has come down out of heaven . Not as the fathers ate and died : he that eats this bread shall live for ever .
DARBY	John	6	59	These things he said in [ the ] synagogue , teaching in Capernaum .
DARBY	John	6	60	Many therefore of his disciples having heard [ it ] said , This word is hard ; who can hear it ?
DARBY	John	6	61	But Jesus , knowing in himself that his disciples murmur concerning this , said to them , Does this offend you ?
DARBY	John	6	62	If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before ?
DARBY	John	6	63	It is the Spirit which quickens , the flesh profits nothing : the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life .
DARBY	John	6	64	But there are some of you who do not believe . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and who would deliver him up .
DARBY	John	6	65	And he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father .
DARBY	John	6	66	From that [ time ] many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him .
DARBY	John	6	67	Jesus therefore said to the twelve , Will ye also go away ?
DARBY	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast words of life eternal ;
DARBY	John	6	69	and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God .
DARBY	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you the twelve ? and of you one is a devil .
DARBY	John	6	71	Now he spoke of Judas [ the son ] of Simon , Iscariote , for he [ it was who ] should deliver him up , being one of the twelve .
DARBY	John	7	7	The world can not hate you , but me it hates , because I bear witness concerning it that its works are evil .
DARBY	John	7	2	Now the tabernacles , the feast of the Jews , was near .
DARBY	John	7	3	His brethren therefore said to him , Remove hence and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou doest ;
DARBY	John	7	4	for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be [ known ] in public . If thou doest these things , manifest thyself to the world :
DARBY	John	7	5	for neither did his brethren believe on him .
DARBY	John	7	6	Jesus therefore says to them , My time is not yet come , but your time is always ready .
DARBY	John	7	8	Ye , go ye up to this feast . I go not up to this feast , for * my * time is not yet fulfilled .
DARBY	John	7	9	Having said these things to them he abode in Galilee .
DARBY	John	7	10	But when his brethren had gone up , then he himself also went up to the feast , not openly , but as in secret .
DARBY	John	7	11	The Jews therefore sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
DARBY	John	7	12	And there was much murmuring concerning him among the crowds . Some said , He is [ a ] good [ man ] ; others said , No ; but he deceives the crowd .
DARBY	John	7	13	However , no one spoke openly concerning him on account of [ their ] fear of the Jews .
DARBY	John	7	14	But when it was now the middle of the feast , Jesus went up into the temple and taught .
DARBY	John	7	15	The Jews therefore wondered , saying , How knows this [ man ] letters , having never learned ?
DARBY	John	7	16	Jesus therefore answered them and said , My doctrine is not mine , but [ that ] of him that has sent me .
DARBY	John	7	17	If any one desire to practise his will , he shall know concerning the doctrine , whether it is of God , or [ that ] I speak from myself .
DARBY	John	7	18	He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory ; but he that seeks the glory of him that has sent him , he is true , and unrighteousness is not in him .
DARBY	John	7	19	Has not Moses given you the law , and no one of you practises the law ? Why do ye seek to kill me ?
DARBY	John	7	20	The crowd answered [ and said ] , Thou hast a demon : who seeks to kill thee ?
DARBY	John	7	21	Jesus answered and said to them , I have done one work , and ye all wonder .
DARBY	John	7	22	Therefore Moses gave you circumcision ( not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) , and ye circumcise a man on sabbath .
DARBY	John	7	23	If a man receives circumcision on sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be violated , are ye angry with me because I have made a man entirely sound on sabbath ?
DARBY	John	7	24	Judge not according to sight , but judge righteous judgment .
DARBY	John	7	25	Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said , Is not this he whom they seek to kill ?
DARBY	John	7	26	and behold , he speaks openly , and they say nothing to him . Have the rulers then indeed recognised that this is the Christ ?
DARBY	John	7	27	But [ as to ] this [ man ] we know whence he is . Now [ as to ] the Christ , when he comes , no one knows whence he is .
DARBY	John	7	28	Jesus therefore cried out in the temple , teaching and saying , Ye both know me and ye know whence I am ; and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye do not know .
DARBY	John	7	29	I know him , because I am from him , and * he * has sent me .
DARBY	John	7	30	They sought therefore to take him ; and no one laid his hand upon him , because his hour had not yet come .
DARBY	John	7	31	But many of the crowd believed on him , and said , Will the Christ , when he comes , do more signs than those which this [ man ] has done ?
DARBY	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning him , and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers that they might take him .
DARBY	John	7	33	Jesus therefore said , Yet a little while I am with you , and I go to him that has sent me .
DARBY	John	7	34	Ye shall seek me and shall not find [ me ] , and where I am ye can not come .
DARBY	John	7	35	The Jews therefore said to one another , Where is he about to go that we shall not find him ? Is he about to go to the dispersion among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
DARBY	John	7	36	What word is this which he said , Ye shall seek me and shall not find [ me ] ; and where I am ye can not come ?
DARBY	John	7	37	In the last , the great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried saying , If any one thirst , let him come to me and drink .
DARBY	John	7	38	He that believes on me , as the scripture has said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water .
DARBY	John	7	39	But this he said concerning the Spirit , which they that believed on him were about to receive ; for [ the ] Spirit was not yet , because Jesus had not yet been glorified .
DARBY	John	7	40	[ Some ] out of the crowd therefore , having heard this word , said , This is truly the prophet .
DARBY	John	7	41	Others said , This is the Christ . Others said , Does then the Christ come out of Galilee ?
DARBY	John	7	42	Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David , and from the village of Bethlehem , where David was ?
DARBY	John	7	43	There was a division therefore in the crowd on account of him .
DARBY	John	7	44	But some of them desired to take him , but no one laid hands upon him .
DARBY	John	7	45	The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , Why have ye not brought him ?
DARBY	John	7	46	The officers answered , Never man spoke thus , as this man [ speaks ] .
DARBY	John	7	47	The Pharisees therefore answered them , Are ye also deceived ?
DARBY	John	7	48	Has any one of the rulers believed on him , or of the Pharisees ?
DARBY	John	7	49	But this crowd , which does not know the law , are accursed .
DARBY	John	7	50	Nicodemus says to them ( being one of themselves ) ,
DARBY	John	7	51	Does our law judge a man before it have first heard from himself , and know what he does ?
DARBY	John	7	52	They answered and said to him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search and look , that no prophet arises out of Galilee .
DARBY	John	7	53	And every one went to his home .
DARBY	John	8	8	And again stooping down he wrote on the ground .
DARBY	John	8	2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him ; and he sat down and taught them .
DARBY	John	8	3	And the scribes and the Pharisees bring [ to him ] a woman taken in adultery , and having set her in the midst ,
DARBY	John	8	4	they say to him , Teacher , this woman has been taken in the very act , committing adultery .
DARBY	John	8	5	Now in the law Moses has commanded us to stone such ; thou therefore , what sayest thou ?
DARBY	John	8	6	But this they said proving him , that they might have [ something ] to accuse him [ of ] . But Jesus , having stooped down , wrote with his finger on the ground .
DARBY	John	8	7	But when they continued asking him , he lifted himself up and said to them , Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her .
DARBY	John	8	9	But they , having heard [ that ] , went out one by one beginning from the elder ones until the last ; and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing there .
DARBY	John	8	10	And Jesus , lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman , said to her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? Has no one condemned thee ?
DARBY	John	8	11	And she said , No one , sir . And Jesus said to her , Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin no more .
DARBY	John	8	12	Again therefore Jesus spoke to them , saying , I am the light of the world ; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life .
DARBY	John	8	13	The Pharisees therefore said to him , Thou bearest witness concerning thyself ; thy witness is not true .
DARBY	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them , Even if I bear witness concerning myself , my witness is true , because I know whence I came and whither I go : but ye know not whence I come and whither I go .
DARBY	John	8	15	Ye judge according to the flesh , I judge no one .
DARBY	John	8	16	And if also I judge , my judgment is true , because I am not alone , but I and the Father who has sent me .
DARBY	John	8	17	And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two men is true :
DARBY	John	8	18	I am [ one ] who bear witness concerning myself , and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me .
DARBY	John	8	19	They said to him therefore , Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered , Ye know neither me nor my Father . If ye had known me , ye would have known also my Father .
DARBY	John	8	20	These words spoke he in the treasury , teaching in the temple ; and no one took him , for his hour was not yet come .
DARBY	John	8	21	He said therefore again to them , I go away , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sin ; where I go ye can not come .
DARBY	John	8	22	The Jews therefore said , Will he kill himself , that he says , Where I go ye can not come ?
DARBY	John	8	23	And he said to them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above . Ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
DARBY	John	8	24	I said therefore to you , that ye shall die in your sins ; for unless ye shall believe that I am [ he ] , ye shall die in your sins .
DARBY	John	8	25	They said therefore to him , Who art thou ? [ And ] Jesus said to them , Altogether that which I also say to you .
DARBY	John	8	26	I have many things to say and to judge concerning you , but he that has sent me is true , and I , what I have heard from him , these things I say to the world .
DARBY	John	8	27	They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father .
DARBY	John	8	28	Jesus therefore said to them , When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man , then ye shall know that I am [ he ] , and [ that ] I do nothing of myself , but as the Father has taught me I speak these things .
DARBY	John	8	29	And he that has sent me is with me ; he has not left me alone , because I do always the things that are pleasing to him .
DARBY	John	8	30	As he spoke these things many believed on him .
DARBY	John	8	31	Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him , If ye abide in my word , ye are truly my disciples ;
DARBY	John	8	32	and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall set you free .
DARBY	John	8	33	They answered him , We are Abraham 's seed , and have never been under bondage to any one ; how sayest thou , Ye shall become free ?
DARBY	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say to you , Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin .
DARBY	John	8	35	Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever : the son abides for ever .
DARBY	John	8	36	If therefore the Son shall set you free , ye shall be really free .
DARBY	John	8	37	I know that ye are Abraham 's seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word has no entrance in you .
DARBY	John	8	38	I speak what I have seen with my Father , and ye then do what ye have seen with your father .
DARBY	John	8	39	They answered and said to him , Abraham is our father . Jesus says to them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham ;
DARBY	John	8	40	but now ye seek to kill me , a man who has spoken the truth to you , which I have heard from God : this did not Abraham .
DARBY	John	8	41	Ye do the works of your father . They said [ therefore ] to him , We are not born of fornication ; we have one father , God .
DARBY	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , If God were your father ye would have loved me , for I came forth from God and am come [ from him ] ; for neither am I come of myself , but * he * has sent me .
DARBY	John	8	43	Why do ye not know my speech ? Because ye can not hear my word .
DARBY	John	8	44	Ye are of the devil , as [ your ] father , and ye desire to do the lusts of your father . He was a murderer from the beginning , and has not stood in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaks falsehood , he speaks of what is his own ; for he is a liar and its father :
DARBY	John	8	45	and because I speak the truth , ye do not believe me .
DARBY	John	8	46	Which of you convinces me of sin ? If I speak truth , why do ye not believe me ?
DARBY	John	8	47	He that is of God hears the words of God : therefore ye hear [ them ] not , because ye are not of God .
DARBY	John	8	48	The Jews answered and said to him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon ?
DARBY	John	8	49	Jesus answered , I have not a demon ; but I honour my Father , and ye dishonour me .
DARBY	John	8	50	But I do not seek my own glory : there is he that seeks and judges .
DARBY	John	8	51	Verily , verily , I say unto you , If any one shall keep my word , he shall never see death .
DARBY	John	8	52	The Jews therefore said to him , Now we know that thou hast a demon . Abraham has died , and the prophets , and thou sayest , If any one keep my word , he shall never taste death .
DARBY	John	8	53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham , who has died ? and the prophets have died : whom makest thou thyself ?
DARBY	John	8	54	Jesus answered , If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing : it is my Father who glorifies me , [ of ] whom ye say , He is our God .
DARBY	John	8	55	And ye know him not ; but I know him ; and if I said , I know him not , I should be like you , a liar . But I know him , and I keep his word .
DARBY	John	8	56	Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day , and he saw and rejoiced .
DARBY	John	8	57	The Jews therefore said to him , Thou hast not yet fifty years , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
DARBY	John	8	58	Jesus said to them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was , I am .
DARBY	John	8	59	They took up therefore stones that they might cast [ them ] at him ; but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple , [ going through the midst of them , and thus passed on . ]
DARBY	John	9	9	Some said , It is he ; others said , No , but he is like him : * he * said , It is I .
DARBY	John	9	2	And his disciples asked him , saying , Rabbi , who sinned , this [ man ] or his parents , that he should be born blind ?
DARBY	John	9	3	Jesus answered , Neither has this [ man ] sinned nor his parents , but that the works of God should be manifested in him .
DARBY	John	9	4	I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day . [ The ] night is coming , when no one can work .
DARBY	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world , I am [ the ] light of the world .
DARBY	John	9	6	Having said these things , he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle , and put the mud , as ointment , on his eyes .
DARBY	John	9	7	And he said to him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , which is interpreted , Sent . He went therefore and washed , and came seeing .
DARBY	John	9	8	The neighbours therefore , and those who used to see him before , that he was a beggar , said , Is not this he that was sitting and begging ?
DARBY	John	9	10	They said therefore to him , How have thine eyes been opened ?
DARBY	John	9	11	He answered [ and said ] , A man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes , and said to me , Go to Siloam and wash : and having gone and washed , I saw .
DARBY	John	9	12	They said therefore to him , Where is he ? He says , I do not know .
DARBY	John	9	13	They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees .
DARBY	John	9	14	Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes .
DARBY	John	9	15	The Pharisees therefore also again asked him how he received his sight . And he said to them , He put mud upon mine eyes , and I washed , and I see .
DARBY	John	9	16	Some of the Pharisees therefore said , This man is not of God , for he does not keep the sabbath . Others said , How can a sinful man perform such signs ? And there was a division among them .
DARBY	John	9	17	They say therefore again to the blind [ man ] , What dost thou say of him , that he has opened thine eyes ? And he said , He is a prophet .
DARBY	John	9	18	The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and had received sight , until they had called the parents of him that had received sight .
DARBY	John	9	19	And they asked them saying , This is your son , of whom ye say that he was born blind : how then does he now see ?
DARBY	John	9	20	His parents answered [ them ] and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
DARBY	John	9	21	but how he now sees we do not know , or who has opened his eyes we do not know . * He * is of age : ask * him * ; * he * will speak concerning himself .
DARBY	John	9	22	His parents said these things because they feared the Jews , for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him [ to be the ] Christ , he should be excommunicated from the synagogue .
DARBY	John	9	23	On this account his parents said , He is of age : ask * him * .
DARBY	John	9	24	They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind , and said to him , Give glory to God : we know that this man is sinful .
DARBY	John	9	25	He answered therefore , If he is sinful I know not . One thing I know , that , being blind [ before ] , now I see .
DARBY	John	9	26	And they said to him again , What did he do to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
DARBY	John	9	27	He answered them , I told you already and ye did not hear : why do ye desire to hear again ? do ye also wish to become his disciples ?
DARBY	John	9	28	They railed at him , and said , Thou art his disciple , but we are disciples of Moses .
DARBY	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses ; but [ as to ] this [ man ] , we know not whence he is .
DARBY	John	9	30	The man answered and said to them , Now in this is a wonderful thing , that * ye * do not know whence he is , and he has opened mine eyes .
DARBY	John	9	31	[ But ] we know that God does not hear sinners ; but if any one be God-fearing and do his will , him he hears .
DARBY	John	9	32	Since time was , it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind .
DARBY	John	9	33	If this [ man ] were not of God he would be able to do nothing .
DARBY	John	9	34	They answered and said to him , Thou hast been wholly born in sins , and thou teachest us ? And they cast him out .
DARBY	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out , and having found him , he said to him , Thou , dost thou believe on the Son of God ?
DARBY	John	9	36	He answered and said , And who is he , Lord , that I may believe on him ?
DARBY	John	9	37	And Jesus said to him , Thou hast both seen him , and he that speaks with thee is he .
DARBY	John	9	38	And he said , I believe , Lord : and he did him homage .
DARBY	John	9	39	And Jesus said , For judgment am I come into this world , that they which see not may see , and they which see may become blind .
DARBY	John	9	40	And [ some ] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things , and they said to him , Are we blind also ?
DARBY	John	9	41	Jesus said to them , If ye were blind ye would not have sin ; but now ye say , We see , your sin remains .
DARBY	John	10	10	The thief comes not but that he may steal , and kill , and destroy : I am come that they might have life , and might have [ it ] abundantly .
DARBY	John	10	2	but he that enters in by the door is [ the ] shepherd of the sheep .
DARBY	John	10	3	To him the porter opens ; and the sheep hear his voice ; and he calls his own sheep by name , and leads them out .
DARBY	John	10	4	When he has put forth all his own , he goes before them , and the sheep follow him , because they know his voice .
DARBY	John	10	5	But they will not follow a stranger , but will flee from him , because they know not the voice of strangers .
DARBY	John	10	6	This allegory spoke Jesus to them , but they did not know what it was [ of ] which he spoke to them .
DARBY	John	10	7	Jesus therefore said again to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .
DARBY	John	10	8	All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers ; but the sheep did not hear them .
DARBY	John	10	9	I am the door : if any one enter in by me , he shall be saved , and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture .
DARBY	John	10	11	I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep :
DARBY	John	10	12	but he who serves for wages , and who is not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , sees the wolf coming , and leaves the sheep and flees ; and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep .
DARBY	John	10	13	Now he who serves for wages flees because he serves for wages , and is not himself concerned about the sheep .
DARBY	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd ; and I know those that are mine , and am known of those that are mine ,
DARBY	John	10	15	as the Father knows me and I know the Father ; and I lay down my life for the sheep .
DARBY	John	10	16	And I have other sheep which are not of this fold : those also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one flock , one shepherd .
DARBY	John	10	17	On this account the Father loves me , because I lay down my life that I may take it again .
DARBY	John	10	18	No one takes it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again . I have received this commandment of my Father .
DARBY	John	10	19	There was a division again among the Jews on account of these words ;
DARBY	John	10	20	but many of them said , He has a demon and raves ; why do ye hear him ?
DARBY	John	10	21	Others said , These sayings are not [ those ] of one that is possessed by a demon . Can a demon open blind people 's eyes ?
DARBY	John	10	22	Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at Jerusalem , and it was winter .
DARBY	John	10	23	And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon .
DARBY	John	10	24	The Jews therefore surrounded him , and said to him , Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense ? If thou art the Christ , say [ so ] to us openly .
DARBY	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye do not believe . The works which I do in my Father 's name , these bear witness concerning me :
DARBY	John	10	26	but ye do not believe , for ye are not of my sheep , as I told you .
DARBY	John	10	27	My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me ;
DARBY	John	10	28	and I give them life eternal ; and they shall never perish , and no one shall seize them out of my hand .
DARBY	John	10	29	My Father who has given [ them ] to me is greater than all , and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father .
DARBY	John	10	30	I and the Father are one .
DARBY	John	10	31	The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him .
DARBY	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , Many good works have I shewn you of my Father ; for which work of them do ye stone me ?
DARBY	John	10	33	The Jews answered him , For a good work we stone thee not , but for blasphemy , and because thou , being a man , makest thyself God .
DARBY	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , Ye are gods ?
DARBY	John	10	35	If he called * them * gods to whom the word of God came ( and the scripture can not be broken ) ,
DARBY	John	10	36	do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest , because I said , I am Son of God ?
DARBY	John	10	37	If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not ;
DARBY	John	10	38	but if I do , even if ye believe not me , believe the works , that ye may know [ and believe ] that the Father is in me and I in him .
DARBY	John	10	39	They sought therefore again to take him ; and he went away from out of their hand
DARBY	John	10	40	and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptising at the first : and he abode there .
DARBY	John	10	41	And many came to him , and said , John did no sign ; but all things which John said of this [ man ] were true .
DARBY	John	10	42	And many believed on him there .
DARBY	John	11	11	These things said he ; and after this he says to them , Lazarus , our friend , is fallen asleep , but I go that I may awake him out of sleep .
DARBY	John	11	2	It was [ the ] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick .
DARBY	John	11	3	The sisters therefore sent to him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
DARBY	John	11	4	But when Jesus heard [ it ] , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified by it .
DARBY	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
DARBY	John	11	6	When therefore he heard , He is sick , he remained two days then in the place where he was .
DARBY	John	11	7	Then after this he says to his disciples , Let us go into Judaea again .
DARBY	John	11	8	The disciples say to him , Rabbi , [ even but ] now the Jews sought to stone thee , and goest thou thither again ?
DARBY	John	11	9	Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any one walk in the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world ;
DARBY	John	11	10	but if any one walk in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him .
DARBY	John	11	12	The disciples therefore said to him , Lord , if he be fallen asleep , he will get well .
DARBY	John	11	13	But Jesus spoke of his death , but * they * thought that he spoke of the rest of sleep .
DARBY	John	11	14	Jesus therefore then said to them plainly , Lazarus has died .
DARBY	John	11	15	And I rejoice on your account that I was not there , in order that ye may believe . But let us go to him .
DARBY	John	11	16	Thomas therefore , called Didymus , said to his fellow disciples , Let * us * also go , that we may die with him .
DARBY	John	11	17	Jesus therefore [ on ] arriving found him to have been four days already in the tomb .
DARBY	John	11	18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about fifteen stadia off ,
DARBY	John	11	19	and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , that they might console them concerning their brother .
DARBY	John	11	20	Martha then , when she heard Jesus is coming , went to meet him ; but Mary sat in the house .
DARBY	John	11	21	Martha therefore said to Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died ;
DARBY	John	11	22	but even now I know , that whatsoever thou shalt ask of God , God will give thee .
DARBY	John	11	23	Jesus says to her , Thy brother shall rise again .
DARBY	John	11	24	Martha says to him , I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day .
DARBY	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , I am the resurrection and the life : he that believes on me , though he have died , shall live ;
DARBY	John	11	26	and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die . Believest thou this ?
DARBY	John	11	27	She says to him , Yea , Lord ; I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , who should come into the world .
DARBY	John	11	28	And having said this , she went away and called her sister Mary secretly , saying , The teacher is come and calls thee .
DARBY	John	11	29	She , when she heard [ that ] , rises up quickly and comes to him .
DARBY	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was in the place where Martha came to meet him .
DARBY	John	11	31	The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and consoling her , seeing Mary that she rose up quickly and went out , followed her , saying , She goes to the tomb , that she may weep there .
DARBY	John	11	32	Mary therefore , when she came where Jesus was , seeing him , fell at his feet , saying to him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
DARBY	John	11	33	Jesus therefore , when he saw her weeping , and the Jews who came with her weeping , was deeply moved in spirit , and was troubled ,
DARBY	John	11	34	and said , Where have ye put him ? They say to him , Lord , come and see .
DARBY	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
DARBY	John	11	36	The Jews therefore said , Behold how he loved him !
DARBY	John	11	37	And some of them said , Could not this [ man ] , who has opened the eyes of the blind [ man ] , have caused that this [ man ] also should not have died ?
DARBY	John	11	38	Jesus therefore , again deeply moved in himself , comes to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
DARBY	John	11	39	Jesus says , Take away the stone . Martha , the sister of the dead , says to him , Lord , he stinks already , for he is four days [ there ] .
DARBY	John	11	40	Jesus says to her , Did I not say to thee , that if thou shouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ?
DARBY	John	11	41	They took therefore the stone away . And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me ;
DARBY	John	11	42	but I knew that thou always hearest me ; but on account of the crowd who stand around I have said [ it ] , that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
DARBY	John	11	43	And having said this , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth .
DARBY	John	11	44	And the dead came forth , bound feet and hands with graveclothes , and his face was bound round with a handkerchief . Jesus says to them , Loose him and let him go .
DARBY	John	11	45	Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done , believed on him ;
DARBY	John	11	46	but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
DARBY	John	11	47	The chief priests , therefore , and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , What do we ? for this man does many signs .
DARBY	John	11	48	If we let him thus alone , all will believe on him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation .
DARBY	John	11	49	But a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being high priest that year , said to them , Ye know nothing
DARBY	John	11	50	nor consider that it is profitable for you that one man die for the people , and not that the whole nation perish .
DARBY	John	11	51	But this he did not say of himself ; but , being high priest that year , prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation ;
DARBY	John	11	52	and not for the nation only , but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad .
DARBY	John	11	53	From that day therefore they took counsel that they might kill him .
DARBY	John	11	54	Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews , but went away thence into the country near the desert , to a city called Ephraim , and there he sojourned with the disciples .
DARBY	John	11	55	But the passover of the Jews was near , and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover , that they might purify themselves .
DARBY	John	11	56	They sought therefore Jesus , and said among themselves , standing in the temple , What do ye think ? that he will not come to the feast ?
DARBY	John	11	57	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment that if any one knew where he was , he should make it known , that they might take him .
DARBY	John	12	12	On the morrow a great crowd who came to the feast , having heard that Jesus is coming into Jerusalem ,
DARBY	John	12	2	There therefore they made him a supper , and Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those at table with him .
DARBY	John	12	3	Mary therefore , having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price , anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair , and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
DARBY	John	12	4	One of his disciples therefore , Judas [ son ] of Simon , Iscariote , who was about to deliver him up , says ,
DARBY	John	12	5	Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor ?
DARBY	John	12	6	But he said this , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief and had the bag , and carried what was put into [ it ] .
DARBY	John	12	7	Jesus therefore said , Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial ;
DARBY	John	12	8	for ye have the poor always with you , but me ye have not always .
DARBY	John	12	9	A great crowd therefore of the Jews knew that he was there ; and they came , not because of Jesus only , but also that they might see Lazarus whom he raised from among [ the ] dead .
DARBY	John	12	10	But the chief priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus also ,
DARBY	John	12	11	because many of the Jews went away on his account and believed on Jesus .
DARBY	John	12	13	took branches of palms and went out to meet him , and cried , Hosanna , blessed [ is ] he that comes in the name of [ the ] Lord , the King of Israel .
DARBY	John	12	14	And Jesus , having found a young ass , sat upon it ; as it is written ,
DARBY	John	12	15	Fear not , daughter of Zion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt .
DARBY	John	12	16	[ Now ] his disciples knew not these things at the first ; but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things to him .
DARBY	John	12	17	The crowd therefore that was with him bore witness because he had called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from among [ the ] dead .
DARBY	John	12	18	Therefore also the crowd met him because they had heard that he had done this sign .
DARBY	John	12	19	The Pharisees therefore said to one another , Ye see that ye profit nothing : behold , the world is gone after him .
DARBY	John	12	20	And there were certain Greeks among those who came up that they might worship in the feast ;
DARBY	John	12	21	these therefore came to Philip , who was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and they asked him saying , Sir , we desire to see Jesus .
DARBY	John	12	22	Philip comes and tells Andrew , [ and again ] Andrew comes and Philip , and they tell Jesus .
DARBY	John	12	23	But Jesus answered them saying , The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified .
DARBY	John	12	24	Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die , it abides alone ; but if it die , it bears much fruit .
DARBY	John	12	25	He that loves his life shall lose it , and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal .
DARBY	John	12	26	If any one serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there also shall be * my * servant . [ And ] if any one serve me , him shall the Father honour .
DARBY	John	12	27	Now is my soul troubled , and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour . But on account of this have I come to this hour .
DARBY	John	12	28	Father , glorify thy name . There came therefore a voice out of heaven , I both have glorified and will glorify [ it ] again .
DARBY	John	12	29	The crowd therefore , which stood [ there ] and heard [ it ] , said that it had thundered . Others said , An angel has spoken to him .
DARBY	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , Not on my account has this voice come , but on yours .
DARBY	John	12	31	Now is [ the ] judgment of this world ; now shall the prince of this world be cast out :
DARBY	John	12	32	and I , if I be lifted up out of the earth , will draw all to me .
DARBY	John	12	33	But this he said signifying by what death he was about to die .
DARBY	John	12	34	The crowd answered him , We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides for ever ; and how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up ? Who * is * this , the Son of man ?
DARBY	John	12	35	Jesus therefore said to them , Yet a little while is the light amongst you . Walk while ye have the light , that darkness may not overtake you . And he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes .
DARBY	John	12	36	While ye have the light , believe in the light , that ye may become sons of light . Jesus said these things , and going away hid himself from them .
DARBY	John	12	37	But though he had done so many signs before them , they believed not on him ,
DARBY	John	12	38	that the word of the prophet Esaias which he said might be fulfilled , Lord , who has believed our report ? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
DARBY	John	12	39	On this account they could not believe , because Esaias said again ,
DARBY	John	12	40	He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart , that they may not see with their eyes , and understand with their heart and be converted , and I should heal them .
DARBY	John	12	41	These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him .
DARBY	John	12	42	Although indeed from among the rulers also many believed on him , but on account of the Pharisees did not confess [ him ] , that they might not be put out of the synagogue :
DARBY	John	12	43	for they loved glory from men rather than glory from God .
DARBY	John	12	44	But Jesus cried and said , He that believes on me , believes not on me , but on him that sent me ;
DARBY	John	12	45	and he that beholds me , beholds him that sent me .
DARBY	John	12	46	I am come into the world [ as ] light , that every one that believes on me may not abide in darkness ;
DARBY	John	12	47	and if any one hear my words and do not keep [ them ] , I judge him not , for I am not come that I might judge the world , but that I might save the world .
DARBY	John	12	48	He that rejects me and does not receive my words , has him who judges him : the word which I have spoken , that shall judge him in the last day .
DARBY	John	12	49	For I have not spoken from myself , but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak ;
DARBY	John	12	50	and I know that his commandment is life eternal . What therefore I speak , as the Father has said to me , so I speak .
DARBY	John	13	13	Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord , and ye say well , for I am [ so ] .
DARBY	John	13	2	And during supper , the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas [ son ] of Simon , Iscariote , that he should deliver him up ,
DARBY	John	13	3	[ Jesus , ] knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands , and that he came out from God and was going to God ,
DARBY	John	13	4	rises from supper and lays aside his garments , and having taken a linen towel he girded himself :
DARBY	John	13	5	then he pours water into the washhand basin , and began to wash the feet of the disciples , and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded .
DARBY	John	13	6	He comes therefore to Simon Peter ; and * he * says to him , Lord , dost thou wash * my * feet ?
DARBY	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him , What I do thou dost not know now , but thou shalt know hereafter .
DARBY	John	13	8	Peter says to him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , Unless I wash thee , thou hast not part with me .
DARBY	John	13	9	Simon Peter says to him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
DARBY	John	13	10	Jesus says to him , He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet , but is wholly clean ; and ye are clean , but not all .
DARBY	John	13	11	For he knew him that delivered him up : on account of this he said , Ye are not all clean .
DARBY	John	13	12	When therefore he had washed their feet , and taken his garments , having sat down again , he said to them , Do ye know what I have done to you ?
DARBY	John	13	14	If I therefore , the Lord and the Teacher , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another 's feet ;
DARBY	John	13	15	for I have given you an example that , as I have done to you , ye should do also .
DARBY	John	13	16	Verily , verily , I say to you , The bondman is not greater than his lord , nor the sent greater than he who has sent him .
DARBY	John	13	17	If ye know these things , blessed are ye if ye do them .
DARBY	John	13	18	I speak not of you all . I know those whom I have chosen ; but that the scripture might be fulfilled , He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me .
DARBY	John	13	19	I tell you [ it ] now before it happens , that when it happens , ye may believe that I am [ he ] .
DARBY	John	13	20	Verily , verily , I say to you , He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me ; and he that receives me receives him who has sent me .
DARBY	John	13	21	Having said these things , Jesus was troubled in spirit , and testified and said , Verily , verily , I say to you , that one of you shall deliver me up .
DARBY	John	13	22	The disciples therefore looked one on another , doubting of whom he spoke .
DARBY	John	13	23	Now there was at table one of his disciples in the bosom of Jesus , whom Jesus loved .
DARBY	John	13	24	Simon Peter makes a sign therefore to him to ask who it might be of whom he spoke .
DARBY	John	13	25	But he , leaning on the breast of Jesus , says to him , Lord , who is it ?
DARBY	John	13	26	Jesus answers , He it is to whom I , after I have dipped the morsel , give it . And having dipped the morsel , he gives it to Judas [ son ] of Simon , Iscariote .
DARBY	John	13	27	And , after the morsel , then entered Satan into him . Jesus therefore says to him , What thou doest , do quickly .
DARBY	John	13	28	But none of those at table knew why he said this to him ;
DARBY	John	13	29	for some supposed , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus was saying to him , Buy the things of which we have need for the feast ; or that he should give something to the poor .
DARBY	John	13	30	Having therefore received the morsel , he went out immediately ; and it was night .
DARBY	John	13	31	When therefore he was gone out Jesus says , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
DARBY	John	13	32	If God be glorified in him , God also shall glorify him in himself , and shall glorify him immediately .
DARBY	John	13	33	Children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me ; and , as I said to the Jews , Where I go ye can not come , I say to you also now .
DARBY	John	13	34	A new commandment I give to you , that ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another .
DARBY	John	13	35	By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine , if ye have love amongst yourselves .
DARBY	John	13	36	Simon Peter says to him , Lord , where goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Where I go thou canst not follow me now , but thou shalt follow me after .
DARBY	John	13	37	Peter says to him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thee .
DARBY	John	13	38	Jesus answers , Thou wilt lay down thy life for me ! Verily , verily , I say to thee , The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice .
DARBY	John	14	14	If ye shall ask anything in my name , I will do it .
DARBY	John	14	2	In my Father 's house there are many abodes ; were it not so , I had told you : for I go to prepare you a place ;
DARBY	John	14	3	and if I go and shall prepare you a place , I am coming again and shall receive you to myself , that where I am ye also may be .
DARBY	John	14	4	And ye know where I go , and ye know the way .
DARBY	John	14	5	Thomas says to him , Lord , we know not where thou goest , and how can we know the way ?
DARBY	John	14	6	Jesus says to him , I am the way , and the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father unless by me .
DARBY	John	14	7	If ye had known me , ye would have known also my Father , and henceforth ye know him and have seen him .
DARBY	John	14	8	Philip says to him , Lord , shew us the Father and it suffices us .
DARBY	John	14	9	Jesus says to him , Am I so long a time with you , and thou hast not known me , Philip ? He that has seen me has seen the Father ; and how sayest thou , Shew us the Father ?
DARBY	John	14	10	Believest thou not that I [ am ] in the Father , and that the Father is in me ? The words which I speak to you I do not speak from myself ; but the Father who abides in me , he does the works .
DARBY	John	14	11	Believe * me * that I [ am ] in the Father and the Father in me ; but if not , believe me for the works ' sake themselves .
DARBY	John	14	12	Verily , verily , I say to you , He that believes on me , the works which I do shall he do also , and he shall do greater than these , because I go to the Father .
DARBY	John	14	13	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , this will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
DARBY	John	14	15	If ye love me , keep my commandments .
DARBY	John	14	16	And I will beg the Father , and he will give you another Comforter , that he may be with you for ever ,
DARBY	John	14	17	the Spirit of truth , whom the world can not receive , because it does not see him nor know him ; but ye know him , for he abides with you , and shall be in you .
DARBY	John	14	18	I will not leave you orphans , I am coming to you .
DARBY	John	14	19	Yet a little and the world sees me no longer ; but ye see me ; because I live ye also shall live .
DARBY	John	14	20	In that day ye shall know that I [ am ] in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
DARBY	John	14	21	He that has my commandments and keeps them , he it is that loves me ; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father , and I will love him and will manifest myself to him .
DARBY	John	14	22	Judas , not the Iscariote , says to him , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world ?
DARBY	John	14	23	Jesus answered and said to him , If any one love me , he will keep my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come to him and make our abode with him .
DARBY	John	14	24	He that loves me not does not keep my words ; and the word which ye hear is not mine , but [ that ] of the Father who has sent me .
DARBY	John	14	25	These things I have said to you , abiding with you ;
DARBY	John	14	26	but the Comforter , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , * he * shall teach you all things , and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you .
DARBY	John	14	27	I leave peace with you ; I give * my * peace to you : not as the world gives do I give to you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it fear .
DARBY	John	14	28	Ye have heard that I have said unto you , I go away and I am coming to you . If ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father , for [ my ] Father is greater than I .
DARBY	John	14	29	And now I have told you before it comes to pass , that when it shall have come to pass ye may believe .
DARBY	John	14	30	I will no longer speak much with you , for the ruler of the world comes , and in me he has nothing ;
DARBY	John	14	31	but that the world may know that I love the Father , and as the Father has commanded me , thus I do . Rise up , let us go hence .
DARBY	John	15	15	I call you no longer bondmen , for the bondman does not know what his master is doing ; but I have called you friends , for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you .
DARBY	John	15	2	[ As to ] every branch in me not bearing fruit , he takes it away ; and [ as to ] every one bearing fruit , he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit .
DARBY	John	15	3	Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you .
DARBY	John	15	4	Abide in me and I in you . As the branch can not bear fruit of itself unless it abide in the vine , thus neither [ can ] ye unless ye abide in me .
DARBY	John	15	5	I am the vine , ye [ are ] the branches . He that abides in me and I in him , * he * bears much fruit ; for without me ye can do nothing .
DARBY	John	15	6	Unless any one abide in me he is cast out as the branch , and is dried up ; and they gather them and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
DARBY	John	15	7	If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you .
DARBY	John	15	8	In this is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit , and ye shall become disciples of mine .
DARBY	John	15	9	As the Father has loved me , I also have loved you : abide in my love .
DARBY	John	15	10	If ye shall keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love , as I have kept my Father 's commandments and abide in his love .
DARBY	John	15	11	I have spoken these things to you that my joy may be in you , and your joy be full .
DARBY	John	15	12	This is my commandment , that ye love one another , as I have loved you .
DARBY	John	15	13	No one has greater love than this , that one should lay down his life for his friends .
DARBY	John	15	14	Ye are my friends if ye practise whatever I command you .
DARBY	John	15	16	Ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and have set you that ye should go and [ that ] ye should bear fruit , and [ that ] your fruit should abide , that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he may give you .
DARBY	John	15	17	These things I command you , that ye love one another .
DARBY	John	15	18	If the world hate you , know that it has hated me before you .
DARBY	John	15	19	If ye were of the world , the world would love its own ; but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , on account of this the world hates you .
DARBY	John	15	20	Remember the word which I said unto you , The bondman is not greater than his master . If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my word , they will keep also yours .
DARBY	John	15	21	But they will do all these things to you on account of my name , because they have not known him that sent me .
DARBY	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them , they had not had sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
DARBY	John	15	23	He that hates me hates also my Father .
DARBY	John	15	24	If I had not done among them the works which no other one has done , they had not had sin ; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father .
DARBY	John	15	25	But that the word written in their law might be fulfilled , They hated me without a cause .
DARBY	John	15	26	But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father , * he * shall bear witness concerning me ;
DARBY	John	15	27	and ye too bear witness , because ye are with me from [ the ] beginning .
DARBY	John	16	16	A little while and ye do not behold me ; and again a little while and ye shall see me , [ because I go away to the Father ] .
DARBY	John	16	2	They shall put you out of the synagogues ; but the hour is coming that every one who kills you will think to render service to God ;
DARBY	John	16	3	and these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor me .
DARBY	John	16	4	But I have spoken these things to you , that when their hour shall have come , ye may remember them , that I have said [ them ] unto you . But I did not say these things unto you from [ the ] beginning , because I was with you .
DARBY	John	16	5	But now I go to him that has sent me , and none of you demands of me , Where goest thou ?
DARBY	John	16	6	But because I have spoken these things to you , sorrow has filled your heart .
DARBY	John	16	7	But I say the truth to you , It is profitable for you that I go away ; for if I do not go away , the Comforter will not come to you ; but if I go I will send him to you .
DARBY	John	16	8	And having come , he will bring demonstration to the world , of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
DARBY	John	16	9	of sin , because they do not believe on me ;
DARBY	John	16	10	of righteousness , because I go away to [ my ] Father , and ye behold me no longer ;
DARBY	John	16	11	of judgment , because the ruler of this world is judged .
DARBY	John	16	12	I have yet many things to say to you , but ye can not bear them now .
DARBY	John	16	13	But when * he * is come , the Spirit of truth , he shall guide you into all the truth : for he shall not speak from himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak ; and he will announce to you what is coming .
DARBY	John	16	14	He shall glorify me , for he shall receive of mine and shall announce [ it ] to you .
DARBY	John	16	15	All things that the Father has are mine ; on account of this I have said that he receives of mine and shall announce [ it ] to you .
DARBY	John	16	17	[ Some ] of his disciples therefore said to one another , What is this he says to us , A little while and ye do not behold me ; and again a little while and ye shall see me , and , Because I go away to the Father ?
DARBY	John	16	18	They said therefore , What is this which he says [ of ] the little while ? We do not know [ of ] what he speaks .
DARBY	John	16	19	Jesus knew therefore that they desired to demand of him , and said to them , Do ye inquire of this among yourselves that I said , A little while and ye do not behold me ; and again a little while and ye shall see me ?
DARBY	John	16	20	Verily , verily , I say to you , that ye shall weep and lament , ye , but the world shall rejoice ; and ye will be grieved , but your grief shall be turned to joy .
DARBY	John	16	21	A woman , when she gives birth to a child , has grief because her hour has come ; but when the child is born , she no longer remembers the trouble , on account of the joy that a man has been born into the world .
DARBY	John	16	22	And ye now therefore have grief ; but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no one takes from you .
DARBY	John	16	23	And in that day ye shall demand nothing of me : verily , verily , I say to you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give you .
DARBY	John	16	24	Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
DARBY	John	16	25	These things I have spoken to you in allegories ; the hour is coming that I will no longer speak to you in allegories , but will declare to you openly concerning the Father .
DARBY	John	16	26	In that day ye shall ask in my name ; and I say not to you that I will demand of the Father for you ,
DARBY	John	16	27	for the Father himself has affection for you , because ye have had affection for me , and have believed that I came out from God .
DARBY	John	16	28	I came out from the Father and have come into the world ; again , I leave the world and go to the Father .
DARBY	John	16	29	His disciples say to him , Lo , now thou speakest openly and utterest no allegory .
DARBY	John	16	30	Now we know that thou knowest all things , and hast not need that any one should demand of thee . By this we believe that thou art come from God .
DARBY	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ?
DARBY	John	16	32	Behold , [ the ] hour is coming , and has come , that ye shall be scattered , each to his own , and shall leave me alone ; and [ yet ] I am not alone , for the Father is with me .
DARBY	John	16	33	These things have I spoken to you that in me ye might have peace . In the world ye have tribulation ; but be of good courage : I have overcome the world .
DARBY	John	17	17	Sanctify them by the truth : thy word is truth .
DARBY	John	17	2	as thou hast given him authority over all flesh , that [ as to ] all that thou hast given to him , he should give them life eternal .
DARBY	John	17	3	And this is the eternal life , that they should know thee , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent .
DARBY	John	17	4	I have glorified * thee * on the earth , I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it ;
DARBY	John	17	5	and now glorify * me * , * thou * Father , along with thyself , with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was .
DARBY	John	17	6	I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world . They were thine , and thou gavest them me , and they have kept thy word .
DARBY	John	17	7	Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee ;
DARBY	John	17	8	for the words which thou hast given me I have given them , and they have received [ them ] , and have known truly that I came out from thee , and have believed that thou sentest me .
DARBY	John	17	9	I demand concerning them ; I do not demand concerning the world , but concerning those whom thou hast given me , for they are thine ,
DARBY	John	17	10	( and all that is mine is thine , and [ all ] that is thine mine , ) and I am glorified in them .
DARBY	John	17	11	And I am no longer in the world , and these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep them in thy name which thou hast given me , that they may be one as we .
DARBY	John	17	12	When I was with them I kept them in thy name ; those thou hast given me I have guarded , and not one of them has perished , but the son of perdition , that the scripture might be fulfilled .
DARBY	John	17	13	And now I come to thee . And these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy fulfilled in them .
DARBY	John	17	14	I have given them thy word , and the world has hated them , because they are not of the world , as I am not of the world .
DARBY	John	17	15	I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them out of evil .
DARBY	John	17	16	They are not of the world , as I am not of the world .
DARBY	John	17	18	As thou hast sent me into the world , I also have sent them into the world ;
DARBY	John	17	19	and I sanctify myself for them , that they also may be sanctified by truth .
DARBY	John	17	20	And I do not demand for these only , but also for those who believe on me through their word ;
DARBY	John	17	21	that they may be all one , as thou , Father , [ art ] in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us , that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
DARBY	John	17	22	And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them , that they may be one , as we are one ;
DARBY	John	17	23	I in them and thou in me , that they may be perfected into one [ and ] that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and [ that ] thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me .
DARBY	John	17	24	Father , [ as to ] those whom thou hast given me , I desire that where I am they also may be with me , that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me , for thou lovedst me before [ the ] foundation of [ the ] world .
DARBY	John	17	25	Righteous Father , —and the world has not known thee , but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
DARBY	John	17	26	And I have made known to them thy name , and will make [ it ] known ; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them .
DARBY	John	18	18	But the bondmen and officers , having made a fire of coals ( for it was cold ) , stood and warmed themselves ; and Peter was standing with them and warming himself .
DARBY	John	18	2	And Judas also , who delivered him up , knew the place , because Jesus was often there , in company with his disciples .
DARBY	John	18	3	Judas therefore , having got the band , and officers of the chief priests and Pharisees , comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons .
DARBY	John	18	4	Jesus therefore , knowing all things that were coming upon him , went forth and said to them , Whom seek ye ?
DARBY	John	18	5	They answered him , Jesus the Nazaraean . Jesus says to them , I am [ he ] . And Judas also , who delivered him up , stood with them .
DARBY	John	18	6	When therefore he said to them , I am [ he ] , they went away backward and fell to the ground .
DARBY	John	18	7	He demanded of them therefore again , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus the Nazaraean .
DARBY	John	18	8	Jesus answered , I told you that I am [ he ] : if therefore ye seek me , let these go away ;
DARBY	John	18	9	that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke , [ As to ] those whom thou hast given me , I have not lost one of them .
DARBY	John	18	10	Simon Peter therefore , having a sword , drew it , and smote the bondman of the high priest and cut off his right ear ; and the bondman 's name was Malchus .
DARBY	John	18	11	Jesus therefore said to Peter , Put the sword into the sheath ; the cup which the Father has given me , shall I not drink it ?
DARBY	John	18	12	The band therefore , and the chiliarch , and the officers of the Jews , took Jesus and bound him :
DARBY	John	18	13	and they led him away to Annas first ; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
DARBY	John	18	14	But it was Caiaphas who counselled the Jews that it was better that one man should perish for the people .
DARBY	John	18	15	Now Simon Peter followed Jesus , and the other disciple . But that disciple was known to the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest ;
DARBY	John	18	16	but Peter stood at the door without . The other disciple therefore , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the porteress and brought in Peter .
DARBY	John	18	17	The maid therefore , who was porteress , says to Peter , Art thou also of the disciples of this man ? He says , I am not .
DARBY	John	18	19	The high priest therefore demanded of Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his doctrine .
DARBY	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , I spoke openly to the world ; I taught always in [ the ] synagogue and in the temple , where all the Jews come together , and in secret I have spoken nothing .
DARBY	John	18	21	Why demandest thou of me ? Demand of those who have heard , what I have spoken to them ; behold , they know what I have said .
DARBY	John	18	22	But as he said these things , one of the officers who stood by gave a blow on the face to Jesus , saying , Answerest thou the high priest thus ?
DARBY	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil ; but if well , why smitest thou me ?
DARBY	John	18	24	Annas [ then ] had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest .
DARBY	John	18	25	But Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . They said therefore to him , Art thou also of his disciples ? He denied , and said , I am not .
DARBY	John	18	26	One of the bondmen of the high priest , who was kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off , says , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
DARBY	John	18	27	Peter denied therefore again , and immediately [ the ] cock crew .
DARBY	John	18	28	They lead therefore Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium ; and it was early morn . And * they * entered not into the praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but eat the passover .
DARBY	John	18	29	Pilate therefore went out to them and said , What accusation do ye bring against this man ?
DARBY	John	18	30	They answered and said to him , If this [ man ] were not an evildoer , we should not have delivered him up to thee .
DARBY	John	18	31	Pilate therefore said to them , Take him , ye , and judge him according to your law . The Jews therefore said to him , It is not permitted to us to put any one to death ;
DARBY	John	18	32	that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke , signifying what death he should die .
DARBY	John	18	33	Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and called Jesus , and said to him , Thou art the king of the Jews ?
DARBY	John	18	34	Jesus answered [ him ] , Dost thou say this of thyself , or have others said it to thee concerning me ?
DARBY	John	18	35	Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee up to me : what hast thou done ?
DARBY	John	18	36	Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world ; if my kingdom were of this world , my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews ; but now my kingdom is not from hence .
DARBY	John	18	37	Pilate therefore said to him , Thou art then a king ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest [ it ] , that I am a king . I have been born for this , and for this I have come into the world , that I might bear witness to the truth . Every one that is of the truth hears my voice .
DARBY	John	18	38	Pilate says to him , What is truth ? And having said this he went out again to the Jews , and says to them , I find no fault whatever in him .
DARBY	John	18	39	But ye have a custom that I release [ some ] one to you at the passover ; will ye therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews ?
DARBY	John	18	40	They cried therefore again all , saying , Not this [ man ] , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber .
DARBY	John	19	19	And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross . But there was written : Jesus the Nazaraean , the King of the Jews .
DARBY	John	19	2	And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head , and put a purple robe on him ,
DARBY	John	19	3	and came to him and said , Hail , king of the Jews ! and gave him blows on the face .
DARBY	John	19	4	And Pilate went out again and says to them , Lo , I bring him out to you , that ye may know that I find in him no fault whatever .
DARBY	John	19	5	( Jesus therefore went forth without , wearing the crown of thorn , and the purple robe . ) And he says to them , Behold the man !
DARBY	John	19	6	When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying , Crucify , crucify [ him ] . Pilate says to them , Take him ye and crucify [ him ] , for I find no fault in him .
DARBY	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , We have a law , and according to [ our ] law he ought to die , because he made himself Son of God .
DARBY	John	19	8	When Pilate therefore heard this word , he was the rather afraid ,
DARBY	John	19	9	and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer .
DARBY	John	19	10	Pilate therefore says to him , Speakest thou not to * me * ? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee ?
DARBY	John	19	11	Jesus answered , Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above . On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [ the ] greater sin .
DARBY	John	19	12	From this time Pilate sought to release him ; but the Jews cried out saying , If thou releasest this [ man ] , thou art not a friend to Caesar . Every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar .
DARBY	John	19	13	Pilate therefore , having heard these words , led Jesus out and sat down upon [ the ] judgment-seat , at a place called Pavement , but in Hebrew Gabbatha ;
DARBY	John	19	14	( now it was [ the ] preparation of the passover ; it was about the sixth hour ; ) and he says to the Jews , Behold your king !
DARBY	John	19	15	But they cried out , Take [ him ] away , take [ him ] away , crucify him . Pilate says to them , Shall I crucify your king ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar .
DARBY	John	19	16	Then therefore he delivered him up to them , that he might be crucified ; and they took Jesus and led him away .
DARBY	John	19	17	And he went out , bearing his cross , to the place called [ place ] of a skull , which is called in Hebrew , Golgotha ;
DARBY	John	19	18	where they crucified him , and with him two others , [ one ] on this side , and [ one ] on that , and Jesus in the middle .
DARBY	John	19	20	This title therefore many of the Jews read , for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was near ; and it was written in Hebrew , Greek , Latin .
DARBY	John	19	21	The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate , Do not write , The king of the Jews , but that * he * said , I am king of the Jews .
DARBY	John	19	22	Pilate answered , What I have written , I have written .
DARBY	John	19	23	The soldiers therefore , when they had crucified Jesus , took his clothes , and made four parts , to each soldier a part , and the body-coat ; but the body-coat was seamless , woven through the whole from the top .
DARBY	John	19	24	They said therefore to one another , Let us not rend it , but let us cast lots for it , whose it shall be ; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says , They parted my garments among themselves , and on my vesture they cast lots . The soldiers therefore did these things .
DARBY	John	19	25	And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother , and the sister of his mother , Mary the [ wife ] of Clopas , and Mary of Magdala .
DARBY	John	19	26	Jesus therefore , seeing his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , says to his mother , Woman , behold thy son .
DARBY	John	19	27	Then he says unto the disciple , Behold thy mother . And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home .
DARBY	John	19	28	After this , Jesus , knowing that all things were now finished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , says , I thirst .
DARBY	John	19	29	There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar , and having filled a sponge with vinegar , and putting hyssop round it , they put it up to his mouth .
DARBY	John	19	30	When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished ; and having bowed his head , he delivered up his spirit .
DARBY	John	19	31	The Jews therefore , that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath , for it was [ the ] preparation , ( for the day of that sabbath was a great [ day ] , ) demanded of Pilate that their legs might be broken and they taken away .
DARBY	John	19	32	The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him ;
DARBY	John	19	33	but coming to Jesus , when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs ,
DARBY	John	19	34	but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and immediately there came out blood and water .
DARBY	John	19	35	And he who saw it bears witness , and his witness is true , and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe .
DARBY	John	19	36	For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled , Not a bone of him shall be broken .
DARBY	John	19	37	And again another scripture says , They shall look on him whom they pierced .
DARBY	John	19	38	And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea , who was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly through fear of the Jews , demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus : and Pilate allowed it . He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus .
DARBY	John	19	39	And Nicodemus also , who at first came to Jesus by night , came , bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds [ weight ] .
DARBY	John	19	40	They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in linen with the spices , as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial .
DARBY	John	19	41	But there was in the place where he had been crucified a garden , and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid .
DARBY	John	19	42	There therefore , on account of the preparation of the Jews , because the tomb was near , they laid Jesus .
DARBY	John	20	20	And having said this , he shewed to them his hands and his side . The disciples rejoiced therefore , having seen the Lord .
DARBY	John	20	2	She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , to whom Jesus was attached , and says to them , They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we know not where they have laid him .
DARBY	John	20	3	Peter therefore went forth , and the other disciple , and came to the tomb .
DARBY	John	20	4	And the two ran together , and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter , and came first to the tomb ,
DARBY	John	20	5	and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying ; he did not however go in .
DARBY	John	20	6	Simon Peter therefore comes , following him , and entered into the tomb , and sees the linen cloths lying ,
DARBY	John	20	7	and the handkerchief which was upon his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but folded up in a distinct place by itself .
DARBY	John	20	8	Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb , and he saw and believed ;
DARBY	John	20	9	for they had not yet known the scripture , that he must rise from among [ the ] dead .
DARBY	John	20	10	The disciples therefore went away again to their own home .
DARBY	John	20	11	But Mary stood at the tomb weeping without . As therefore she wept , she stooped down into the tomb ,
DARBY	John	20	12	and beholds two angels sitting in white [ garments ] , one at the head and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
DARBY	John	20	13	And they say to her , Woman , why dost thou weep ? She says to them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him .
DARBY	John	20	14	Having said these things she turned backward and beholds Jesus standing [ there ] , and knew not that it was Jesus .
DARBY	John	20	15	Jesus says to her , Woman , why dost thou weep ? Whom seekest thou ? She , supposing that it was the gardener , says to him , Sir , if thou hast borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
DARBY	John	20	16	Jesus says to her , Mary . She , turning round , says to him in Hebrew , Rabboni , which means Teacher .
DARBY	John	20	17	Jesus says to her , Touch me not , for I have not yet ascended to my Father ; but go to my brethren and say to them , I ascend to my Father and your Father , and [ to ] my God and your God .
DARBY	John	20	18	Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and [ that ] he had said these things to her .
DARBY	John	20	19	When therefore it was evening on that day , which was the first [ day ] of the week , and the doors shut where the disciples were , through fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and says to them , Peace [ be ] to you .
DARBY	John	20	21	[ Jesus ] said therefore again to them , Peace [ be ] to you : as the Father sent me forth , I also send you .
DARBY	John	20	22	And having said this , he breathed into [ them ] , and says to them , Receive [ the ] Holy Spirit :
DARBY	John	20	23	whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted to them ; whose soever [ sins ] ye retain , they are retained .
DARBY	John	20	24	But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
DARBY	John	20	25	The other disciples therefore said to him , We have seen the Lord . But he said to them , Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails , and put my finger into the mark of the nails , and put my hand into his side , I will not believe .
DARBY	John	20	26	And eight days after , his disciples were again within , and Thomas with them . Jesus comes , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst and said , Peace [ be ] to you .
DARBY	John	20	27	Then he says to Thomas , Bring thy finger here and see my hands ; and bring thy hand and put it into my side ; and be not unbelieving , but believing .
DARBY	John	20	28	Thomas answered and said to him , My Lord and my God .
DARBY	John	20	29	Jesus says to him , Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed : blessed they who have not seen and have believed .
DARBY	John	20	30	Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his disciples , which are not written in this book ;
DARBY	John	20	31	but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing ye might have life in his name .
DARBY	John	21	21	Peter , seeing him , says to Jesus , Lord , and what [ of ] this [ man ] ?
DARBY	John	21	2	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee , and the [ sons ] of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples .
DARBY	John	21	3	Simon Peter says to them , I go to fish . They say to him , We also come with thee . They went forth , and went on board , and that night took nothing .
DARBY	John	21	4	And early morn already breaking , Jesus stood on the shore ; the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus .
DARBY	John	21	5	Jesus therefore says to them , Children , have ye anything to eat ? They answered him , No .
DARBY	John	21	6	And he said to them , Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find . They cast therefore , and they could no longer draw it , from the multitude of fishes .
DARBY	John	21	7	That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter , It is the Lord . Simon Peter therefore , having heard that it was the Lord , girded his overcoat [ on him ] ( for he was naked ) , and cast himself into the sea ;
DARBY	John	21	8	and the other disciples came in the small boat , for they were not far from the land , but somewhere about two hundred cubits , dragging the net of fishes .
DARBY	John	21	9	When therefore they went out on the land , they see a fire of coals there , and fish laid on it , and bread .
DARBY	John	21	10	Jesus says to them , Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken .
DARBY	John	21	11	Simon Peter went up and drew the net to the land full of great fishes , a hundred and fifty-three ; and though there were so many , the net was not rent .
DARBY	John	21	12	Jesus says to them , Come [ and ] dine . But none of the disciples dared inquire of him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord .
DARBY	John	21	13	Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them , and the fish in like manner .
DARBY	John	21	14	This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples , being risen from among [ the ] dead .
DARBY	John	21	15	When therefore they had dined , Jesus says to Simon Peter , Simon , [ son ] of Jonas , lovest thou me more than these ? He says to him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I am attached to thee . He says to him , Feed my lambs .
DARBY	John	21	16	He says to him again a second time , Simon , [ son ] of Jonas , lovest thou me ? He says to him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I am attached to thee . He says to him , Shepherd my sheep .
DARBY	John	21	17	He says to him the third time , Simon , [ son ] of Jonas , art thou attached to me ? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time , Art thou attached to me ? and said to him , Lord , thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that I am attached to thee . Jesus says to him , Feed my sheep .
DARBY	John	21	18	Verily , verily , I say to thee , When thou wast young , thou girdedst thyself , and walkedst where thou desiredst ; but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and bring thee where thou dost not desire .
DARBY	John	21	19	But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God . And having said this , he says to him , Follow me .
DARBY	John	21	20	Peter , turning round , sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following , who also leaned at supper on his breast , and said , Lord , who is it that delivers thee up ?
DARBY	John	21	22	Jesus says to him , If I will that he abide until I come , what [ is that ] to thee ? Follow thou me .
DARBY	John	21	23	This word therefore went out among the brethren , That disciple does not die . And Jesus did not say to him , He does not die ; but , If I will that he abide until I come , what [ is that ] to thee ?
DARBY	John	21	24	This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things , and who has written these things ; and we know that his witness is true .
DARBY	John	21	25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which if they were written one by one , I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written .
DARBY	Romans	1	1	Paul , bondman of Jesus Christ , [ a ] called apostle , separated to God 's glad tidings ,
DARBY	Romans	1	2	( which he had before promised by his prophets in holy writings , )
DARBY	Romans	1	3	concerning his Son ( come of David 's seed according to flesh ,
DARBY	Romans	1	4	marked out Son of God in power , according to [ the ] Spirit of holiness , by resurrection of [ the ] dead ) Jesus Christ our Lord ;
DARBY	Romans	1	5	by whom we have received grace and apostleship in behalf of his name , for obedience of faith among all the nations ,
DARBY	Romans	1	6	among whom are * ye * also [ the ] called of Jesus Christ :
DARBY	Romans	1	7	to all that are in Rome , beloved of God , called saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [ our ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world .
DARBY	Romans	1	9	For God is my witness , whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son , how unceasingly I make mention of you ,
DARBY	Romans	1	10	always beseeching at my prayers , if any way now at least I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you .
DARBY	Romans	1	11	For I greatly desire to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to establish you ;
DARBY	Romans	1	12	that is , to have mutual comfort among you , each by the faith [ which is ] in the other , both yours and mine .
DARBY	Romans	1	13	But I do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , that I often proposed to come to you , ( and have been hindered until the present time , ) that I might have some fruit among you too , even as among the other nations also .
DARBY	Romans	1	14	I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians , both to wise and unintelligent :
DARBY	Romans	1	15	so , as far as depends on me , am I ready to announce the glad tidings to you also who [ are ] in Rome .
DARBY	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the glad tidings ; for it is God 's power to salvation , to every one that believes , both to Jew first and to Greek :
DARBY	Romans	1	17	for righteousness of God is revealed therein , on the principle of faith , to faith : according as it is written , But the just shall live by faith .
DARBY	Romans	1	18	For there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety , and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness .
DARBY	Romans	1	19	Because what is known of God is manifest among them , for God has manifested [ it ] to them ,
DARBY	Romans	1	20	—for from [ the ] world 's creation the invisible things of him are perceived , being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made , both his eternal power and divinity , —so as to render them inexcusable .
DARBY	Romans	1	21	Because , knowing God , they glorified [ him ] not as God , neither were thankful ; but fell into folly in their thoughts , and their heart without understanding was darkened :
DARBY	Romans	1	22	professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
DARBY	Romans	1	23	and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into [ the ] likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles .
DARBY	Romans	1	24	Wherefore God gave them up [ also ] in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness , to dishonour their bodies between themselves :
DARBY	Romans	1	25	who changed the truth of God into falsehood , and honoured and served the creature more than him who had created [ it ] , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
DARBY	Romans	1	26	For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts ; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature ;
DARBY	Romans	1	27	and in like manner the males also , leaving the natural use of the female , were inflamed in their lust towards one another ; males with males working shame , and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit .
DARBY	Romans	1	28	And according as they did not think good to have God in [ their ] knowledge , God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things ;
DARBY	Romans	1	29	being filled with all unrighteousness , wickedness , covetousness , malice ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , evil dispositions ; whisperers ,
DARBY	Romans	1	30	back-biters , hateful to God , insolent , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
DARBY	Romans	1	31	void of understanding , faithless , without natural affection , unmerciful ;
DARBY	Romans	1	32	who knowing the righteous judgment of God , that they who do such things are worthy of death , not only practise them , but have fellow delight in those who do [ them ] .
DARBY	Romans	2	2	But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who do such things .
DARBY	Romans	2	3	And thinkest thou this , O man , who judgest those that do such things , and practisest them [ thyself ] , that * thou * shalt escape the judgment of God ?
DARBY	Romans	2	4	or despisest thou the riches of his goodness , and forbearance , and long-suffering , not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance ?
DARBY	Romans	2	5	but , according to thy hardness and impenitent heart , treasurest up to thyself wrath , in [ the ] day of wrath and revelation of [ the ] righteous judgment of God ,
DARBY	Romans	2	6	who shall render to each according to his works :
DARBY	Romans	2	7	to them who , in patient continuance of good works , seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility , life eternal .
DARBY	Romans	2	8	But to those that are contentious , and are disobedient to the truth , but obey unrighteousness , [ there shall be ] wrath and indignation ,
DARBY	Romans	2	9	tribulation and distress , on every soul of man that works evil , both of Jew first , and of Greek ;
DARBY	Romans	2	10	but glory and honour and peace to every one that works good , both to Jew first and to Greek :
DARBY	Romans	2	11	for there is no acceptance of persons with God .
DARBY	Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law shall perish also without law ; and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law ,
DARBY	Romans	2	13	( for not the hearers of the law [ are ] just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
DARBY	Romans	2	14	For when [ those of the ] nations , which have no law , practise by nature the things of the law , these , having no law , are a law to themselves ;
DARBY	Romans	2	15	who shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts accusing or else excusing themselves between themselves ; )
DARBY	Romans	2	16	in [ the ] day when God shall judge the secrets of men , according to my glad tidings , by Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Romans	2	17	But if * thou * art named a Jew , and restest in the law , and makest thy boast in God ,
DARBY	Romans	2	18	and knowest the will , and discerningly approvest the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the law ;
DARBY	Romans	2	19	and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of the blind , a light of those who [ are ] in darkness ,
DARBY	Romans	2	20	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of babes , having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law :
DARBY	Romans	2	21	thou then that teachest another , dost thou not teach thyself ? thou that preachest not to steal , dost thou steal ?
DARBY	Romans	2	22	thou that sayest [ man should ] not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ?
DARBY	Romans	2	23	thou who boastest in law , dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God ?
DARBY	Romans	2	24	For the name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations , according as it is written .
DARBY	Romans	2	25	For circumcision indeed profits if thou keep [ the ] law ; but if thou be a law-transgressor , thy circumcision is become uncircumcision .
DARBY	Romans	2	26	If therefore the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision ,
DARBY	Romans	2	27	and uncircumcision by nature , fulfilling the law , judge thee , who , with letter and circumcision , [ art ] a law-transgressor ?
DARBY	Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew who [ is ] one outwardly , neither that circumcision which is outward in flesh ;
DARBY	Romans	2	29	but he [ is ] a Jew [ who is so ] inwardly ; and circumcision , of the heart , in spirit , not in letter ; whose praise [ is ] not of men , but of God .
DARBY	Romans	3	3	For what ? if some have not believed , shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect ?
DARBY	Romans	3	2	Much every way : and first , indeed , that to them were entrusted the oracles of God .
DARBY	Romans	3	4	Far be the thought : but let God be true , and every man false ; according as it is written , So that thou shouldest be justified in thy words , and shouldest overcome when thou art in judgment .
DARBY	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commend God 's righteousness , what shall we say ? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath ? I speak according to man .
DARBY	Romans	3	6	Far be the thought : since how shall God judge the world ?
DARBY	Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God , in my lie , has more abounded to his glory , why yet am * I * also judged as a sinner ?
DARBY	Romans	3	8	and not , according as we are injuriously charged , and according as some affirm that we say , Let us practise evil things , that good ones may come ? whose judgment is just .
DARBY	Romans	3	9	What then ? are we better ? No , in no wise : for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin :
DARBY	Romans	3	10	according as it is written , There is not a righteous [ man ] , not even one ;
DARBY	Romans	3	11	there is not the [ man ] that understands , there is not one that seeks after God .
DARBY	Romans	3	12	All have gone out of the way , they have together become unprofitable ; there is not one that practises goodness , there is not so much as one :
DARBY	Romans	3	13	their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have used deceit ; asps ' poison [ is ] under their lips :
DARBY	Romans	3	14	whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness ;
DARBY	Romans	3	15	swift their feet to shed blood ;
DARBY	Romans	3	16	ruin and misery [ are ] in their ways ,
DARBY	Romans	3	17	and way of peace they have not known :
DARBY	Romans	3	18	there is no fear of God before their eyes .
DARBY	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the things the law says , it speaks to those under the law , that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world be under judgment to God .
DARBY	Romans	3	20	Wherefore by works of law no flesh shall be justified before him ; for by law [ is ] knowledge of sin .
DARBY	Romans	3	21	But now without law righteousness of God is manifested , borne witness to by the law and the prophets ;
DARBY	Romans	3	22	righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all , and upon all those who believe : for there is no difference ;
DARBY	Romans	3	23	for all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God ;
DARBY	Romans	3	24	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which [ is ] in Christ Jesus ;
DARBY	Romans	3	25	whom God has set forth a mercy-seat , through faith in his blood , for [ the ] shewing forth of his righteousness , in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before , through the forbearance of God ;
DARBY	Romans	3	26	for [ the ] shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time , so that he should be just , and justify him that is of [ the ] faith of Jesus .
DARBY	Romans	3	27	Where then [ is ] boasting ? It has been excluded . By what law ? of works ? Nay , but by law of faith ;
DARBY	Romans	3	28	for we reckon that a man is justified by faith , without works of law .
DARBY	Romans	3	29	Is [ God ] the God of Jews only ? is he not of [ the ] nations also ? Yea , of nations also :
DARBY	Romans	3	30	since indeed [ it is ] one God who shall justify [ the ] circumcision on the principle of faith , and uncircumcision by faith .
DARBY	Romans	3	31	Do we then make void law by faith ? Far be the thought : [ no , ] but we establish law .
DARBY	Romans	4	4	Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace , but of debt :
DARBY	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham has been justified on the principle of works , he has whereof to boast : but not before God ;
DARBY	Romans	4	3	for what does the scripture say ? And Abraham believed God , and it was reckoned to him as righteousness .
DARBY	Romans	4	5	but to him who does not work , but believes on him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is reckoned as righteousness .
DARBY	Romans	4	6	Even as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works :
DARBY	Romans	4	7	Blessed [ they ] whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven , and whose sins have been covered :
DARBY	Romans	4	8	blessed [ the ] man to whom [ the ] Lord shall not at all reckon sin .
DARBY	Romans	4	9	[ Does ] this blessedness then [ rest ] on the circumcision , or also on the uncircumcision ? For we say that faith has been reckoned to Abraham as righteousness .
DARBY	Romans	4	10	How then has it been reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
DARBY	Romans	4	11	And he received [ the ] sign of circumcision [ as ] seal of the righteousness of faith which [ he had ] being in uncircumcision , that he might be [ the ] father of all them that believe being in uncircumcision , that righteousness might be reckoned to them also ;
DARBY	Romans	4	12	and father of circumcision , not only to those who are of [ the ] circumcision , but to those also who walk in the steps of the faith , during uncircumcision , of our father Abraham .
DARBY	Romans	4	13	For [ it was ] not by law that the promise was to Abraham , or to his seed , that he should be heir of [ the ] world , but by righteousness of faith .
DARBY	Romans	4	14	For if they which [ are ] of law be heirs , faith is made vain , and the promise made of no effect .
DARBY	Romans	4	15	For law works wrath ; but where no law is neither [ is there ] transgression .
DARBY	Romans	4	16	Therefore [ it is ] on the principle of faith , that [ it might be ] according to grace , in order to the promise being sure to all the seed , not to that only which [ is ] of the law , but to that also which [ is ] of Abraham 's faith , who is father of us all ,
DARBY	Romans	4	17	( according as it is written , I have made thee father of many nations , ) before the God whom he believed , who quickens the dead , and calls the things which be not as being ;
DARBY	Romans	4	18	who against hope believed in hope to his becoming father of many nations , according to that which was spoken , So shall thy seed be :
DARBY	Romans	4	19	and not being weak in faith , he considered not his own body already become dead , being about a hundred years old , and the deadening of Sarah 's womb ,
DARBY	Romans	4	20	and hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief ; but found strength in faith , giving glory to God ;
DARBY	Romans	4	21	and being fully persuaded that what he has promised he is able also to do ;
DARBY	Romans	4	22	wherefore also it was reckoned to him as righteousness .
DARBY	Romans	4	23	Now it was not written on his account alone that it was reckoned to him ,
DARBY	Romans	4	24	but on ours also , to whom , believing on him who has raised from among [ the ] dead Jesus our Lord ,
DARBY	Romans	4	25	who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification , it will be reckoned .
DARBY	Romans	5	5	and hope does not make ashamed , because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by [ the ] Holy Spirit which has been given to us :
DARBY	Romans	5	2	by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand , and we boast in hope of the glory of God .
DARBY	Romans	5	3	And not only [ that ] , but we also boast in tribulations , knowing that tribulation works endurance ;
DARBY	Romans	5	4	and endurance , experience ; and experience , hope ;
DARBY	Romans	5	6	for we being still without strength , in [ the ] due time Christ has died for [ the ] ungodly .
DARBY	Romans	5	7	For scarcely for [ the ] just [ man ] will one die , for perhaps for [ the ] good [ man ] some one might also dare to die ;
DARBY	Romans	5	8	but God commends * his * love to us , in that , we being still sinners , Christ has died for us .
DARBY	Romans	5	9	Much rather therefore , having been now justified in [ the power of ] his blood , we shall be saved by him from wrath .
DARBY	Romans	5	10	For if , being enemies , we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much rather , having been reconciled , we shall be saved in [ the power of ] his life .
DARBY	Romans	5	11	And not only [ that ] , but [ we are ] making our boast in God , through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom now we have received the reconciliation .
DARBY	Romans	5	12	For this [ cause ] , even as by one man sin entered into the world , and by sin death ; and thus death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned :
DARBY	Romans	5	13	( for until law sin was in [ the ] world ; but sin is not put to account when there is no law ;
DARBY	Romans	5	14	but death reigned from Adam until Moses , even upon those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam 's transgression , who is [ the ] figure of him to come .
DARBY	Romans	5	15	But [ shall ] not the act of favour [ be ] as the offence ? For if by the offence of one the many have died , much rather has the grace of God , and the free gift in grace , which [ is ] by the one man Jesus Christ , abounded unto the many .
DARBY	Romans	5	16	And [ shall ] not as by one that has sinned [ be ] the gift ? For the judgment [ was ] of one to condemnation , but the act of favour , of many offences unto justification .
DARBY	Romans	5	17	For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one , much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace , and of the free gift of righteousness , reign in life by the one Jesus Christ : )
DARBY	Romans	5	18	so then as [ it was ] by one offence towards all men to condemnation , so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life .
DARBY	Romans	5	19	For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners , so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous .
DARBY	Romans	5	20	But law came in , in order that the offence might abound ; but where sin abounded grace has overabounded ,
DARBY	Romans	5	21	in order that , even as sin has reigned in [ the power of ] death , so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
DARBY	Romans	6	6	knowing this , that our old man has been crucified with [ him ] , that the body of sin might be annulled , that we should no longer serve sin .
DARBY	Romans	6	2	Far be the thought . We who have died to sin , how shall we still live in it ?
DARBY	Romans	6	3	Are you ignorant that we , as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus , have been baptised unto his death ?
DARBY	Romans	6	4	We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death , in order that , even as Christ has been raised up from among [ the ] dead by the glory of the Father , so * we * also should walk in newness of life .
DARBY	Romans	6	5	For if we are become identified with [ him ] in the likeness of his death , so also we shall be of [ his ] resurrection ;
DARBY	Romans	6	7	For he that has died is justified from sin .
DARBY	Romans	6	8	Now if we have died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him ,
DARBY	Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ having been raised up from among [ the ] dead dies no more : death has dominion over him no more .
DARBY	Romans	6	10	For in that he has died , he has died to sin once for all ; but in that he lives , he lives to God .
DARBY	Romans	6	11	So also * ye * , reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus .
DARBY	Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to obey its lusts .
DARBY	Romans	6	13	Neither yield your members instruments of unrighteousness to sin , but yield yourselves to God as alive from among [ the ] dead , and your members instruments of righteousness to God .
DARBY	Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over * you * , for ye are not under law but under grace .
DARBY	Romans	6	15	What then ? should we sin because we are not under law but under grace ? Far be the thought .
DARBY	Romans	6	16	Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves bondmen for obedience , ye are bondmen to him whom ye obey , whether of sin unto death , or of obedience unto righteousness ?
DARBY	Romans	6	17	But thanks [ be ] to God , that ye were bondmen of sin , but have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed .
DARBY	Romans	6	18	Now , having got your freedom from sin , ye have become bondmen to righteousness .
DARBY	Romans	6	19	I speak humanly on account of the weakness of your flesh . For even as ye have yielded your members in bondage to uncleanness and to lawlessness unto lawlessness , so now yield your members in bondage to righteousness unto holiness .
DARBY	Romans	6	20	For when ye were bondmen of sin ye were free from righteousness .
DARBY	Romans	6	21	What fruit therefore had ye * then * in the things of which ye are * now * ashamed ? for the end of * them * [ is ] death .
DARBY	Romans	6	22	But * now * , having got your freedom from sin , and having become bondmen to God , ye have your fruit unto holiness , and the end eternal life .
DARBY	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin [ is ] death ; but the act of favour of God , eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
DARBY	Romans	7	7	What shall we say then ? [ is ] the law sin ? Far be the thought . But I had not known sin , unless by law : for I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said , Thou shalt not lust ;
DARBY	Romans	7	2	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband so long as he is alive ; but if the husband should die , she is clear from the law of the husband :
DARBY	Romans	7	3	so then , the husband being alive , she shall be called an adulteress if she be to another man ; but if the husband should die , she is free from the law , so as not to be an adulteress , though she be to another man .
DARBY	Romans	7	4	So that , my brethren , * ye * also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ , to be to another , who has been raised up from among [ the ] dead , in order that we might bear fruit to God .
DARBY	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins , which [ were ] by the law , wrought in our members to bring forth fruit to death ;
DARBY	Romans	7	6	but now we are clear from the law , having died in that in which we were held , so that we should serve in newness of spirit , and not in oldness of letter .
DARBY	Romans	7	8	but sin , getting a point of attack by the commandment , wrought in me every lust ; for without law sin [ was ] dead .
DARBY	Romans	7	9	But * I * was alive without law once ; but the commandment having come , sin revived , but * I * died .
DARBY	Romans	7	10	And the commandment , which [ was ] for life , was found , [ as ] to me , itself [ to be ] unto death :
DARBY	Romans	7	11	for sin , getting a point of attack by the commandment , deceived me , and by it slew [ me ] .
DARBY	Romans	7	12	So that the law indeed [ is ] holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good .
DARBY	Romans	7	13	Did then that which is good become death to me ? Far be the thought . But sin , that it might appear sin , working death to me by that which is good ; in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
DARBY	Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual : but * I * am fleshly , sold under sin .
DARBY	Romans	7	15	For that which I do , I do not own : for not what I will , this I do ; but what I hate , this I practise .
DARBY	Romans	7	16	But if what I do not will , this I practise , I consent to the law that [ it is ] right .
DARBY	Romans	7	17	Now then [ it is ] no longer * I * [ that ] do it , but the sin that dwells in me .
DARBY	Romans	7	18	For I know that in me , that is , in my flesh , good does not dwell : for to will is there with me , but to do right [ I find ] not .
DARBY	Romans	7	19	For I do not practise the good that I will ; but the evil I do not will , that I do .
DARBY	Romans	7	20	But if what * I * do not will , this I practise , [ it is ] no longer * I * [ that ] do it , but the sin that dwells in me .
DARBY	Romans	7	21	I find then the law upon * me * who will to practise what is right , that with * me * evil is there .
DARBY	Romans	7	22	For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man :
DARBY	Romans	7	23	but I see another law in my members , warring in opposition to the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which exists in my members .
DARBY	Romans	7	24	O wretched man that I [ am ] ! who shall deliver me out of this body of death ?
DARBY	Romans	7	25	I thank God , through Jesus Christ our Lord . So then * I * * myself * with the mind serve God 's law ; but with the flesh sin 's law .
DARBY	Romans	8	8	and they that are in flesh can not please God .
DARBY	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death .
DARBY	Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God , having sent his own Son , in likeness of flesh of sin , and for sin , has condemned sin in the flesh ,
DARBY	Romans	8	4	in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us , who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit .
DARBY	Romans	8	5	For they that are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh ; and they that are according to Spirit , the things of the Spirit .
DARBY	Romans	8	6	For the mind of the flesh [ is ] death ; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace .
DARBY	Romans	8	7	Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God ; for neither indeed can it be :
DARBY	Romans	8	9	But * ye * are not in flesh but in Spirit , if indeed God 's Spirit dwell in you ; but if any one has not [ the ] Spirit of Christ * he * is not of him :
DARBY	Romans	8	10	but if Christ be in you , the body is dead on account of sin , but the Spirit life on account of righteousness .
DARBY	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [ the ] dead dwell in you , he that has raised up Christ from among [ the ] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you .
DARBY	Romans	8	12	So then , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live according to flesh ;
DARBY	Romans	8	13	for if ye live according to flesh , ye are about to die ; but if , by the Spirit , ye put to death the deeds of the body , ye shall live :
DARBY	Romans	8	14	for as many as are led by [ the ] Spirit of God , * these * are sons of God .
DARBY	Romans	8	15	For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear , but ye have received a spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , Abba , Father .
DARBY	Romans	8	16	The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit , that we are children of God .
DARBY	Romans	8	17	And if children , heirs also : heirs of God , and Christ 's joint heirs ; if indeed we suffer with [ him ] , that we may also be glorified with [ him ] .
DARBY	Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [ to be compared ] with the coming glory to be revealed to us .
DARBY	Romans	8	19	For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God :
DARBY	Romans	8	20	for the creature has been made subject to vanity , not of its will , but by reason of him who has subjected [ the same ] , in hope
DARBY	Romans	8	21	that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God .
DARBY	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now .
DARBY	Romans	8	23	And not only [ that ] , but even * we * ourselves , who have the first-fruits of the Spirit , we also ourselves groan in ourselves , awaiting adoption , [ that is ] the redemption of our body .
DARBY	Romans	8	24	For we have been saved in hope ; but hope seen is not hope ; for what any one sees , why does he also hope ?
DARBY	Romans	8	25	But if what we see not we hope , we expect in patience .
DARBY	Romans	8	26	And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness ; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting , but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which can not be uttered .
DARBY	Romans	8	27	But he who searches the hearts knows what [ is ] the mind of the Spirit , because he intercedes for saints according to God .
DARBY	Romans	8	28	But we * do * know that all things work together for good to those who love God , to those who are called according to purpose .
DARBY	Romans	8	29	Because whom he has foreknown , he has also predestinated [ to be ] conformed to the image of his Son , so that he should be [ the ] firstborn among many brethren .
DARBY	Romans	8	30	But whom he has predestinated , these also he has called ; and whom he has called , these also he has justified ; but whom he has justified , these also he has glorified .
DARBY	Romans	8	31	What shall we then say to these things ? If God [ be ] for us , who against us ?
DARBY	Romans	8	32	He who , yea , has not spared his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not also with him grant us all things ?
DARBY	Romans	8	33	Who shall bring an accusation against God 's elect ? [ It is ] God who justifies :
DARBY	Romans	8	34	who is he that condemns ? [ It is ] Christ who has died , but rather has been [ also ] raised up ; who is also at the right hand of God ; who also intercedes for us .
DARBY	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? tribulation or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
DARBY	Romans	8	36	According as it is written , For thy sake we are put to death all the day long ; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter .
DARBY	Romans	8	37	But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us .
DARBY	Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor things present , nor things to come , nor powers ,
DARBY	Romans	8	39	nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which [ is ] in Christ Jesus our Lord .
DARBY	Romans	9	9	For this word [ is ] of promise , According to this time I will come , and there shall be a son to Sarah .
DARBY	Romans	9	2	that I have great grief and uninterrupted pain in my heart ,
DARBY	Romans	9	3	for I have wished , I myself , to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren , my kinsmen , according to flesh ;
DARBY	Romans	9	4	who are Israelites ; whose [ is ] the adoption , and the glory , and the covenants , and the law-giving , and the service , and the promises ;
DARBY	Romans	9	5	whose [ are ] the fathers ; and of whom , as according to flesh , [ is ] the Christ , who is over all , God blessed for ever . Amen .
DARBY	Romans	9	6	Not however as though the word of God had failed ; for not all [ are ] Israel which [ are ] of Israel ;
DARBY	Romans	9	7	nor because they are seed of Abraham [ are ] all children : but , In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee .
DARBY	Romans	9	8	That is , [ they that are ] the children of the flesh , these [ are ] not the children of God ; but the children of the promise are reckoned as seed .
DARBY	Romans	9	10	And not only [ that ] , but Rebecca having conceived by one , Isaac our father ,
DARBY	Romans	9	11	[ the children ] indeed being not yet born , or having done anything good or worthless ( that the purpose of God according to election might abide , not of works , but of him that calls ) ,
DARBY	Romans	9	12	it was said to her , The greater shall serve the less :
DARBY	Romans	9	13	according as it is written , I have loved Jacob , and I have hated Esau .
DARBY	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then ? [ Is there ] unrighteousness with God ? Far be the thought .
DARBY	Romans	9	15	For he says to Moses , I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy , and I will feel compassion for whom I will feel compassion .
DARBY	Romans	9	16	So then [ it is ] not of him that wills , nor of him that runs , but of God that shews mercy .
DARBY	Romans	9	17	For the scripture says to Pharaoh , For this very thing I have raised thee up from amongst [ men ] , that I might thus shew in thee my power , and so that my name should be declared in all the earth .
DARBY	Romans	9	18	So then , to whom he will he shews mercy , and whom he will he hardens .
DARBY	Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say to me then , Why does he yet find fault ? for who resists his purpose ?
DARBY	Romans	9	20	Aye , but thou , O man , who art * thou * that answerest again to God ? Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
DARBY	Romans	9	21	Or has not the potter authority over the clay , out of the same lump to make one vessel to honour , and another to dishonour ?
DARBY	Romans	9	22	And if God , minded to shew his wrath and to make his power known , endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction ;
DARBY	Romans	9	23	and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy , which he had before prepared for glory ,
DARBY	Romans	9	24	us , whom he has also called , not only from amongst [ the ] Jews , but also from amongst [ the ] nations ?
DARBY	Romans	9	25	As he says also in Hosea , I will call not-my-people My people ; and the-not-beloved Beloved .
DARBY	Romans	9	26	And it shall be , in the place where it was said to them , * Ye * [ are ] not my people , there shall they be called Sons of [ the ] living God .
DARBY	Romans	9	27	But Esaias cries concerning Israel , Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , the remnant shall be saved :
DARBY	Romans	9	28	for [ he ] is bringing the matter to an end , and [ cutting [ it ] short in righteousness ; because ] a cutting short of the matter will [ the ] Lord accomplish upon the earth .
DARBY	Romans	9	29	And according as Esaias said before , Unless [ the ] Lord of hosts had left us a seed , we had been as Sodom , and made like even as Gomorrha .
DARBY	Romans	9	30	What then shall we say ? That [ they of the ] nations , who did not follow after righteousness , have attained righteousness , but [ the ] righteousness that is on the principle of faith .
DARBY	Romans	9	31	But Israel , pursuing after a law of righteousness , has not attained to [ that ] law .
DARBY	Romans	9	32	Wherefore ? Because [ it was ] not on the principle of faith , but as of works . They have stumbled at the stumblingstone ,
DARBY	Romans	9	33	according as it is written , Behold , I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence : and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed .
DARBY	Romans	10	10	For with [ the ] heart is believed to righteousness ; and with [ the ] mouth confession made to salvation .
DARBY	Romans	10	2	For I bear them witness that they have zeal for God , but not according to knowledge .
DARBY	Romans	10	3	For they , being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and seeking to establish their own [ righteousness ] , have not submitted to the righteousness of God .
DARBY	Romans	10	4	For Christ is [ the ] end of law for righteousness to every one that believes .
DARBY	Romans	10	5	For Moses lays down in writing the righteousness which is of the law , The man who has practised those things shall live by them .
DARBY	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness of faith speaks thus : Do not say in thine heart , Who shall ascend to the heavens ? that is , to bring Christ down ;
DARBY	Romans	10	7	or , Who shall descend into the abyss ? that is , to bring up Christ from among [ the ] dead .
DARBY	Romans	10	8	But what says it ? The word is near thee , in thy mouth and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach :
DARBY	Romans	10	9	that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord , and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among [ the ] dead , thou shalt be saved .
DARBY	Romans	10	11	For the scripture says , No one believing on him shall be ashamed .
DARBY	Romans	10	12	For there is no difference of Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord of all [ is ] rich towards all that call upon him .
DARBY	Romans	10	13	For every one whosoever , who shall call on the name of the Lord , shall be saved .
DARBY	Romans	10	14	How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without one who preaches ?
DARBY	Romans	10	15	and how shall they preach unless they have been sent ? according as it is written , How beautiful the feet of them that announce glad tidings of peace , of them that announce glad tidings of good things !
DARBY	Romans	10	16	But they have not all obeyed the glad tidings . For Esaias says , Lord , who has believed our report ?
DARBY	Romans	10	17	So faith then [ is ] by a report , but the report by God 's word .
DARBY	Romans	10	18	But I say , Have they not heard ? Yea , surely , Their voice has gone out into all the earth , and their words to the extremities of the habitable world .
DARBY	Romans	10	19	But I say , Has not Israel known ? First , Moses says , * I * will provoke you to jealousy through [ them that are ] not a nation : through a nation without understanding I will anger you .
DARBY	Romans	10	20	But Esaias is very bold , and says , I have been found by those not seeking me ; I have become manifest to those not inquiring after me .
DARBY	Romans	10	21	But unto Israel he says , All the day long I have stretched out my hands unto a people disobeying and opposing .
DARBY	Romans	11	11	I say then , Have they stumbled in order that they might fall ? Far be the thought : but by their fall [ there is ] salvation to the nations to provoke them to jealousy .
DARBY	Romans	11	2	God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew . Know ye not what the scripture says in [ the history of ] Elias , how he pleads with God against Israel ?
DARBY	Romans	11	3	Lord , they have killed thy prophets , they have dug down thine altars ; and * I * have been left alone , and they seek my life .
DARBY	Romans	11	4	But what says the divine answer to him ? I have left to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed knee to Baal .
DARBY	Romans	11	5	Thus , then , in the present time also there has been a remnant according to election of grace .
DARBY	Romans	11	6	But if by grace , no longer of works : since [ otherwise ] grace is no more grace .
DARBY	Romans	11	7	What [ is it ] then ? What Israel seeks for , that he has not obtained ; but the election has obtained , and the rest have been blinded ,
DARBY	Romans	11	8	according as it is written , God has given to them a spirit of slumber , eyes not to see , and ears not to hear , unto this day .
DARBY	Romans	11	9	And David says , Let their table be for a snare , and for a gin , and for a fall-trap , and for a recompense to them :
DARBY	Romans	11	10	let their eyes be darkened not to see , and bow down their back alway .
DARBY	Romans	11	12	But if their fall [ be the ] world 's wealth , and their loss [ the ] wealth of [ the ] nations , how much rather their fulness ?
DARBY	Romans	11	13	For I speak to you , the nations , inasmuch as * I * am apostle of nations , I glorify my ministry ;
DARBY	Romans	11	14	if by any means I shall provoke to jealousy [ them which are ] my flesh , and shall save some from among them .
DARBY	Romans	11	15	For if their casting away [ be the ] world 's reconciliation , what [ their ] reception but life from among [ the ] dead ?
DARBY	Romans	11	16	Now if the first-fruit [ be ] holy , the lump also ; and if the root [ be ] holy , the branches also .
DARBY	Romans	11	17	Now if some of the branches have been broken out , and * thou * , being a wild olive tree , hast been grafted in amongst them , and hast become a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree ,
DARBY	Romans	11	18	boast not against the branches ; but if thou boast , [ it is ] not * thou * bearest the root , but the root thee .
DARBY	Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then , The branches have been broken out in order that * I * might be grafted in .
DARBY	Romans	11	20	Right : they have been broken out through unbelief , and * thou * standest through faith . Be not high-minded , but fear :
DARBY	Romans	11	21	if God indeed has not spared the natural branches ; lest it might be he spare not thee either .
DARBY	Romans	11	22	Behold then [ the ] goodness and severity of God : upon them who have fallen , severity ; upon thee goodness of God , if thou shalt abide in goodness , since [ otherwise ] * thou * also wilt be cut away .
DARBY	Romans	11	23	And * they * too , if they abide not in unbelief , shall be grafted in ; for God is able again to graft them in .
DARBY	Romans	11	24	For if * thou * hast been cut out of the olive tree wild by nature , and , contrary to nature , hast been grafted into the good olive tree , how much rather shall they , who are according to nature be grafted into their own olive tree ?
DARBY	Romans	11	25	For I do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , of this mystery , that ye may not be wise in your own conceits , that blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the nations be come in ;
DARBY	Romans	11	26	and so all Israel shall be saved . According as it is written , The deliverer shall come out of Zion ; he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
DARBY	Romans	11	27	And this is the covenant from me to them , when I shall have taken away their sins .
DARBY	Romans	11	28	As regards the glad tidings , [ they are ] enemies on your account ; but as regards election , beloved on account of the fathers .
DARBY	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God [ are ] not subject to repentance .
DARBY	Romans	11	30	For as indeed * ye * [ also ] once have not believed in God , but now have been objects of mercy through the unbelief of * these * ;
DARBY	Romans	11	31	so these also have now not believed in your mercy , in order that * they * also may be objects of mercy .
DARBY	Romans	11	32	For God hath shut up together all in unbelief , in order that he might shew mercy to all .
DARBY	Romans	11	33	O depth of riches both of [ the ] wisdom and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable his judgments , and untraceable his ways !
DARBY	Romans	11	34	For who has known [ the ] mind of [ the ] Lord , or who has been his counsellor ?
DARBY	Romans	11	35	or who has first given to him , and it shall be rendered to him ?
DARBY	Romans	11	36	For of him , and through him , and for him [ are ] all things : to him be glory for ever . Amen .
DARBY	Romans	12	12	As regards hope , rejoicing : as regards tribulation , enduring : as regards prayer , persevering :
DARBY	Romans	12	2	And be not conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of [ your ] mind , that ye may prove what [ is ] the good and acceptable and perfect will of God .
DARBY	Romans	12	3	For I say , through the grace which has been given to me , to every one that is among you , not to have high thoughts above what he should think ; but to think so as to be wise , as God has dealt to each a measure of faith .
DARBY	Romans	12	4	For , as in one body we have many members , but all the members have not the same office ;
DARBY	Romans	12	5	thus we , [ being ] many , are one body in Christ , and each one members one of the other .
DARBY	Romans	12	6	But having different gifts , according to the grace which has been given to us , whether [ it be ] prophecy , [ let us prophesy ] according to the proportion of faith ;
DARBY	Romans	12	7	or service , [ let us occupy ourselves ] in service ; or he that teaches , in teaching ;
DARBY	Romans	12	8	or he that exhorts , in exhortation ; he that gives , in simplicity ; he that leads , with diligence ; he that shews mercy , with cheerfulness .
DARBY	Romans	12	9	Let love be unfeigned ; abhorring evil ; cleaving to good :
DARBY	Romans	12	10	as to brotherly love , kindly affectioned towards one another : as to honour , each taking the lead in paying it to the other :
DARBY	Romans	12	11	as to diligent zealousness , not slothful ; in spirit fervent ; serving the Lord .
DARBY	Romans	12	13	distributing to the necessities of the saints ; given to hospitality .
DARBY	Romans	12	14	Bless them that persecute you ; bless , and curse not .
DARBY	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those that rejoice , weep with those that weep .
DARBY	Romans	12	16	Have the same respect one for another , not minding high things , but going along with the lowly : be not wise in your own eyes :
DARBY	Romans	12	17	recompensing to no one evil for evil : providing things honest before all men :
DARBY	Romans	12	18	if possible , as far as depends on you , living in peace with all men ;
DARBY	Romans	12	19	not avenging yourselves , beloved , but give place to wrath ; for it is written , Vengeance [ belongs ] to me , * I * will recompense , saith the Lord .
DARBY	Romans	12	20	If therefore thine enemy should hunger , feed him ; if he should thirst , give him drink ; for , so doing , thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head .
DARBY	Romans	12	21	Be not overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
DARBY	Romans	13	13	As in the day , let us walk becomingly ; not in rioting and drunkenness , not in chambering and lasciviousness , not in strife and emulation .
DARBY	Romans	13	2	So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God ; and they who [ thus ] resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves .
DARBY	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to a good work , but to an evil [ one ] . Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority ? practise [ what is ] good , and thou shalt have praise from it ;
DARBY	Romans	13	4	for it is God 's minister to thee for good . But if thou practisest evil , fear ; for it bears not the sword in vain ; for it is God 's minister , an avenger for wrath to him that does evil .
DARBY	Romans	13	5	Wherefore it is necessary to be subject , not only on account of wrath , but also on account of conscience .
DARBY	Romans	13	6	For on this account ye pay tribute also ; for they are God 's officers , attending continually on this very thing .
DARBY	Romans	13	7	Render to all their dues : to whom tribute [ is due ] , tribute ; to whom custom , custom ; to whom fear , fear ; to whom honour , honour .
DARBY	Romans	13	8	Owe no one anything , unless to love one another : for he that loves another has fulfilled the law .
DARBY	Romans	13	9	For , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not lust ; and if there be any other commandment , it is summed up in this word , namely , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
DARBY	Romans	13	10	Love works no ill to its neighbour ; love therefore [ is the ] whole law .
DARBY	Romans	13	11	This also , knowing the time , that it is already time that * we * should be aroused out of sleep ; for now [ is ] our salvation nearer than when we believed .
DARBY	Romans	13	12	The night is far spent , and the day is near ; let us cast away therefore the works of darkness , and let us put on the armour of light .
DARBY	Romans	13	14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and do not take forethought for the flesh to [ fulfil its ] lusts .
DARBY	Romans	14	14	I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean of itself ; except to him who reckons anything to be unclean , to that man [ it is ] unclean .
DARBY	Romans	14	2	One man is assured that he may eat all things ; but the weak eats herbs .
DARBY	Romans	14	3	Let not him that eats make little of him that eats not ; and let not him that eats not judge him that eats : for God has received him .
DARBY	Romans	14	4	Who art * thou * that judgest the servant of another ? to his own master he stands or falls . And he shall be made to stand ; for the Lord is able to make him stand .
DARBY	Romans	14	5	One man esteems day more than day ; another esteems every day [ alike ] . Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind .
DARBY	Romans	14	6	He that regards the day , regards it to [ the ] Lord . And he that eats , eats to [ the ] Lord , for he gives God thanks ; and he that does not eat , [ it is ] to [ the ] Lord he does not eat , and gives God thanks .
DARBY	Romans	14	7	For none of us lives to himself , and none dies to himself .
DARBY	Romans	14	8	For both if we should live , [ it is ] to the Lord we live ; and if we should die , [ it is ] to the Lord we die : both if we should live then , and if we should die , we are the Lord 's .
DARBY	Romans	14	9	For to this [ end ] Christ has died and lived [ again ] , that he might rule over both dead and living .
DARBY	Romans	14	10	But thou , why judgest thou thy brother ? or again , thou , why dost thou make little of thy brother ? for we shall all be placed before the judgment-seat of God .
DARBY	Romans	14	11	For it is written , * I * live , saith [ the ] Lord , that to me shall bow every knee , and every tongue shall confess to God .
DARBY	Romans	14	12	So then each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God .
DARBY	Romans	14	13	Let us no longer therefore judge one another ; but judge ye this rather , not to put a stumbling-block or a fall-trap before his brother .
DARBY	Romans	14	15	For if on account of meat thy brother is grieved , thou walkest no longer according to love . Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ has died .
DARBY	Romans	14	16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of ;
DARBY	Romans	14	17	for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness , and peace , and joy in [ the ] Holy Spirit .
DARBY	Romans	14	18	For he that in this serves the Christ [ is ] acceptable to God and approved of men .
DARBY	Romans	14	19	So then let us pursue the things which tend to peace , and things whereby one shall build up another .
DARBY	Romans	14	20	For the sake of meat do not destroy the work of God . All things indeed [ are ] pure ; but [ it is ] evil to that man who eats while stumbling [ in doing so ] .
DARBY	Romans	14	21	[ It is ] right not to eat meat , nor drink wine , nor [ do anything ] in which thy brother stumbles , or is offended , or is weak .
DARBY	Romans	14	22	Hast * thou * faith ? have [ it ] to thyself before God . Blessed [ is ] he who does not judge himself in what he allows .
DARBY	Romans	14	23	But he that doubts , if he eat , is condemned ; because [ it is ] not of faith ; but whatever [ is ] not of faith is sin .
DARBY	Romans	15	15	But I have written to you the more boldly , [ brethren , ] in part , as putting you in mind , because of the grace given to me by God ,
DARBY	Romans	15	2	Let each one of us please his neighbour with a view to what is good , to edification .
DARBY	Romans	15	3	For the Christ also did not please himself ; but according as it is written , The reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me .
DARBY	Romans	15	4	For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction , that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope .
DARBY	Romans	15	5	Now the God of endurance and of encouragement give to you to be like-minded one toward another , according to Christ Jesus ;
DARBY	Romans	15	6	that ye may with one accord , with one mouth , glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Romans	15	7	Wherefore receive ye one another , according as the Christ also has received you to [ the ] glory of God .
DARBY	Romans	15	8	For I say that Jesus Christ became a minister of [ the ] circumcision for [ the ] truth of God , to confirm the promises of the fathers ;
DARBY	Romans	15	9	and that the nations should glorify God for mercy ; according as it is written , For this cause I will confess to thee among [ the ] nations , and will sing to thy name .
DARBY	Romans	15	10	And again he says , Rejoice , nations , with his people .
DARBY	Romans	15	11	And again , Praise the Lord , all [ ye ] nations , and let all the peoples laud him .
DARBY	Romans	15	12	And again , Esaias says , There shall be the root of Jesse , and one that arises , to rule over [ the ] nations : in him shall [ the ] nations hope .
DARBY	Romans	15	13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , so that ye should abound in hope by [ the ] power of [ the ] Holy Spirit .
DARBY	Romans	15	14	But I am persuaded , my brethren , I myself also , concerning you , that yourselves also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
DARBY	Romans	15	16	for me to be minister of Christ Jesus to the nations , carrying on as a sacrificial service the [ message of ] glad tidings of God , in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable , sanctified by [ the ] Holy Spirit .
DARBY	Romans	15	17	I have therefore [ whereof to ] boast in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God .
DARBY	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me , for [ the ] obedience of [ the ] nations , by word and deed ,
DARBY	Romans	15	19	in [ the ] power of signs and wonders , in [ the ] power of [ the ] Spirit of God ; so that I , from Jerusalem , and in a circuit round to Illyricum , have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ ;
DARBY	Romans	15	20	and so aiming to announce the glad tidings , not where Christ has been named , that I might not build upon another 's foundation ;
DARBY	Romans	15	21	but according as it is written , To whom there was nothing told concerning him , they shall see ; and they that have not heard shall understand .
DARBY	Romans	15	22	Wherefore also I have been often hindered from coming to you .
DARBY	Romans	15	23	But now , having no longer place in these regions , and having great desire to come to you these many years ,
DARBY	Romans	15	24	whenever I should go to Spain ; ( for I hope to see you as I go through , and by you to be set forward thither , if first I shall have been in part filled with your company ; )
DARBY	Romans	15	25	but now I go to Jerusalem , ministering to the saints ;
DARBY	Romans	15	26	for Macedonia and Achaia have been well pleased to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who [ are ] in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Romans	15	27	They have been well pleased indeed , and they are their debtors ; for if the nations have participated in their spiritual things , they ought also in fleshly to minister to them .
DARBY	Romans	15	28	Having finished this therefore , and having sealed to them this fruit , I will set off by you into Spain .
DARBY	Romans	15	29	But I know that , coming to you , I shall come in [ the ] fulness of [ the ] blessing of Christ .
DARBY	Romans	15	30	But I beseech you , brethren , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in prayers for me to God ;
DARBY	Romans	15	31	that I may be saved from those that do not believe in Judaea ; and that my ministry which [ I have ] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ;
DARBY	Romans	15	32	in order that I may come to you in joy by God 's will , and that I may be refreshed with you .
DARBY	Romans	15	33	And the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
DARBY	Romans	16	16	Salute one another with a holy kiss . All the assemblies of Christ salute you .
DARBY	Romans	16	2	that ye may receive her in [ the ] Lord worthily of saints , and that ye may assist her in whatever matter she has need of you ; for * she * also has been a helper of many , and of myself .
DARBY	Romans	16	3	Salute Prisca and Aquila , my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus ,
DARBY	Romans	16	4	( who for my life staked their own neck ; to whom not * I * only am thankful , but also all the assemblies of the nations , )
DARBY	Romans	16	5	and the assembly at their house . Salute Epaenetus , my beloved , who is [ the ] first-fruits of Asia for Christ .
DARBY	Romans	16	6	Salute Maria , who laboured much for you .
DARBY	Romans	16	7	Salute Andronicus and Junias , my kinsmen and fellow-captives , who are of note among the apostles ; who were also in Christ before me .
DARBY	Romans	16	8	Salute Amplias , my beloved in the Lord .
DARBY	Romans	16	9	Salute Urbanus , our fellow-workman in Christ , and Stachys , my beloved .
DARBY	Romans	16	10	Salute Apelles , approved in Christ . Salute those who belong to Aristobulus .
DARBY	Romans	16	11	Salute Herodion , my kinsman . Salute those who belong to Narcissus , who are in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Romans	16	12	Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who labour in [ the ] Lord . Salute Persis , the beloved , who has laboured much in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Romans	16	13	Salute Rufus , chosen in [ the ] Lord ; and his mother and mine .
DARBY	Romans	16	14	Salute Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brethren with them .
DARBY	Romans	16	15	Salute Philologus , and Julia , Nereus , and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints with them .
DARBY	Romans	16	17	But I beseech you , brethren , to consider those who create divisions and occasions of falling , contrary to the doctrine which * ye * have learnt , and turn away from them .
DARBY	Romans	16	18	For such serve not our Lord Christ , but their own belly , and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting .
DARBY	Romans	16	19	For your obedience has reached to all . I rejoice therefore as it regards you ; but I wish you to be wise [ as ] to that which is good , and simple [ as ] to evil .
DARBY	Romans	16	20	But the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with you .
DARBY	Romans	16	21	Timotheus , my fellow-workman , and Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my kinsmen , salute you .
DARBY	Romans	16	22	I Tertius , who have written this epistle , salute you in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Romans	16	23	Gaius , my host and of the whole assembly , salutes you . Erastus , the steward of the city , salutes you , and the brother Quartus .
DARBY	Romans	16	24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with you all . Amen .
DARBY	Romans	16	25	Now to him that is able to establish you , according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to [ the ] revelation of [ the ] mystery , as to which silence has been kept in [ the ] times of the ages ,
DARBY	Romans	16	26	but [ which ] has now been made manifest , and by prophetic scriptures , according to commandment of the eternal God , made known for obedience of faith to all the nations—
DARBY	Romans	16	27	[ the ] only wise God , through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory for ever . Amen .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , [ a ] called apostle of Jesus Christ , by God 's will , and Sosthenes the brother ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	2	to the assembly of God which is in Corinth , to [ those ] sanctified in Christ Jesus , called saints , with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , both theirs and ours :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always about you , in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	5	that in everything ye have been enriched in him , in all word [ of doctrine ] , and all knowledge ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	6	( according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you , )
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that ye come short in no gift , awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	8	who shall also confirm you to [ the ] end , unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God [ is ] faithful , by whom ye have been called into [ the ] fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I exhort you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all say the same thing , and that there be not among you divisions ; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it has been shewn to me concerning you , my brethren , by those of [ the house of ] Chloe , that there are strifes among you .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	12	But I speak of this , that each of you says , * I * am of Paul , and * I * of Apollos , and * I * of Cephas , and * I * of Christ .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Is the Christ divided ? has Paul been crucified for you ? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I have baptised none of you , unless Crispus and Gaius ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	15	that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	16	Yes , I baptised also the house of Stephanas ; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ has not sent me to baptise , but to preach glad tidings ; not in wisdom of word , that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness , but to us that are saved it is God 's power .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written , I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where [ is the ] wise ? where scribe ? where disputer of this world ? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since , in the wisdom of God , the world by wisdom has not known God , God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	22	Since Jews indeed ask for signs , and Greeks seek wisdom ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but * we * preach Christ crucified , to Jews an offence , and to nations foolishness ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but to those that [ are ] called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ God 's power and God 's wisdom .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For consider your calling , brethren , that [ there are ] not many wise according to flesh , not many powerful , not many high-born .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God has chosen the foolish things of the world , that he may put to shame the wise ; and God has chosen the weak things of the world , that he may put to shame the strong things ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	28	and the ignoble things of the world , and the despised , has God chosen , [ and ] things that are not , that he may annul the things that are ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	29	so that no flesh should boast before God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But of him are * ye * in Christ Jesus , who has been made to us wisdom from God , and righteousness , and holiness , and redemption ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	1	31	that according as it is written , He that boasts , let him boast in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I did not judge [ it well ] to know anything among you save Jesus Christ , and * him * crucified .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And * I * was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	4	and my word and my preaching , not in persuasive words of wisdom , but in demonstration of [ the ] Spirit and of power ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	5	that your faith might not stand in men 's wisdom , but in God 's power .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	6	But we speak wisdom among the perfect ; but wisdom not of this world , nor of the rulers of this world , who come to nought .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	7	But we speak God 's wisdom in [ a ] mystery , that hidden [ wisdom ] which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	8	which none of the princes of this age knew , ( for had they known , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory ; )
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	9	but according as it is written , Things which eye has not seen , and ear not heard , and which have not come into man 's heart , which God has prepared for them that love him ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	10	but God has revealed to us by [ his ] Spirit ; for the Spirit searches all things , even the depths of God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For who of men hath known the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him ? thus also the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	12	But * we * have received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which [ is ] of God , that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	13	which also we speak , not in words taught by human wisdom , but in those taught by the Spirit , communicating spiritual [ things ] by spiritual [ means ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But [ the ] natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God , for they are folly to him ; and he can not know [ them ] because they are spiritually discerned ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	15	but the spiritual discerns all things , and * he * is discerned of no one .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For who has known the mind of [ the ] Lord , who shall instruct him ? But * we * have the mind of Christ .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for ye are yet carnal . For whereas [ there are ] among you emulation and strife , are ye not carnal , and walk according to man ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I have given you milk to drink , not meat , for ye have not yet been able , nor indeed are ye yet able ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when one says , * I * am of Paul , and another , * I * of Apollos , are ye not men ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Apollos , and who Paul ? Ministering servants , through whom ye have believed , and as the Lord has given to each .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	6	* I * have planted ; Apollos watered ; but God has given the increase .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So that neither the planter is anything , nor the waterer ; but God the giver of the increase .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	8	But the planter and the waterer are one ; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are God 's fellow-workmen ; ye are God 's husbandry , God 's building .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which has been given to me , as a wise architect , I have laid the foundation , but another builds upon it . But let each see how he builds upon it .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [ is ] laid , which is Jesus Christ .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if any one build upon [ this ] foundation , gold , silver , precious stones , wood , grass , straw ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	13	the work of each shall be made manifest ; for the day shall declare [ it ] , because it is revealed in fire ; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If the work of any one which he has built upon [ the foundation ] shall abide , he shall receive a reward .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If the work of any one shall be consumed , he shall suffer loss , but * he * shall be saved , but so as through [ the ] fire .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Do ye not know that ye are [ the ] temple of God , and [ that ] the Spirit of God dwells in you ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If any one corrupt the temple of God , * him * shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , and such are * ye * .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no one deceive himself : if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world , let him become foolish , that he may be wise .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God ; for it is written , He who takes the wise in their craftiness .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	20	And again , [ The ] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So that let no one boast in men ; for all things are yours .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	22	Whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or [ the ] world , or life , or death , or things present , or things coming , all are yours ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	3	23	and * ye * [ are ] Christ 's , and Christ [ is ] God 's .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	4	For I am conscious of nothing in myself ; but I am not justified by this : but he that examines me is the Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Here , further , it is sought in stewards , that a man be found faithful .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man 's day . Nor do I even examine myself .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So that do not judge anything before [ the ] time , until the Lord shall come , who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts ; and then shall each have [ his ] praise from God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now these things , brethren , I have transferred , in their application , to myself and Apollos , for your sakes , that ye may learn in us the [ lesson of ] not [ letting your thoughts go ] above what is written , that ye may not be puffed up one for [ such a ] one against another .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who makes thee to differ ? and what hast thou which thou hast not received ? but if also thou hast received , why boastest thou as not receiving ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	8	Already ye are filled ; already ye have been enriched ; ye have reigned without us ; and I would that ye reigned , that * we * also might reign with you .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last , as appointed to death . For we have become a spectacle to the world , both to angels and men .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	10	* We * [ are ] fools for Christ 's sake , but * ye * prudent in Christ : * we * weak , but * ye * strong : * ye * glorious , but * we * in dishonour .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	11	To the present hour we both hunger and thirst , and are in nakedness , and buffeted , and wander without a home ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	12	and labour , working with our own hands . Railed at , we bless ; persecuted , we suffer [ it ] ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	13	insulted , we entreat : we are become as [ the ] offscouring of the world , [ the ] refuse of all , until now .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	14	Not [ as ] chiding do I write these things to you , but as my beloved children I admonish [ you ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet not many fathers ; for in Christ Jesus * I * have begotten you through the glad tidings .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	16	I entreat you therefore , be my imitators .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus , who is my beloved and faithful child in [ the ] Lord , who shall put you in mind of my ways [ as ] they [ are ] in Christ , according as I teach everywhere in every assembly .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	18	But some have been puffed up , as if I were not coming to you ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	19	but I will come quickly to you , if the Lord will ; and I will know , not the word of those that are puffed up , but the power .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God [ is ] not in word , but in power .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	4	21	What will ye ? that I come to you with a rod ; or in love , and [ in ] a spirit of meekness ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	5	to deliver him , [ I say , ] [ being ] such , to Satan for destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And * ye * are puffed up , and ye have not rather mourned , in order that he that has done this deed might be taken away out of the midst of you .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	3	For * I * , [ as ] absent in body but present in spirit , have already judged as present ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	4	[ to deliver , ] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ( ye and my spirit being gathered together , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ) , him that has so wrought this :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting [ is ] not good . Do ye not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Purge out the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , according as ye are unleavened . For also our passover , Christ , has been sacrificed ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	8	so that let us celebrate the feast , not with old leaven , nor with leaven of malice and wickedness , but with unleavened [ bread ] of sincerity and truth .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I have written to you in the epistle not to mix with fornicators ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	10	not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the avaricious and rapacious , or idolaters , since [ then ] ye should go out of the world .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written to you , if any one called brother be fornicator , or avaricious , or idolater , or abusive , or a drunkard , or rapacious , not to mix with [ him ] ; with such a one not even to eat .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what have * I * [ to do ] with judging those outside also ? * ye * , do not ye judge them that are within ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	5	13	But those without God judges . Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But brother prosecutes his suit with brother , and that before unbelievers .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Do ye not then know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world is judged by you , are ye unworthy of [ the ] smallest judgments ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Do ye not know that we shall judge angels ? and not then matters of this life ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	4	If then ye have judgments as to things of this life , set those [ to judge ] who are little esteemed in the assembly .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I speak to you [ to put you ] to shame . Thus there is not a wise person among you , not even one , who shall be able to decide between his brethren !
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Already indeed then it is altogether a fault in you that ye have suits between yourselves . Why do ye not rather suffer wrong ? why are ye not rather defrauded ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	8	But * ye * do wrong , and defraud , and this [ your ] brethren .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Do ye not know that unrighteous [ persons ] shall not inherit [ the ] kingdom of God ? Do not err : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor those who make women of themselves , nor who abuse themselves with men ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor abusive persons , nor [ the ] rapacious , shall inherit [ the ] kingdom of God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And these things were some of you ; but ye have been washed , but ye have been sanctified , but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful to me , but all things do not profit ; all things are lawful to me , but * I * will not be brought under the power of any .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	13	Meats for the belly , and the belly for meats ; but God will bring to nothing both it and them : but the body [ is ] not for fornication , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	14	And God has both raised up the Lord , and will raise us up from among [ the dead ] by his power .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Shall I then , taking the members of the Christ , make [ them ] members of a harlot ? Far be the thought .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Do ye not know that he [ that is ] joined to the harlot is one body ? for the two , he says , shall be one flesh .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But he that [ is ] joined to the Lord is one Spirit .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Flee fornication . Every sin which a man may practise is without the body , but he that commits fornication sins against his own body .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Do ye not know that your body is [ the ] temple of the Holy Spirit which [ is ] in you , which ye have of God ; and ye are not your own ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	6	20	for ye have been bought with a price : glorify now then God in your body .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	7	Now I wish all men to be even as myself : but every one has his own gift of God : one man thus , and another thus .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	2	but on account of fornications , let each have his own wife , and each [ woman ] have her own husband .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render her due to the wife , and in like manner the wife to the husband .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife has not authority over her own body , but the husband : in like manner also the husband has not authority over his own body , but the wife .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Defraud not one another , unless , it may be , by consent for a time , that ye may devote yourselves to prayer , and again be together , that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But this I say , as consenting [ to ] , not as commanding [ it ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows , It is good for them that they remain even as I .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they have not control over themselves , let them marry ; for it is better to marry than to burn .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	10	But to the married I enjoin , not * I * , but the Lord , Let not wife be separated from husband ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	11	( but if also she shall have been separated , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband ; ) and let not husband leave wife .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	12	But as to the rest , * I * say , not the Lord , If any brother have an unbelieving wife , and * she * consent to dwell with him , let him not leave her .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And a woman who has an unbelieving husband , and he consents to dwell with her , let her not leave [ her ] husband .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother ; since [ otherwise ] indeed your children are unclean , but now they are holy .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbeliever go away , let them go away ; a brother or a sister is not bound in such [ cases ] , but God has called us in peace .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For what knowest thou , O wife , if thou shalt save thy husband ? or what knowest thou , O husband , if thou shalt save thy wife ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	17	However , as the Lord has divided to each , as God has called each , so let him walk ; and thus I ordain in all the assemblies .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Has any one been called circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised : has any one been called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing ; but keeping God 's commandments .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Let each abide in that calling in which he has been called .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Hast thou been called [ being ] a bondman , let it not concern thee ; but and if thou canst become free , use [ it ] rather .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For the bondman that is called in [ the ] Lord is the Lord 's freedman ; in like manner [ also ] the freeman being called is Christ 's bondman .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	23	Ye have been bought with a price ; do not be the bondmen of men .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Let each , wherein he is called , brethren , therein abide with God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	25	But concerning virgins , I have no commandment of [ the ] Lord ; but I give my opinion , as having received mercy of [ the ] Lord to be faithful .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think then that this is good , on account of the present necessity , that [ it is ] good for a man to remain so as he is .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound to a wife ? seek not to be loosed ; art thou free from a wife ? do not seek a wife .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if thou shouldest also marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if the virgin marry , they have not sinned : but such shall have tribulation in the flesh ; but I spare you .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But this I say , brethren , the time is straitened . For the rest , that they who have wives , be as not having [ any ] :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and they that weep , as not weeping ; and they that rejoice , as not rejoicing ; and they that buy , as not possessing ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and they that use the world , as not disposing of it as their own ; for the fashion of this world passes .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I wish you to be without care . The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord , how he shall please the Lord ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	33	but he that has married cares for the things of the world , how he shall please his wife .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	34	There is a difference between the wife and the virgin . The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and spirit ; but she that has married cares for the things of the world , how she shall please her husband .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	35	But I say this for your own profit ; not that I may set a snare before you , but for what [ is ] seemly , and waiting on the Lord without distraction .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any one think that he behaves unseemly to his virginity , if he be beyond the flower of his age , and so it must be , let him do what he will , he does not sin : let them marry .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But he who stands firm in his heart , having no need , but has authority over his own will , and has judged this in his heart to keep his own virginity , he does well .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So that he that marries himself does well ; and he that does not marry does better .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound for whatever time her husband lives ; but if the husband be fallen asleep , she is free to be married to whom she will , only in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she so remain , according to my judgment ; but I think that * I * also have God 's Spirit .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But meat does not commend us to God ; neither if we should not eat do we come short ; nor if we should eat have we an advantage .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	2	If any one think he knows anything , he knows nothing yet as he ought to know [ it ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if any one love God , * he * is known of him ) :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	4	—concerning then the eating of things sacrificed to idols , we know that an idol [ is ] nothing in [ the ] world , and that there [ is ] no other God save one .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For and if indeed there are [ those ] called gods , whether in heaven or on earth , ( as there are gods many , and lords many , )
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet to us [ there is ] one God , the Father , of whom all things , and * we * for him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , by whom [ are ] all things , and * we * by him .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But knowledge [ is ] not in all : but some , with conscience of the idol , until now eat as of a thing sacrificed to idols ; and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But see lest anywise this your right [ to eat ] itself be a stumbling-block to the weak .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if any one see thee , who hast knowledge , sitting at table in an idol-house , shall not his conscience , he being weak , be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to the idol ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	11	and the weak [ one ] , the brother for whose sake Christ died , will perish through thy knowledge .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	12	Now , thus sinning against the brethren , and wounding their weak conscience , ye sin against Christ .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Wherefore if meat be a fall-trap to my brother , I will eat no flesh for ever , that I may not be a fall-trap to my brother .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	9	For in the law of Moses it is written , Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that is treading out corn . Is God occupied about the oxen ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If I am not an apostle to others , yet at any rate I am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are * ye * in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	3	My defence to those who examine me is this :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Have we not a right to eat and to drink ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	5	have we not a right to take round a sister [ as ] wife , as also the other apostles , and the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or * I * alone and Barnabas , have we not a right not to work ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who ever carries on war at his own charges ? who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit ? or who herds a flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Do I speak these things as a man , or does not the law also say these things ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	10	or does he say [ it ] altogether for our sakes ? For for our sakes it has been written , that the plougher should plough in hope , and he that treads out corn , in hope of partaking of [ it ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown to you spiritual things , [ is it a ] great [ thing ] if * we * shall reap your carnal things ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others partake of this right over you , should not rather * we * ? But we have not used this right , but we bear all things , that we may put no hindrance in the way of the glad tidings of the Christ .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Do ye not know that they who labour [ at ] sacred things eat of the [ offerings offered in the ] temple ; they that attend at the altar partake with the altar ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	14	So also the Lord has ordained to those that announce the glad tidings to live of the glad tidings .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But * I * have used none of these things . Now I have not written these things that it should be thus in my case ; for [ it were ] good for me rather to die than that any one should make vain my boast .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For if I announce the glad tidings , I have nothing to boast of ; for a necessity is laid upon me ; for it is woe to me if I should not announce the glad tidings .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this voluntarily , I have a reward ; but if not of my own will , I am entrusted with an administration .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What is the reward then that I have ? That in announcing the glad tidings I make the glad tidings costless [ to others ] , so as not to have made use , as belonging to me , of my right in [ announcing ] the glad tidings .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For being free from all , I have made myself bondman to all , that I might gain the most [ possible ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	20	And I became to the Jews as a Jew , in order that I might gain the Jews : to those under law , as under law , not being myself under law , in order that I might gain those under law :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	21	to those without law , as without law , ( not as without law to God , but as legitimately subject to Christ , ) in order that I might gain [ those ] without law .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	22	I became to the weak , [ as ] weak , in order that I might gain the weak . To all I have become all things , in order that at all events I might save some .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	23	And I do all things for the sake of the glad tidings , that I may be fellow-partaker with them .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Know ye not that they who run in [ the ] race-course run all , but one receives the prize ? Thus run in order that ye may obtain .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	25	But every one that contends [ for a prize ] is temperate in all things : * they * then indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown , but * we * an incorruptible .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	26	* I * therefore thus run , as not uncertainly ; so I combat , as not beating the air .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	9	27	But I buffet my body , and lead it captive , lest [ after ] having preached to others I should be myself rejected .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	10	Neither murmur ye , as some of them murmured , and perished by the destroyer .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	2	and all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	3	and all ate the same spiritual food ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same spiritual drink , for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed [ them ] : ( now the rock was the Christ ; )
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	5	yet God was not pleased with the most of them , for they were strewed in the desert .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	6	But these things happened [ as ] types of us , that we should not be lusters after evil things , as they also lusted .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Neither be ye idolaters , as some of them ; as it is written , The people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed fornication , and fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt the Christ , as some of them tempted , and perished by serpents .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened to them [ as ] types , and have been written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the ages are come .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	12	So that let him that thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has taken you but such as is according to man 's nature ; and God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able [ to bear ] , but will with the temptation make the issue also , so that [ ye ] should be able to bear [ it ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore , my beloved , flee from idolatry .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to intelligent [ persons ] : do * ye * judge what I say .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not [ the ] communion of the blood of the Christ ? The bread which we break , is it not [ the ] communion of the body of the Christ ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	17	Because we , [ being ] many , are one loaf , one body ; for we all partake of that one loaf .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	18	See Israel according to flesh : are not they who eat the sacrifices in communion with the altar ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What then do I say ? that what is sacrificed to an idol is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	20	But that what [ the nations ] sacrifice they sacrifice to demons , and not to God . Now I do not wish you to be in communion with demons .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	21	Ye can not drink [ the ] Lord 's cup , and [ the ] cup of demons : ye can not partake of [ the ] Lord 's table , and of [ the ] table of demons .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? are we stronger than he ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful , but all are not profitable ; all things are lawful , but all do not edify .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no one seek his own [ advantage ] , but that of the other .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Everything sold in the shambles eat , making no inquiry for conscience sake .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	26	For the earth [ is ] the Lord 's and its fulness .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	27	But if any one of the unbelievers invite you , and ye are minded to go , all that is set before you eat , making no inquiry for conscience sake .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if any one say to you , This is offered to holy purposes , do not eat , for his sake that pointed it out , and conscience sake ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	29	but conscience , I mean , not thine own , but that of the other : for why is my liberty judged by another conscience ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If * I * partake with thanksgiving , why am I spoken evil of for what * I * give thanks for ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore ye eat , or drink , or whatever ye do , do all things to God 's glory .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Give no occasion to stumbling , whether to Jews , or Greeks , or the assembly of God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	10	33	Even as * I * also please all in all things ; not seeking my own profit , but that of the many , that they may be saved .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	11	However , neither [ is ] woman without man , nor man without woman , in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you , that in all things ye are mindful of me ; and that as I have directed you , ye keep the directions .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man , but woman 's head [ is ] the man , and the Christ 's head God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying , having [ anything ] on his head , puts his head to shame .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered puts her own head to shame ; for it is one and the same as a shaved [ woman ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman be not covered , let her hair also be cut off . But if [ it be ] shameful to a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved , let her be covered .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For man indeed ought not to have his head covered , being God 's image and glory ; but woman is man 's glory .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For man is not of woman , but woman of man .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	9	For also man was not created for the sake of the woman , but woman for the sake of the man .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	10	Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head , on account of the angels .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman [ is ] of the man , so also [ is ] the man by the woman , but all things of God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Judge in yourselves : is it comely that a woman should pray to God uncovered ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Does not even nature itself teach you , that man , if he have long hair , it is a dishonour to him ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But woman , if she have long hair , [ it is ] glory to her ; for the long hair is given [ to her ] in lieu of a veil .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if any one think to be contentious , * we * have no such custom , nor the assemblies of God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	17	But [ in ] prescribing [ to you on ] this [ which I now enter on ] , I do not praise , [ namely , ] that ye come together , not for the better , but for the worse .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For first , when ye come together in assembly , I hear there exist divisions among you , and I partly give credit [ to it ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For there must also be sects among you , that the approved may become manifest among you .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When ye come therefore together into one place , it is not to eat [ the ] Lord 's supper .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For each one in eating takes his * own * supper before [ others ] , and one is hungry and another drinks to excess .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	22	Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking ? or do ye despise the assembly of God , and put to shame them who have not ? What shall I say to you ? shall I praise you ? In this [ point ] I do not praise .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For * I * received from the Lord , that which I also delivered to you , that the Lord Jesus , in the night in which he was delivered up , took bread ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and having given thanks broke [ it ] , and said , This is my body , which [ is ] for you : this do in remembrance of me .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In like manner also the cup , after having supped , saying , This cup is the new covenant in my blood : this do , as often as ye shall drink [ it ] , in remembrance of me .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as ye shall eat this bread , and drink the cup , ye announce the death of the Lord , until he come .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	27	So that whosoever shall eat the bread , or drink the cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But let a man prove himself , and thus eat of the bread , and drink of the cup .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For [ the ] eater and drinker eats and drinks judgment to himself , not distinguishing the body .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	30	On this account many among you [ are ] weak and infirm , and a good many are fallen asleep .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we judged ourselves , so were we not judged .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But being judged , we are disciplined of [ the ] Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So that , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , wait for one another .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If any one be hungry , let him eat at home , that ye may not come together for judgment . But the other things , whenever I come , I will set in order .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For even as the body is one and has many members , but all the members of the body , being many , are one body , so also [ is ] the Christ .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	2	Ye know that when ye were [ of the ] nations [ ye were ] led away to dumb idols , in whatever way ye might be led .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	3	I give you therefore to know , that no one , speaking in [ the power of the ] Spirit of God , says , Curse [ on ] Jesus ; and no one can say , Lord Jesus , unless in [ the power of the ] Holy Spirit .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	4	But there are distinctions of gifts , but the same Spirit ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	5	and there are distinctions of services , and the same Lord ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	6	and there are distinctions of operations , but the same God who operates all things in all .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	8	For to one , by the Spirit , is given [ the ] word of wisdom ; and to another [ the ] word of knowledge , according to the same Spirit ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	9	and to a different one faith , in [ the power of ] the same Spirit ; and to another gifts of healing in [ the power of ] the same Spirit ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	10	and to another operations of miracles ; and to another prophecy ; and to another discerning of spirits ; and to a different one kinds of tongues ; and to another interpretation of tongues .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit , dividing to each in particular according as he pleases .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For also in [ the power of ] one Spirit * we * have all been baptised into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether bondmen or free , and have all been given to drink of one Spirit .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For also the body is not one member but many .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot say , Because I am not a hand I am not of the body , is it on account of this not indeed of the body ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear say , Because I am not an eye I am not of the body , is it on account of this not indeed of the body ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body [ were ] an eye , where the hearing ? if all hearing , where the smelling ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now God has set the members , each one of them in the body , according as it has pleased [ him ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	19	But if all were one member , where the body ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now the members [ are ] many , and the body one .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	21	The eye can not say to the hand , I have not need of thee ; or again , the head to the feet , I have not need of you .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	22	But much rather , the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and those [ parts ] of the body which we esteem to be the more void of honour , these we clothe with more abundant honour ; and our uncomely [ parts ] have more abundant comeliness ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	24	but our comely [ parts ] have not need . But God has tempered the body together , having given more abundant honour to [ the part ] that lacked ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	25	that there might be no division in the body , but that the members might have the same concern one for another .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffer , all the members suffer with [ it ] ; and if one member be glorified , all the members rejoice with [ it ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now * ye * are Christ 's body , and members in particular .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And God has set certain in the assembly : first , apostles ; secondly , prophets ; thirdly , teachers ; then miraculous powers ; then gifts of healings ; helps ; governments ; kinds of tongues .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	29	[ Are ] all apostles ? [ are ] all prophets ? [ are ] all teachers ? [ are ] all [ in possession of ] miraculous powers ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	30	have all gifts of healings ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But desire earnestly the greater gifts , and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	13	And now abide faith , hope , love ; these three things ; and the greater of these [ is ] love .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And if I have prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	3	And if I shall dole out all my goods in food , and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned , but have not love , I profit nothing .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love has long patience , is kind ; love is not emulous [ of others ] ; love is not insolent and rash , is not puffed up ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	5	does not behave in an unseemly manner , does not seek what is its own , is not quickly provoked , does not impute evil ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	6	does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	7	bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails ; but whether prophecies , they shall be done away ; or tongues , they shall cease ; or knowledge , it shall be done away .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part , and we prophesy in part :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	10	but when that which is perfect has come , that which is in part shall be done away .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I reasoned as a child ; when I became a man , I had done with what belonged to the child .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For we see now through a dim window obscurely , but then face to face ; now I know partially , but then I shall know according as I also have been known .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray with a tongue , my spirit prays , but my understanding is unfruitful .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaks with a tongue does not speak to men but to God : for no one hears ; but in spirit he speaks mysteries .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesies speaks to men [ in ] edification , and encouragement , and consolation .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	4	He that speaks with a tongue edifies himself ; but he that prophesies edifies [ the ] assembly .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	5	Now I desire that ye should all speak with tongues , but rather that ye should prophesy . But greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues , unless he interpret , that the assembly may receive edification .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	6	And now , brethren , if I come to you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , unless I shall speak to you either in revelation , or in knowledge , or in prophecy , or in teaching ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Even lifeless things giving a sound , whether pipe or harp , if they give not distinction to the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For also , if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself for war ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	9	Thus also * ye * with the tongue , unless ye give a distinct speech , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye will be speaking to the air .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of undistinguishable sound .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	11	If therefore I do not know the power of the sound , I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian , and he that speaks a barbarian for me .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	12	Thus * ye * also , since ye are desirous of spirits , seek that ye may abound for the edification of the assembly .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Wherefore let him that speaks with a tongue pray that he may interpret .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , but I will pray also with the understanding ; I will sing with the spirit , but I will sing also with the understanding .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Since otherwise , if thou blessest with [ the ] spirit , how shall he who fills the place of the simple [ Christian ] say Amen , at thy giving of thanks , since he does not know what thou sayest ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For * thou * indeed givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God I speak in a tongue more than all of you :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	19	but in [ the ] assembly I desire to speak five words with my understanding , that I may instruct others also , [ rather ] than ten thousand words in a tongue .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brethren , be not children in [ your ] minds , but in malice be babes ; but in [ your ] minds be grown [ men ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	21	It is written in the law , By people of other tongues , and by strange lips , will I speak to this people ; and neither thus will they hear me , saith the Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	22	So that tongues are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to unbelievers ; but prophecy , not to unbelievers , but to those who believe .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place , and all speak with tongues , and simple [ persons ] enter in , or unbelievers , will not they say ye are mad ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy , and some unbeliever or simple [ person ] come in , he is convicted of all , he is judged of all ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	25	the secrets of his heart are manifested ; and thus , falling upon [ his ] face , he will do homage to God , reporting that God is indeed amongst you .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	26	What is it then , brethren ? whenever ye come together , each [ of you ] has a psalm , has a teaching , has a tongue , has a revelation , has an interpretation . Let all things be done to edification .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If any one speak with a tongue , [ let it be ] two , or at the most three , and separately , and let one interpret ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	28	but if there be no interpreter , let him be silent in [ the ] assembly , and let him speak to himself and to God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	29	And let two or three prophets speak , and let the others judge .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	30	But if there be a revelation to another sitting [ there ] , let the first be silent .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For ye can all prophesy one by one , that all may learn and all be encouraged .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	32	And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For God is not [ a God ] of disorder but of peace , as in all the assemblies of the saints .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	34	Let [ your ] women be silent in the assemblies , for it is not permitted to them to speak ; but to be in subjection , as the law also says .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	35	But if they wish to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home ; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in assembly .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Did the word of God go out from you , or did it come to you only ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual , let him recognise the things that I write to you , that it is [ the ] Lord 's commandment .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But if any be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	39	So that , brethren , desire to prophesy , and do not forbid the speaking with tongues .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	14	40	But let all things be done comelily and with order .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	15	And we are found also false witnesses of God ; for we have witnessed concerning God that he raised the Christ , whom he has not raised if indeed [ those that are ] dead are not raised .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	2	by which also ye are saved , ( if ye hold fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings , ) unless indeed ye have believed in vain .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered to you , in the first place , what also I had received , that Christ died for our sins , according to the scriptures ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	4	and that he was buried ; and that he was raised the third day , according to the scriptures ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	6	Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once , of whom the most remain until now , but some also have fallen asleep .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Then he appeared to James ; then to all the apostles ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	8	and last of all , as to an abortion , he appeared to * me * also .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For * I * am the least of the apostles , who am not fit to be called apostle , because I have persecuted the assembly of God .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by God 's grace I am what I am ; and his grace , which [ was ] towards me , has not been vain ; but I have laboured more abundantly than they all , but not * I * , but the grace of God which [ was ] with me .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Whether , therefore , I or they , thus we preach , and thus ye have believed .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached that he is raised from among [ the ] dead , how say some among you that there is not a resurrection of [ those that are ] dead ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there is not a resurrection of [ those that are ] dead , neither is Christ raised :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	14	but if Christ is not raised , then , indeed , vain also [ is ] our preaching , and vain also your faith .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if [ those that are ] dead are not raised , neither is Christ raised ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	17	but if Christ be not raised , your faith [ is ] vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then indeed also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are [ the ] most miserable of all men .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	20	( But now Christ is raised from among [ the ] dead , first-fruits of those fallen asleep .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since by man [ came ] death , by man also resurrection of [ those that are ] dead .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For as in the Adam all die , thus also in the Christ all shall be made alive .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own rank : [ the ] first-fruits , Christ ; then those that are the Christ 's at his coming .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then the end , when he gives up the kingdom to him [ who is ] God and Father ; when he shall have annulled all rule and all authority and power .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	26	[ The ] last enemy [ that ] is annulled [ is ] death .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For he has put all things in subjection under his feet . But when he says that all things are put in subjection , [ it is ] evident that [ it is ] except him who put all things in subjection to him .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	28	But when all things shall have been brought into subjection to him , then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him , that God may be all in all . )
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Since what shall the baptised for the dead do if [ those that are ] dead rise not at all ? why also are they baptised for them ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	30	Why do * we * also endanger ourselves every hour ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	31	Daily I die , by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If , [ to speak ] after the manner of man , I have fought with beasts in Ephesus , what is the profit to me if [ those that are ] dead do not rise ? let us eat and drink ; for to-morrow we die .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Be not deceived : evil communications corrupt good manners .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Awake up righteously , and sin not ; for some are ignorant of God : I speak to you as a matter of shame .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But some one will say , How are the dead raised ? and with what body do they come ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Fool ; what * thou * sowest is not quickened unless it die .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And what thou sowest , thou sowest not the body that shall be , but a bare grain : it may be of wheat , or some one of the rest :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	38	and God gives to it a body as he has pleased , and to each of the seeds its own body .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	39	Every flesh [ is ] not the same flesh , but one [ is ] of men , and another flesh of beasts , and another [ flesh ] of birds , and another of fishes .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	40	And [ there are ] heavenly bodies , and earthly bodies : but different is the glory of the heavenly , different that of the earthly :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	41	one [ the ] sun 's glory , and another [ the ] moon 's glory , and another [ the ] stars ' glory ; for star differs from star in glory .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	42	Thus also [ is ] the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption , it is raised in incorruptibility .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonour , it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness , it is raised in power .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body : if there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual [ one ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	45	Thus also it is written , The first man Adam became a living soul ; the last Adam a quickening spirit .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	46	But that which is spiritual [ was ] not first , but that which is natural , then that which is spiritual :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	47	the first man out of [ the ] earth , made of dust ; the second man , out of heaven .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	48	Such as he made of dust , such also those made of dust ; and such as the heavenly [ one ] , such also the heavenly [ ones ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And as we have borne the image of the [ one ] made of dust , we shall bear also the image of the heavenly [ one ] .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	50	But this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood can not inherit God 's kingdom , nor does corruption inherit incorruptibility .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I tell you a mystery : We shall not all fall asleep , but we shall all be changed ,
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in an instant , in [ the ] twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet ; for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and * we * shall be changed .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility , and this mortal put on immortality .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	54	But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruptibility , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall come to pass the word written : Death has been swallowed up in victory .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	55	Where , O death , [ is ] thy sting ? where , O death , thy victory ?
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Now the sting of death [ is ] sin , and the power of sin the law ;
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	57	but thanks to God , who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	15	58	So then , my beloved brethren , be firm , immovable , abounding always in the work of the Lord , knowing that your toil is not in vain in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	1	Corinthians
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	16	that * ye * should also be subject to such , and to every one joined in the work and labouring .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	2	On [ the ] first of [ the ] week let each of you put by at home , laying up [ in ] whatever [ degree ] he may have prospered , that there may be no collections when I come .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	3	And when I am arrived , whomsoever ye shall approve , these I will send with letters to carry your bounty to Jerusalem :
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	4	and if it be suitable that * I * also should go , they shall go with me .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	5	But I will come to you when I shall have gone through Macedonia ; for I do go through Macedonia .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	6	But perhaps I will stay with you , or even winter with you , that * ye * may set me forward wheresoever I may go .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now in passing , for I hope to remain a certain time with you , if the Lord permit .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I remain in Ephesus until Pentecost .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	9	For a great door is opened to me and an effectual [ one ] , and [ the ] adversaries many .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timotheus come , see that he may be with you without fear ; for he works the work of the Lord , even as I .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	11	Let not therefore any one despise him ; but set him forward in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brethren .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	12	Now concerning the brother Apollos , I begged him much that he would go to you with the brethren ; but it was not at all [ his ] will to go now ; but he will come when he shall have good opportunity .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Be vigilant ; stand fast in the faith ; quit yourselves like men ; be strong .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Let all things ye do be done in love .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	15	But I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the first-fruits of Achaia , and they have devoted themselves to the saints for service , )
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	17	But I rejoice in the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus ; because * they * have supplied what was lacking on your part .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours : own therefore such .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The assemblies of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla , with the assembly in their house , salute you much in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren salute you . Salute one another with a holy kiss .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	21	The salutation of [ me ] Paul with my own hand .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	22	If any one love not the Lord [ Jesus Christ ] let him be Anathema Maranatha .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with you .
DARBY	1%20Corinthians	16	24	My love [ be ] with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Grace to you , and peace from God our Father , and [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , apostle of Jesus Christ by God 's will , and the brother Timotheus , to the assembly of God which is in Corinth , with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Blessed [ be ] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of compassions , and God of all encouragement ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who encourages us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to encourage those who are in any tribulation whatever , through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged of God .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	5	Because , even as the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us , so through the Christ does our encouragement also abound .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	6	But whether we are in tribulation , [ it is ] for your encouragement and salvation , wrought in the endurance of the same sufferings which * we * also suffer ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	7	( and our hope for you [ is ] sure ; ) or whether we are encouraged , [ it is ] for your encouragement and salvation : knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so also of the encouragement .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , as to our tribulation which happened [ to us ] in Asia , that we were excessively pressed beyond [ our ] power , so as to despair even of living .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	9	But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not have our trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	10	who has delivered us from so great a death , and does deliver ; in whom we confide that he will also yet deliver ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	11	ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us , through means of many persons , may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our boasting is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and sincerity before God , ( not in fleshly wisdom but in God 's grace , ) we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly towards you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we do not write other things to you but what ye well know and recognise ; and I hope that ye will recognise to the end ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	14	even as also ye have recognised us in part , that we are your boast , even as * ye * [ are ] ours in the day of the Lord Jesus .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	15	And with this confidence I purposed to come to you previously , that ye might have a second favour ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	16	and to pass through to Macedonia by you , and again from Macedonia to come to you , and to be set forward by you to Judaea .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Having therefore this purpose , did I then use lightness ? Or what I purpose , do I purpose according to flesh , that there should be with me yea yea , and nay nay ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	18	Now God [ is ] faithful , that our word to you is not yea and nay .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , he who has been preached by us among you ( by me and Silvanus and Timotheus ) , did not become yea and nay , but yea * is * in him .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For whatever promises of God [ there are ] , in him is the yea , and in him the amen , for glory to God by us .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now he that establishes us with you in Christ , and has anointed us , [ is ] God ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	22	who also has sealed us , and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	23	But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not that we rule over your faith , but are fellow-workmen of your joy : for by faith ye stand .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	2	For if * I * grieve you , who also [ is ] it that gladdens me , if not he that is grieved through me ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I have written this very [ letter ] [ to you ] , that coming I may not have grief from those from whom I ought to have joy ; trusting in you all that my joy is [ that ] of you all .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of much tribulation and distress of heart I wrote to you , with many tears ; not that ye may be grieved , but that ye may know the love which I have very abundantly towards you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But if any one has grieved , he has grieved , not me , but in part ( that I may not overcharge [ you ] ) all of you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a one [ is ] this rebuke which [ has been inflicted ] by the many ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	7	so that on the contrary ye should rather shew grace and encourage , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore I exhort you to assure him of [ your ] love .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also I have written , that I might know , by putting you to the test , if as to everything ye are obedient .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	10	But to whom ye forgive anything , * I * also ; for I also , what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , [ it is ] for your sakes in [ the ] person of Christ ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	11	that we might not have Satan get an advantage against us , for we are not ignorant of * his * thoughts .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Now when I came to Troas for the [ publication of the ] glad tidings of the Christ , a door also being opened to me in [ the ] Lord ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit at not finding Titus my brother ; but bidding them adieu , I came away to Macedonia .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thanks [ be ] to God , who always leads us in triumph in the Christ , and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God , in the saved and in those that perish :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	16	to the one an odour from death unto death , but to the others an odour from life unto life ; and who [ is ] sufficient for these things ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we do not , as the many , make a trade of the word of God ; but as of sincerity , but as of God , before God , we speak in Christ .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	2	* Ye * are our letter , written in our hearts , known and read of all men ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	3	being manifested to be Christ 's epistle ministered by us , written , not with ink , but [ the ] Spirit of [ the ] living God ; not on stone tables , but on fleshy tables of [ the ] heart .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	4	And such confidence have we through the Christ towards God :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	5	not that we are competent of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves , but our competency [ is ] of God ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	6	who has also made us competent , [ as ] ministers of [ the ] new covenant ; not of letter , but of spirit . For the letter kills , but the Spirit quickens .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	7	( But if the ministry of death , in letters , graven in stones , began with glory , so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses , on account of the glory of his face , [ a glory ] which is annulled ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	8	how shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit subsist in glory ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministry of condemnation [ be ] glory , much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For also that [ which was ] glorified is not glorified in this respect , on account of the surpassing glory .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that annulled [ was introduced ] with glory , much rather that which abides [ subsists ] in glory .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Having therefore such hope , we use much boldness :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	13	and not according as Moses put a veil on his own face , so that the children of Israel should not fix their eyes on the end of that annulled .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their thoughts have been darkened , for unto this day the same veil remains in reading the old covenant , unremoved , which in Christ is annulled .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But unto this day , when Moses is read , the veil lies upon their heart .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But when it shall turn to [ the ] Lord , the veil is taken away . )
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit , but where the Spirit of [ the ] Lord [ is , there is ] liberty .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	3	18	But * we * all , looking on the glory of the Lord , with unveiled face , are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory , even as by [ the ] Lord [ the ] Spirit .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	2	But we have rejected the hidden things of shame , not walking in deceit , nor falsifying the word of God , but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	4	in whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving , so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ , who is [ the ] image of God , should not shine forth [ for them ] .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	3	But if also our gospel is veiled , it is veiled in those that are lost ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For we do not preach ourselves , but Christ Jesus Lord , and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus ' sake .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	6	Because [ it is ] the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in [ the ] face of [ Jesus ] Christ .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the surpassingness of the power may be of God , and not from us :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	8	every way afflicted , but not straitened ; seeing no apparent issue , but our way not entirely shut up ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	9	persecuted , but not abandoned ; cast down , but not destroyed ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	10	always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus , that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	11	for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus , that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	12	so that death works in us , but life in you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	13	And having the same spirit of faith , according to what is written , I have believed , therefore have I spoken ; * we * also believe , therefore also we speak ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	14	knowing that he who has raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also with Jesus , and shall present [ us ] with you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For all things [ are ] for your sakes , that the grace abounding through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore we faint not ; but if indeed our outward man is consumed , yet the inward is renewed day by day .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our momentary [ and ] light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	4	18	while we look not at the things that are seen , but at the things that are not seen ; for the things that are seen [ are ] for a time , but those that are not seen eternal .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	2	For indeed in this we groan , ardently desiring to have put on our house which [ is ] from heaven ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now he that has wrought us for this very thing [ is ] God , who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	3	if indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For indeed we who are in the tabernacle groan , being burdened ; while yet we do not wish to be unclothed , but clothed , that [ what is ] mortal may be swallowed up by life .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore [ we are ] always confident , and know that while present in the body we are absent from the Lord ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	7	( for we walk by faith , not by sight ; )
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	8	we are confident , I say , and pleased rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Wherefore also we are zealous , whether present or absent , to be agreeable to him .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of the Christ , that each may receive the things [ done ] in the body , according to those he has done , whether [ it be ] good or evil .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men , but have been manifested to God , and I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	12	[ For ] we do not again commend ourselves to you , but [ we are ] giving to you occasion of boast in our behalf , that ye may have [ such ] with those boasting in countenance , and not in heart .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For whether we are beside ourselves , [ it is ] to God ; or are sober , [ it is ] for you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of the Christ constrains us , having judged this : that one died for all , then all have died ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and he died for all , that they who live should no longer live to themselves , but to him who died for them and has been raised .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	16	So that * we * henceforth know no one according to flesh ; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh , yet now we know [ him thus ] no longer .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	17	So if any one [ be ] in Christ , [ there is ] a new creation ; the old things have passed away ; behold all things have become new :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	18	and all things [ are ] of the God who has reconciled us to himself by [ Jesus ] Christ , and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	19	how that God was in Christ , reconciling the world to himself , not reckoning to them their offences ; and putting in us the word of that reconciliation .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	20	We are ambassadors therefore for Christ , God as [ it were ] beseeching by us , we entreat for Christ , Be reconciled to God .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	5	21	Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us , that * we * might become God 's righteousness in him .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	2	( for he says , I have listened to thee in an accepted time , and I have helped thee in a day of salvation : behold , now [ is the ] well-accepted time ; behold , now [ the ] day of salvation : )
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	6	in pureness , in knowledge , in longsuffering , in kindness , in [ the ] Holy Spirit , in love unfeigned ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	3	giving no manner of offence in anything , that the ministry be not blamed ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	4	but in everything commending ourselves as God 's ministers , in much endurance , in afflictions , in necessities , in straits ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	5	in stripes , in prisons , in riots , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	7	in [ the ] word of truth , in [ the ] power of God ; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	8	through glory and dishonour , through evil report and good report : as deceivers , and true ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	9	as unknown , and well known ; as dying , and behold , we live ; as disciplined , and not put to death ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	10	as grieved , but always rejoicing ; as poor , but enriching many ; as having nothing , and possessing all things .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth is opened to you , Corinthians , our heart is expanded .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	12	Ye are not straitened in us , but ye are straitened in your affections ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	13	but for an answering recompense , ( I speak as to children , ) let * your * heart also expand itself .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers ; for what participation [ is there ] between righteousness and lawlessness ? or what fellowship of light with darkness ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	15	and what consent of Christ with Beliar , or what part for a believer along with an unbeliever ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	16	and what agreement of God 's temple with idols ? for * ye * are [ the ] living God 's temple ; according as God has said , I will dwell among them , and walk among [ them ] ; and I will be their God , and they shall be to me a people .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	17	Wherefore come out from the midst of them , and be separated , saith [ the ] Lord , and touch not [ what is ] unclean , and * I * will receive you ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	6	18	and I will be to you for a Father , and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters , saith [ the ] Lord Almighty .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Receive us : we have injured no one , we have ruined no one , we have made gain of no one .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	7	and not by his coming only , but also through the encouragement with which he was encouraged as to you ; relating to us your ardent desire , your mourning , your zeal for me ; so that I the more rejoiced .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not speak for condemnation , for I have already said that ye are in our hearts , to die together , and live together .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	4	Great [ is ] my boldness towards you , great my exulting in respect of you ; I am filled with encouragement ; I overabound in joy under all our affliction .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For indeed , when we came into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but [ we were ] afflicted in every way ; without combats , within fears .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But he who encourages those that are [ brought ] low , [ even ] God , encouraged us by the coming of Titus ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For if also I grieved you in the letter , I do not regret [ it ] , if even I have regretted it ; for I see that that letter , if even [ it were ] only for a time , grieved you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I rejoice , not that ye have been grieved , but that ye have been grieved to repentance ; for ye have been grieved according to God , that in nothing ye might be injured by us .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For grief according to God works repentance to salvation , never to be regretted ; but the grief of the world works death .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For , behold , this same thing , your being grieved according to God , how much diligence it wrought in * you * , but [ what ] excusing [ of yourselves ] , but [ what ] indignation , but [ what ] fear , but [ what ] ardent desire , but [ what ] zeal , but [ what ] vengeance : in every way ye have proved yourselves to be pure in the matter .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So then , if also I wrote to you , [ it was ] not for the sake of him that injured , nor for the sake of him that was injured , but for the sake of our diligent zeal for you being manifested to you before God .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	13	For this reason we have been encouraged . And we the rather rejoiced in our encouragement more abundantly by reason of the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by you all .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	14	Because if I boasted to him anything about you , I have not been put to shame ; but as we have spoken to you all things in truth , so also our boasting to Titus has been [ the ] truth ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	15	and his affections are more abundantly towards you , calling to mind the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in everything I am confident as to you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	2	that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty has abounded to the riches of their [ free-hearted ] liberality .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I do not speak as commanding [ it ] , but through the zeal of others , and proving the genuineness of your love .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For according to [ their ] power , I bear witness , and beyond [ their ] power , [ they were ] willing of their own accord ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	4	begging of us with much entreaty [ to give effect to ] the grace and fellowship of the service which [ was to be rendered ] to the saints .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And not according as we hoped , but they gave themselves first to the Lord , and to us by God 's will .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So that we begged Titus that , according as he had before begun , so he would also complete as to you this grace also ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	7	but even as ye abound in every way , in faith , and word , and knowledge , and all diligence , and in love from you to us , that ye may abound in this grace also .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that for your sakes he , being rich , became poor , in order that * ye * by * his * poverty might be enriched .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And I give [ my ] opinion in this , for this is profitable for you who began before , not only to do , but also to be willing , a year ago .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	11	But now also complete the doing of it ; so that as [ there was ] the readiness to be willing , so also to complete out of what ye have .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the readiness be there , [ a man is ] accepted according to what he may have , not according to what he has not .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For [ it is ] not in order that there may be ease for others , and for you distress ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	14	but [ on the principle ] of equality ; in the present time your abundance for their lack , that their abundance may be for your lack , so that there should be equality .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	15	According as it is written , He who [ gathered ] much had no excess , and he who [ gathered ] little was nothing short .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thanks [ be ] to God , who gives the same diligent zeal for you in the heart of Titus .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For he received indeed the entreaty , but , being full of zeal , he went of his own accord to you ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	18	but we have sent with him the brother whose praise [ is ] in the glad tidings through all the assemblies ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	19	and not only [ so ] , but [ is ] also chosen by the assemblies as our fellow-traveller with this grace , ministered by us to the glory of the Lord himself , and [ a witness of ] our readiness ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	20	avoiding this , that any one should blame us in this abundance [ which is ] administered by us ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	21	for we provide for things honest , not only before [ the ] Lord , but also before men .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved to be of diligent zeal in many things , and now more diligently zealous through the great confidence [ he has ] as to you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Whether as regards Titus , [ he is ] my companion and fellow-labourer in your behalf ; or our brethren , [ they are ] deputed messengers of assemblies , Christ 's glory .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Shew therefore to them , before the assemblies , the proof of your love , and of our boasting about you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	2	For I know your readiness , which I boast of as respects you to Macedonians , that Achaia is prepared since a year ago , and the zeal [ reported ] of you has stimulated the mass [ of the brethren ] .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	9	according as it is written , He has scattered abroad , he has given to the poor , his righteousness remains for ever .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But I have sent the brethren , in order that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect , in order that , as I have said , ye may be prepared ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	4	lest haply , if Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , * we * , that we say not * ye * , may be put to shame in this confidence .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	5	I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you , and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing , that this may be ready thus as blessing , and not as got out of you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	6	But this [ is true ] , he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he that sows in [ the spirit of ] blessing shall reap also in blessing :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	7	each according as he is purposed in his heart ; not grievingly , or of necessity ; for God loves a cheerful giver .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	8	But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you , that , having in every way always all-sufficiency , ye may abound to every good work :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing , and increase the fruits of your righteousness :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	11	enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality , which works through us thanksgiving to God .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	12	Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints , but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	13	they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration , by reason of your subjection , by profession , to the glad tidings of the Christ , and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	14	and in their supplication for you , full of ardent desire for you , on account of the exceeding grace of God [ which is ] upon you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Thanks [ be ] to God for his unspeakable free gift .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	2	but I beseech that present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I think to be daring towards some who think of us as walking according to flesh .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	10	because his letters , he says , [ are ] weighty and strong , but his presence in the body weak , and his speech naught .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For walking in flesh , we do not war according to flesh .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	4	For the arms of our warfare [ are ] not fleshly , but powerful according to God to [ the ] overthrow of strongholds ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	5	overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God , and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	6	and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	7	Do ye look at what concerns appearance ? If any one has confidence in himself that he is of Christ , let him think this again in himself , that even as he [ is ] of Christ , so also [ are ] we .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For and if I should boast even somewhat more abundantly of our authority , which the Lord has given [ to us ] for building up and not for your overthrowing , I shall not be put to shame ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	9	that I may not seem as if I was frightening you by letters :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such a one think this , that such as we are in word by letters [ when ] absent , such also present in deed .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves ; but these , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are not intelligent .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	13	Now * we * will not boast out of measure , but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us , to reach to you also .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we do not , as not reaching to you , overstretch ourselves , ( for we have come to you also in the glad tidings of the Christ ; )
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	15	not boasting out of measure in other people 's labours , but having hope , your faith increasing , to be enlarged amongst you , according to our rule , yet more abundantly
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	16	to announce the glad tidings to that [ which is ] beyond you , not to be boasting in another 's rule of things made ready to hand .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But he that boasts , let him boast in the Lord .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	10	18	For not * he * that commends himself is approved , but whom the Lord commends .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous as to you with a jealousy [ which is ] of God ; for I have espoused you unto one man , to present [ you ] a chaste virgin to Christ .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why ? because I do not love you ? God knows .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I fear lest by any means , as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft , [ so ] your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if indeed he that comes preaches another Jesus , whom we have not preached , or ye get a different Spirit , which ye have not got , or a different glad tidings , which ye have not received , ye might well bear with [ it ] .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I reckon that in nothing I am behind those who are in surpassing degree apostles .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But if [ I am ] a simple person in speech , yet not in knowledge , but in everything making [ the truth ] manifest in all things to you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Have I committed sin , abasing myself in order that * ye * might be exalted , because I gratuitously announced to you the glad tidings of God ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I spoiled other assemblies , receiving hire for ministry towards you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And being present with you and lacking , I did not lazily burden any one , ( for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied what I lacked , ) and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you , and will keep myself .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	10	[ The ] truth of Christ is in me that this boasting shall not be stopped as to me in the regions of Achaia .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I do , I will also do , that I may cut off the opportunity of those wishing [ for ] an opportunity , that wherein they boast they may be found even as we .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such [ are ] false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into apostles of Christ .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And [ it is ] not wonderful , for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	15	It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	16	Again I say , Let not any one think me to be a fool ; but if otherwise , receive me then even as a fool , that * I * also may boast myself some little .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	17	What I speak I do not speak according to [ the ] Lord , but as in folly , in this confidence of boasting .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since many boast according to flesh , * I * also will boast .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For ye bear fools readily , being wise .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For ye bear if any one bring you into bondage , if any one devour [ you ] , if any one get [ your money ] , if any one exalt himself , if any one beat you on the face .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I speak as to dishonour , as though * we * had been weak ; but wherein any one is daring , ( I speak in folly , ) * I * also am daring .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? * I * also . Are they Israelites ? * I * also . Are they seed of Abraham ? * I * also .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as being beside myself ) * I * above measure [ so ] ; in labours exceedingly abundant , in stripes to excess , in prisons exceedingly abundant , in deaths oft .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	24	From the Jews five times have I received forty [ stripes ] , save one .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Thrice have I been scourged , once I have been stoned , three times I have suffered shipwreck , a night and day I passed in the deep :
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	26	in journeyings often , in perils of rivers , in perils of robbers , in perils from [ my own ] race , in perils from [ the ] nations , in perils in [ the ] city , in perils in [ the ] desert , in perils on [ the ] sea , in perils among false brethren ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	27	in labour and toil , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Besides those things that are without , the crowd [ of cares ] pressing on me daily , the burden of all the assemblies .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is stumbled , and I burn not ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If it is needful to boast , I will boast in the things which concern my infirmity .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows—he who is blessed for ever—that I do not lie .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes shut up , wishing to take me ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	11	33	and through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall , and escaped his hands .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ , fourteen years ago , ( whether in [ the ] body I know not , or out of the body I know not , God knows ; ) such [ a one ] caught up to [ the ] third heaven .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	12	The signs indeed of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance , signs , and wonders , and works of power .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I know such a man , ( whether in [ the ] body or out of the body I know not , God knows ; )
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	4	that he was caught up into paradise , and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	5	Of such [ a one ] I will boast , but of myself I will not boast , unless in my weaknesses .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For if I shall desire to boast , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say [ the ] truth ; but I forbear , lest any one should think as to me above what he sees me [ to be ] , or whatever he may hear of me .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	7	And that I might not be exalted by the exceeding greatness of the revelations , there was given to me a thorn for the flesh , a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me , that I might not be exalted .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	8	For this I thrice besought the Lord that it might depart from me .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And he said to me , My grace suffices thee ; for [ my ] power is perfected in weakness . Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses , that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses , in insults , in necessities , in persecutions , in straits , for Christ : for when I am weak , then I am powerful .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have become a fool ; * ye * have compelled me ; for * I * ought to have been commended by you ; for I have been nothing behind those who were in surpassing degree apostles , if also I am nothing .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For in what is it that ye have been inferior to the other assemblies , unless that I myself have not been in laziness a charge upon you ? Forgive me this injury .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Behold , this third time I am ready to come to you , and I will not be in laziness a charge ; for I do not seek yours , but you ; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	15	Now * I * shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls , if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But be it so . * I * did not burden you , but being crafty I took you by guile .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I make gain of you by any of those whom I have sent to you ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I begged Titus , and sent the brother with [ him ] : did Titus at all make gain of you ? have we not walked in the same spirit ? [ have we ] not in the same steps ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Ye have long been supposing that we excuse ourselves to you : we speak before God in Christ ; and all things , beloved , for your building up .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I fear lest perhaps coming I find you not such as I wish , and that * I * be found by you such as ye do not wish : lest [ there might be ] strifes , jealousies , angers , contentions , evil speakings , whisperings , puffings up , disturbances ;
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	12	21	lest my God should humble me as to you when I come again , and that I shall grieve over many of those who have sinned before , and have not repented as to the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practised .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	2	I have declared beforehand , and I say beforehand as present the second time , and now absent , to those that have sinned before , and to all the rest , that if I come again I will not spare .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	13	All the saints salute you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	3	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me , ( who is not weak towards you , but is powerful among you ,
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	4	for if indeed he has been crucified in weakness , yet he lives by God 's power ; for indeed * we * are weak in him , but we shall live with him by God 's power towards you , )
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	5	examine your own selves if ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves : do ye not recognise yourselves , that Jesus Christ is in you , unless indeed ye be reprobates ?
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	6	Now I hope that ye will know that * we * are not reprobates .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	7	But we pray to God that ye may do nothing evil ; not that * we * may appear approved , but that * ye * may do what is right , and * we * be as reprobates .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	9	For we rejoice when * we * may be weak and * ye * may be powerful . But this also we pray for , your perfecting .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	10	On this account I write these things being absent , that being present I may not use severity according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up , and not for overthrowing .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	11	For the rest , brethren , rejoice ; be perfected ; be encouraged ; be of one mind ; be at peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	12	Salute one another with a holy kiss .
DARBY	2%20Corinthians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the communion of the Holy Spirit , [ be ] with you all .
DARBY	Galatians	1	1	Paul , apostle , not from men nor through man , but through Jesus Christ , and God [ the ] Father who raised him from among [ the ] dead ,
DARBY	Galatians	1	2	and all the brethren with me , to the assemblies of Galatia .
DARBY	Galatians	1	3	Grace to you , and peace , from God [ the ] Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DARBY	Galatians	1	4	who gave himself for our sins , so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world , according to the will of our God and Father ;
DARBY	Galatians	1	5	to whom [ be ] glory to the ages of ages . Amen .
DARBY	Galatians	1	6	I wonder that ye thus quickly change , from him that called you in Christ 's grace , to a different gospel ,
DARBY	Galatians	1	7	which is not another [ one ] ; but there are some that trouble you , and desire to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ .
DARBY	Galatians	1	8	But if even * we * or an angel out of heaven announce as glad tidings to you [ anything ] besides what we have announced as glad tidings to you , let him be accursed .
DARBY	Galatians	1	9	As we have said before , now also again I say , If any one announce to you as glad tidings [ anything ] besides what ye have received , let him be accursed .
DARBY	Galatians	1	10	For do I now seek to satisfy men or God ? or do I seek to please men ? If I were yet pleasing men , I were not Christ 's bondman .
DARBY	Galatians	1	11	But I let you know , brethren , [ as to ] the glad tidings which were announced by me , that they are not according to man .
DARBY	Galatians	1	12	For neither did I receive them from man , neither was I taught [ them ] , but by revelation of Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Galatians	1	13	For ye have heard [ what was ] my conversation formerly in Judaism , that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God , and ravaged it ;
DARBY	Galatians	1	14	and advanced in Judaism beyond many [ my ] contemporaries in my nation , being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my fathers .
DARBY	Galatians	1	15	But when God , who set me apart [ even ] from my mother 's womb , and called [ me ] by his grace ,
DARBY	Galatians	1	16	was pleased to reveal his Son in me , that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations , immediately I took not counsel with flesh and blood ,
DARBY	Galatians	1	17	nor went I up to Jerusalem to those [ who were ] apostles before me ; but I went to Arabia , and again returned to Damascus .
DARBY	Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter , and I remained with him fifteen days ;
DARBY	Galatians	1	19	but I saw none other of the apostles , but James the brother of the Lord .
DARBY	Galatians	1	20	Now what I write to you , behold , before God , I do not lie .
DARBY	Galatians	1	21	Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
DARBY	Galatians	1	22	But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea which [ are ] in Christ ;
DARBY	Galatians	1	23	only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he ravaged :
DARBY	Galatians	1	24	and they glorified God in me .
DARBY	Galatians	2	2	and I went up according to revelation , and I laid before them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations , but privately to those conspicuous [ among them ] , lest in any way I run or had run in vain ;
DARBY	Galatians	2	3	( but neither was Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , compelled to be circumcised ; )
DARBY	Galatians	2	4	and [ it was ] on account of the false brethren brought in surreptitiously , who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into bondage ;
DARBY	Galatians	2	5	to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour , that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you .
DARBY	Galatians	2	6	But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat—whatsoever they were , it makes no difference to me : God does not accept man 's person ; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing ;
DARBY	Galatians	2	7	but , on the contrary , seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me , even as to Peter that of the circumcision ,
DARBY	Galatians	2	8	( for he that wrought in Peter for [ the ] apostleship of the circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles , )
DARBY	Galatians	2	9	and recognising the grace given to me , James and Cephas and John , who were conspicuous as being pillars , gave to me and Barnabas [ the ] right hands of fellowship , that * we * [ should go ] to the nations , and * they * to the circumcision ;
DARBY	Galatians	2	10	only that we should remember the poor , which same thing also I was diligent to do .
DARBY	Galatians	2	11	But when Peter came to Antioch , I withstood him to [ the ] face , because he was to be condemned :
DARBY	Galatians	2	12	for before that certain came from James , he ate with [ those of ] the nations ; but when they came , he drew back and separated himself , fearing those of [ the ] circumcision ;
DARBY	Galatians	2	13	and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling part with him ; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by their dissimulation .
DARBY	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly , according to the truth of the glad tidings , I said to Peter before all , If * thou * , being a Jew , livest as the nations and not as the Jews , how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize ?
DARBY	Galatians	2	15	We , Jews by nature , and not sinners of [ the ] nations ,
DARBY	Galatians	2	16	but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of works of law [ nor ] but by the faith of Jesus Christ , * we * also have believed on Christ Jesus , that we might be justified on the principle of [ the ] faith of Christ ; and not of works of law ; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be justified .
DARBY	Galatians	2	17	Now if in seeking to be justified in Christ we also have been found sinners , then [ is ] Christ minister of sin ? Far be the thought .
DARBY	Galatians	2	18	For if the things I have thrown down , these I build again , I constitute myself a transgressor .
DARBY	Galatians	2	19	For * I * , through law , have died to law , that I may live to God .
DARBY	Galatians	2	20	I am crucified with Christ , and no longer live , * I * , but Christ lives in me ; but [ in ] that I now live in flesh , I live by faith , the [ faith ] of the Son of God , who has loved me and given himself for me .
DARBY	Galatians	2	21	I do not set aside the grace of God ; for if righteousness [ is ] by law , then Christ has died for nothing .
DARBY	Galatians	3	3	Are ye so senseless ? having begun in Spirit , are ye going to be made perfect in flesh ?
DARBY	Galatians	3	2	This only I wish to learn of you , Have ye received the Spirit on the principle of works of law , or of [ the ] report of faith ?
DARBY	Galatians	3	4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain , if indeed also in vain ?
DARBY	Galatians	3	5	He therefore who ministers to you the Spirit , and works miracles among you , [ is it ] on the principle of works of law , or of [ the ] report of faith ?
DARBY	Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham believed God , and it was reckoned to him as righteousness .
DARBY	Galatians	3	7	Know then that they that are on the principle of faith , these are Abraham 's sons ;
DARBY	Galatians	3	8	and the scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the nations on the principle of faith , announced beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham : In thee all the nations shall be blessed .
DARBY	Galatians	3	9	So that they who are on the principle of faith are blessed with believing Abraham .
DARBY	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are on the principle of works of law are under curse . For it is written , Cursed is every one who does not continue in all things which [ are ] written in the book of the law to do them ;
DARBY	Galatians	3	11	but that by law no one is justified with God [ is ] evident , because The just shall live on the principle of faith ;
DARBY	Galatians	3	12	but the law is not on the principle of faith ; but , He that shall have done these things shall live by them .
DARBY	Galatians	3	13	Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law , having become a curse for us , ( for it is written , Cursed [ is ] every one hanged upon a tree , )
DARBY	Galatians	3	14	that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus , that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
DARBY	Galatians	3	15	Brethren , ( I speak according to man , ) even man 's confirmed covenant no one sets aside , or adds other dispositions to .
DARBY	Galatians	3	16	But to Abraham were the promises addressed , and to his seed : he does not say , And to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , And to thy seed ; which is Christ .
DARBY	Galatians	3	17	Now I say this , A covenant confirmed beforehand by God , the law , which took place four hundred and thirty years after , does not annul , so as to make the promise of no effect .
DARBY	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance [ be ] on the principle of law , [ it is ] no longer on the principle of promise ; but God gave it in grace to Abraham by promise .
DARBY	Galatians	3	19	Why then the law ? It was added for the sake of transgressions , until the seed came to whom the promise was made , ordained through angels in [ the ] hand of a mediator .
DARBY	Galatians	3	20	But a mediator is not of one , but God is one .
DARBY	Galatians	3	21	[ Is ] then the law against the promises of God ? Far be the thought . For if a law had been given able to quicken , then indeed righteousness were on the principle of law ;
DARBY	Galatians	3	22	but the scripture has shut up all things under sin , that the promise , on the principle of faith of Jesus Christ , should be given to those that believe .
DARBY	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came , we were guarded under law , shut up to faith [ which was ] about to be revealed .
DARBY	Galatians	3	24	So that the law has been our tutor up to Christ , that we might be justified on the principle of faith .
DARBY	Galatians	3	25	But , faith having come , we are no longer under a tutor ;
DARBY	Galatians	3	26	for ye are all God 's sons by faith in Christ Jesus .
DARBY	Galatians	3	27	For ye , as many as have been baptised unto Christ , have put on Christ .
DARBY	Galatians	3	28	There is no Jew nor Greek ; there is no bondman nor freeman ; there is no male and female ; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus :
DARBY	Galatians	3	29	but if * ye * [ are ] of Christ , then ye are Abraham 's seed , heirs according to promise .
DARBY	Galatians	4	4	but when the fulness of the time was come , God sent forth his Son , come of woman , come under law ,
DARBY	Galatians	4	2	but he is under guardians and stewards until the period fixed by the father .
DARBY	Galatians	4	3	So we also , when we were children , were held in bondage under the principles of the world ;
DARBY	Galatians	4	5	that he might redeem those under law , that we might receive sonship .
DARBY	Galatians	4	6	But because ye are sons , God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , crying , Abba , Father .
DARBY	Galatians	4	7	So thou art no longer bondman , but son ; but if son , heir also through God .
DARBY	Galatians	4	8	But then indeed , not knowing God , ye were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods ;
DARBY	Galatians	4	9	but now , knowing God , but rather being known by God , how do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly principles to which ye desire to be again anew in bondage ?
DARBY	Galatians	4	10	Ye observe days and months and times and years .
DARBY	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you , lest indeed I have laboured in vain as to you .
DARBY	Galatians	4	12	Be as * I * [ am ] , for * I * also [ am ] as * ye * , brethren , I beseech you : ye have not at all wronged me .
DARBY	Galatians	4	13	But ye know that in weakness of the flesh I announced the glad tidings to you at the first ;
DARBY	Galatians	4	14	and my temptation , which [ was ] in my flesh , ye did not slight nor reject with contempt ; but ye received me as an angel of God , as Christ Jesus .
DARBY	Galatians	4	15	What then [ was ] your blessedness ? for I bear you witness that , if possible , plucking out your own eyes ye would have given [ them ] to me .
DARBY	Galatians	4	16	So I have become your enemy in speaking the truth to you ?
DARBY	Galatians	4	17	They are not rightly zealous after you , but desire to shut you out [ from us ] , that ye may be zealous after them .
DARBY	Galatians	4	18	But [ it is ] right to be zealous at all times in what is right , and not only when I am present with you—
DARBY	Galatians	4	19	my children , of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you :
DARBY	Galatians	4	20	and I should wish to be present with you now , and change my voice , for I am perplexed as to you .
DARBY	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , ye who are desirous of being under law , do ye not listen to the law ?
DARBY	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons ; one of the maid servant , and one of the free woman .
DARBY	Galatians	4	23	But he [ that was ] of the maid servant was born according to flesh , and he [ that was ] of the free woman through the promise .
DARBY	Galatians	4	24	Which things have an allegorical sense ; for these are two covenants : one from mount Sinai , gendering to bondage , which is Hagar .
DARBY	Galatians	4	25	For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia , and corresponds to Jerusalem which [ is ] now , for she is in bondage with her children ;
DARBY	Galatians	4	26	but the Jerusalem above is free , which is our mother .
DARBY	Galatians	4	27	For it is written , Rejoice , thou barren that bearest not ; break out and cry , thou that travailest not ; because the children of the desolate are more numerous than [ those ] of her that has a husband .
DARBY	Galatians	4	28	But * ye * , brethren , after the pattern of Isaac , are children of promise .
DARBY	Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him [ that was born ] according to Spirit , so also [ it is ] now .
DARBY	Galatians	4	30	But what says the scripture ? Cast out the maid servant and her son ; for the son of the maid servant shall not inherit with the son of the free woman .
DARBY	Galatians	4	31	So then , brethren , we are not maid servant 's children , but [ children ] of the free woman .
DARBY	Galatians	5	5	For we , by [ the ] Spirit , on the principle of faith , await the hope of righteousness .
DARBY	Galatians	5	2	Behold , I , Paul , say to you , that if ye are circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
DARBY	Galatians	5	3	And I witness again to every man [ who is ] circumcised , that he is debtor to do the whole law .
DARBY	Galatians	5	4	Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ as separated [ from him ] , as many as are justified by law ; ye have fallen from grace .
DARBY	Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force , nor uncircumcision ; but faith working through love .
DARBY	Galatians	5	7	Ye ran well ; who has stopped you that ye should not obey the truth ?
DARBY	Galatians	5	8	The persuasibleness [ is ] not of him that calls you .
DARBY	Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leavens the whole lump .
DARBY	Galatians	5	10	* I * have confidence as to you in [ the ] Lord , that ye will have no other mind ; and he that is troubling you shall bear the guilt [ of it ] , whosoever he may be .
DARBY	Galatians	5	11	But * I * , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why am I yet persecuted ? Then the scandal of the cross has been done away .
DARBY	Galatians	5	12	I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion .
DARBY	Galatians	5	13	For * ye * have been called to liberty , brethren ; only [ do ] not [ turn ] liberty into an opportunity to the flesh , but by love serve one another .
DARBY	Galatians	5	14	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ;
DARBY	Galatians	5	15	but if ye bite and devour one another , see that ye are not consumed one of another .
DARBY	Galatians	5	16	But I say , Walk in [ the ] Spirit , and ye shall no way fulfil flesh 's lust .
DARBY	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these things are opposed one to the other , that ye should not do those things which ye desire ;
DARBY	Galatians	5	18	but if ye are led by the Spirit , ye are not under law .
DARBY	Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are fornication , uncleanness , licentiousness ,
DARBY	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , sorcery , hatred , strifes , jealousies , angers , contentions , disputes , schools of opinion ,
DARBY	Galatians	5	21	envyings , murders , drunkennesses , revels , and things like these ; as to which I tell you beforehand , even as I also have said before , that they who do such things shall not inherit God 's kingdom .
DARBY	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , long-suffering , kindness , goodness , fidelity ,
DARBY	Galatians	5	23	meekness , self-control : against such things there is no law .
DARBY	Galatians	5	24	But they that [ are ] of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts .
DARBY	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit , let us walk also by the Spirit .
DARBY	Galatians	5	26	Let us not become vain-glorious , provoking one another , envying one another .
DARBY	Galatians	6	6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things .
DARBY	Galatians	6	2	Bear one another 's burdens , and thus fulfil the law of the Christ .
DARBY	Galatians	6	3	For if any man reputes himself to be something , being nothing , he deceives himself ;
DARBY	Galatians	6	4	but let each prove his own work , and then he will have his boast in what belongs to himself alone , and not in what belongs to another .
DARBY	Galatians	6	5	For each shall bear his own burden .
DARBY	Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived : God is not mocked ; for whatever a man shall sow , that also shall he reap .
DARBY	Galatians	6	8	For he that sows to his own flesh , shall reap corruption from the flesh ; but he that sows to the Spirit , from the Spirit shall reap eternal life :
DARBY	Galatians	6	9	but let us not lose heart in doing good ; for in due time , if we do not faint , we shall reap .
DARBY	Galatians	6	10	So then , as we have occasion , let us do good towards all , and specially towards those of the household of faith .
DARBY	Galatians	6	11	See how long a letter I have written to you with my own hand .
DARBY	Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to have a fair appearance in [ the ] flesh , these compel you to be circumcised , only that they may not be persecuted because of the cross of Christ .
DARBY	Galatians	6	13	For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law ; but they wish you to be circumcised , that they may boast in your flesh .
DARBY	Galatians	6	14	But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom [ the ] world is crucified to me , and I to the world .
DARBY	Galatians	6	15	For [ in Christ Jesus ] neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision ; but new creation .
DARBY	Galatians	6	16	And as many as shall walk by this rule , peace upon them and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
DARBY	Galatians	6	17	For the rest let no one trouble me , for * I * bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus .
DARBY	Galatians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with your spirit , brethren . Amen .
DARBY	Ephesians	1	1	Paul , apostle of Jesus Christ by God 's will , to the saints and faithful in Christ Jesus who are at Ephesus .
DARBY	Ephesians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Ephesians	1	3	Blessed [ be ] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ ;
DARBY	Ephesians	1	4	according as he has chosen us in him before [ the ] world 's foundation , that we should be holy and blameless before him in love ;
DARBY	Ephesians	1	5	having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	6	to [ the ] praise of [ the ] glory of his grace , wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved :
DARBY	Ephesians	1	7	in whom we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of offences , according to the riches of his grace ;
DARBY	Ephesians	1	8	which he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	9	having made known to us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself
DARBY	Ephesians	1	10	for [ the ] administration of the fulness of times ; to head up all things in the Christ , the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth ; in him ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	11	in whom we have also obtained an inheritance , being marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	12	that we should be to [ the ] praise of his glory who have pre-trusted in the Christ :
DARBY	Ephesians	1	13	in whom * ye * also [ have trusted ] , having heard the word of the truth , the glad tidings of your salvation ; in whom also , having believed , ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	14	who is [ the ] earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to [ the ] praise of his glory .
DARBY	Ephesians	1	15	Wherefore * I * also , having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which [ is ] in you , and the love which [ ye have ] towards all the saints ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	16	do not cease giving thanks for you , making mention [ of you ] at my prayers ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , would give you [ the ] spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	18	being enlightened in the eyes of your heart , so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling , [ and ] what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	19	and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe , according to the working of the might of his strength ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	20	[ in ] which he wrought in the Christ [ in ] raising him from among [ the ] dead , and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	21	above every principality , and authority , and power , and dominion , and every name named , not only in this age , but also in that to come ;
DARBY	Ephesians	1	22	and has put all things under his feet , and gave him [ to be ] head over all things to the assembly ,
DARBY	Ephesians	1	23	which is his body , the fulness of him who fills all in all :
DARBY	Ephesians	2	2	in which ye once walked according to the age of this world , according to the ruler of the authority of the air , the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience :
DARBY	Ephesians	2	3	among whom * we * also all once had our conversation in the lusts of our flesh , doing what the flesh and the thoughts willed to do , and were children , by nature , of wrath , even as the rest :
DARBY	Ephesians	2	4	but God , being rich in mercy , because of his great love wherewith he loved us ,
DARBY	Ephesians	2	5	( we too being dead in offences , ) has quickened us with the Christ , ( ye are saved by grace , )
DARBY	Ephesians	2	6	and has raised [ us ] up together , and has made [ us ] sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus ,
DARBY	Ephesians	2	7	that he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus .
DARBY	Ephesians	2	8	For ye are saved by grace , through faith ; and this not of yourselves ; it is God 's gift :
DARBY	Ephesians	2	9	not on the principle of works , that no one might boast .
DARBY	Ephesians	2	10	For we are his workmanship , having been created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God has before prepared that we should walk in them .
DARBY	Ephesians	2	11	Wherefore remember that * ye * , once nations in [ the ] flesh , who [ are ] called uncircumcision by that called circumcision in [ the ] flesh done with the hand ;
DARBY	Ephesians	2	12	that ye were at that time without Christ , aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers to the covenants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
DARBY	Ephesians	2	13	but now in Christ Jesus * ye * who once were afar off are become nigh by the blood of the Christ .
DARBY	Ephesians	2	14	For * he * is our peace , who has made both one , and has broken down the middle wall of enclosure ,
DARBY	Ephesians	2	15	having annulled the enmity in his flesh , the law of commandments in ordinances , that he might form the two in himself into one new man , making peace ;
DARBY	Ephesians	2	16	and might reconcile both in one body to God by the cross , having by it slain the enmity ;
DARBY	Ephesians	2	17	and , coming , he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who [ were ] afar off , and [ the glad tidings of ] peace to those [ who were ] nigh .
DARBY	Ephesians	2	18	For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father .
DARBY	Ephesians	2	19	So then ye are no longer strangers and foreigners , but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints , and of the household of God ,
DARBY	Ephesians	2	20	being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone ,
DARBY	Ephesians	2	21	in whom all [ the ] building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord ;
DARBY	Ephesians	2	22	in whom * ye * also are built together for a habitation of God in [ the ] Spirit .
DARBY	Ephesians	3	3	that by revelation the mystery has been made known to me , ( according as I have written before briefly ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	2	( if indeed ye have heard of the administration of the grace of God which has been given to me towards you ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	4	by which , in reading it , ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ , )
DARBY	Ephesians	3	5	which in other generations has not been made known to the sons of men , as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in [ the power of the ] Spirit ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	6	that [ they who are of ] the nations should be joint heirs , and a joint body , and joint partakers of [ his ] promise in Christ Jesus by the glad tidings ;
DARBY	Ephesians	3	7	of which I am become minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me , according to the working of his power .
DARBY	Ephesians	3	8	To me , less than the least of all saints , has this grace been given , to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	9	and to enlighten all [ with the knowledge of ] what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God , who has created all things ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	10	in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	11	according to [ the ] purpose of the ages , which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him .
DARBY	Ephesians	3	13	Wherefore I beseech [ you ] not to faint through my tribulations for you , which is your glory .
DARBY	Ephesians	3	14	For this reason I bow my knees to the Father [ of our Lord Jesus Christ ] ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	15	of whom every family in [ the ] heavens and on earth is named ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	16	in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory , to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man ;
DARBY	Ephesians	3	17	that the Christ may dwell , through faith , in your hearts , being rooted and founded in love ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	18	in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what [ is ] the breadth and length and depth and height ;
DARBY	Ephesians	3	19	and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge ; that ye may be filled [ even ] to all the fulness of God .
DARBY	Ephesians	3	20	But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think , according to the power which works in us ,
DARBY	Ephesians	3	21	to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages . Amen ) .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	4	[ There is ] one body and one Spirit , as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	2	with all lowliness and meekness , with long-suffering , bearing with one another in love ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	3	using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	5	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in us all .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	7	But to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	8	Wherefore he says , Having ascended up on high , he has led captivity captive , and has given gifts to men .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	9	But that he ascended , what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth ?
DARBY	Ephesians	4	10	He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens , that he might fill all things ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	11	and * he * has given some apostles , and some prophets , and some evangelists , and some shepherds and teachers ,
DARBY	Ephesians	4	12	for the perfecting of the saints ; with a view to [ the ] work of [ the ] ministry , with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	13	until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , at [ the ] full-grown man , at [ the ] measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	14	in order that we may be no longer babes , tossed and carried about by every wind of * that * teaching [ which is ] in the sleight of men , in unprincipled cunning with a view to systematized error ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	15	but , holding the truth in love , we may grow up to him in all things , who is the head , the Christ :
DARBY	Ephesians	4	16	from whom the whole body , fitted together , and connected by every joint of supply , according to [ the ] working in [ its ] measure of each one part , works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	17	This I say therefore , and testify in [ the ] Lord , that ye should no longer walk as [ the rest of ] the nations walk in [ the ] vanity of their mind ,
DARBY	Ephesians	4	18	being darkened in understanding , estranged from the life of God by reason of the ignorance which is in them , by reason of the hardness of their hearts ,
DARBY	Ephesians	4	19	who having cast off all feeling , have given themselves up to lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greedy unsatisfied lust .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	20	But * ye * have not thus learnt the Christ ,
DARBY	Ephesians	4	21	if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as [ the ] truth is in Jesus ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	22	[ namely ] your having put off according to the former conversation the old man which corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	23	and being renewed in the spirit of your mind ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	24	and [ your ] having put on the new man , which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	25	Wherefore , having put off falsehood , speak truth every one with his neighbour , because we are members one of another .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	26	Be angry , and do not sin ; let not the sun set upon your wrath ,
DARBY	Ephesians	4	27	neither give room for the devil .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	28	Let the stealer steal no more , but rather let him toil , working what is honest with [ his ] hands , that he may have to distribute to him that has need .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt word go out of your mouth , but if [ there be ] any good one for needful edification , that it may give grace to those that hear [ it ] .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	30	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , with which ye have been sealed for [ the ] day of redemption .
DARBY	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness , and heat of passion , and wrath , and clamour , and injurious language , be removed from you , with all malice ;
DARBY	Ephesians	4	32	and be to one another kind , compassionate , forgiving one another , so as God also in Christ has forgiven you .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	5	For this ye are [ well ] informed of , knowing that no fornicator , or unclean person , or person of unbridled lust , who is an idolater , has inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	2	and walk in love , even as the Christ loved us , and delivered himself up for us , an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	3	But fornication and all uncleanness or unbridled lust , let it not be even named among you , as it becomes saints ;
DARBY	Ephesians	5	4	and filthiness and foolish talking , or jesting , which are not convenient ; but rather thanksgiving .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with vain words , for on account of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	7	Be not ye therefore fellow-partakers with them ;
DARBY	Ephesians	5	8	for ye were once darkness , but now light in [ the ] Lord ; walk as children of light ,
DARBY	Ephesians	5	9	( for the fruit of the light [ is ] in all goodness and righteousness and truth , )
DARBY	Ephesians	5	10	proving what is agreeable to the Lord ;
DARBY	Ephesians	5	11	and do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather also reprove [ them ] ,
DARBY	Ephesians	5	12	for the things that are done by them in secret it is shameful even to say .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	13	But all things having their true character exposed by the light are made manifest ; for that which makes everything manifest is light .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	14	Wherefore he says , Wake up , [ thou ] that sleepest , and arise up from among the dead , and the Christ shall shine upon thee .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	15	See therefore how ye walk carefully , not as unwise but as wise ,
DARBY	Ephesians	5	16	redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	17	For this reason be not foolish , but understanding what [ is ] the will of the Lord .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	18	And be not drunk with wine , in which is debauchery ; but be filled with the Spirit ,
DARBY	Ephesians	5	19	speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord ;
DARBY	Ephesians	5	20	giving thanks at all times for all things to him [ who is ] God and [ the ] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DARBY	Ephesians	5	21	submitting yourselves to one another in [ the ] fear of Christ .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , [ submit yourselves ] to your own husbands , as to the Lord ,
DARBY	Ephesians	5	23	for a husband is head of the wife , as also the Christ [ is ] head of the assembly . * He * [ is ] Saviour of the body .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	24	But even as the assembly is subjected to the Christ , so also wives to their own husbands in everything .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your own wives , even as the Christ also loved the assembly , and has delivered himself up for it ,
DARBY	Ephesians	5	26	in order that he might sanctify it , purifying [ it ] by the washing of water by [ the ] word ,
DARBY	Ephesians	5	27	that * he * might present the assembly to himself glorious , having no spot , or wrinkle , or any of such things ; but that it might be holy and blameless .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	28	So ought men also to love their own wives as their own bodies : he that loves his own wife loves himself .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	29	For no one has ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , even as also the Christ the assembly :
DARBY	Ephesians	5	30	for we are members of his body ; [ we are of his flesh , and of his bones . ]
DARBY	Ephesians	5	31	Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother , and shall be united to his wife , and the two shall be one flesh .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	32	This mystery is great , but * I * speak as to Christ , and as to the assembly .
DARBY	Ephesians	5	33	But * ye * also , every one of you , let each so love his own wife as himself ; but as to the wife [ I speak ] that she may fear the husband .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	6	not with eye-service as men-pleasers ; but as bondmen of Christ , doing the will of God from [ the ] soul ,
DARBY	Ephesians	6	2	Honour thy father and thy mother , which is the first commandment with a promise ,
DARBY	Ephesians	6	3	that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest be long-lived on the earth .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	4	And [ ye ] fathers , do not provoke your children to anger , but bring them up in [ the ] discipline and admonition of [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	5	Bondmen , obey masters according to flesh , with fear and trembling , in simplicity of your heart as to the Christ ;
DARBY	Ephesians	6	7	serving with good will as to the Lord , and not to men ;
DARBY	Ephesians	6	8	knowing that whatever good each shall do , this he shall receive of [ the ] Lord , whether bond or free .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	9	And , masters , do the same things towards them , giving up threatening , knowing that both their and your Master is in heaven , and there is no acceptance of persons with him .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	10	For the rest , brethren , be strong in [ the ] Lord , and in the might of his strength .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the panoply of God , that ye may be able to stand against the artifices of the devil :
DARBY	Ephesians	6	12	because our struggle is not against blood and flesh , but against principalities , against authorities , against the universal lords of this darkness , against spiritual [ power ] of wickedness in the heavenlies .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	13	For this reason take [ to you ] the panoply of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and , having accomplished all things , to stand .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore , having girt about your loins with truth , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
DARBY	Ephesians	6	15	and shod your feet with [ the ] preparation of the glad tidings of peace :
DARBY	Ephesians	6	16	besides all [ these ] , having taken the shield of faith with which ye will be able to quench all the inflamed darts of the wicked one .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	17	Have also the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is God 's word ;
DARBY	Ephesians	6	18	praying at all seasons , with all prayer and supplication in [ the ] Spirit , and watching unto this very thing with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints ;
DARBY	Ephesians	6	19	and for me in order that utterance may be given to me in [ the ] opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the glad tidings ,
DARBY	Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador [ bound ] with a chain , that I may be bold in it as I ought to speak .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	21	But in order that * ye * also may know what concerns me , how I am getting on , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful minister in [ the ] Lord , shall make all things known to you ;
DARBY	Ephesians	6	22	whom I have sent to you for this very thing , that ye may know of our affairs and that he may encourage your hearts .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	23	Peace to the brethren , and love with faith , from God [ the ] Father and [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Ephesians	6	24	Grace with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption .
DARBY	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timotheus , bondmen of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi , with [ the ] overseers and ministers ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	2	grace to you , and peace from God our Father and [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you ,
DARBY	Philippians	1	4	constantly in my every supplication , making the supplication for you all with joy ,
DARBY	Philippians	1	5	because of your fellowship with the gospel , from the first day until now ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	6	having confidence of this very thing , that he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ 's day :
DARBY	Philippians	1	7	as it is righteous for me to think this as to you all , because ye have * me * in your hearts , and that both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are all participators in my grace .
DARBY	Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness how I long after you all in [ the ] bowels of Christ Jesus .
DARBY	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence ,
DARBY	Philippians	1	10	that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent , in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ 's day ,
DARBY	Philippians	1	11	being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness , which [ is ] by Jesus Christ , to God 's glory and praise .
DARBY	Philippians	1	12	But I would have you know , brethren , that the circumstances in which I am have turned out rather to the furtherance of the glad tidings ,
DARBY	Philippians	1	13	so that my bonds have become manifest [ as being ] in Christ in all the praetorium and to all others ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	14	and that the most of the brethren , trusting in [ the ] Lord through my bonds , dare more abundantly to speak the word of God fearlessly .
DARBY	Philippians	1	15	Some indeed also for envy and strife , but some also for good will , preach the Christ .
DARBY	Philippians	1	16	These indeed out of love , knowing that I am set for the defence of the glad tidings ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	17	but those out of contention , announce the Christ , not purely , supposing to arouse tribulation for my bonds .
DARBY	Philippians	1	18	What is it then ? at any rate , in every way , whether in pretext or in truth , Christ is announced ; and in this I rejoice , yea , also I will rejoice ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	19	for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation , through your supplication and [ the ] supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	20	according to my earnest expectation and hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but in all boldness , as always , now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death .
DARBY	Philippians	1	21	For for me to live [ is ] Christ , and to die gain ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	22	but if to live in flesh [ is my lot ] , this is for me worth the while : and what I shall choose I can not tell .
DARBY	Philippians	1	23	But I am pressed by both , having the desire for departure and being with Christ , [ for ] [ it is ] very much better ,
DARBY	Philippians	1	24	but remaining in the flesh [ is ] more necessary for your sakes ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	25	and having confidence of this , I know that I shall remain and abide along with you all , for your progress and joy in faith ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	26	that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus through me by my presence again with you .
DARBY	Philippians	1	27	Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ , in order that whether coming and seeing you , or absent , I may hear of what concerns you , that ye stand firm in one spirit , with one soul , labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	28	and not frightened in anything by the opposers , which is to them a demonstration of destruction , but of your salvation , and that from God ;
DARBY	Philippians	1	29	because to you has been given , as regards Christ , not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also ,
DARBY	Philippians	1	30	having the same conflict which ye have seen in me , and now hear of in me .
DARBY	Philippians	2	2	fulfil my joy , that ye may think the same thing , having the same love , joined in soul , thinking one thing ;
DARBY	Philippians	2	3	[ let ] nothing [ be ] in the spirit of strife or vain glory , but , in lowliness of mind , each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves ;
DARBY	Philippians	2	4	regarding not each his own [ qualities ] , but each those of others also .
DARBY	Philippians	2	5	For let this mind be in you which [ was ] also in Christ Jesus ;
DARBY	Philippians	2	6	who , subsisting in the form of God , did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God ;
DARBY	Philippians	2	7	but emptied himself , taking a bondman 's form , taking his place in [ the ] likeness of men ;
DARBY	Philippians	2	8	and having been found in figure as a man , humbled himself , becoming obedient even unto death , and [ that the ] death of [ the ] cross .
DARBY	Philippians	2	9	Wherefore also God highly exalted him , and granted him a name , that which is above every name ,
DARBY	Philippians	2	10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of heavenly and earthly and infernal [ beings ] ,
DARBY	Philippians	2	11	and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ [ is ] Lord to God [ the ] Father 's glory .
DARBY	Philippians	2	12	So that , my beloved , even as ye have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much rather in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling ,
DARBY	Philippians	2	13	for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to [ his ] good pleasure .
DARBY	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmurings and reasonings ,
DARBY	Philippians	2	15	that ye may be harmless and simple , irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation ; among whom ye appear as lights in [ the ] world ,
DARBY	Philippians	2	16	holding forth [ the ] word of life , so as to be a boast for me in Christ 's day , that I have not run in vain nor laboured in vain .
DARBY	Philippians	2	17	But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith , I rejoice , and rejoice in common with you all .
DARBY	Philippians	2	18	In like manner do * ye * also rejoice , and rejoice with me .
DARBY	Philippians	2	19	But I hope in [ the ] Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you shortly , that * I * also may be refreshed , knowing how ye get on .
DARBY	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on .
DARBY	Philippians	2	21	For all seek their own things , not the things of Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Philippians	2	22	But ye know the proof of him , that , as a child a father , he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings .
DARBY	Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send immediately , as soon as I shall see how it goes with me :
DARBY	Philippians	2	24	but I trust in [ the ] Lord that I myself also shall soon come ;
DARBY	Philippians	2	25	but I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier , but your messenger and minister to my need ,
DARBY	Philippians	2	26	since he had a longing desire after you all , and was distressed because ye had heard that he was sick ;
DARBY	Philippians	2	27	for he was also sick close to death , but God had mercy on him , and not indeed on him alone , but also on me , that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow .
DARBY	Philippians	2	28	I have sent him therefore the more diligently , that seeing him ye might again rejoice , and that * I * might be the less sorrowful .
DARBY	Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in [ the ] Lord with all joy , and hold such in honour ;
DARBY	Philippians	2	30	because for the sake of the work he drew near even to death , venturing his life that he might fill up what lacked in your ministration toward me .
DARBY	Philippians	3	3	For * we * are the circumcision , who worship by [ the ] Spirit of God , and boast in Christ Jesus , and do not trust in flesh .
DARBY	Philippians	3	2	See to dogs , see to evil workmen , see to the concision .
DARBY	Philippians	3	4	Though * I * have [ my ] trust even in flesh ; if any other think to trust in flesh , * I * rather :
DARBY	Philippians	3	5	as to circumcision , [ I received it ] the eighth day ; of [ the ] race of Israel , of [ the ] tribe of Benjamin , Hebrew of Hebrews ; as to [ the ] law , a Pharisee ;
DARBY	Philippians	3	6	as to zeal , persecuting the assembly ; as to righteousness which [ is ] in [ the ] law , found blameless ;
DARBY	Philippians	3	7	but what things were gain to me these I counted , on account of Christ , loss .
DARBY	Philippians	3	8	But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord , on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all , and count them to be filth , that I may gain Christ ;
DARBY	Philippians	3	9	and that I may be found in him , not having my righteousness , which [ would be ] on the principle of law , but that which is by faith of Christ , the righteousness which [ is ] of God through faith ,
DARBY	Philippians	3	10	to know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being conformed to his death ,
DARBY	Philippians	3	11	if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among [ the ] dead .
DARBY	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already obtained [ the prize ] , or am already perfected ; but I pursue , if also I may get possession [ of it ] , seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ [ Jesus ] .
DARBY	Philippians	3	13	Brethren , * I * do not count to have got possession myself ; but one thing—forgetting the things behind , and stretching out to the things before ,
DARBY	Philippians	3	14	I pursue , [ looking ] towards [ the ] goal , for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus .
DARBY	Philippians	3	15	As many therefore as [ are ] perfect , let us be thus minded ; and if ye are any otherwise minded , this also God shall reveal to you .
DARBY	Philippians	3	16	But whereto we have attained , [ let us ] walk in the same steps .
DARBY	Philippians	3	17	Be imitators [ all ] together of me , brethren , and fix your eyes on those walking thus as you have us for a model ;
DARBY	Philippians	3	18	( for many walk of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they [ are ] the enemies of the cross of Christ :
DARBY	Philippians	3	19	whose end [ is ] destruction , whose god [ is ] the belly , and [ their ] glory in their shame , who mind earthly things : )
DARBY	Philippians	3	20	for * our * commonwealth has its existence in [ the ] heavens , from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ [ as ] Saviour ,
DARBY	Philippians	3	21	who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory , according to the working of [ the ] power which he has even to subdue all things to himself .
DARBY	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in [ the ] Lord always : again I will say , Rejoice .
DARBY	Philippians	4	2	I exhort Euodia , and exhort Syntyche , to be of the same mind in [ the ] Lord ;
DARBY	Philippians	4	3	yea , I ask thee also , true yokefellow , assist them , who have contended along with me in the glad tidings , with Clement also , and my other fellow-labourers , whose names [ are ] in [ the ] book of life .
DARBY	Philippians	4	5	Let your gentleness be known of all men . The Lord [ is ] near .
DARBY	Philippians	4	6	Be careful about nothing ; but in everything , by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to God ;
DARBY	Philippians	4	7	and the peace of God , which surpasses every understanding , shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus .
DARBY	Philippians	4	8	For the rest , brethren , whatsoever things [ are ] true , whatsoever things [ are ] noble , whatsoever things [ are ] just , whatsoever things [ are ] pure , whatsoever things [ are ] amiable , whatsoever things [ are ] of good report ; if [ there be ] any virtue and if any praise , think on these things .
DARBY	Philippians	4	9	What ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , these things do ; and the God of peace shall be with you .
DARBY	Philippians	4	10	But I rejoiced in [ the ] Lord greatly , that now however at length ye have revived your thinking of me , though surely ye did also think [ of me ] , but lacked opportunity .
DARBY	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak as regards privation , for as to me * I * have learnt in those circumstances in which I am , to be satisfied in myself .
DARBY	Philippians	4	12	I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound . In everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer privation .
DARBY	Philippians	4	13	I have strength for all things in him that gives me power .
DARBY	Philippians	4	14	But ye have done well in taking part in my affliction .
DARBY	Philippians	4	15	And know also * ye * , O Philippians , that in [ the ] beginning of the gospel , when I came out of Macedonia , no assembly communicated [ anything ] to me in [ the ] way of giving and receiving save * ye * alone ;
DARBY	Philippians	4	16	for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me for my need .
DARBY	Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek gift , but I seek fruit abounding to your account .
DARBY	Philippians	4	18	But I have all things in full supply and abound ; I am full , having received of Epaphroditus the things [ sent ] from you , an odour of sweet savour , an acceptable sacrifice , agreeable to God .
DARBY	Philippians	4	19	But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
DARBY	Philippians	4	20	But to our God and Father [ be ] glory to the ages of ages . Amen .
DARBY	Philippians	4	21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus . The brethren who [ are ] with me salute you .
DARBY	Philippians	4	22	All the saints salute you , and specially those of the household of Caesar .
DARBY	Philippians	4	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with your spirit . Amen .
DARBY	Colossians	1	1	Paul , apostle of Christ Jesus , by God 's will , and Timotheus the brother ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	2	to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ which [ are ] in Colosse . Grace to you and peace from God our Father [ and Lord Jesus Christ ] .
DARBY	Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ continually [ when ] praying for you ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	4	having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and the love which ye have towards all the saints ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	5	on account of the hope which [ is ] laid up for you in the heavens ; of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the glad tidings ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	6	which are come to you , as [ they are ] in all the world , [ and ] are bearing fruit and growing , even as also among you , from the day ye heard [ them ] and knew indeed the grace of God , in truth :
DARBY	Colossians	1	7	even as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-bondman , who is a faithful minister of Christ for you ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	8	who has also manifested to us your love in [ the ] Spirit .
DARBY	Colossians	1	9	For this reason * we * also , from the day we heard [ of your faith and love ] , do not cease praying and asking for you , to the end that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of his will , in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	10	[ so as ] to walk worthily of the Lord unto all well-pleasing , bearing fruit in every good work , and growing by the true knowledge of God ;
DARBY	Colossians	1	11	strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy ;
DARBY	Colossians	1	12	giving thanks to the Father , who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	13	who has delivered us from the authority of darkness , and translated [ us ] into the kingdom of the Son of his love :
DARBY	Colossians	1	14	in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins ;
DARBY	Colossians	1	15	who is image of the invisible God , firstborn of all creation ;
DARBY	Colossians	1	16	because by him were created all things , the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth , the visible and the invisible , whether thrones , or lordships , or principalities , or authorities : all things have been created by him and for him .
DARBY	Colossians	1	17	And * he * is before all , and all things subsist together by him .
DARBY	Colossians	1	18	And * he * is the head of the body , the assembly ; who is [ the ] beginning , firstborn from among the dead , that * he * might have the first place in all things :
DARBY	Colossians	1	19	for in him all the fulness [ of the Godhead ] was pleased to dwell ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	20	and by him to reconcile all things to itself , having made peace by the blood of his cross—by him , whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens .
DARBY	Colossians	1	21	And you , who once were alienated and enemies in mind by wicked works , yet now has it reconciled
DARBY	Colossians	1	22	in the body of his flesh through death ; to present you holy and unblamable and irreproachable before it ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	23	if indeed ye abide in the faith founded and firm , and not moved away from the hope of the glad tidings , which ye have heard , which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which [ is ] under heaven , of which * I * Paul became minister .
DARBY	Colossians	1	24	Now , I rejoice in sufferings for you , and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh , for his body , which is the assembly ;
DARBY	Colossians	1	25	of which * I * became minister , according to the dispensation of God which [ is ] given me towards you to complete the word of God ,
DARBY	Colossians	1	26	the mystery which [ has been ] hidden from ages and from generations , but has now been made manifest to his saints ;
DARBY	Colossians	1	27	to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations , which is Christ in you the hope of glory :
DARBY	Colossians	1	28	whom * we * announce , admonishing every man , and teaching every man , in all wisdom , to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ .
DARBY	Colossians	1	29	Whereunto also I toil , combating according to his working , which works in me in power .
DARBY	Colossians	2	2	to the end that their hearts may be encouraged , being united together in love , and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding , to [ the ] full knowledge of the mystery of God ;
DARBY	Colossians	2	3	in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge .
DARBY	Colossians	2	4	And I say this to the end that no one may delude you by persuasive speech .
DARBY	Colossians	2	5	For if indeed in the flesh I am absent , yet I am with you in spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the firmness of your faith in Christ .
DARBY	Colossians	2	6	As therefore ye have received the Christ , Jesus the Lord , walk in him ,
DARBY	Colossians	2	7	rooted and built up in him , and assured in the faith , even as ye have been taught , abounding in it with thanksgiving .
DARBY	Colossians	2	8	See that there be no one who shall lead * you * away as a prey through philosophy and vain deceit , according to the teaching of men , according to the elements of the world , and not according to Christ .
DARBY	Colossians	2	9	For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily ;
DARBY	Colossians	2	10	and ye are complete in him , who is the head of all principality and authority ,
DARBY	Colossians	2	11	in whom also ye have been circumcised with circumcision not done by hand , in the putting off of the body of the flesh , in the circumcision of the Christ ;
DARBY	Colossians	2	12	buried with him in baptism , in which ye have been also raised with [ him ] through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead .
DARBY	Colossians	2	13	And you , being dead in offences and in the uncircumcision of your flesh , he has quickened together with him , having forgiven us all the offences ;
DARBY	Colossians	2	14	having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which [ stood out ] against us , which was contrary to us , he has taken it also out of the way , having nailed it to the cross ;
DARBY	Colossians	2	15	having spoiled principalities and authorities , he made a show of them publicly , leading them in triumph by it .
DARBY	Colossians	2	16	Let none therefore judge you in meat or in drink , or in matter of feast , or new moon , or sabbaths ,
DARBY	Colossians	2	17	which are a shadow of things to come ; but the body [ is ] of Christ .
DARBY	Colossians	2	18	Let no one fraudulently deprive you of your prize , doing his own will in humility and worship of angels , entering into things which he has not seen , vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh ,
DARBY	Colossians	2	19	and not holding fast the head , from whom all the body , ministered to and united together by the joints and bands , increases with the increase of God .
DARBY	Colossians	2	20	If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the world , why as [ if ] alive in [ the ] world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances ?
DARBY	Colossians	2	21	Do not handle , do not taste , do not touch ,
DARBY	Colossians	2	22	( things which are all for destruction in the using [ of them ] : ) according to the injunctions and teachings of men ,
DARBY	Colossians	2	23	( which have indeed an appearance of wisdom in voluntary worship , and humility , and harsh treatment of the body , not in a certain honour , ) to [ the ] satisfaction of the flesh .
DARBY	Colossians	3	3	for ye have died , and your life is hid with the Christ in God .
DARBY	Colossians	3	2	have your mind on the things [ that are ] above , not on the things [ that are ] on the earth ;
DARBY	Colossians	3	4	When the Christ is manifested who [ is ] our life , then shall * ye * also be manifested with him in glory .
DARBY	Colossians	3	5	Put to death therefore your members which [ are ] upon the earth , fornication , uncleanness , vile passions , evil lust , and unbridled desire , which is idolatry .
DARBY	Colossians	3	6	On account of which things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience .
DARBY	Colossians	3	7	In which * ye * also once walked when ye lived in these things .
DARBY	Colossians	3	8	But now , put off , * ye * also , all [ these ] things , wrath , anger , malice , blasphemy , vile language out of your mouth .
DARBY	Colossians	3	9	Do not lie to one another , having put off the old man with his deeds ,
DARBY	Colossians	3	10	and having put on the new , renewed into full knowledge according to [ the ] image of him that has created him ;
DARBY	Colossians	3	11	wherein there is not Greek and Jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , barbarian , Scythian , bondman , freeman ; but Christ [ is ] everything , and in all .
DARBY	Colossians	3	12	Put on therefore , as [ the ] elect of God , holy and beloved , bowels of compassion , kindness , lowliness , meekness , longsuffering ;
DARBY	Colossians	3	13	forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any should have a complaint against any ; even as the Christ has forgiven you , so also [ do ] * ye * .
DARBY	Colossians	3	14	And to all these [ add ] love , which is the bond of perfectness .
DARBY	Colossians	3	15	And let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts , to which also ye have been called in one body , and be thankful .
DARBY	Colossians	3	16	Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly , in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another , in psalms , hymns , spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to God .
DARBY	Colossians	3	17	And everything , whatever ye may do in word or in deed , [ do ] all things in [ the ] name of [ the ] Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father by him .
DARBY	Colossians	3	18	Wives , be subject to [ your ] husbands , as is fitting in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter against them .
DARBY	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in all things , for this is well-pleasing in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , do not vex your children , to the end that they be not disheartened .
DARBY	Colossians	3	22	Bondmen , obey in all things your masters according to flesh ; not with eye-services , as men-pleasers , but in simplicity of heart , fearing the Lord .
DARBY	Colossians	3	23	Whatsoever ye do , labour at it heartily , as [ doing it ] to the Lord , and not to men ;
DARBY	Colossians	3	24	knowing that of [ the ] Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance ; ye serve the Lord Christ .
DARBY	Colossians	3	25	For he that does a wrong shall receive the wrong he has done , and there is no respect of persons .
DARBY	Colossians	4	4	to the end that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak .
DARBY	Colossians	4	2	Persevere in prayer , watching in it with thanksgiving ;
DARBY	Colossians	4	3	praying at the same time for us also , that God may open to us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ , on account of which also I am bound ,
DARBY	Colossians	4	5	Walk in wisdom towards those without , redeeming opportunities .
DARBY	Colossians	4	6	[ Let ] your word [ be ] always with grace , seasoned with salt , [ so as ] to know how ye ought to answer each one .
DARBY	Colossians	4	7	Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-bondman in [ the ] Lord , will make known to you all that concerns me ;
DARBY	Colossians	4	8	whom I have sent to you for this very purpose , that he might know your state , and that he might encourage your hearts :
DARBY	Colossians	4	9	with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is [ one ] of you . They shall make known to you everything here .
DARBY	Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus my fellow-captive salutes you , and Mark , Barnabas 's cousin , concerning whom ye have received orders , ( if he come to you , receive him , )
DARBY	Colossians	4	11	and Jesus called Justus , who are of the circumcision . These [ are the ] only fellow-workers for the kingdom of God who have been a consolation to me .
DARBY	Colossians	4	12	Epaphras , who is [ one ] of you , [ the ] bondman of Christ Jesus , salutes you , always combating earnestly for you in prayers , to the end that ye may stand perfect and complete in all [ the ] will of God .
DARBY	Colossians	4	13	For I bear him witness that he labours much for you , and them in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis .
DARBY	Colossians	4	14	Luke , the beloved physician , salutes you , and Demas .
DARBY	Colossians	4	15	Salute the brethren in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the assembly which [ is ] in his house .
DARBY	Colossians	4	16	And when the letter has been read among you , cause that it be read also in the assembly of Laodiceans , and that * ye * also read that from Laodicea .
DARBY	Colossians	4	17	And say to Archippus , Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in [ the ] Lord , to the end that thou fulfil it .
DARBY	Colossians	4	18	The salutation by the hand of me Paul . Remember my bonds . Grace [ be ] with you .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of Thessalonians in God [ the ] Father and [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ . Grace to you and peace .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	2	We give thanks to God always for you all , making mention of you at our prayers ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	3	remembering unceasingly your work of faith , and labour of love , and enduring constancy of hope , of our Lord Jesus Christ , before our God and Father ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	knowing , brethren beloved by God , your election .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	For our glad tidings were not with you in word only , but also in power , and in [ the ] Holy Spirit , and in much assurance ; even as ye know what we were among you for your sakes :
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	and * ye * became our imitators , and of the Lord , having accepted the word in much tribulation with joy of [ the ] Holy Spirit ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	so that ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia :
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	for the word of the Lord sounded out from you , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but in every place your faith which [ is ] towards God has gone abroad , so that we have no need to say anything ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	for they themselves relate concerning us what entering in we had to you , and how ye turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	1	10	and to await his Son from the heavens , whom he raised from among the dead , Jesus , our deliverer from the coming wrath .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	1	Thessalonians
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	but , having suffered before and been insulted , even as ye know , in Philippi , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the glad tidings of God with much earnest striving .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation [ was ] not of deceit , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	but even as we have been approved of God to have the glad tidings entrusted to us , so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , who proves our hearts .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	For we have not at any time been [ among you ] with flattering discourse , even as ye know , nor with a pretext for covetousness , God [ is ] witness ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	nor seeking glory from men , neither from you nor from others , when we might have been a charge as Christ 's apostles ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	but have been gentle in the midst of you , as a nurse would cherish her own children .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	Thus , yearning over you , we had found our delight in having imparted to you not only the glad tidings of God , but our own lives also , because ye had become beloved of us .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	For ye remember , brethren , our labour and toil : working night and day , not to be chargeable to any one of you , we have preached to you the glad tidings of God .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	* Ye * [ are ] witnesses , and God , how piously and righteously and blamelessly we have conducted ourselves with you that believe :
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	as ye know how , as a father his own children , we used to exhort each one of you , and comfort and testify ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	that ye should walk worthy of God , who calls you to his own kingdom and glory .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	And for this cause we also give thanks to God unceasingly that , having received [ the ] word of [ the ] report of God by us , ye accepted , not men 's word , but , even as it is truly , God 's word , which also works in you who believe .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For * ye * , brethren , have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus ; for * ye * also have suffered the same things of your own countrymen as also * they * of the Jews ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	who have both slain the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and have driven us out by persecution , and do not please God , and [ are ] against all men ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	forbidding us to speak to the nations that they may be saved , that they may fill up their sins always : but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	But we , brethren , having been bereaved of you and separated for a little moment in person , not in heart , have used more abundant diligence to see your face with much desire ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	wherefore we have desired to come to you , even I Paul , both once and twice , and Satan has hindered us .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For what [ is ] our hope , or joy , or crown of boasting ? [ are ] not * ye * also before our Lord Jesus at his coming ?
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	for ye are our glory and joy .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	1	Thessalonians
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	that no one might be moved by these afflictions . ( For yourselves know that we are set for this ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	and sent Timotheus , our brother and fellow-workman under God in the glad tidings of Christ , to confirm you and encourage [ you ] concerning your faith ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	for also , when we were with you , we told you beforehand we are about to be in tribulation , even as also it came to pass , and ye know . )
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	For this reason * I * also , no longer able to refrain myself , sent to know your faith , lest perhaps the tempter had tempted you and our labour should be come to nothing .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But Timotheus having just come to us from you , and brought to us the glad tidings of your faith and love , and that ye have always good remembrance of us , desiring much to see us , even as we also you ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	for this reason we have been comforted in you , brethren , in all our distress and tribulation , through your faith ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	because now we live if * ye * stand firm in [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you , for all the joy wherewith we rejoice on account of you before our God ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	night and day beseeching exceedingly to the end that we may see your face , and perfect what is lacking in your faith ?
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	But our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus , direct our way to you .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	But you , may the Lord make to exceed and abound in love toward one another , and toward all , even as we also towards you ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	3	13	in order to the confirming of your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	1	Thessalonians
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	4	that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honour ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For ye know what charges we gave you through the Lord Jesus .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	For this is [ the ] will of God , [ even ] your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	( not in passionate desire , even as the nations who know not God , )
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	not overstepping the rights of and wronging his brother in the matter , because the Lord [ is ] the avenger of all these things , even as we also told you before , and have fully testified .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For God has not called us to uncleanness , but in sanctification .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	He therefore that [ in this ] disregards [ his brother ] , disregards , not man , but God , who has given also his Holy Spirit to you .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	Now concerning brotherly love ye have no need that we should write to you , for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	For also ye do this towards all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia ; but we exhort you , brethren , to abound still more ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	and to seek earnestly to be quiet and mind your own affairs , and work with your [ own ] hands , even as we charged you ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	that ye may walk reputably towards those without , and may have need of no one .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	But we do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them that are fallen asleep , to the end that ye be not grieved even as also the rest who have no hope .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus has died and has risen again , so also God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	( For this we say to you in [ the ] word of [ the ] Lord , that * we * , the living , who remain to the coming of the Lord , are in no way to anticipate those who have fallen asleep ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	for the Lord himself , with an assembling shout , with archangel 's voice and with trump of God , shall descend from heaven ; and the dead in Christ shall rise first ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	then * we * , the living who remain , shall be caught up together with them in [ the ] clouds , to meet the Lord in [ the ] air ; and thus we shall be always with [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	So encourage one another with these words . )
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	1	Thessalonians
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	5	for all * ye * are sons of light and sons of day ; we are not of night nor of darkness .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	for ye know perfectly well yourselves , that the day of [ the ] Lord so comes as a thief by night .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	When they may say , Peace and safety , then sudden destruction comes upon them , as travail upon her that is with child ; and they shall in no wise escape .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But * ye * , brethren , are not in darkness , that the day should overtake you as a thief :
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	So then do not let us sleep as the rest do , but let us watch and be sober ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	for they that sleep sleep by night , and they that drink drink by night ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	but * we * being of [ the ] day , let us be sober , putting on [ the ] breastplate of faith and love , and as helmet [ the ] hope of salvation ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	because God has not set us for wrath , but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	who has died for us , that whether we may be watching or sleep , we may live together with him .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	11	Wherefore encourage one another , and build up each one the other , even as also ye do .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	But we beg you , brethren , to know those who labour among you , and take the lead among you in [ the ] Lord , and admonish you ,
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	13	and to regard them exceedingly in love on account of their work . Be in peace among yourselves .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	14	But we exhort you , brethren , admonish the disorderly , comfort the faint-hearted , sustain the weak , be patient towards all .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	15	See that no one render to any evil for evil , but pursue always what is good towards one another and towards all ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	16	rejoice always ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	17	pray unceasingly ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	18	in everything give thanks , for this is [ the ] will of God in Christ Jesus towards you ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	19	quench not the Spirit ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	20	do not lightly esteem prophecies ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	21	but prove all things , hold fast the right ;
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	22	hold aloof from every form of wickedness .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	23	Now the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly : and your whole spirit , and soul , and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	24	He [ is ] faithful who calls you , who will also perform [ it ] .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren , pray for us .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	27	I adjure you by the Lord that the letter be read to all the [ holy ] brethren .
DARBY	1%20Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with you .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	2	Grace to you , and peace from God our Father , and [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father and [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We ought to thank God always for you , brethren , even as it is meet , because your faith increases exceedingly , and the love of each one of you all towards one another abounds ;
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	so that we ourselves make our boast in you in the assemblies of God for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations , which ye are sustaining ;
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , to the end that ye should be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for the sake of which ye also suffer ;
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	if at least [ it is a ] righteous thing with God to render tribulation to those that trouble you ,
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and to you that are troubled repose with us , at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven , with [ the ] angels of his power ,
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God , and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	who shall pay the penalty [ of ] everlasting destruction from [ the ] presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his might ,
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	when he shall have come to be glorified in his saints , and wondered at in all that have believed , ( for our testimony to you has been believed , ) in that day .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	To which end we also pray always for you , that our God may count you worthy of the calling , and fulfil all [ the ] good pleasure of [ his ] goodness and [ the ] work of faith with power ,
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	so that the name of our Lord Jesus [ Christ ] may be glorified in you and * ye * in him , according to the grace of our God , and of [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	2	that ye be not soon shaken in mind , nor troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter , as [ if it were ] by us , as that the day of the Lord is present .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Let not any one deceive you in any manner , because [ it will not be ] unless the apostasy have first come , and the man of sin have been revealed , the son of perdition ;
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	who opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God , or object of veneration ; so that he himself sits down in the temple of God , shewing himself that he is God .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Do ye not remember that , being yet with you , I said these things to you ?
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And now ye know that which restrains , that he should be revealed in his own time .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of lawlessness already works ; only [ there is ] he who restrains now until he be gone ,
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	and then the lawless one shall be revealed , whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth , and shall annul by the appearing of his coming ;
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood ,
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish , because they have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	And for this reason God sends to them a working of error , that they should believe what is false ,
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	that all might be judged who have not believed the truth , but have found pleasure in unrighteousness .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	But we ought to give thanks to God always for you , brethren beloved of [ the ] Lord , that God has chosen you from [ the ] beginning to salvation in sanctification of [ the ] Spirit and belief of [ the ] truth :
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	whereto he has called you by our glad tidings , to [ the ] obtaining of [ the ] glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	So then , brethren , stand firm , and hold fast the instructions which ye have been taught , whether by word or by our letter .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	But our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and our God and Father , who has loved us , and given [ us ] eternal consolation and good hope by grace ,
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	2	17	encourage your hearts , and establish you in every good work and word .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	2	and that we may be delivered from bad and evil men , for faith [ is ] not [ the portion ] of all .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful , who shall establish you and keep [ you ] from evil .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	But we trust in the Lord as to you , that the things which we enjoin , ye both do and will do .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	But the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patience of the Christ .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Now we enjoin you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the instruction which he received from us .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For ye know yourselves how ye ought to imitate us , because we have not walked disorderly among you ;
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	nor have we eaten bread from any one without cost ; but in toil and hardship working night and day not to be chargeable to any one of you :
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	not that we have not the right , but that we might give ourselves as an example to you , in order to your imitating us .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For also when we were with you we enjoined you this , that if any man does not like to work , neither let him eat .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear that [ there are ] some walking among you disorderly , not working at all , but busybodies .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now such we enjoin and exhort in [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ , that working quietly they eat their own bread .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	But * ye * , brethren , do not faint in well-doing .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	But if any one obey not our word by the letter , mark that man , and do not keep company with him , that he may be ashamed of himself ;
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	and do not esteem him as an enemy , but admonish [ him ] as a brother .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	But the Lord of peace himself give you peace continually in every way . The Lord [ be ] with you all .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	17	The salutation by the hand of me , Paul , which is [ the ] mark in every letter ; so I write .
DARBY	2%20Thessalonians	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with you all .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , apostle of Jesus Christ , according to [ the ] command of God our Saviour , and of Christ Jesus our hope ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	2	to Timotheus , [ my ] true child in faith : grace , mercy , peace , from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	3	Even as I begged thee to remain in Ephesus , [ when I was ] going to Macedonia , that thou mightest enjoin some not to teach other doctrines ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	4	nor to turn their minds to fables and interminable genealogies , which bring questionings rather than [ further ] God 's dispensation , which [ is ] in faith .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	5	But the end of what is enjoined is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	6	which [ things ] some having missed , have turned aside to vain discourse ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	7	desiring to be law-teachers , not understanding either what they say or concerning what they [ so ] strenuously affirm .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	8	Now we know that the law [ is ] good if any one uses it lawfully ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	9	knowing this , that law has not its application to a righteous person , but to [ the ] lawless and insubordinate , to [ the ] impious and sinful , to [ the ] unholy and profane , to smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers ; to murderers ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	10	fornicators , sodomites , kidnappers , liars , perjurers ; and if any other thing is opposed to sound teaching ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	11	according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God , with which * I * have been entrusted .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	12	[ And ] I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me power , that he has counted me faithful , appointing to ministry him
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	13	who before was a blasphemer and persecutor , and an insolent overbearing [ man ] : but mercy was shewn me because I did it ignorantly , in unbelief .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	14	But the grace of our Lord surpassingly over-abounded with faith and love , which [ is ] in Christ Jesus .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	15	Faithful [ is ] the word , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , of whom * I * am [ the ] first .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	16	But for this reason mercy was shewn me , that in me , [ the ] first , Jesus Christ might display the whole long-suffering , for a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now to the King of the ages , [ the ] incorruptible , invisible , only God , honour and glory to the ages of ages . Amen .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	18	This charge , [ my ] child Timotheus , I commit to thee , according to the prophecies as to thee preceding , in order that thou mightest war by them the good warfare ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	19	maintaining faith and a good conscience ; which [ last ] some , having put away , have made shipwreck as to faith ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	1	20	of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have delivered to Satan , that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	2	for kings and all that are in dignity , that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	3	for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	4	who desires that all men should be saved and come to [ the ] knowledge of [ the ] truth .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	5	For God is one , and [ the ] mediator of God and men one , [ the ] man Christ Jesus ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	6	who gave himself a ransom for all , the testimony [ to be rendered ] in its own times ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	7	to which * I * have been appointed a herald and apostle , ( I speak [ the ] truth , I do not lie , ) a teacher of [ the ] nations in faith and truth .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	8	I will therefore that the men pray in every place , lifting up pious hands , without wrath or reasoning .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	9	In like manner also that the women in decent deportment and dress adorn themselves with modesty and discretion , not with plaited [ hair ] and gold , or pearls , or costly clothing ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	10	but , what becomes women making profession of the fear of God , by good works .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	12	but I do not suffer a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over man , but to be in quietness ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	13	for Adam was formed first , then Eve :
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	14	and Adam was not deceived ; but the woman , having been deceived , was in transgression .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	2	15	But she shall be preserved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and love and holiness with discretion .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	1	Timothy
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	3	not given to excesses from wine , not a striker , but mild , not addicted to contention , not fond of money ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	2	The overseer then must be irreproachable , husband of one wife , sober , discreet , decorous , hospitable , apt to teach ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	4	conducting his own house well , having [ his ] children in subjection with all gravity ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	5	( but if one does not know how to conduct his own house , how shall he take care of the assembly of God ? )
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	6	not a novice , that he may not , being inflated , fall into [ the ] fault of the devil .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	7	But it is necessary that he should have also a good testimony from those without , that he may fall not into reproach and [ the ] snare of the devil .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	8	Ministers , in like manner , grave , not double-tongued , not given to much wine , not seeking gain by base means ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	9	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	10	And let these be first proved , then let them minister , being without charge [ against them ] .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	11	[ The ] women in like manner grave , not slanderers , sober , faithful in all things .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	12	Let [ the ] ministers be husbands of one wife , conducting [ their ] children and their own houses well :
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	13	for those who shall have ministered well obtain for themselves a good degree , and much boldness in faith which [ is ] in Christ Jesus .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	14	These things I write to thee , hoping to come to thee more quickly ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	15	but if I delay , in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God 's house , which is [ the ] assembly of [ the ] living God , [ the ] pillar and base of the truth .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	3	16	And confessedly the mystery of piety is great . God has been manifested in flesh , has been justified in [ the ] Spirit , has appeared to angels , has been preached among [ the ] nations , has been believed on in [ the ] world , has been received up in glory .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God [ is ] good , and nothing [ is ] to be rejected , being received with thanksgiving ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	2	speaking lies in hypocrisy , cauterised as to their own conscience ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	3	forbidding to marry , [ bidding ] to abstain from meats , which God has created for receiving with thanksgiving for them who are faithful and know the truth .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	5	for it is sanctified by God 's word and freely addressing [ him ] .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	6	Laying these things before the brethren , thou wilt be a good minister of Christ Jesus , nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which thou hast fully followed up .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	7	But profane and old wives ' fables avoid , but exercise thyself unto piety ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	8	for bodily exercise is profitable for a little , but piety is profitable for everything , having promise of life , of the present one , and of that to come .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	9	The word [ is ] faithful and worthy of all acceptation ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	10	for , for this we labour and suffer reproach , because we hope in a living God , who is preserver of all men , specially of those that believe .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	11	Enjoin and teach these things .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	12	Let no one despise thy youth , but be a model of the believers , in word , in conduct , in love , in faith , in purity .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	13	Till I come , give thyself to reading , to exhortation , to teaching .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	14	Be not negligent of the gift [ that is ] in thee , which has been given to thee through prophecy , with imposition of the hands of the elderhood .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	15	Occupy thyself with these things ; be wholly in them , that thy progress may be manifest to all .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	4	16	Give heed to thyself and to the teaching ; continue in them ; for , doing this , thou shalt save both thyself and those that hear thee .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	5	Now she who [ is ] a widow indeed , and is left alone , has put [ her ] hope in God , and continues in supplications and prayers night and day .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	2	elder women as mothers , younger women as sisters , with all purity .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	3	Honour widows who are really widows ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	4	but if any widow have children or descendants , let them learn first to be pious as regards their own house , and to render a return on their side to [ their ] parents ; for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	6	But she that lives in habits of self-indulgence is dead [ while ] living .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	7	And these things enjoin , that they may be irreproachable .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if any one does not provide for his own , and specially for those of [ his ] house , he has denied the faith , and is worse than the unbeliever .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	9	Let a widow be put upon the list , being of not less than sixty years , [ having been ] wife of one man ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	10	borne witness to in good works , if she have brought up children , if she have exercised hospitality , if she have washed saints ' feet , if she have imparted relief to the distressed , if she have diligently followed every good work .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	11	But younger widows decline ; for when they grow wanton against Christ , they desire to marry ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	12	being guilty , because they have cast off their first faith .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	13	And , at the same time , they learn also [ to be ] idle , going about to people 's houses ; and not only idle , but also gossipers and meddlers , speaking things not becoming .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	14	I will therefore that the younger marry , bear children , rule the house , give no occasion to the adversary in respect of reproach .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	15	For already some have turned aside after Satan .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any believing man or woman have widows , let them impart relief to them , and let not the assembly be charged , that it may impart relief to those [ that are ] widows indeed .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	17	Let the elders who take the lead [ among the saints ] well be esteemed worthy of double honour , specially those labouring in word and teaching ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	18	for the scripture says , Thou shalt not muzzle an ox that treadeth out corn , and , The workman [ is ] worthy of his hire .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	19	Against an elder receive not an accusation unless where there are two or three witnesses .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	20	Those that sin convict before all , that the rest also may have fear .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	21	I testify before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels , that thou keep these things without prejudice , doing nothing by favour .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	22	Lay hands quickly on no man , nor partake in others ' sins . Keep thyself pure .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	23	Drink no longer only water , but use a little wine on account of thy stomach and thy frequent illnesses .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	24	Of some men the sins are manifest beforehand , going before to judgment , and some also they follow after .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	5	25	In like manner good works also are manifest beforehand , and those that are otherwise can not be hid .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	6	But piety with contentment * is * great gain .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	2	And they that have believing masters , let them not despise [ them ] because they are brethren ; but let them the rather serve them with subjection , because they are faithful and beloved , who profit by the good and ready service [ rendered ] . These things teach and exhort .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	3	If any one teach differently , and do not accede to sound words , those of our Lord Jesus Christ , and the teaching which [ is ] according to piety ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	4	he is puffed up , knowing nothing , but sick about questions and disputes of words , out of which arise envy , strife , injurious words , evil suspicions ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	5	constant quarrellings of men corrupted in mind and destitute of the truth , holding gain to be [ the end of ] piety .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	7	For we have brought nothing into the world : [ it is ] [ manifest ] that neither can we carry anything out .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	8	But having sustenance and covering , we will be content with these .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	9	But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare , and many unwise and hurtful lusts , which plunge men into destruction and ruin .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is [ the ] root of every evil ; which some having aspired after , have wandered from the faith , and pierced themselves with many sorrows .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	11	But * thou * , O man of God , flee these things , and pursue righteousness , piety , faith , love , endurance , meekness of spirit .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	12	Strive earnestly [ in ] the good conflict of faith . Lay hold of eternal life , to which thou hast been called , and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	13	I enjoin thee before God who preserves all things in life , and Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	14	that thou keep the commandment spotless , irreproachable , until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	15	which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall shew , the King of those that reign , and Lord of those that exercise lordship ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	16	who only has immortality , dwelling in unapproachable light ; whom no man has seen , nor is able to see ; to whom [ be ] honour and eternal might . Amen .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	17	Enjoin on those rich in the present age not to be high-minded , nor to trust on the uncertainty of riches ; but in the God who affords us all things richly for [ our ] enjoyment ;
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	18	to do good , to be rich in good works , to be liberal in distributing , disposed to communicate [ of their substance ] ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	19	laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future , that they may lay hold of [ what is ] really life .
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	20	O Timotheus , keep the entrusted deposit , avoiding profane , vain babblings , and oppositions of false-named knowledge ,
DARBY	1%20Timothy	6	21	of which some having made profession , have missed the faith . Grace [ be ] with thee .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	2	to Timotheus , [ my ] beloved child : grace , mercy , peace , from God [ the ] Father , and Christ Jesus our Lord .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , apostle of Jesus Christ by God 's will , according to promise of life , the [ life ] which [ is ] in Christ Jesus ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	3	I am thankful to God , whom I serve from [ my ] forefathers with pure conscience , how unceasingly I have the remembrance of thee in my supplications night and day ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	4	earnestly desiring to see thee , remembering thy tears , that I may be filled with joy ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	5	calling to mind the unfeigned faith which [ has been ] in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and in thy mother Eunice , and I am persuaded that in thee also .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	6	For which cause I put thee in mind to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	7	For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice , but of power , and of love , and of wise discretion .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	8	Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner ; but suffer evil along with the glad tidings , according to the power of God ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	9	who has saved us , and has called us with a holy calling , not according to our works , but according to [ his ] own purpose and grace , which [ was ] given to us in Christ Jesus before [ the ] ages of time ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	10	but has been made manifest now by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ , who has annulled death , and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	11	to which * I * have been appointed a herald and apostle and teacher of [ the ] nations .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	12	For which cause also I suffer these things ; but I am not ashamed ; for I know whom I have believed , and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	13	Have an outline of sound words , which [ words ] thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which [ are ] in Christ Jesus .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	14	Keep , by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us , the good deposit entrusted .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	15	Thou knowest this , that all who [ are ] in Asia , of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes , have turned away from me .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	16	The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus , for he has often refreshed me , and has not been ashamed of my chain ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	17	but being in Rome sought me out very diligently , and found [ me ] —
DARBY	2%20Timothy	1	18	the Lord grant to him to find mercy from [ the ] Lord in that day—and how much service he rendered in Ephesus * thou * knowest best .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	2	And the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses , these entrust to faithful men , such as shall be competent to instruct others also .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	3	Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	4	No one going as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life , that he may please him who has enlisted him as a soldier .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	5	And if also any one contend [ in the games ] , he is not crowned unless he contend lawfully .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	6	The husbandman must labour before partaking of the fruits .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	7	Think of what I say , for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ raised from among [ the ] dead , of [ the ] seed of David , according to my glad tidings ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	9	in which I suffer even unto bonds as an evil-doer : but the word of God is not bound .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	10	For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect , that * they * also may obtain the salvation which [ is ] in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	11	The word [ is ] faithful ; for if we have died together with [ him ] , we shall also live together ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	12	if we endure , we shall also reign together ; if we deny , * he * also will deny us ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	13	if we are unfaithful , * he * abides faithful , for he can not deny himself .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	14	Of these things put in remembrance , testifying earnestly before the Lord not to have disputes of words , profitable for nothing , to the subversion of the hearers .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	15	Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God , a workman that has not to be ashamed , cutting in a straight line the word of truth .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	16	But profane , vain babblings shun , for they will advance to greater impiety ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	17	and their word will spread as a gangrene ; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	18	[ men ] who as to the truth have gone astray , saying that the resurrection has taken place already ; and overthrow the faith of some .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	19	Yet the firm foundation of God stands , having this seal , [ The ] Lord knows those that are his ; and , Let every one who names the name of [ the ] Lord withdraw from iniquity .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	20	But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels , but also wooden and earthen ; and some to honour , and some to dishonour .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	21	If therefore one shall have purified himself from these , [ in separating himself from them ] , he shall be a vessel to honour , sanctified , serviceable to the Master , prepared for every good work .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	22	But youthful lusts flee , and pursue righteousness , faith , love , peace , with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	23	But foolish and senseless questionings avoid , knowing that they beget contentions .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	24	And a bondman of [ the ] Lord ought not to contend , but be gentle towards all ; apt to teach ; forbearing ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	25	in meekness setting right those who oppose , if God perhaps may sometime give them repentance to acknowledgment of [ the ] truth ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	2	26	and that they may awake up out of the snare of the devil , [ who are ] taken by him , for * his * will .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	2	for men shall be lovers of self , lovers of money , boastful , arrogant , evil speakers , disobedient to parents , ungrateful , profane ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	3	without natural affection , implacable , slanderers , of unsubdued passions , savage , having no love for what is good ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	4	traitors , headlong , of vain pretensions , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	5	having a form of piety but denying the power of it : and from these turn away .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	6	For of these are they who are getting into houses , and leading captive silly women , laden with sins , led by various lusts ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	7	always learning , and never able to come to [ the ] knowledge of [ the ] truth .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	8	Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses , thus these also withstand the truth ; men corrupted in mind , found worthless as regards the faith .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they shall not advance farther ; for their folly shall be completely manifest to all , as that of those also became .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	10	But * thou * hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching , conduct , purpose , faith , longsuffering , love , endurance ,
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	11	persecutions , sufferings : what [ sufferings ] happened to me in Antioch , in Iconium , in Lystra ; what persecutions I endured ; and the Lord delivered me out of all .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	12	And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	13	But wicked men and juggling impostors shall advance in evil , leading and being led astray .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	14	But * thou * , abide in those things which thou hast learned , and [ of which ] thou hast been fully persuaded , knowing of whom thou hast learned [ them ] ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	15	and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation , through faith which [ is ] in Christ Jesus .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	16	Every scripture [ is ] divinely inspired , and profitable for teaching , for conviction , for correction , for instruction in righteousness ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	3	17	that the man of God may be complete , fully fitted to every good work .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	2	proclaim the word ; be urgent in season [ and ] out of season , convict , rebuke , encourage , with all longsuffering and doctrine .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	4	and they will turn away their ear from the truth , and will have turned aside to fables .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	3	For the time shall be when they will not bear sound teaching ; but according to their own lusts will heap up to themselves teachers , having an itching ear ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	5	But * thou * , be sober in all things , bear evils , do [ the ] work of an evangelist , fill up the full measure of thy ministry .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	6	For * I * am already being poured out , and the time of my release is come .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	7	I have combated the good combat , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	8	Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will render to me in that day ; but not only to me , but also to all who love his appearing .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	9	Use diligence to come to me quickly ;
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	10	for Demas has forsaken me , having loved the present age , and is gone to Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	11	Luke alone is with me . Take Mark , and bring [ him ] with thyself , for he is serviceable to me for ministry .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	12	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	13	The cloak which I left behind [ me ] in Troas at Carpus 's , bring when thou comest , and the books , especially the parchments .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	14	Alexander the smith did many evil things against me . The Lord will render to him according to his works .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	15	Against whom be * thou * also on thy guard , for he has greatly withstood our words .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	16	At my first defence no man stood with me , but all deserted me . May it not be imputed to them .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stood with [ me ] , and gave me power , that through me the proclamation might be fully made , and all [ those of ] the nations should hear ; and I was delivered out of the lion 's mouth .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	18	The Lord shall deliver me from every wicked work , and shall preserve [ me ] for his heavenly kingdom ; to whom [ be ] glory for the ages of ages . Amen .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	19	Salute Prisca and Aquila , and the house of Onesiphorus .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	20	Erastus remained in Corinth , but Trophimus I left behind in Miletus sick .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	21	Use diligence to come before winter . Eubulus salutes thee , and Pudens , and Linus , and Claudia , and the brethren all .
DARBY	2%20Timothy	4	22	The Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with your spirit . Grace [ be ] with you .
DARBY	Titus	1	1	Paul , bondman of God , and apostle of Jesus Christ according to [ the ] faith of God 's elect , and knowledge of [ the ] truth which [ is ] according to piety ;
DARBY	Titus	1	2	in [ the ] hope of eternal life , which God , who can not lie , promised before the ages of time ,
DARBY	Titus	1	3	but has manifested in its own due season his word , in [ the ] proclamation with which * I * have been entrusted , according to [ the ] commandment of our Saviour God ;
DARBY	Titus	1	4	to Titus , my own child according to [ the ] faith common [ to us ] : Grace and peace from God [ the ] Father , and Christ Jesus our Saviour .
DARBY	Titus	1	5	For this cause I left thee in Crete , that thou mightest go on to set right what remained [ unordered ] , and establish elders in each city , as * I * had ordered thee :
DARBY	Titus	1	6	if any one be free from all charge [ against him ] , husband of one wife , having believing children not accused of excess or unruly .
DARBY	Titus	1	7	For the overseer must be free from all charge [ against him ] as God 's steward ; not headstrong , not passionate , not disorderly through wine , not a striker , not seeking gain by base means ;
DARBY	Titus	1	8	but hospitable , a lover of goodness , discreet , just , pious , temperate ,
DARBY	Titus	1	9	clinging to the faithful word according to the doctrine taught , that he may be able both to encourage with sound teaching and refute gainsayers .
DARBY	Titus	1	10	For there are many and disorderly vain speakers and deceivers of people 's minds , specially those of [ the ] circumcision ,
DARBY	Titus	1	11	who must have their mouths stopped , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which ought not [ to be taught ] for the sake of base gain .
DARBY	Titus	1	12	One of themselves , a prophet of their own , has said , Cretans are always liars , evil wild beasts , lazy gluttons .
DARBY	Titus	1	13	This testimony is true ; for which cause rebuke them severely , that they may be sound in the faith ,
DARBY	Titus	1	14	not turning [ their ] minds to Jewish fables and commandments of men turning away from the truth .
DARBY	Titus	1	15	All things [ are ] pure to the pure ; but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing [ is ] pure ; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled .
DARBY	Titus	1	16	They profess to know God , but in works deny [ him ] , being abominable , and disobedient , and found worthless as to every good work .
DARBY	Titus	2	2	that the elder men be sober , grave , discreet , sound in faith , in love , in patience ;
DARBY	Titus	2	3	that the elder women in like manner be in deportment as becoming those who have to say to sacred things , not slanderers , not enslaved to much wine , teachers of what is right ;
DARBY	Titus	2	4	that they may admonish the young women to be attached to [ their ] husbands , to be attached to [ their ] children ,
DARBY	Titus	2	5	discreet , chaste , diligent in home work , good , subject to their own husbands , that the word of God may not be evil spoken of .
DARBY	Titus	2	6	The younger men in like manner exhort to be discreet :
DARBY	Titus	2	7	in all things affording thyself as a pattern of good works ; in teaching uncorruptedness , gravity ,
DARBY	Titus	2	8	a sound word , not to be condemned ; that he who is opposed may be ashamed , having no evil thing to say about us :
DARBY	Titus	2	9	bondmen to be subject to their own masters , to make themselves acceptable in everything ; not gainsaying ;
DARBY	Titus	2	10	not robbing [ their masters ] , but shewing all good fidelity , that they may adorn the teaching which [ is ] of our Saviour God in all things .
DARBY	Titus	2	11	For the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared ,
DARBY	Titus	2	12	teaching us that , having denied impiety and worldly lusts , we should live soberly , and justly , and piously in the present course of things ,
DARBY	Titus	2	13	awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ ;
DARBY	Titus	2	14	who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all lawlessness , and purify to himself a peculiar people , zealous for good works .
DARBY	Titus	2	15	These things speak , and exhort , and rebuke with all authority . Let no one despise thee .
DARBY	Titus	3	3	For we were once ourselves also without intelligence , disobedient , wandering in error , serving various lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , [ and ] hating one another .
DARBY	Titus	3	2	to speak evil of no one , not to be contentious , [ to be ] mild , shewing all meekness towards all men .
DARBY	Titus	3	4	But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared ,
DARBY	Titus	3	5	not on the principle of works which [ have been done ] in righteousness which * we * had done , but according to his own mercy he saved us through [ the ] washing of regeneration and renewal of [ the ] Holy Spirit ,
DARBY	Titus	3	6	which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour ;
DARBY	Titus	3	7	that , having been justified by * his * grace , we should become heirs according to [ the ] hope of eternal life .
DARBY	Titus	3	8	The word [ is ] faithful , and I desire that thou insist strenuously on these things , that they who have believed God may take care to pay diligent attention to good works . These things are good and profitable to men .
DARBY	Titus	3	9	But foolish questions , and genealogies , and strifes , and contentions about the law , shun ; for they are unprofitable and vain .
DARBY	Titus	3	10	An heretical man after a first and second admonition have done with ,
DARBY	Titus	3	11	knowing that such a one is perverted , and sins , being self-condemned .
DARBY	Titus	3	12	When I shall send Artemas to thee , or Tychicus , use diligence to come to me to Nicopolis ; for I have decided to winter there .
DARBY	Titus	3	13	Zenas the lawyer and Apollos set forward diligently on their way , that nothing may be lacking to them ;
DARBY	Titus	3	14	and let ours also learn to apply themselves to good works for necessary wants , that they may not be unfruitful .
DARBY	Titus	3	15	All with me salute thee . Salute those who love us in [ the ] faith . Grace [ be ] with you all .
DARBY	Philemon	1	1	Paul , prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timotheus the brother , to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman ,
DARBY	Philemon	1	2	and to the sister Apphia and to Archippus our fellow-soldier , and to the assembly which [ is ] in thine house .
DARBY	Philemon	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Philemon	1	4	I thank my God , always making mention of thee at my prayers ,
DARBY	Philemon	1	5	hearing of thy love and the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus , and towards all the saints ,
DARBY	Philemon	1	6	in such sort that thy participation in the faith should become operative in the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in us towards Christ [ Jesus ] .
DARBY	Philemon	1	7	For we have great thankfulness and encouragement through thy love , because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee , brother .
DARBY	Philemon	1	8	Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to enjoin thee what is fitting ,
DARBY	Philemon	1	9	for love 's sake I rather exhort , being such a one as Paul the aged , and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Philemon	1	10	I exhort thee for * my * child , whom I have begotten in [ my ] bonds , Onesimus ,
DARBY	Philemon	1	11	once unserviceable to thee , but now serviceable to thee and to me :
DARBY	Philemon	1	12	whom I have sent back to thee : [ but do * thou * receive ] him , that is , * my * bowels :
DARBY	Philemon	1	13	whom * I * was desirous of keeping with myself , that for thee he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad tidings ;
DARBY	Philemon	1	14	but I have wished to do nothing without thy mind , that thy good might not be as of necessity but of willingness :
DARBY	Philemon	1	15	for perhaps for this reason he has been separated [ from thee ] for a time , that thou mightest possess him fully for ever ;
DARBY	Philemon	1	16	not any longer as a bondman , but above a bondman , a beloved brother , specially to me , and how much rather to thee , both in [ the ] flesh and in [ the ] Lord ?
DARBY	Philemon	1	17	If therefore thou holdest me to be a partner [ with thee ] , receive him as me ;
DARBY	Philemon	1	18	but if he have wronged thee anything or owe anything [ to thee ] , put this to my account .
DARBY	Philemon	1	19	* I * Paul have written [ it ] with mine own hand ; * I * will repay [ it ] : that I say not to thee that thou owest even thine own self also to me .
DARBY	Philemon	1	20	Yea , brother , * I * would have profit of * thee * in [ the ] Lord : refresh my bowels in Christ .
DARBY	Philemon	1	21	Being confident of thine obedience , I have written to thee , knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say .
DARBY	Philemon	1	22	But withal prepare me also a lodging ; for I hope that I shall be granted to you through your prayers .
DARBY	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras salutes thee , my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus ;
DARBY	Philemon	1	24	Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , Luke , my fellow-workmen .
DARBY	Philemon	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with your spirit .
DARBY	Hebrews	1	1	God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets ,
DARBY	Hebrews	1	2	at the end of these days has spoken to us in [ the person of the ] Son , whom he has established heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
DARBY	Hebrews	1	3	who being [ the ] effulgence of his glory and [ the ] expression of his substance , and upholding all things by the word of his power , having made [ by himself ] the purification of sins , set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high ,
DARBY	Hebrews	1	4	taking a place by so much better than the angels , as he inherits a name more excellent than they .
DARBY	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels said he ever , * Thou * art my Son : this day have * I * begotten thee ? and again , * I * will be to him for father , and * he * shall be to me for son ?
DARBY	Hebrews	1	6	and again , when he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world , he says , And let all God 's angels worship him .
DARBY	Hebrews	1	7	And as to the angels he says , Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire ;
DARBY	Hebrews	1	8	but as to the Son , Thy throne , O God , [ is ] to the age of the age , and a sceptre of uprightness [ is ] the sceptre of thy kingdom .
DARBY	Hebrews	1	9	Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness ; therefore God , thy God , has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions .
DARBY	Hebrews	1	10	And , * Thou * in the beginning , Lord , hast founded the earth , and works of thy hands are the heavens .
DARBY	Hebrews	1	11	They shall perish , but * thou * continuest still ; and they all shall grow old as a garment ,
DARBY	Hebrews	1	12	and as a covering shalt thou roll them up , and they shall be changed ; but * thou * art the Same , and thy years shall not fail .
DARBY	Hebrews	1	13	But as to which of the angels said he ever , Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies [ as ] footstool of thy feet ?
DARBY	Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation ?
DARBY	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm , and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution ,
DARBY	Hebrews	2	3	how shall * we * escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation , which , having had its commencement in being spoken [ of ] by the Lord , has been confirmed to us by those who have heard ;
DARBY	Hebrews	2	4	God bearing , besides , witness with [ them ] to [ it ] , both by signs and wonders , and various acts of power , and distributions of [ the ] Holy Spirit , according to his will ?
DARBY	Hebrews	2	5	For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come , of which we speak ;
DARBY	Hebrews	2	6	but one has testified somewhere , saying , What is man , that thou rememberest him , or son of man that thou visitest him ?
DARBY	Hebrews	2	7	Thou hast made him some little inferior to the angels ; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour , [ and hast set him over the works of thy hands ; ]
DARBY	Hebrews	2	8	thou hast subjected all things under his feet . For in subjecting all things to him , he has left nothing unsubject to him . But now we see not yet all things subjected to * him * ,
DARBY	Hebrews	2	9	but we see Jesus , who [ was ] made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; so that by the grace of God he should taste death for every thing .
DARBY	Hebrews	2	10	For it became him , for whom [ are ] all things , and by whom [ are ] all things , in bringing many sons to glory , to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings .
DARBY	Hebrews	2	11	For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified [ are ] all of one ; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
DARBY	Hebrews	2	12	saying , I will declare thy name to my brethren ; in [ the ] midst of [ the ] assembly will I sing thy praises .
DARBY	Hebrews	2	13	And again , I will trust in him . And again , Behold , I and the children which God has given me .
DARBY	Hebrews	2	14	Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh , he also , in like manner , took part in the same , that through death he might annul him who has the might of death , that is , the devil ;
DARBY	Hebrews	2	15	and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage .
DARBY	Hebrews	2	16	For he does not indeed take hold of angels [ by the hand ] , but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham .
DARBY	Hebrews	2	17	Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to [ his ] brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God , to make propitiation for the sins of the people ;
DARBY	Hebrews	2	18	for , in that himself has suffered , being tempted , he is able to help those that are being tempted .
DARBY	Hebrews	3	3	For * he * has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses , by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house .
DARBY	Hebrews	3	2	who is faithful to him that has constituted him , as Moses also in all his house .
DARBY	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by some one ; but he who has built all things [ is ] God .
DARBY	Hebrews	3	5	And Moses indeed [ was ] faithful in all his house , as a ministering servant , for a testimony of the things to be spoken after ;
DARBY	Hebrews	3	6	but Christ , as Son over his house , whose house are * we * , if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end .
DARBY	Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore , even as says the Holy Spirit , To-day if ye will hear his voice ,
DARBY	Hebrews	3	8	harden not your hearts , as in the provocation , in the day of temptation in the wilderness ;
DARBY	Hebrews	3	9	where your fathers tempted [ me ] , by proving [ me ] , and saw my works forty years .
DARBY	Hebrews	3	10	Wherefore I was wroth with this generation , and said , They always err in heart ; and * they * have not known my ways ;
DARBY	Hebrews	3	11	so I swore in my wrath , If they shall enter into my rest .
DARBY	Hebrews	3	12	See , brethren , lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief , in turning away from [ the ] living God .
DARBY	Hebrews	3	13	But encourage yourselves each day , as long as it is called To-day , that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
DARBY	Hebrews	3	14	For we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end ;
DARBY	Hebrews	3	15	in that it is said , To-day if ye will hear his voice , do not harden your hearts , as in the provocation ;
DARBY	Hebrews	3	16	( for who was it , who , having heard , provoked ? but [ was it ] not all who came out of Egypt by Moses ?
DARBY	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was he wroth forty years ? [ Was it ] not with those who had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wilderness ?
DARBY	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to those who had not hearkened to the word ?
DARBY	Hebrews	3	19	And we see that they could not enter in on account of unbelief ; )
DARBY	Hebrews	4	4	For he has said somewhere of the seventh [ day ] thus , And God rested on the seventh day from all his works :
DARBY	Hebrews	4	2	For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us , even as they also ; but the word of the report did not profit * them * , not being mixed with faith in those who heard .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	3	For we enter into the rest who have believed ; as he said , As I have sworn in my wrath , If they shall enter into my rest ; although the works had been completed from [ the ] foundation of [ the ] world .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	5	and in this again , If they shall enter into my rest .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it , and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word ,
DARBY	Hebrews	4	7	again he determines a certain day , saying , in David , 'To-day , ' after so long a time ; ( according as it has been said before ) , To-day , if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	8	For if Jesus had brought them into rest , he would not have spoken afterwards about another day .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	9	There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	10	For he that has entered into his rest , he also has rested from his works , as God did from his own .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	11	Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest , that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God [ is ] living and operative , and sharper than any two-edged sword , and penetrating to [ the ] division of soul and spirit , both of joints and marrow , and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of [ the ] heart .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	13	And there is not a creature unapparent before him ; but all things [ are ] naked and laid bare to his eyes , with whom we have to do .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	14	Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast the confession .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	15	For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities , but tempted in all things in like manner , sin apart .
DARBY	Hebrews	4	16	Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy , and find grace for seasonable help .
DARBY	Hebrews	5	5	Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest ; but he who had said to him , * Thou * art my Son , * I * have to-day begotten thee .
DARBY	Hebrews	5	2	being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring , since he himself also is clothed with infirmity ;
DARBY	Hebrews	5	3	and , on account of this [ infirmity ] , he ought , even as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
DARBY	Hebrews	5	4	And no one takes the honour to himself but [ as ] called by God , even as Aaron also .
DARBY	Hebrews	5	6	Even as also in another [ place ] he says , * Thou * [ art ] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec .
DARBY	Hebrews	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh , having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death , with strong crying and tears ; ( and having been heard because of his piety ; )
DARBY	Hebrews	5	8	though he were Son , he learned obedience from the things which he suffered ;
DARBY	Hebrews	5	9	and having been perfected , became to all them that obey him , author of eternal salvation ;
DARBY	Hebrews	5	10	addressed by God [ as ] high priest according to the order of Melchisedec .
DARBY	Hebrews	5	11	Concerning whom we have much to say , and hard to be interpreted in speaking [ of it ] , since ye are become dull in hearing .
DARBY	Hebrews	5	12	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have again need that [ one ] should teach you what [ are ] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God , and are become such as have need of milk , [ and ] not of solid food .
DARBY	Hebrews	5	13	For every one that partakes of milk [ is ] unskilled in the word of righteousness , for he is a babe ;
DARBY	Hebrews	5	14	but solid food belongs to full-grown men , who , on account of habit , have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil .
DARBY	Hebrews	6	6	and have fallen away , crucifying for themselves [ as they do ] the Son of God , and making a show of [ him ] .
DARBY	Hebrews	6	2	of [ the ] doctrine of washings , and of imposition of hands , and of resurrection of [ the ] dead , and of eternal judgment ;
DARBY	Hebrews	6	3	and this will we do if God permit .
DARBY	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened , and who have tasted of the heavenly gift , and have been made partakers of [ the ] Holy Spirit ,
DARBY	Hebrews	6	5	and have tasted the good word of God , and [ the ] works of power of [ the ] age to come ,
DARBY	Hebrews	6	7	For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it , and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled , partakes of blessing from God ;
DARBY	Hebrews	6	8	but bringing forth thorns and briars , it is found worthless and nigh to a curse , whose end [ is ] to be burned .
DARBY	Hebrews	6	9	But we are persuaded concerning you , beloved , better things , and connected with salvation , even if we speak thus .
DARBY	Hebrews	6	10	For God [ is ] not unrighteous to forget your work , and the love which ye have shewn to his name , having ministered to the saints , and [ still ] ministering .
DARBY	Hebrews	6	11	But we desire earnestly that each one of you shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end ;
DARBY	Hebrews	6	12	that ye be not sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises .
DARBY	Hebrews	6	13	For God , having promised to Abraham , since he had no greater to swear by , swore by himself ,
DARBY	Hebrews	6	14	saying , Surely blessing I will bless thee , and multiplying I will multiply thee ;
DARBY	Hebrews	6	15	and thus , having had long patience , he got the promise .
DARBY	Hebrews	6	16	For men indeed swear by a greater , and with them the oath is a term to all dispute , as making matters sure .
DARBY	Hebrews	6	17	Wherein God , willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose , intervened by an oath ,
DARBY	Hebrews	6	18	that by two unchangeable things , in which [ it was ] impossible that God should lie , we might have a strong encouragement , who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us ,
DARBY	Hebrews	6	19	which we have as anchor of the soul , both secure and firm , and entering into that within the veil ,
DARBY	Hebrews	6	20	where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us , become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	7	But beyond all gainsaying , the inferior is blessed by the better .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	2	to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all ; first being interpreted King of righteousness , and then also King of Salem , which is King of peace ;
DARBY	Hebrews	7	3	without father , without mother , without genealogy ; having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but assimilated to the Son of God , abides a priest continually .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this [ personage ] was , to whom [ even ] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	5	And they indeed from among the sons of Levi , who receive the priesthood , have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law , that is from their brethren , though these are come out of the loins of Abraham :
DARBY	Hebrews	7	6	but he who has no genealogy from them has tithed Abraham , and blessed him who had the promises .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	8	And here dying men receive tithes ; but there [ one ] of whom the witness is that he lives ;
DARBY	Hebrews	7	9	and , so to speak , through Abraham , Levi also , who received tithes , has been made to pay tithes .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	11	If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood , for the people had their law given to them in connexion with * it * , what need [ was there ] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec , and not be named after the order of Aaron ?
DARBY	Hebrews	7	12	For , the priesthood being changed , there takes place of necessity a change of law also .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	13	For he , of whom these things are said , belongs to a different tribe , of which no one has [ ever ] been attached to the service of the altar .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	14	For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda , as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet more abundantly evident , since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec ,
DARBY	Hebrews	7	16	who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment , but according to power of indissoluble life .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	17	For it is borne witness , * Thou * art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	18	For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness ,
DARBY	Hebrews	7	19	( for the law perfected nothing , ) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	20	And by how much [ it was ] not without the swearing of an oath ;
DARBY	Hebrews	7	21	( for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath , but he with the swearing of an oath , by him who said , as to him , The Lord has sworn , and will not repent [ of it ] , * Thou * [ art ] priest for ever [ according to the order of Melchisedec ] ; )
DARBY	Hebrews	7	22	by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	23	And they have been many priests , on account of being hindered from continuing by death ;
DARBY	Hebrews	7	24	but he , because of his continuing for ever , has the priesthood unchangeable .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	25	Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God , always living to intercede for them .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	26	For such a high priest became us , holy , harmless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and become higher than the heavens :
DARBY	Hebrews	7	27	who has not day by day need , as the high priests , first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins , then [ for ] those of the people ; for this he did once for all [ in ] having offered up himself .
DARBY	Hebrews	7	28	For the law constitutes men high priests , having infirmity ; but the word of the swearing of the oath which [ is ] after the law , a Son perfected for ever .
DARBY	Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault , he says to them , Behold , days come , saith the Lord , and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the house of Israel , and as regards the house of Juda ;
DARBY	Hebrews	8	2	minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord has pitched , [ and ] not man .
DARBY	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices ; whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer .
DARBY	Hebrews	8	4	If then indeed he were upon earth , he would not even be a priest , there being those who offer the gifts according to the law ,
DARBY	Hebrews	8	5	( who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things , according as Moses was oracularly told [ when ] about to make the tabernacle ; for See , saith He , that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain . )
DARBY	Hebrews	8	6	But now he has got a more excellent ministry , by so much as he is mediator of a better covenant , which is established on the footing of better promises .
DARBY	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first was faultless , place had not been sought for a second .
DARBY	Hebrews	8	9	not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in [ the ] day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; because * they * did not continue in my covenant , and * I * did not regard them , saith [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	Hebrews	8	10	Because this [ is ] the covenant that I will covenant to the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord : Giving my laws into their mind , I will write them also upon their hearts ; and I will be to them for God , and * they * shall be to me for people .
DARBY	Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach each his fellow-citizen , and each his brother , saying , Know the Lord ; because all shall know me in themselves , from [ the ] little one [ among them ] unto [ the ] great among them .
DARBY	Hebrews	8	12	Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses , and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more .
DARBY	Hebrews	8	13	In that he says New , he has made the first old ; but that which grows old and aged [ is ] near disappearing .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	9	the which [ is ] an image for the present time , according to which both gifts and sacrifices , unable to perfect as to conscience him that worshipped , are offered ,
DARBY	Hebrews	9	2	For a tabernacle was set up ; the first , in which [ were ] both the candlestick and the table and the exposition of the loaves , which is called Holy ;
DARBY	Hebrews	9	3	but after the second veil a tabernacle which is called Holy of holies ,
DARBY	Hebrews	9	4	having a golden censer , and the ark of the covenant , covered round in every part with gold , in which [ were ] the golden pot that had the manna , and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted , and the tables of the covenant ;
DARBY	Hebrews	9	5	and above over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat ; concerning which it is not now [ the time ] to speak in detail .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	6	Now these things being thus ordered , into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times , accomplishing the services ;
DARBY	Hebrews	9	7	but into the second , the high priest only , once a year , not without blood , which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people :
DARBY	Hebrews	9	8	the Holy Spirit shewing this , that the way of the [ holy of ] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has [ its ] standing ;
DARBY	Hebrews	9	10	[ consisting ] only of meats and drinks and divers washings , ordinances of flesh , imposed until [ the ] time of setting things right .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ being come high priest of the good things to come , by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand , ( that is , not of this creation , )
DARBY	Hebrews	9	12	nor by blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood , has entered in once for all into the [ holy of ] holies , having found an eternal redemption .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls , and a heifer 's ashes sprinkling the defiled , sanctifies for the purity of the flesh ,
DARBY	Hebrews	9	14	how much rather shall the blood of the Christ , who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God , purify your conscience from dead works to worship [ the ] living God ?
DARBY	Hebrews	9	15	And for this reason he is mediator of a new covenant , so that , death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant , the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	16	( For where [ there is ] a testament , the death of the testator must needs come in .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	17	For a testament [ is ] of force when men are dead , since it is in no way of force while the testator is alive . )
DARBY	Hebrews	9	18	Whence neither the first was inaugurated without blood .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	19	For every commandment having been spoken according to [ the ] law by Moses to all the people ; having taken the blood of calves and goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
DARBY	Hebrews	9	20	saying , This [ is ] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	21	And the tabernacle too and all the vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood ;
DARBY	Hebrews	9	22	and almost all things are purified with blood according to the law , and without blood-shedding there is no remission .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	23	[ It was ] necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	24	For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand , figures of the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear before the face of God for us :
DARBY	Hebrews	9	25	nor in order that he should offer himself often , as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own ;
DARBY	Hebrews	9	26	since he had [ then ] been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world . But now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for [ the ] putting away of sin by his sacrifice .
DARBY	Hebrews	9	27	And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die , and after this judgment ;
DARBY	Hebrews	9	28	thus the Christ also , having been once offered to bear the sins of many , shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	10	by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	2	Since , would they not indeed have ceased being offered , on account of the worshippers once purged having no longer any conscience of sins ?
DARBY	Hebrews	10	3	But in these [ there is ] a calling to mind of sins yearly .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	4	For blood of bulls and goats [ is ] incapable of taking away sins .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore coming into the world he says , Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not ; but thou hast prepared me a body .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	6	Thou tookest no pleasure in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , Lo , I come ( in [ the ] roll of the book it is written of me ) to do , O God , thy will .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	8	Above , saying Sacrifices and offerings and burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou willedst not , neither tookest pleasure in ( which are offered according to the law ) ;
DARBY	Hebrews	10	9	then he said , Lo , I come to do thy will . He takes away the first that he may establish the second ;
DARBY	Hebrews	10	11	And every priest stands daily ministering , and offering often the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	12	But * he * , having offered one sacrifice for sins , sat down in perpetuity at [ the ] right hand of God ,
DARBY	Hebrews	10	13	waiting from henceforth until his enemies be set [ for the ] footstool of his feet .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness [ of it ] ; for after what was said :
DARBY	Hebrews	10	16	This [ is ] the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days , saith [ the ] Lord : Giving my laws into their hearts , I will write them also in their understandings ;
DARBY	Hebrews	10	17	and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	18	But where there [ is ] remission of these , [ there is ] no longer a sacrifice for sin .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore , brethren , boldness for entering into the [ holy of ] holies by the blood of Jesus ,
DARBY	Hebrews	10	20	the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil , that is , his flesh ,
DARBY	Hebrews	10	21	and [ having ] a great priest over the house of God ,
DARBY	Hebrews	10	22	let us approach with a true heart , in full assurance of faith , sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience , and washed as to our body with pure water .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the confession of the hope unwavering , ( for he [ is ] faithful who has promised ; )
DARBY	Hebrews	10	24	and let us consider one another for provoking to love and good works ;
DARBY	Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the custom [ is ] with some ; but encouraging [ one another ] , and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	26	For where we sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains any sacrifice for sins ,
DARBY	Hebrews	10	27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and heat of fire about to devour the adversaries .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	28	Any one that has disregarded Moses ' law dies without mercy on [ the testimony of ] two or three witnesses :
DARBY	Hebrews	10	29	of how much worse punishment , think ye , shall he be judged worthy who has trodden under foot the Son of God , and esteemed the blood of the covenant , whereby he has been sanctified , common , and has insulted the Spirit of grace ?
DARBY	Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that said , To me [ belongs ] vengeance ; * I * will recompense , saith the Lord : and again , The Lord shall judge his people .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	31	[ It is ] a fearful thing falling into [ the ] hands of [ the ] living God .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	32	But call to mind the earlier days in which , having been enlightened , ye endured much conflict of sufferings ;
DARBY	Hebrews	10	33	on the one hand , when ye were made a spectacle both in reproaches and afflictions ; and on the other , when ye became partakers with those who were passing through them .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	34	For ye both sympathised with prisoners and accepted with joy the plunder of your goods , knowing that ye have for yourselves a better substance , and an abiding one .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	35	Cast not away therefore your confidence , which has great recompense .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	36	For ye have need of endurance in order that , having done the will of God , ye may receive the promise .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	37	For yet a very little while he that comes will come , and will not delay .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	38	But the just shall live by faith ; and , if he draw back , my soul does not take pleasure in him .
DARBY	Hebrews	10	39	But * we * are not drawers back to perdition , but of faith to saving [ the ] soul .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	11	By faith also Sarah herself received strength for [ the ] conception of seed , and [ that ] beyond a seasonable age ; since she counted him faithful who promised .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	2	For in [ the power of ] this the elders have obtained testimony .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by [ the ] word of God , so that that which is seen should not take its origin from things which appear .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained testimony of being righteous , God bearing testimony to his gifts , and by it , having died , he yet speaks .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him ; for before [ his ] translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	6	But without faith [ it is ] impossible to please [ him ] . For he that draws near to God must believe that he is , and [ that ] he is a rewarder of them who seek him out .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	7	By faith , Noah , oracularly warned concerning things not yet seen , moved with fear , prepared an ark for the saving of his house ; by which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which [ is ] according to faith .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham , being called , obeyed to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance , and went out , not knowing where he was going .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he sojourned as a stranger in the land of promise as a foreign country , having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with [ him ] of the same promise ;
DARBY	Hebrews	11	10	for he waited for the city which has foundations , of which God is [ the ] artificer and constructor .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	12	Wherefore also there have been born of one , and that of one become dead , even as the stars of heaven in multitude , and as the countless sand which [ is ] by the sea shore .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	13	All these died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them from afar off and embraced [ them ] , and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	14	For they who say such things shew clearly that they seek [ their ] country .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	15	And if they had called to mind that from whence they went out , they had had opportunity to have returned ;
DARBY	Hebrews	11	16	but now they seek a better , that is , a heavenly ; wherefore God is not ashamed of them , to be called their God ; for he has prepared for them a city .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , [ when ] tried , offered up Isaac , and he who had received to himself the promises offered up his only begotten [ son ] ,
DARBY	Hebrews	11	18	as to whom it had been said , In Isaac shall thy seed be called :
DARBY	Hebrews	11	19	counting that God [ was ] able to raise [ him ] even from among [ the ] dead , whence also he received him in a figure .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob [ when ] dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshipped on the top of his staff .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph [ when ] dying called to mind the going forth of the sons of Israel , and gave commandment concerning his bones .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses , being born , was hid three months by his parents , because they saw the child beautiful ; and they did not fear the injunction of the king .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , when he had become great , refused to be called son of Pharaoh 's daughter ;
DARBY	Hebrews	11	25	choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God than to have [ the ] temporary pleasure of sin ;
DARBY	Hebrews	11	26	esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt , for he had respect to the recompense .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he persevered , as seeing him who is invisible .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he celebrated the passover and the sprinkling of the blood , that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as through dry land ; of which the Egyptians having made trial were swallowed up .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell , having been encircled for seven days .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	31	By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with the unbelieving , having received the spies in peace .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	32	And what more do I say ? For the time would fail me telling of Gideon , and Barak , and Samson , and Jephthah , and David and Samuel , and of the prophets :
DARBY	Hebrews	11	33	who by faith overcame kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped lions ' mouths ,
DARBY	Hebrews	11	34	quenched [ the ] power of fire , escaped [ the ] edge of the sword , became strong out of weakness , became mighty in war , made [ the ] armies of strangers give way .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead again by resurrection ; and others were tortured , not having accepted deliverance , that they might get a better resurrection ;
DARBY	Hebrews	11	36	and others underwent trial of mockings and scourgings , yea , and of bonds and imprisonment .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned , were sawn asunder , were tempted , died by the death of the sword ; they went about in sheepskins , in goatskins , destitute , afflicted , evil treated ,
DARBY	Hebrews	11	38	( of whom the world was not worthy , ) wandering in deserts and mountains , and [ in ] dens and caverns of the earth .
DARBY	Hebrews	11	39	And these all , having obtained witness through faith , did not receive the promise ,
DARBY	Hebrews	11	40	God having foreseen some better thing for us , that they should not be made perfect without us .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	12	Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down , and the failing knees ;
DARBY	Hebrews	12	2	looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith : who , in view of the joy lying before him , endured [ the ] cross , having despised [ the ] shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	3	For consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself , that ye be not weary , fainting in your minds .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood , wrestling against sin .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	5	And ye have quite forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons : My son , despise not [ the ] chastening of [ the ] Lord , nor faint [ when ] reproved by him ;
DARBY	Hebrews	12	6	for whom [ the ] Lord loves he chastens , and scourges every son whom he receives .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	7	Ye endure for chastening , God conducts himself towards you as towards sons ; for who is the son that the father chastens not ?
DARBY	Hebrews	12	8	But if ye are without chastening , of which all have been made partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	9	Moreover we have had the fathers of our flesh as chasteners , and we reverenced [ them ] ; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits , and live ?
DARBY	Hebrews	12	10	For they indeed chastened for a few days , as seemed good to them ; but he for profit , in order to the partaking of his holiness .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	11	But no chastening at the time seems to be [ matter ] of joy , but of grief ; but afterwards yields [ the ] peaceful fruit of righteousness to those exercised by it .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet , that that which is lame be not turned aside ; but that rather it may be healed .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	14	Pursue peace with all , and holiness , without which no one shall see the Lord :
DARBY	Hebrews	12	15	watching lest [ there be ] any one who lacks the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble [ you ] , and many be defiled by it ;
DARBY	Hebrews	12	16	lest [ there be ] any fornicator , or profane person , as Esau , who for one meal sold his birthright ;
DARBY	Hebrews	12	17	for ye know that also afterwards , desiring to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , ( for he found no place for repentance ) although he sought it earnestly with tears .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	18	For ye have not come to [ the mount ] that might be touched and was all on fire , and to obscurity , and darkness , and tempest ,
DARBY	Hebrews	12	19	and trumpet 's sound , and voice of words ; which they that heard , excusing themselves , declined [ the ] word being addressed to them any more :
DARBY	Hebrews	12	20	( for they were not able to bear what was enjoined : And if a beast should touch the mountain , it shall be stoned ;
DARBY	Hebrews	12	21	and , so fearful was the sight , Moses said , I am exceedingly afraid and full of trembling ; )
DARBY	Hebrews	12	22	but ye have come to mount Zion ; and to [ the ] city of [ the ] living God , heavenly Jerusalem ; and to myriads of angels ,
DARBY	Hebrews	12	23	the universal gathering ; and to [ the ] assembly of the firstborn [ who are ] registered in heaven ; and to God , judge of all ; and to [ the ] spirits of just [ men ] made perfect ;
DARBY	Hebrews	12	24	and to Jesus , mediator of a new covenant ; and to [ the ] blood of sprinkling , speaking better than Abel .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	25	See that ye refuse not him that speaks . For if those did not escape who had refused him who uttered the oracles on earth , much more we who turn away from him [ who does so ] from heaven :
DARBY	Hebrews	12	26	whose voice then shook the earth ; but now he has promised , saying , Yet once will * I * shake not only the earth , but also the heaven .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	27	But this Yet once , signifies the removing of what is shaken , as being made , that what is not shaken may remain .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	28	Wherefore let us , receiving a kingdom not to be shaken , have grace , by which let us serve God acceptably with reverence and fear .
DARBY	Hebrews	12	29	For also our God [ is ] a consuming fire .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	13	therefore let us go forth to him without the camp , bearing his reproach :
DARBY	Hebrews	13	2	Be not forgetful of hospitality ; for by it some have unawares entertained angels .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	3	Remember prisoners , as bound with [ them ] ; those that are evil-treated , as being yourselves also in [ the ] body .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	4	[ Let ] marriage [ be held ] every way in honour , and the bed [ be ] undefiled ; for fornicators and adulterers will God judge .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	5	[ Let your ] conversation [ be ] without love of money , satisfied with [ your ] present circumstances ; for * he * has said , I will not leave thee , neither will I forsake thee .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	6	So that , taking courage , we may say , The Lord [ is ] my helper , and I will not be afraid : what will man do unto me ?
DARBY	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God ; and considering the issue of their conversation , imitate their faith .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ [ is ] the same yesterday , and to-day , and to the ages [ to come ] .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	9	Be not carried away with various and strange doctrines ; for [ it is ] good that the heart be confirmed with grace , not meats ; those who have walked in which have not been profited by [ them ] .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle ;
DARBY	Hebrews	13	11	for of those beasts whose blood is carried [ as sacrifices for sin ] into the [ holy of ] holies by the high priest , of these the bodies are burned outside the camp .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	12	Wherefore also Jesus , that he might sanctify the people by his own blood , suffered without the gate :
DARBY	Hebrews	13	14	for we have not here an abiding city , but we seek the coming one .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	15	By him therefore let us offer [ the ] sacrifice of praise continually to God , that is , [ the ] fruit of [ the ] lips confessing his name .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	16	But of doing good and communicating [ of your substance ] be not forgetful , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders , and be submissive ; for * they * watch over your souls as those that shall give account ; that they may do this with joy , and not groaning , for this [ would be ] unprofitable for you .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us : for we persuade ourselves that we have a good conscience , in all things desirous to walk rightly .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	19	But I much more beseech [ you ] to do this , that I may the more quickly be restored to you .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	20	But the God of peace , who brought again from among [ the ] dead our Lord Jesus , the great shepherd of the sheep , in [ the power of the ] blood of [ the ] eternal covenant ,
DARBY	Hebrews	13	21	perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will , doing in you what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ ; to whom [ be ] glory for the ages of ages . Amen .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	22	But I beseech you , brethren , bear the word of exhortation , for it is but in few words that I have written to you .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	23	Know that our brother Timotheus is set at liberty ; with whom , if he should come soon , I will see you .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	24	Salute all your leaders , and all the saints . They from Italy salute you .
DARBY	Hebrews	13	25	Grace [ be ] with you all . Amen .
DARBY	James	1	1	James , bondman of God and of [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which [ are ] in the dispersion , greeting .
DARBY	James	1	2	Count it all joy , my brethren , when ye fall into various temptations ,
DARBY	James	1	3	knowing that the proving of your faith works endurance .
DARBY	James	1	4	But let endurance have [ its ] perfect work , that ye may be perfect and complete , lacking in nothing .
DARBY	James	1	5	But if any one of you lack wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all freely and reproaches not , and it shall be given to him :
DARBY	James	1	6	but let him ask in faith , nothing doubting . For he that doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed about ;
DARBY	James	1	7	for let not that man think that he shall receive anything from the Lord ;
DARBY	James	1	8	[ he is ] a double-minded man , unstable in all his ways .
DARBY	James	1	9	But let the brother of low degree glory in his elevation ,
DARBY	James	1	10	and the rich in his humiliation , because as [ the ] grass 's flower he will pass away .
DARBY	James	1	11	For the sun has risen with its burning heat , and has withered the grass , and its flower has fallen , and the comeliness of its look has perished : thus the rich also shall wither in his goings .
DARBY	James	1	12	Blessed [ is the ] man who endures temptation ; for , having been proved , he shall receive the crown of life , which He has promised to them that love him .
DARBY	James	1	13	Let no man , being tempted , say , I am tempted of God . For God can not be tempted by evil things , and himself tempts no one .
DARBY	James	1	14	But every one is tempted , drawn away , and enticed by his own lust ;
DARBY	James	1	15	then lust , having conceived , gives birth to sin ; but sin fully completed brings forth death .
DARBY	James	1	16	Do not err , my beloved brethren .
DARBY	James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above , from the Father of lights , with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning .
DARBY	James	1	18	According to his own will begat he us by the word of truth , that we should be a certain first-fruits of * his * creatures .
DARBY	James	1	19	So that , my beloved brethren , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath ;
DARBY	James	1	20	for man 's wrath does not work God 's righteousness .
DARBY	James	1	21	Wherefore , laying aside all filthiness and abounding of wickedness , accept with meekness the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
DARBY	James	1	22	But be ye doers of [ the ] word and not hearers only , beguiling yourselves .
DARBY	James	1	23	For if any man be a hearer of [ the ] word and not a doer , * he * is like to a man considering his natural face in a mirror :
DARBY	James	1	24	for he has considered himself and is gone away , and straightway he has forgotten what he was like .
DARBY	James	1	25	But * he * that fixes his view on [ the ] perfect law , that of liberty , and abides in [ it ] , being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of [ the ] work , * he * shall be blessed in his doing .
DARBY	James	1	26	If any one think himself to be religious , not bridling his tongue , but deceiving his heart , this man 's religion is vain .
DARBY	James	1	27	Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this : to visit orphans and widows in their affliction , to keep oneself unspotted from the world .
DARBY	James	2	2	for if there come unto your synagogue a man with a gold ring in splendid apparel , and a poor man also come in in vile apparel ,
DARBY	James	2	3	and ye look upon him who wears the splendid apparel , and say , Do thou sit here well , and say to the poor , Do thou stand there , or sit here under my footstool :
DARBY	James	2	4	have ye not made a difference among yourselves , and become judges having evil thoughts ?
DARBY	James	2	5	Hear , my beloved brethren : Has not God chosen the poor as to the world , rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom , which he has promised to them that love him ?
DARBY	James	2	6	But * ye * have despised the poor [ man ] . Do not the rich oppress you , and [ do not ] * they * drag you before [ the ] tribunals ?
DARBY	James	2	7	And [ do not ] * they * blaspheme the excellent name which has been called upon you ?
DARBY	James	2	8	If indeed ye keep [ the ] royal law according to the scripture , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself , ye do well .
DARBY	James	2	9	But if ye have respect of persons , ye commit sin , being convicted by the law as transgressors .
DARBY	James	2	10	For whoever shall keep the whole law and shall offend in one [ point ] , he has come under the guilt of [ breaking ] all .
DARBY	James	2	11	For he who said , Thou shalt not commit adultery , said also , Thou shalt not kill . Now if thou dost not commit adultery , but killest , thou art become transgressor of [ the ] law .
DARBY	James	2	12	So speak ye , and so act , as those that are to be judged by [ the ] law of liberty ;
DARBY	James	2	13	for judgment [ will be ] without mercy to him that has shewn no mercy . Mercy glories over judgment .
DARBY	James	2	14	What [ is ] the profit , my brethren , if any one say he have faith , but have not works ? can faith save him ?
DARBY	James	2	15	Now if a brother or a sister is naked and destitute of daily food ,
DARBY	James	2	16	and one from amongst you say to them , Go in peace , be warmed and filled ; but give not to them the needful things for the body , what [ is ] the profit ?
DARBY	James	2	17	So also faith , if it have not works , is dead by itself .
DARBY	James	2	18	But some one will say , * Thou * hast faith and * I * have works . Shew me thy faith without works , and * I * from my works will shew thee my faith .
DARBY	James	2	19	* Thou * believest that God is one . Thou doest well . The demons even believe , and tremble .
DARBY	James	2	20	But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith without works is dead ?
DARBY	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar ?
DARBY	James	2	22	Thou seest that faith wrought with his works , and that by works faith was perfected .
DARBY	James	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled which says , Abraham believed God , and it was reckoned to him as righteousness , and he was called Friend of God .
DARBY	James	2	24	Ye see that a man is justified on the principle of works , and not on the principle of faith only .
DARBY	James	2	25	But was not in like manner also Rahab the harlot justified on the principle of works , when she had received the messengers and put [ them ] forth by another way ?
DARBY	James	2	26	For as the body without a spirit is dead , so also faith without works is dead .
DARBY	James	3	3	Behold , we put the bits in the mouths of the horses , that they may obey us , and we turn round their whole bodies .
DARBY	James	3	2	For we all often offend . If any one offend not in word , * he * [ is ] a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body too .
DARBY	James	3	4	Behold also the ships , which are so great , and driven by violent winds , are turned about by a very small rudder , wherever the pleasure of the helmsman will .
DARBY	James	3	5	Thus also the tongue is a little member , and boasts great things . See how little a fire , how large a wood it kindles !
DARBY	James	3	6	and the tongue [ is ] fire , the world of unrighteousness ; the tongue is set in our members , the defiler of the whole body , and which sets fire to the course of nature , and is set on fire of hell .
DARBY	James	3	7	For every species both of beasts and of birds , both of creeping things and of sea animals , is tamed and has been tamed by the human species ;
DARBY	James	3	8	but the tongue can no one among men tame ; [ it is ] an unsettled evil , full of death-bringing poison .
DARBY	James	3	9	Therewith bless we the Lord and Father , and therewith curse we men made after [ the ] likeness of God .
DARBY	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth goes forth blessing and cursing . It is not right , my brethren , that these things should be thus .
DARBY	James	3	11	Does the fountain , out of the same opening , pour forth sweet and bitter ?
DARBY	James	3	12	Can , my brethren , a fig produce olives , or a vine figs ? Neither [ can ] salt [ water ] make sweet water .
DARBY	James	3	13	Who [ is ] wise and understanding among you ; let him shew out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom ;
DARBY	James	3	14	but if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts , do not boast and lie against the truth .
DARBY	James	3	15	This is not the wisdom which comes down from above , but earthly , natural , devilish .
DARBY	James	3	16	For where emulation and strife [ are ] , there [ is ] disorder and every evil thing .
DARBY	James	3	17	But the wisdom from above first is pure , then peaceful , gentle , yielding , full of mercy and good fruits , unquestioning , unfeigned .
DARBY	James	3	18	But [ the ] fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them that make peace .
DARBY	James	4	4	Adulteresses , know ye not that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? Whoever therefore is minded to be [ the ] friend of the world is constituted enemy of God .
DARBY	James	4	2	Ye lust and have not : ye kill and are full of envy , and can not obtain ; ye fight and war ; ye have not because ye ask not .
DARBY	James	4	3	Ye ask and receive not , because ye ask evilly , that ye may consume [ it ] in your pleasures .
DARBY	James	4	5	Think ye that the scripture speaks in vain ? Does the Spirit which has taken his abode in us desire enviously ?
DARBY	James	4	6	But he gives more grace . Wherefore he says , God sets himself against [ the ] proud , but gives grace to [ the ] lowly .
DARBY	James	4	7	Subject yourselves therefore to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
DARBY	James	4	8	Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse [ your ] hands , sinners , and purify [ your ] hearts , ye double-minded .
DARBY	James	4	9	Be wretched , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and [ your ] joy to heaviness .
DARBY	James	4	10	Humble yourselves before [ the ] Lord , and he shall exalt you .
DARBY	James	4	11	Speak not against one another , brethren . He that speaks against [ his ] brother , or judges his brother , speaks against [ the ] law and judges [ the ] law . But if thou judgest [ the ] law , thou art not doer of [ the ] law , but judge .
DARBY	James	4	12	One is the lawgiver and judge , who is able to save and to destroy : but who art * thou * who judgest thy neighbour ?
DARBY	James	4	13	Go to now , ye who say , To-day or to-morrow will we go into such a city and spend a year there , and traffic and make gain ,
DARBY	James	4	14	ye who do not know what will be on the morrow , ( [ for ] what [ is ] your life ? It is even a vapour , appearing for a little while , and then disappearing , )
DARBY	James	4	15	instead of your saying , If the Lord should [ so ] will and we should live , we will also do this or that .
DARBY	James	4	16	But now ye glory in your vauntings : all such glorying is evil .
DARBY	James	4	17	To him therefore who knows how to do good , and does it not , to him it is sin .
DARBY	James	5	5	Ye have lived luxuriously on the earth and indulged yourselves ; ye have nourished your hearts [ as ] in a day of slaughter ;
DARBY	James	5	2	Your wealth is become rotten , and your garments moth-eaten .
DARBY	James	5	3	Your gold and silver is eaten away , and their canker shall be for a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh as fire . Ye have heaped up treasure in [ the ] last days .
DARBY	James	5	4	Behold , the wages of your labourers , who have harvested your fields , wrongfully kept back by you , cry , and the cries of those that have reaped are entered into the ears of [ the ] Lord of sabaoth .
DARBY	James	5	6	ye have condemned , ye have killed the just ; he does not resist you .
DARBY	James	5	7	Have patience , therefore , brethren , till the coming of the Lord . Behold , the labourer awaits the precious fruit of the earth , having patience for it until it receive [ the ] early and [ the ] latter rain .
DARBY	James	5	8	* Ye * also have patience : stablish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is drawn nigh .
DARBY	James	5	9	Complain not one against another , brethren , that ye be not judged . Behold , the judge stands before the door .
DARBY	James	5	10	Take [ as ] an example , brethren , of suffering and having patience , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of [ the ] Lord .
DARBY	James	5	11	Behold , we call them blessed who have endured . Ye have heard of the endurance of Job , and seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is full of tender compassion and pitiful .
DARBY	James	5	12	But before all things , my brethren , swear not , neither by heaven , nor by the earth , nor by any other oath ; but let your yea be yea , and your nay , nay , that ye do not fall under judgment .
DARBY	James	5	13	Does any one among you suffer evil ? let him pray . Is any happy ? let him sing psalms .
DARBY	James	5	14	Is any sick among you ? let him call to [ him ] the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of [ the ] Lord ;
DARBY	James	5	15	and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he be one who has committed sins , it shall be forgiven him .
DARBY	James	5	16	Confess therefore your offences to one another , and pray for one another , that ye may be healed . [ The ] fervent supplication of the righteous [ man ] has much power .
DARBY	James	5	17	Elias was a man of like passions to us , and he prayed with prayer that it should not rain ; and it did not rain upon the earth three years and six months ;
DARBY	James	5	18	and again he prayed , and the heaven gave rain , and the earth caused its fruit to spring forth .
DARBY	James	5	19	My brethren , if any one among you err from the truth , and one bring him back ,
DARBY	James	5	20	let him know that he that brings back a sinner from [ the ] error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins .
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter , apostle of Jesus Christ , to [ the ] sojourners of [ the ] dispersion of Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	2	elect according to [ the ] foreknowledge of God [ the ] Father , by sanctification of [ the ] Spirit , unto [ the ] obedience and sprinkling of [ the ] blood of Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace be multiplied .
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	3	Blessed [ be ] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who , according to his great mercy , has begotten us again to a living hope through [ the ] resurrection of Jesus Christ from among [ the ] dead ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	4	to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance , reserved in [ the ] heavens for you ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	5	who are kept guarded by [ the ] power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in [ the ] last time .
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	6	Wherein ye exult , for a little while at present , if needed , put to grief by various trials ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	7	that the proving of your faith , much more precious than of gold which perishes , though it be proved by fire , be found to praise and glory and honour in [ the ] revelation of Jesus Christ :
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	8	whom , having not seen , ye love ; on whom [ though ] not now looking , but believing , ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with [ the ] glory ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	9	receiving the end of your faith , [ the ] salvation of [ your ] souls .
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	10	Concerning which salvation prophets , who have prophesied of the grace towards you , sought out and searched out ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	11	searching what , or what manner of time , the Spirit of Christ which [ was ] in them pointed out , testifying before of the sufferings which [ belonged ] to Christ , and the glories after these .
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	12	To whom it was revealed , that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things , which have now been announced to you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by [ the ] Holy Spirit , sent from heaven , which angels desire to look into .
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	13	Wherefore , having girded up the loins of your mind , [ be ] sober [ and ] hope with perfect stedfastness in the grace [ which will be ] brought to you at [ the ] revelation of Jesus Christ ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	14	as children of obedience , not conformed to [ your ] former lusts in your ignorance ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	15	but as he who has called you is holy , be ye also holy in all [ your ] conversation ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	16	because it is written , Be ye holy , for * I * am holy .
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	17	And if ye invoke as Father him who , without regard of persons , judges according to the work of each , pass your time of sojourn in fear ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	18	knowing that ye have been redeemed , not by corruptible [ things , as ] silver or gold , from your vain conversation handed down from [ your ] fathers ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	19	but by precious blood , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot , [ the blood ] of Christ ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	20	foreknown indeed before [ the ] foundation of [ the ] world , but who has been manifested at the end of times for your sakes ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	21	who by him do believe on God , who has raised him from among [ the ] dead and given him glory , that your faith and hope should be in God .
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	22	Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth to unfeigned brotherly love , love one another out of a pure heart fervently ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	23	being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by [ the ] living and abiding word of God .
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	24	Because all flesh [ is ] as grass , and all its glory as [ the ] flower of grass . The grass has withered and [ its ] flower has fallen ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	1	25	but the word of [ the ] Lord abides for eternity . But this is the word which in the glad tidings [ is ] preached to you .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	2	as newborn babes desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word , that by it ye may grow up to salvation ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	3	if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord [ is ] good .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	4	To whom coming , a living stone , cast away indeed as worthless by men , but with God chosen , precious ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	5	yourselves also , as living stones , are being built up a spiritual house , a holy priesthood , to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	6	Because it is contained in the scripture : Behold , I lay in Zion a corner stone , elect , precious : and he that believes on him shall not be put to shame .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	7	To you therefore who believe [ is ] the preciousness ; but to the disobedient , the stone which the builders cast away as worthless , this is become head of [ the ] corner ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	8	and a stone of stumbling and rock of offence ; [ who ] stumble at the word , being disobedient to which also they have been appointed .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	9	But * ye * [ are ] a chosen race , a kingly priesthood , a holy nation , a people for a possession , that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	10	who once [ were ] not a people , but now God 's people ; who were not enjoying mercy , but now have found mercy .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	11	Beloved , I exhort [ you ] , as strangers and sojourners , to abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	12	having your conversation honest among the Gentiles , that [ as to that ] in which they speak against you as evildoers , they may through [ your ] good works , [ themselves ] witnessing [ them ] , glorify God in [ the ] day of visitation .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	13	Be in subjection [ therefore ] to every human institution for the Lord 's sake ; whether to [ the ] king as supreme ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	14	or to rulers as sent by him , for vengeance on evildoers , and praise to them that do well .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	15	Because so is the will of God , that by well-doing ye put to silence the ignorance of senseless men ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	16	as free , and not as having liberty as a cloak of malice , but as God 's bondmen .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	17	Shew honour to all , love the brotherhood , fear God , honour the king .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	18	Servants , [ be ] subject with all fear to your masters , not only to the good and gentle , but also to the ill-tempered .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	19	For this [ is ] acceptable , if one , for conscience sake towards God , endure griefs , suffering unjustly .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	20	For what glory [ is it ] , if sinning and being buffeted ye shall bear [ it ] ? but if , doing good and suffering , ye shall bear [ it ] , this is acceptable with God .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	21	For to this have ye been called ; for Christ also has suffered for you , leaving you a model that ye should follow in his steps :
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	22	who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	23	who , [ when ] reviled , reviled not again ; [ when ] suffering , threatened not ; but gave [ himself ] over into the hands of him who judges righteously ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	24	who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree , in order that , being dead to sins , we may live to righteousness : by whose stripes ye have been healed .
DARBY	1%20Peter	2	25	For ye were going astray as sheep , but have now returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls .
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	3	whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair , and wearing gold , or putting on apparel ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	2	having witnessed your pure conversation [ carried out ] in fear ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	4	but the hidden man of the heart , in the incorruptible [ ornament ] of a meek and quiet spirit , which in the sight of God is of great price .
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	5	For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God heretofore adorned themselves , being subject to their own husbands ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord ; whose children ye have become , doing good , and not fearing with any kind of consternation .
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	7	[ Ye ] husbands likewise , dwell with [ them ] according to knowledge , as with a weaker , [ even ] the female , vessel , giving [ them ] honour , as also fellow-heirs of [ the ] grace of life , that your prayers be not hindered .
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , [ be ] all of one mind , sympathising , full of brotherly love , tender hearted , humble minded ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	9	not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing ; but on the contrary , blessing [ others ] , because ye have been called to this , that ye should inherit blessing .
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	10	For he that will love life and see good days , let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile .
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	11	And let him avoid evil , and do good ; let him seek peace and pursue it ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	12	because [ the ] eyes of [ the ] Lord [ are ] on [ the ] righteous , and his ears towards their supplications ; but [ the ] face of [ the ] Lord [ is ] against them that do evil .
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	13	And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of that which [ is ] good ?
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	14	But if also ye should suffer for righteousness ' sake , blessed [ are ye ] ; but be not afraid of their fear , neither be troubled ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	15	but sanctify [ the ] Lord the Christ in your hearts , and [ be ] always prepared to [ give ] an answer [ to ] every one that asks you to give an account of the hope that [ is ] in you , but with meekness and fear ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	16	having a good conscience , that [ as to that ] in which they speak against you as evildoers , they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in Christ .
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	17	For [ it is ] better , if the will of God should will it , to suffer [ as ] well-doers than [ as ] evildoers ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	18	for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins , [ the ] just for [ the ] unjust , that he might bring us to God ; being put to death in flesh , but made alive in [ the ] Spirit ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	19	in which also going he preached to the spirits [ which are ] in prison ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	20	heretofore disobedient , when the longsuffering of God waited in [ the ] days of Noah while the ark was preparing , into which few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water :
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	21	which figure also now saves you , [ even ] baptism , not a putting away of [ the ] filth of flesh , but [ the ] demand as before God of a good conscience , by [ the ] resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
DARBY	1%20Peter	3	22	who is at [ the ] right hand of God , gone into heaven , angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him .
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	4	Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with [ them ] to the same sink of corruption , speaking injuriously [ of you ] ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	2	no longer to live the rest of [ his ] time in [ the ] flesh to men 's lusts , but to God 's will .
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	3	For the time past [ is ] sufficient [ for us ] to have wrought the will of the Gentiles , walking in lasciviousness , lusts , wine-drinking , revels , drinkings , and unhallowed idolatries .
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	5	who shall render account to him who is ready to judge [ the ] living and [ the ] dead .
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	6	For to this [ end ] were the glad tidings preached to [ the ] dead also , that they might be judged , as regards men , after [ the ] flesh , but live , as regards God , after [ the ] Spirit .
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is drawn nigh : be sober therefore , and be watchful unto prayers ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	8	but before all things having fervent love among yourselves , because love covers a multitude of sins ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	9	hospitable one to another , without murmuring ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	10	each according as he has received a gift , ministering it to one another , as good stewards of [ the ] various grace of God .
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	11	If any one speak—as oracles of God ; if any one minister—as of strength which God supplies ; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of ages . Amen .
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	12	Beloved , take not [ as ] strange the fire [ of persecution ] which has taken place amongst you for [ your ] trial , as if a strange thing was happening to you ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	13	but as ye have share in the sufferings of Christ , rejoice , that in the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exultation .
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	14	If ye are reproached in [ the ] name of Christ , blessed [ are ye ] ; for the [ Spirit ] of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you : [ on their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified . ]
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	15	Let none of you suffer indeed as murderer , or thief , or evildoer , or as overseer of other people 's matters ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	16	but if as a christian , let him not be ashamed , but glorify God in this name .
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	17	For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of God [ is come ] ; but if first from us , what [ shall be ] the end of those who obey not the glad tidings of God ?
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	18	And if the righteous is difficultly saved , where shall the impious and [ the ] sinner appear ?
DARBY	1%20Peter	4	19	Wherefore also let them who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	1	Peter
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	5	Likewise [ ye ] younger , be subject to [ the ] elder , and all of you bind on humility towards one another ; for God sets himself against [ the ] proud , but to [ the ] humble gives grace .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	2	shepherd the flock of God which [ is ] among you , exercising oversight , not by necessity , but willingly ; not for base gain , but readily ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	3	not as lording it over your possessions , but being models for the flock .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	4	And when the chief shepherd is manifested ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in [ the due ] time ;
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	7	having cast all your care upon him , for he cares about you .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	8	Be vigilant , watch . Your adversary [ the ] devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	9	Whom resist , stedfast in faith , knowing that the selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which [ is ] in [ the ] world .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	10	But the God of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus , when ye have suffered for a little while , himself shall make perfect , stablish , strengthen , ground :
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	11	to him [ be ] the glory and the might for the ages of the ages . Amen .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	12	By Silvanus , the faithful brother , as I suppose , I have written to you briefly ; exhorting and testifying that this is [ the ] true grace of God in which ye stand .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	13	She that is elected with [ you ] in Babylon salutes you , and Marcus my son .
DARBY	1%20Peter	5	14	Salute one another with a kiss of love . Peace be with you all who [ are ] in Christ .
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	2	Grace and peace be multiplied to you in [ the ] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord .
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	1	Simon Peter , bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have received like precious faith with us through [ the ] righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ :
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	3	As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that has called us by glory and virtue ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	4	through which he has given to us the greatest and precious promises , that through these ye may become partakers of [ the ] divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	5	But for this very reason also , using therewith all diligence , in your faith have also virtue , in virtue knowledge ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	6	in knowledge temperance , in temperance endurance , in endurance godliness ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	7	in godliness brotherly love , in brotherly love love :
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	8	for these things existing and abounding in you make [ you ] to be neither idle nor unfruitful as regards the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	9	for he with whom these things are not present is blind , short-sighted , and has forgotten the purging of his former sins .
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	10	Wherefore the rather , brethren , use diligence to make your calling and election sure , for doing these things ye will never fall ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	11	for thus shall the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ be richly furnished unto you .
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	12	Wherefore I will be careful to put you always in mind of these things , although knowing [ them ] and established in the present truth .
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	13	But I account it right , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting [ you ] in remembrance ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	14	knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is speedily [ to take place ] , as also our Lord Jesus Christ has manifested to me ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	15	but I will use diligence , that after my departure ye should have also , at any time , [ in your power ] to call to mind these things .
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	16	For we have not made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , following cleverly imagined fables , but having been eyewitnesses of * his * majesty .
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	17	For he received from God [ the ] Father honour and glory , such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory : This is my beloved Son , in whom * I * have found my delight ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	18	and this voice * we * heard uttered from heaven , being with him on the holy mountain .
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	19	And we have the prophetic word [ made ] surer , to which ye do well taking heed ( as to a lamp shining in an obscure place ) until [ the ] day dawn and [ the ] morning star arise in your hearts ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	20	knowing this first , that [ the scope of ] no prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	1	21	for prophecy was not ever uttered by [ the ] will of man , but holy men of God spake under the power of [ the ] Holy Spirit .
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	2	and many shall follow their dissolute ways , through whom the way of the truth shall be blasphemed .
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	3	And through covetousness , with well-turned words , will they make merchandise of you : for whom judgment of old is not idle , and their destruction slumbers not .
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God spared not [ the ] angels who had sinned , but having cast them down to the deepest pit of gloom has delivered them to chains of darkness [ to be ] kept for judgment ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	5	and spared not [ the ] old world , but preserved Noe , [ the ] eighth , a preacher of righteousness , having brought in [ the ] flood upon [ the ] world of [ the ] ungodly ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	6	and having reduced [ the ] cities of Sodom and Gomorrha to ashes , condemned [ them ] with an overthrow , setting [ them as ] an example to those that should [ afterwards ] live an ungodly life ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	7	and saved righteous Lot , distressed with the abandoned conversation of the godless ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	8	( for the righteous man through seeing and hearing , dwelling among them , tormented [ his ] righteous soul day after day with [ their ] lawless works , )
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	9	[ the ] Lord knows [ how ] to deliver the godly out of trial , and to keep [ the ] unjust to [ the ] day of judgment [ to be ] punished ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	10	and specially those who walk after the flesh in [ the ] lust of uncleanness , and despise lordship . Bold [ are they ] , self-willed ; they do not fear speaking injuriously of dignities :
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	11	when angels , who are greater in might and power , do not bring against them , before the Lord , an injurious charge .
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	12	But these , as natural animals without reason , made to be caught and destroyed , speaking injuriously in things they are ignorant of , shall also perish in their own corruption ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	13	receiving [ the ] reward of unrighteousness ; accounting ephemeral indulgence pleasure ; spots and blemishes , rioting in their own deceits , feasting with you ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	14	having eyes full of adultery , and that cease not from sin , alluring unestablished souls ; having a heart practised in covetousness , children of curse ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	15	having left [ the ] straight way they have gone astray , having followed in the path of Balaam [ the son ] of Bosor , who loved [ the ] reward of unrighteousness ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	16	but had reproof of his own wickedness— [ the ] dumb ass speaking with man 's voice forbad the folly of the prophet .
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	17	These are springs without water , and mists driven by storm , to whom the gloom of darkness is reserved [ for ever ] .
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	18	For [ while ] speaking great highflown words of vanity , they allure with [ the ] lusts of [ the ] flesh , by dissoluteness , those who have just fled those who walk in error ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	19	promising them liberty , while they themselves are slaves of corruption ; for by whom a man is subdued , by him is he also brought into slavery .
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	20	For if after having escaped the pollutions of the world through [ the ] knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , again entangled , they are subdued by these , their last state is worse than the first .
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	21	For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than having known [ it ] to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them .
DARBY	2%20Peter	2	22	But that [ word ] of the true proverb has happened to them : [ The ] dog [ has ] turned back to his own vomit ; and , [ The ] washed sow to [ her ] rolling in mud .
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	2	to be mindful of the words spoken before by the holy prophets , and of the commandment of the Lord and Saviour by your apostles ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	3	knowing this first , that there shall come at [ the ] close of the days mockers with mocking , walking according to their own lusts ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	4	and saying , Where is the promise of his coming ? for from the time the fathers fell asleep all things remain thus from [ the ] beginning of [ the ] creation .
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	5	For this is hidden from them through their own wilfulness , that heavens were of old , and an earth , having its subsistence out of water and in water , by the word of God ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	6	through which [ waters ] the then world , deluged with water , perished .
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	7	But the present heavens and the earth by his word are laid up in store , kept for fire unto a day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	8	But let not this one thing be hidden from you , beloved , that one day with [ the ] Lord [ is ] as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	9	[ The ] Lord does not delay his promise , as some account of delay , but is longsuffering towards you , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of [ the ] Lord will come as a thief , in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise , and [ the ] elements , burning with heat , shall be dissolved , and [ the ] earth and the works in it shall be burnt up .
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	11	All these things then being to be dissolved , what ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	12	waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God , by reason of which [ the ] heavens , being on fire , shall be dissolved , and [ the ] elements , burning with heat , shall melt ?
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	13	But , according to his promise , we wait for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwells righteousness .
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	14	Wherefore , beloved , as ye wait for these things , be diligent to be found of him in peace , without spot and blameless ;
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	15	and account the longsuffering of our Lord [ to be ] salvation ; according as our beloved brother Paul also has written to you according to the wisdom given to him ,
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	16	as also in all [ his ] epistles , speaking in them of these things ; among which some things are hard to be understood , which the untaught and ill-established wrest , as also the other scriptures , to their own destruction .
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	17	* Ye * therefore , beloved , knowing [ these ] things before , take care lest , being led away along with the error of the wicked , ye should fall from your own stedfastness :
DARBY	2%20Peter	3	18	but grow in grace , and in [ the ] knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him [ be ] glory both now and to [ the ] day of eternity . Amen .
DARBY	1%20John	1	1	That which was from [ the ] beginning , that which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes ; that which we contemplated , and our hands handled , concerning the word of life ;
DARBY	1%20John	1	2	( and the life has been manifested , and we have seen , and bear witness , and report to you the eternal life , which was with the Father , and has been manifested to us : )
DARBY	1%20John	1	3	that which we have seen and heard we report to you , that * ye * also may have fellowship with us ; and our fellowship [ is ] indeed with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ .
DARBY	1%20John	1	4	And these things write we to you that your joy may be full .
DARBY	1%20John	1	5	And this is the message which we have heard from him , and declare to you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
DARBY	1%20John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not practise the truth .
DARBY	1%20John	1	7	But if we walk in the light as * he * is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin .
DARBY	1%20John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
DARBY	1%20John	1	9	If we confess our sins , he is faithful and righteous to forgive us [ our ] sins , and cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
DARBY	1%20John	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
DARBY	1%20John	2	1	John
DARBY	1%20John	2	2	and * he * is the propitiation for our sins ; but not for ours alone , but also for the whole world .
DARBY	1%20John	2	3	And hereby we know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
DARBY	1%20John	2	4	He that says , I know him , and does not keep his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him ;
DARBY	1%20John	2	5	but whoever keeps his word , in him verily the love of God is perfected . Hereby we know that we are in him .
DARBY	1%20John	2	6	He that says he abides in him ought , even as * he * walked , himself also [ so ] to walk .
DARBY	1%20John	2	7	Beloved , I write no new commandment to you , but an old commandment , which ye have had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word which ye heard .
DARBY	1%20John	2	8	Again , I write a new commandment to you , which thing is true in him and in you , because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines .
DARBY	1%20John	2	9	He who says he is in the light , and hates his brother , is in the darkness until now .
DARBY	1%20John	2	10	He that loves his brother abides in light , and there is no occasion of stumbling in him .
DARBY	1%20John	2	11	But he that hates his brother is in the darkness , and walks in the darkness , and knows not where he goes , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
DARBY	1%20John	2	12	I write to you , children , because [ your ] sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
DARBY	1%20John	2	13	I write to you , fathers , because ye have known him [ that is ] from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked [ one ] . I write to you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
DARBY	1%20John	2	14	I have written to you , fathers , because ye have known him [ that is ] from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abides in you , and ye have overcome the wicked [ one ] .
DARBY	1%20John	2	15	Love not the world , nor the things in the world . If any one love the world , the love of the Father is not in him ;
DARBY	1%20John	2	16	because all that [ is ] in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
DARBY	1%20John	2	17	And the world is passing , and its lust , but he that does the will of God abides for eternity .
DARBY	1%20John	2	18	Little children , it is [ the ] last hour , and , according as ye have heard that antichrist comes , even now there have come many antichrists , whence we know that it is [ the ] last hour .
DARBY	1%20John	2	19	They went out from among us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would have surely remained with us , but that they might be made manifest that none are of us .
DARBY	1%20John	2	20	And * ye * have [ the ] unction from the holy [ one ] , and ye know all things .
DARBY	1%20John	2	21	I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
DARBY	1%20John	2	22	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? * He * is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son .
DARBY	1%20John	2	23	Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either ; he who confesses the Son has the Father also .
DARBY	1%20John	2	24	As for * you * let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you : if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you , * ye * also shall abide in the Son and in the Father .
DARBY	1%20John	2	25	And this is the promise which * he * has promised us , life eternal .
DARBY	1%20John	2	26	These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray :
DARBY	1%20John	2	27	and * yourselves * , the unction which ye have received from him abides in you , and ye have not need that any one should teach you ; but as the same unction teaches you as to all things , and is true and is not a lie , and even as it has taught you , ye shall abide in him .
DARBY	1%20John	2	28	And now , children , abide in him , that if he be manifested we may have boldness , and not be put to shame from before him at his coming .
DARBY	1%20John	2	29	If ye know that he is righteous , know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him .
DARBY	1%20John	3	1	John
DARBY	1%20John	3	3	And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself , even as * he * is pure .
DARBY	1%20John	3	2	Beloved , now are we children of God , and what we shall be has not yet been manifested ; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him , for we shall see him as he is .
DARBY	1%20John	3	4	Every one that practises sin practises also lawlessness ; and sin is lawlessness .
DARBY	1%20John	3	5	And ye know that * he * has been manifested that he might take away our sins ; and in him sin is not .
DARBY	1%20John	3	6	Whoever abides in him , does not sin : whoever sins , has not seen him or known him .
DARBY	1%20John	3	7	Children , let no man lead you astray ; he that practises righteousness is righteous , even as * he * is righteous .
DARBY	1%20John	3	8	He that practises sin is of the devil ; for from [ the ] beginning the devil sins . To this end the Son of God has been manifested , that he might undo the works of the devil .
DARBY	1%20John	3	9	Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin , because his seed abides in him , and he can not sin , because he has been begotten of God .
DARBY	1%20John	3	10	In this are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil . Whoever does not practise righteousness is not of God , and he who does not love his brother .
DARBY	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message which ye have heard from the beginning , that we should love one another :
DARBY	1%20John	3	12	not as Cain was of the wicked one , and slew his brother ; and on account of what slew he him ? because his works were wicked , and those of his brother righteous .
DARBY	1%20John	3	13	Do not wonder , brethren , if the world hate you .
DARBY	1%20John	3	14	* We * know that we have passed from death to life , because we love the brethren . He who does not love [ his ] brother abides in death .
DARBY	1%20John	3	15	Every one that hates his brother is a murderer , and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him .
DARBY	1%20John	3	16	Hereby we have known love , because * he * has laid down his life for us ; and * we * ought for the brethren to lay down [ our ] lives .
DARBY	1%20John	3	17	But whoso may have the world 's substance , and see his brother having need , and shut up his bowels from him , how abides the love of God in him ?
DARBY	1%20John	3	18	Children , let us not love with word , nor with tongue , but in deed and in truth .
DARBY	1%20John	3	19	And hereby we shall know that we are of the truth , and shall persuade our hearts before him—
DARBY	1%20John	3	20	that if our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart and knows all things .
DARBY	1%20John	3	21	Beloved , if our heart condemn us not , we have boldness towards God ,
DARBY	1%20John	3	22	and whatsoever we ask we receive from him , because we keep his commandments , and practise the things which are pleasing in his sight .
DARBY	1%20John	3	23	And this is his commandment , that we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and that we love one another , even as he has given us commandment .
DARBY	1%20John	3	24	And he that keeps his commandments abides in him , and he in him . And hereby we know that he abides in us , by the Spirit which he has given to us .
DARBY	1%20John	4	1	John
DARBY	1%20John	4	4	* Ye * are of God , children , and have overcome them , because greater is he that [ is ] in you than he that [ is ] in the world .
DARBY	1%20John	4	2	Hereby ye know the Spirit of God : every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God ;
DARBY	1%20John	4	3	and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God : and this is that [ power ] of the antichrist , [ of ] which ye have heard that it comes , and now it is already in the world .
DARBY	1%20John	4	5	* They * are of the world ; for this reason they speak [ as ] of the world , and the world hears them .
DARBY	1%20John	4	6	* We * are of God ; he that knows God hears us ; he who is not of God does not hear us . From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error .
DARBY	1%20John	4	7	Beloved , let us love one another ; because love is of God , and every one that loves has been begotten of God , and knows God .
DARBY	1%20John	4	8	He that loves not has not known God ; for God is love .
DARBY	1%20John	4	9	Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God , that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
DARBY	1%20John	4	10	Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins .
DARBY	1%20John	4	11	Beloved , if God has so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
DARBY	1%20John	4	12	No one has seen God at any time : if we love one another , God abides in us , and his love is perfected in us .
DARBY	1%20John	4	13	Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us , that he has given to us of his Spirit .
DARBY	1%20John	4	14	And * we * have seen , and testify , that the Father has sent the Son [ as ] Saviour of the world .
DARBY	1%20John	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God abides in him , and he in God .
DARBY	1%20John	4	16	And * we * have known and have believed the love which God has to us . God is love , and he that abides in love abides in God , and God in him .
DARBY	1%20John	4	17	Herein has love been perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment , that even as * he * is , * we * also are in this world .
DARBY	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love , but perfect love casts out fear ; for fear has torment , and he that fears has not been made perfect in love .
DARBY	1%20John	4	19	* We * love because * he * has first loved us .
DARBY	1%20John	4	20	If any one say , I love God , and hate his brother , he is a liar : for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen , how can he love God whom he has not seen ?
DARBY	1%20John	4	21	And this commandment have we from him , That he that loves God love also his brother .
DARBY	1%20John	5	1	John
DARBY	1%20John	5	5	Who is he that gets the victory over the world , but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
DARBY	1%20John	5	2	Hereby know we that we love the children of God , when we love God and keep his commandments .
DARBY	1%20John	5	3	For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments ; and his commandments are not grievous .
DARBY	1%20John	5	4	For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world ; and this is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world , our faith .
DARBY	1%20John	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood , Jesus [ the ] Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit that bears witness , for the Spirit is the truth .
DARBY	1%20John	5	7	For they that bear witness are three :
DARBY	1%20John	5	8	the Spirit , and the water , and the blood ; and the three agree in one .
DARBY	1%20John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater . For this is the witness of God [ which ] he has witnessed concerning his Son .
DARBY	1%20John	5	10	He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself ; he that does not believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the witness which God has witnessed concerning his Son .
DARBY	1%20John	5	11	And this is the witness , that God has given to us eternal life ; and this life is in his Son .
DARBY	1%20John	5	12	He that has the Son has life : he that has not the Son of God has not life .
DARBY	1%20John	5	13	These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God .
DARBY	1%20John	5	14	And this is the boldness which we have towards him , that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us .
DARBY	1%20John	5	15	And if we know that he hears us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him .
DARBY	1%20John	5	16	If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death , he shall ask , and he shall give him life , for those that do not sin unto death . There is a sin to death : I do not say of that that he should make a request .
DARBY	1%20John	5	17	Every unrighteousness is sin ; and there is a sin not to death .
DARBY	1%20John	5	18	We know that every one begotten of God does not sin , but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself , and the wicked [ one ] does not touch him .
DARBY	1%20John	5	19	We know that we are of God , and the whole world lies in the wicked [ one ] .
DARBY	1%20John	5	20	And we know that the Son of God has come , and has given us an understanding that we should know him that [ is ] true ; and we are in him that [ is ] true , in his Son Jesus Christ . He is the true God and eternal life .
DARBY	1%20John	5	21	Children , keep yourselves from idols .
DARBY	2%20John	1	2	for the truth 's sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity .
DARBY	2%20John	1	1	The elder to [ the ] elect lady and her children , whom * I * love in truth , and not * I * only but also all who have known the truth ,
DARBY	2%20John	1	3	Grace shall be with you , mercy , peace from God [ the ] Father , and from [ the ] Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
DARBY	2%20John	1	4	I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth , as we have received commandment from the Father .
DARBY	2%20John	1	5	And now I beseech thee , lady , not as writing to thee a new commandment , but that which we have had from [ the ] beginning , that we should love one another .
DARBY	2%20John	1	6	And this is love , that we should walk according to his commandments . This is the commandment , according as ye have heard from the beginning , that ye might walk in it .
DARBY	2%20John	1	7	For many deceivers have gone out into the world , they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh—this is the deceiver and the antichrist .
DARBY	2%20John	1	8	See to yourselves , that we may not lose what we have wrought , but may receive full wages .
DARBY	2%20John	1	9	Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the Christ has not God . He that abides in the doctrine , * he * has both the Father and the Son .
DARBY	2%20John	1	10	If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine , do not receive him into [ the ] house , and greet him not ;
DARBY	2%20John	1	11	for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works .
DARBY	2%20John	1	12	Having many things to write to you , I would not with paper and ink ; but hope to come to you , and to speak mouth to mouth , that our joy may be full .
DARBY	2%20John	1	13	The children of thine elect sister greet thee .
DARBY	3%20John	1	3	For I rejoiced exceedingly when [ the ] brethren came and bore testimony to thy [ holding fast the ] truth , even as * thou * walkest in truth .
DARBY	3%20John	1	1	The elder to the beloved Gaius , whom I love in truth .
DARBY	3%20John	1	2	Beloved , I desire that in all things thou shouldest prosper and be in health , even as thy soul prospers .
DARBY	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater joy than these things that I hear of my children walking in the truth .
DARBY	3%20John	1	5	Beloved , thou doest faithfully [ in ] whatever thou mayest have wrought towards the brethren and that strangers ,
DARBY	3%20John	1	6	( who have witnessed of thy love before [ the ] assembly , ) in setting forward whom on their journey worthily of God , thou wilt do well ;
DARBY	3%20John	1	7	for for the name have they gone forth , taking nothing of those of the nations .
DARBY	3%20John	1	8	* We * therefore ought to receive such , that we may be fellow-workers with the truth .
DARBY	3%20John	1	9	I wrote something to the assembly ; but Diotrephes , who loves to have the first place among them , receives us not .
DARBY	3%20John	1	10	For this reason , if I come , I will bring to remembrance his works which he does , babbling against us with wicked words ; and not content with these , neither does he himself receive the brethren ; and those who would he prevents , and casts [ them ] out of the assembly .
DARBY	3%20John	1	11	Beloved , do not imitate what is evil , but what is good . He that does good is of God . He that does evil has not seen God .
DARBY	3%20John	1	12	Demetrius has witness borne to him by all , and by the truth itself ; and * we * also bear witness , and thou knowest that our witness is true .
DARBY	3%20John	1	13	I had many things to write to thee , but I will not with ink and pen write to thee ;
DARBY	3%20John	1	14	but I hope soon to see thee , and we will speak mouth to mouth . Peace [ be ] to thee . The friends greet thee . Greet the friends by name .
DARBY	Jude	1	1	Jude , bondman of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to the called ones beloved in God [ the ] Father and preserved in Jesus Christ :
DARBY	Jude	1	2	Mercy to you , and peace , and love be multiplied .
DARBY	Jude	1	3	Beloved , using all diligence to write to you of our common salvation , I have been obliged to write to you exhorting [ you ] to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints .
DARBY	Jude	1	4	For certain men have got in unnoticed , they who of old were marked out beforehand to this sentence , ungodly [ persons ] , turning the grace of our God into dissoluteness , and denying our only Master and Lord Jesus Christ .
DARBY	Jude	1	5	But I would put you in remembrance , you who once knew all things , that the Lord , having saved a people out of [ the ] land of Egypt , in the second place destroyed those who had not believed .
DARBY	Jude	1	6	And angels who had not kept their own original state , but had abandoned their own dwelling , he keeps in eternal chains under gloomy darkness , to [ the ] judgment of [ the ] great day ;
DARBY	Jude	1	7	as Sodom and Gomorrha , and the cities around them , committing greedily fornication , in like manner with them , and going after other flesh , lie there as an example , undergoing the judgment of eternal fire .
DARBY	Jude	1	8	Yet in like manner these dreamers also defile [ the ] flesh , and despise lordship , and speak railingly against dignities .
DARBY	Jude	1	9	But Michael the archangel , when disputing with the devil he reasoned about the body of Moses , did not dare to bring a railing judgment against [ him ] , but said , [ The ] Lord rebuke thee .
DARBY	Jude	1	10	But these , whatever things they know not , they speak railingly against ; but what even , as the irrational animals , they understand by mere nature , in these things they corrupt themselves .
DARBY	Jude	1	11	Woe to them ! because they have gone in the way of Cain , and given themselves up to the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
DARBY	Jude	1	12	These are spots in your love-feasts , feasting together [ with you ] without fear , pasturing themselves ; clouds without water , carried along by [ the ] winds ; autumnal trees , without fruit , twice dead , rooted up ;
DARBY	Jude	1	13	raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shames ; wandering stars , to whom has been reserved the gloom of darkness for eternity .
DARBY	Jude	1	14	And Enoch , [ the ] seventh from Adam , prophesied also as to these , saying , Behold , [ the ] Lord has come amidst his holy myriads ,
DARBY	Jude	1	15	to execute judgment against all ; and to convict all the ungodly of them of all their works of ungodliness , which they have wrought ungodlily , and of all the hard [ things ] which ungodly sinners have spoken against him .
DARBY	Jude	1	16	These are murmurers , complainers , walking after their lusts ; and their mouth speaks swelling words , admiring persons for the sake of profit .
DARBY	Jude	1	17	But * ye * , beloved , remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DARBY	Jude	1	18	that they said to you , that at [ the ] end of the time there should be mockers , walking after their own lusts of ungodlinesses .
DARBY	Jude	1	19	These are they who set [ themselves ] apart , natural [ men ] , not having [ the ] Spirit .
DARBY	Jude	1	20	But * ye * , beloved , building yourselves up on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Spirit ,
DARBY	Jude	1	21	keep yourselves in the love of God , awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life .
DARBY	Jude	1	22	And of some have compassion , making a difference ,
DARBY	Jude	1	23	but others save with fear , snatching [ them ] out of the fire ; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
DARBY	Jude	1	24	But to him that is able to keep you without stumbling , and to set [ you ] with exultation blameless before his glory ,
DARBY	Jude	1	25	to the only God our Saviour , through Jesus Christ our Lord , [ be ] glory , majesty , might , and authority , from before the whole age , and now , and to all the ages . Amen .
DARBY	Revelation	1	1	Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave to him , to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place ; and he signified [ it ] , sending by his angel , to his bondman John ,
DARBY	Revelation	1	2	who testified the word of God , and the testimony of Jesus Christ , all things that he saw .
DARBY	Revelation	1	3	Blessed [ is ] he that reads , and they that hear the words of the prophecy , and keep the things written in it ; for the time [ is ] near .
DARBY	Revelation	1	4	John to the seven assemblies which [ are ] in Asia : Grace to you and peace from [ him ] who is , and who was , and who is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which [ are ] before his throne ;
DARBY	Revelation	1	5	and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the firstborn from the dead , and the prince of the kings of the earth . To him who loves us , and has washed us from our sins in his blood ,
DARBY	Revelation	1	6	and made us a kingdom , priests to his God and Father : to him [ be ] the glory and the might to the ages of ages . Amen .
DARBY	Revelation	1	7	Behold , he comes with the clouds , and every eye shall see him , and they which have pierced him , and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him . Yea . Amen .
DARBY	Revelation	1	8	I am the Alpha and the Omega , saith [ the ] Lord God , he who is , and who was , and who is to come , the Almighty .
DARBY	Revelation	1	9	I John , your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience , in Jesus , was in the island called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus .
DARBY	Revelation	1	10	I became in [ the ] Spirit on the Lord 's day , and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet ,
DARBY	Revelation	1	11	saying , What thou seest write in a book , and send to the seven assemblies : to Ephesus , and to Smyrna , and to Pergamos , and to Thyatira , and to Sardis , and to Philadelphia , and to Laodicea .
DARBY	Revelation	1	12	And I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me ; and having turned , I saw seven golden lamps ,
DARBY	Revelation	1	13	and in the midst of the [ seven ] lamps [ one ] like [ the ] Son of man , clothed with a garment reaching to the feet , and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle :
DARBY	Revelation	1	14	his head and hair white like white wool , as snow ; and his eyes as a flame of fire ;
DARBY	Revelation	1	15	and his feet like fine brass , as burning in a furnace ; and his voice as the voice of many waters ;
DARBY	Revelation	1	16	and having in his right hand seven stars ; and out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth ; and his countenance as the sun shines in its power .
DARBY	Revelation	1	17	And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead ; and he laid his right hand upon me , saying , Fear not ; * I * am the first and the last ,
DARBY	Revelation	1	18	and the living one : and I became dead , and behold , I am living to the ages of ages , and have the keys of death and of hades .
DARBY	Revelation	1	19	Write therefore what thou hast seen , and the things that are , and the things that are about to be after these .
DARBY	Revelation	1	20	The mystery of the seven stars which thou hast seen on my right hand , and the seven golden lamps.—The seven stars are angels of the seven assemblies ; and the seven lamps are seven assemblies .
DARBY	Revelation	2	2	I know thy works and [ thy ] labour , and thine endurance , and that thou canst not bear evil [ men ] ; and thou hast tried them who say that themselves [ are ] apostles and are not , and hast found them liars ;
DARBY	Revelation	2	3	and endurest , and hast borne for my name 's sake , and hast not wearied :
DARBY	Revelation	2	4	but I have against thee , that thou hast left thy first love .
DARBY	Revelation	2	5	Remember therefore whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works : but if not , I am coming to thee , and I will remove thy lamp out of its place , except thou shalt repent .
DARBY	Revelation	2	6	But this thou hast , that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitanes , which * I * also hate .
DARBY	Revelation	2	7	He that has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . To him that overcomes , I will give to him to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God .
DARBY	Revelation	2	8	And to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write : These things says the first and the last , who became dead , and lived :
DARBY	Revelation	2	9	I know thy tribulation and thy poverty ; but thou art rich ; and the railing of those who say that they themselves are Jews , and are not , but a synagogue of Satan .
DARBY	Revelation	2	10	Fear nothing [ of ] what thou art about to suffer . Behold , the devil is about to cast of you into prison , that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten days . Be thou faithful unto death , and I will give to thee the crown of life .
DARBY	Revelation	2	11	He that has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . He that overcomes shall in no wise be injured of the second death .
DARBY	Revelation	2	12	And to the angel of the assembly in Pergamos write : These things says he that has the sharp two-edged sword :
DARBY	Revelation	2	13	I know where thou dwellest , where the throne of Satan [ is ] ; and thou holdest fast my name , and hast not denied my faith , even in the days in which Antipas my faithful witness [ was ] , who was slain among you , where Satan dwells .
DARBY	Revelation	2	14	But I have a few things against thee : that thou hast there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balak to cast a snare before the sons of Israel , to eat [ of ] idol sacrifices and commit fornication .
DARBY	Revelation	2	15	So thou also hast those who hold the doctrine of Nicolaitanes in like manner .
DARBY	Revelation	2	16	Repent therefore : but if not , I come to thee quickly , and I will make war with them with the sword of my mouth .
DARBY	Revelation	2	17	He that has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . To him that overcomes , to him will I give of the hidden manna ; and I will give to him a white stone , and on the stone a new name written , which no one knows but he that receives [ it ] .
DARBY	Revelation	2	18	And to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write : These things says the Son of God , he that has his eyes as a flame of fire , and his feet [ are ] like fine brass :
DARBY	Revelation	2	19	I know thy works , and love , and faith , and service , and thine endurance , and thy last works [ to be ] more than the first .
DARBY	Revelation	2	20	But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel , she who calls herself prophetess , and she teaches and leads astray my servants to commit fornication and eat of idol sacrifices .
DARBY	Revelation	2	21	And I gave her time that she should repent , and she will not repent of her fornication .
DARBY	Revelation	2	22	Behold , I cast her into a bed , and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , unless they repent of her works ,
DARBY	Revelation	2	23	and her children will I kill with death ; and all the assemblies shall know that * I * am he that searches [ the ] reins and [ the ] hearts ; and I will give to you each according to your works .
DARBY	Revelation	2	24	But to you I say , the rest who [ are ] in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , who have not known the depths of Satan , as they say , I do not cast upon you any other burden ;
DARBY	Revelation	2	25	but what ye have hold fast till I shall come .
DARBY	Revelation	2	26	And he that overcomes , and he that keeps unto the end my works , to him will I give authority over the nations ,
DARBY	Revelation	2	27	and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod ; as vessels of pottery are they broken in pieces , as I also have received from my Father ;
DARBY	Revelation	2	28	and I will give to him the morning star .
DARBY	Revelation	2	29	He that has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
DARBY	Revelation	3	3	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and keep [ it ] and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come [ upon thee ] as a thief , and thou shalt not know at what hour I shall come upon thee .
DARBY	Revelation	3	2	Be watchful , and strengthen the things that remain , which are about to die , for I have not found thy works complete before my God .
DARBY	Revelation	3	4	But thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments , and they shall walk with me in white , because they are worthy .
DARBY	Revelation	3	5	He that overcomes , * he * shall be clothed in white garments , and I will not blot his name out of the book of life , and will confess his name before my Father and before his angels .
DARBY	Revelation	3	6	He that has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
DARBY	Revelation	3	7	And to the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write : These things saith the holy , the true ; he that has the key of David , he who opens and no one shall shut , and shuts and no one shall open :
DARBY	Revelation	3	8	I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an opened door , which no one can shut , because thou hast a little power , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
DARBY	Revelation	3	9	Behold , I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews , and are not , but lie ; behold , I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet , and shall know that * I * have loved thee .
DARBY	Revelation	3	10	Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , * I * also will keep thee out of the hour of trial , which is about to come upon the whole habitable world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	3	11	I come quickly : hold fast what thou hast , that no one take thy crown .
DARBY	Revelation	3	12	He that overcomes , him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall go no more at all out ; and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , which comes down out of heaven , from my God , and my new name .
DARBY	Revelation	3	13	He that has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
DARBY	Revelation	3	14	And to the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write : These things says the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God :
DARBY	Revelation	3	15	I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot ; I would thou wert cold or hot .
DARBY	Revelation	3	16	Thus because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I am about to spue thee out of my mouth .
DARBY	Revelation	3	17	Because thou sayest , I am rich , and am grown rich , and have need of nothing , and knowest not that * thou * art the wretched and the miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked ;
DARBY	Revelation	3	18	I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white garments , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest ; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes , that thou mayest see .
DARBY	Revelation	3	19	I rebuke and discipline as many as I love ; be zealous therefore and repent .
DARBY	Revelation	3	20	Behold , I stand at the door and am knocking ; if any one hear my voice and open the door , I will come in unto him and sup with him , and he with me .
DARBY	Revelation	3	21	He that overcomes , to him will I give to sit with me in my throne ; as * I * also have overcome , and have sat down with my Father in his throne .
DARBY	Revelation	3	22	He that has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies .
DARBY	Revelation	4	4	And round the throne twenty-four thrones , and on the thrones twenty-four elders sitting , clothed with white garments ; and on their heads golden crowns .
DARBY	Revelation	4	2	Immediately I became in [ the ] Spirit ; and behold , a throne stood in the heaven , and upon the throne one sitting ,
DARBY	Revelation	4	3	and he [ that was ] sitting like in appearance to a stone [ of ] jasper and a sardius , and a rainbow round the throne like in appearance to an emerald .
DARBY	Revelation	4	5	And out of the throne go forth lightnings , and voices , and thunders ; and seven lamps of fire , burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God ;
DARBY	Revelation	4	6	and before the throne , as a glass sea , like crystal . And in the midst of the throne , and around the throne , four living creatures , full of eyes , before and behind ;
DARBY	Revelation	4	7	and the first living creature like a lion , and the second living creature like a calf , and the third living creature having the face as of a man , and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle .
DARBY	Revelation	4	8	And the four living creatures , each one of them having respectively six wings ; round and within they are full of eyes ; and they cease not day and night saying , Holy , holy , holy , Lord God Almighty , who was , and who is , and who is to come .
DARBY	Revelation	4	9	And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne , who lives to the ages of ages ,
DARBY	Revelation	4	10	the twenty-four elders shall fall before him that sits upon the throne , and do homage to him that lives to the ages of ages ; and shall cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
DARBY	Revelation	4	11	Thou art worthy , O our Lord and [ our ] God , to receive glory and honour and power ; for * thou * hast created all things , and for thy will they were , and they have been created .
DARBY	Revelation	5	5	And one of the elders says to me , Do not weep . Behold , the lion which [ is ] of the tribe of Juda , the root of David , has overcome [ so as ] to open the book , and its seven seals .
DARBY	Revelation	5	2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , Who [ is ] worthy to open the book , and to break its seals ?
DARBY	Revelation	5	3	And no one was able in the heaven , or upon the earth , or underneath the earth , to open the book , or to regard it .
DARBY	Revelation	5	4	And * I * wept much because no one had been found worthy to open the book nor to regard it .
DARBY	Revelation	5	6	And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a Lamb standing , as slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God [ which are ] sent into all the earth :
DARBY	Revelation	5	7	and it came and took [ it ] out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne .
DARBY	Revelation	5	8	And when it took the book , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb , having each a harp and golden bowls full of incenses , which are the prayers of the saints .
DARBY	Revelation	5	9	And they sing a new song , saying , Thou art worthy to take the book , and to open its seals ; because thou hast been slain , and hast redeemed to God , by thy blood , out of every tribe , and tongue , and people , and nation ,
DARBY	Revelation	5	10	and made them to our God kings and priests ; and they shall reign over the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	5	11	And I saw , and I heard [ the ] voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders ; and their number was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands ;
DARBY	Revelation	5	12	saying with a loud voice , Worthy is the Lamb that has been slain , to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
DARBY	Revelation	5	13	And every creature which is in the heaven and upon the earth and under the earth , and [ those that are ] upon the sea , and all things in them , heard I saying , To him that sits upon the throne , and to the Lamb , blessing , and honour , and glory , and might , to the ages of ages .
DARBY	Revelation	5	14	And the four living creatures said , Amen ; and the elders fell down and did homage .
DARBY	Revelation	6	6	And I heard as a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , A choenix of wheat for a denarius , and three choenixes of barley for a denarius : and do not injure the oil and the wine .
DARBY	Revelation	6	2	And I saw : and behold , a white horse , and he that sat upon it having a bow ; and a crown was given to him , and he went forth conquering and that he might conquer .
DARBY	Revelation	6	3	And when it opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature saying , Come [ and see ] .
DARBY	Revelation	6	4	And another , a red horse , went forth ; and to him that sat upon it , to him it was given to take peace from the earth , and that they should slay one another ; and there was given to him a great sword .
DARBY	Revelation	6	5	And when it opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature saying , Come [ and see ] . And I saw : and behold , a black horse , and he that sat upon it having a balance in his hand .
DARBY	Revelation	6	7	And when it opened the fourth seal , I heard [ the voice of ] the fourth living creature saying , Come [ and see ] .
DARBY	Revelation	6	8	And I saw : and behold , a pale horse , and he that sat upon it , his name [ was ] Death , and hades followed with him ; and authority was given to him over the fourth of the earth to slay with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and by the beasts of the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	6	9	And when it opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held ;
DARBY	Revelation	6	10	and they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O sovereign Ruler , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth ?
DARBY	Revelation	6	11	And there was given to them , to each one a white robe ; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while , until both their fellow-bondmen and their brethren , who were about to be killed as they , should be fulfilled .
DARBY	Revelation	6	12	And I saw when it opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as hair sackcloth , and the whole moon became as blood ,
DARBY	Revelation	6	13	and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth , as a fig tree , shaken by a great wind , casts its unseasonable figs .
DARBY	Revelation	6	14	And the heaven was removed as a book rolled up , and every mountain and island were removed out of their places .
DARBY	Revelation	6	15	And the kings of the earth , and the great , and the chiliarchs , and the rich , and the strong , and every bondman and freeman , hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains ;
DARBY	Revelation	6	16	and they say to the mountains and to the rocks , Fall on us , and have us hidden from [ the ] face of him that sits upon the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb ;
DARBY	Revelation	6	17	because the great day of his wrath is come , and who is able to stand ?
DARBY	Revelation	7	7	out of [ the ] tribe of Simeon , twelve thousand ; out of [ the ] tribe of Levi , twelve thousand ; out of [ the ] tribe of Issachar , twelve thousand ;
DARBY	Revelation	7	2	And I saw another angel ascending from [ the ] sunrising , having [ the ] seal of [ the ] living God ; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
DARBY	Revelation	7	3	saying , Hurt not the earth , nor the sea , nor the trees , until we shall have sealed the bondmen of our God upon their foreheads .
DARBY	Revelation	7	4	And I heard the number of the sealed , a hundred [ and ] forty-four thousand , sealed out of every tribe of [ the ] sons of Israel :
DARBY	Revelation	7	5	out of [ the ] tribe of Juda , twelve thousand sealed ; out of [ the ] tribe of Reuben , twelve thousand ; out of [ the ] tribe of Gad , twelve thousand ;
DARBY	Revelation	7	6	out of [ the ] tribe of Aser , twelve thousand ; out of [ the ] tribe of Nepthalim , twelve thousand ; out of [ the ] tribe of Manasseh , twelve thousand ;
DARBY	Revelation	7	8	out of [ the ] tribe of Zabulun , twelve thousand ; out of [ the ] tribe of Joseph , twelve thousand ; out of [ the ] tribe of Benjamin , twelve thousand sealed .
DARBY	Revelation	7	9	After these things I saw , and lo , a great crowd , which no one could number , out of every nation and tribes and peoples and tongues , standing before the throne , and before the Lamb , clothed with white robes , and palm branches in their hands .
DARBY	Revelation	7	10	And they cry with a loud voice , saying , Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne , and to the Lamb .
DARBY	Revelation	7	11	And all the angels stood around the throne , and the elders , and the four living creatures , and fell before the throne upon their faces , and worshipped God ,
DARBY	Revelation	7	12	saying , Amen : Blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and strength , to our God , to the ages of ages . Amen .
DARBY	Revelation	7	13	And one of the elders answered , saying to me , These who are clothed with white robes , who are they , and whence came they ?
DARBY	Revelation	7	14	And I said to him , My lord , * thou * knowest . And he said to me , These are they who come out of the great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
DARBY	Revelation	7	15	Therefore are they before the throne of God , and serve him day and night in his temple , and he that sits upon the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them .
DARBY	Revelation	7	16	They shall not hunger any more , neither shall they thirst any more , nor shall the sun at all fall on them , nor any burning heat ;
DARBY	Revelation	7	17	because the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them , and shall lead them to fountains of waters of life , and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes .
DARBY	Revelation	8	8	And the second angel sounded [ his ] trumpet : and as a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea , and the third part of the sea became blood ;
DARBY	Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
DARBY	Revelation	8	3	And another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer ; and much incense was given to him , that he might give [ efficacy ] to the prayers of all saints at the golden altar which [ was ] before the throne .
DARBY	Revelation	8	4	And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints , out of the hand of the angel before God .
DARBY	Revelation	8	5	And the angel took the censer , and filled it from the fire of the altar , and cast [ it ] on the earth : and there were voices , and thunders and lightnings , and an earthquake .
DARBY	Revelation	8	6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound with [ their ] trumpets .
DARBY	Revelation	8	7	And the first sounded [ his ] trumpet : and there was hail and fire , mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth ; and the third part of the earth was burnt up , and the third part of the trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
DARBY	Revelation	8	9	and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea which had life died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
DARBY	Revelation	8	10	And the third angel sounded [ his ] trumpet : and there fell out of the heaven a great star , burning as a torch , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters .
DARBY	Revelation	8	11	And the name of the star is called Wormwood ; and the third part of the waters became wormwood , and many of the men died of the waters because they were made bitter .
DARBY	Revelation	8	12	And the fourth angel sounded [ his ] trumpet : and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so that the third part of them should be darkened , and that the day should not appear [ for ] the third part of it , and the night the same .
DARBY	Revelation	8	13	And I saw , and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven , saying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe , to them that dwell upon the earth , for the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound .
DARBY	Revelation	9	9	and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron , and the sound of their wings [ was ] as the sound of chariots of many horses running to war ;
DARBY	Revelation	9	2	And it opened the pit of the abyss ; and there went up smoke out of the pit as [ the ] smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit .
DARBY	Revelation	9	3	And out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth , and power was given to them as the scorpions of the earth have power ;
DARBY	Revelation	9	4	and it was said to them , that they should not injure the grass of the earth , nor any green thing , nor any tree , but the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads :
DARBY	Revelation	9	5	and it was given to them that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months ; and their torment [ was ] as [ the ] torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man .
DARBY	Revelation	9	6	And in those days shall men seek death , and shall in no way find it ; and shall desire to die , and death flees from them .
DARBY	Revelation	9	7	And the likenesses of the locusts [ were ] like to horses prepared for war ; and upon their heads as crowns like gold , and their faces as faces of men ;
DARBY	Revelation	9	8	and they had hair as women 's hair , and their teeth were as of lions ,
DARBY	Revelation	9	10	and they have tails like scorpions , and stings ; and their power [ was ] in their tails to hurt men five months .
DARBY	Revelation	9	11	They have a king over them , the angel of the abyss : his name in Hebrew , Abaddon , and in Greek he has [ for ] name Apollyon .
DARBY	Revelation	9	12	The first woe has passed . Behold , there come yet two woes after these things .
DARBY	Revelation	9	13	And the sixth angel sounded [ his ] trumpet : and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which [ is ] before God ,
DARBY	Revelation	9	14	saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates .
DARBY	Revelation	9	15	And the four angels were loosed , who are prepared for the hour and day and month and year , that they might slay the third part of men ;
DARBY	Revelation	9	16	and the number of the hosts of horse [ was ] twice ten thousand times ten thousand . I heard their number .
DARBY	Revelation	9	17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and those that sat upon them , having breastplates of fire and jacinth and brimstone ; and the heads of the horses [ were ] as heads of lions , and out of their mouths goes out fire and smoke and brimstone .
DARBY	Revelation	9	18	By these three plagues were the third part of men killed , by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which goes out of their mouths .
DARBY	Revelation	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails : for their tails [ are ] like serpents , having heads , and with them they injure .
DARBY	Revelation	9	20	And the rest of men who were not killed with these plagues repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship demons , and the golden and silver and brazen and stone and wooden idols , which can neither see nor hear nor walk .
DARBY	Revelation	9	21	And they repented not of their murders , nor of their witchcrafts , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
DARBY	Revelation	10	10	And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth as honey , sweet ; and when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter .
DARBY	Revelation	10	2	and having in his hand a little opened book . And he set his right foot on the sea , and the left upon the earth ,
DARBY	Revelation	10	3	and cried with a loud voice as a lion roars . And when he cried , the seven thunders uttered their own voices .
DARBY	Revelation	10	4	And when the seven thunders spoke , I was about to write : and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying , Seal the things which the seven thunders have spoken , and write them not .
DARBY	Revelation	10	5	And the angel whom I saw stand on the sea and on the earth lifted up his right hand to the heaven ,
DARBY	Revelation	10	6	and swore by him that lives to the ages of ages , who created the heaven and the things that are in it , and the earth and the things that are in it , and the sea and the things that are in it , that there should be no longer delay ;
DARBY	Revelation	10	7	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound the trumpet , the mystery of God also shall be completed , as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets .
DARBY	Revelation	10	8	And the voice which I heard out of the heaven [ was ] again speaking with me , and saying , Go , take the little book which is opened in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	10	9	And I went to the angel , saying to him to give me the little book . And he says to me , Take and eat it up : and it shall make thy belly bitter , but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey .
DARBY	Revelation	10	11	And it was said to me , Thou must prophesy again as to peoples and nations and tongues and many kings .
DARBY	Revelation	11	11	And after the three days and a half [ the ] spirit of life from God came into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon those beholding them .
DARBY	Revelation	11	2	And the court which [ is ] without the temple cast out , and measure it not ; because it has been given [ up ] to the nations , and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months .
DARBY	Revelation	11	3	And I will give [ power ] to my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred [ and ] sixty days , clothed in sackcloth .
DARBY	Revelation	11	4	These are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand before the Lord of the earth ;
DARBY	Revelation	11	5	and if any one wills to injure them , fire goes out of their mouth , and devours their enemies . And if any one wills to injure them , thus must he be killed .
DARBY	Revelation	11	6	These have power to shut the heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy ; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood , and to smite the earth as often as they will with every plague .
DARBY	Revelation	11	7	And when they shall have completed their testimony , the beast who comes up out of the abyss shall make war with them , and shall conquer them , and shall kill them :
DARBY	Revelation	11	8	and their body [ shall be ] on the street of the great city , which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
DARBY	Revelation	11	9	And [ men ] of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their body three days and a half , and they do not suffer their bodies to be put into a sepulchre .
DARBY	Revelation	11	10	And they that dwell upon the earth rejoice over them , and are full of delight , and shall send gifts one to another , because these , the two prophets , tormented them that dwell upon the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	11	12	And I heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them , Come up here ; and they went up to the heaven in the cloud , and their enemies beheld them .
DARBY	Revelation	11	13	And in that hour there was a great earthquake , and the tenth of the city fell , and seven thousand names of men were slain in the earthquake . And the remnant were filled with fear , and gave glory to the God of the heaven .
DARBY	Revelation	11	14	The second woe has passed ; behold , the third woe comes quickly .
DARBY	Revelation	11	15	And the seventh angel sounded [ his ] trumpet : and there were great voices in the heaven , saying , The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come , and he shall reign to the ages of ages .
DARBY	Revelation	11	16	And the twenty-four elders , who sit on their thrones before God , fell upon their faces , and worshipped God ,
DARBY	Revelation	11	17	saying , We give thee thanks , Lord God Almighty , [ He ] who is , and who was , that thou hast taken thy great power and hast reigned .
DARBY	Revelation	11	18	And the nations have been full of wrath , and thy wrath is come , and the time of the dead to be judged , and to give the recompense to thy servants the prophets , and to the saints , and to those who fear thy name , small and great ; and to destroy those that destroy the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	11	19	And the temple of God in the heaven was opened , and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunders , and an earthquake , and great hail .
DARBY	Revelation	12	12	Therefore be full of delight , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . Woe to the earth and to the sea , because the devil has come down to you , having great rage , knowing he has a short time .
DARBY	Revelation	12	2	and being with child she cried , [ being ] in travail , and in pain to bring forth .
DARBY	Revelation	12	3	And another sign was seen in the heaven : and behold , a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads seven diadems ;
DARBY	Revelation	12	4	and his tail draws the third part of the stars of the heaven ; and he cast them to the earth . And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth , in order that when she brought forth he might devour her child .
DARBY	Revelation	12	5	And she brought forth a male son , who shall shepherd all the nations with an iron rod ; and her child was caught up to God and to his throne .
DARBY	Revelation	12	6	And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she has there a place prepared of God , that they should nourish her there a thousand two hundred [ and ] sixty days .
DARBY	Revelation	12	7	And there was war in the heaven : Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon . And the dragon fought , and his angels ;
DARBY	Revelation	12	8	and he prevailed not , nor was their place found any more in the heaven .
DARBY	Revelation	12	9	And the great dragon was cast out , the ancient serpent , he who is called Devil and Satan , he who deceives the whole habitable world , he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
DARBY	Revelation	12	10	And I heard a great voice in the heaven saying , Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God , and the authority of his Christ ; for the accuser of our brethren has been cast out , who accused them before our God day and night :
DARBY	Revelation	12	11	and * they * have overcome him by reason of the blood of the Lamb , and by reason of the word of their testimony , and have not loved their life even unto death .
DARBY	Revelation	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he had been cast out into the earth , he persecuted the woman which bore the male [ child ] .
DARBY	Revelation	12	14	And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle , that she might fly into the desert into her place , where she is nourished there a time , and times , and half a time , from [ the ] face of the serpent .
DARBY	Revelation	12	15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth behind the woman water as a river , that he might make her be [ as ] one carried away by a river .
DARBY	Revelation	12	16	And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
DARBY	Revelation	12	17	And the dragon was angry with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , who keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus .
DARBY	Revelation	13	13	And it works great signs , that it should cause even fire to come down from heaven to the earth before men .
DARBY	Revelation	13	2	And the beast which I saw was like to a leopardess , and its feet as of a bear , and its mouth as a lion 's mouth ; and the dragon gave to it his power , and his throne , and great authority ;
DARBY	Revelation	13	3	and one of his heads [ was ] as slain to death , and his wound of death had been healed : and the whole earth wondered after the beast .
DARBY	Revelation	13	4	And they did homage to the dragon , because he gave the authority to the beast ; and they did homage to the beast , saying , Who [ is ] like to the beast ? and who can make war with it ?
DARBY	Revelation	13	5	And there was given to it a mouth , speaking great things and blasphemies ; and there was given to it authority to pursue its career forty-two months .
DARBY	Revelation	13	6	And it opened its mouth for blasphemies against God , to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle , and those who have their tabernacle in the heaven .
DARBY	Revelation	13	7	And there was given to it to make war with the saints , and to overcome them ; and there was given to it authority over every tribe , and people , and tongue , and nation ;
DARBY	Revelation	13	8	and all that dwell on the earth shall do it homage , [ every one ] whose name had not been written from [ the ] founding of [ the ] world in the book of life of the slain Lamb .
DARBY	Revelation	13	9	If any one has an ear , let him hear .
DARBY	Revelation	13	10	If any one [ leads ] into captivity , he goes into captivity . If any one shall kill with [ the ] sword , he must with [ the ] sword be killed . Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
DARBY	Revelation	13	11	And I saw another beast rising out of the earth ; and it had two horns like to a lamb , and spake as a dragon ;
DARBY	Revelation	13	12	and it exercises all the authority of the first beast before it , and causes the earth and those that dwell in it to do homage to the first beast , whose wound of death was healed .
DARBY	Revelation	13	14	And it deceives those that dwell upon the earth by reason of the signs which it was given to it to work before the beast , saying to those that dwell upon the earth to make an image to the beast , which has the wound of the sword , and lived .
DARBY	Revelation	13	15	And it was given to it to give breath to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should also speak , and should cause that as many as should not do homage to the image of the beast should be killed .
DARBY	Revelation	13	16	And it causes all , the small and the great , and the rich and the poor , and the free and the bondmen , that they should give them a mark upon their right hand or upon their forehead ;
DARBY	Revelation	13	17	and that no one should be able to buy or sell save he that had the mark , the name of the beast , or the number of its name .
DARBY	Revelation	13	18	Here is wisdom . He that has understanding let him count the number of the beast : for it is a man 's number ; and its number [ is ] six hundred [ and ] sixty-six .
DARBY	Revelation	14	14	And I saw , and behold , a white cloud , and on the cloud one sitting like [ the ] Son of man , having upon his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
DARBY	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a voice out of the heaven as a voice of many waters , and as a voice of great thunder . And the voice which I heard [ was ] as of harp-singers harping with their harps ;
DARBY	Revelation	14	3	and they sing a new song before the throne , and before the four living creatures and the elders . And no one could learn that song save the hundred [ and ] forty-four thousand who were bought from the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	14	4	These are they who have not been defiled with women , for they are virgins : these are they who follow the Lamb wheresoever it goes . These have been bought from men [ as ] first-fruits to God and to the Lamb :
DARBY	Revelation	14	5	and in their mouths was no lie found ; [ for ] they are blameless .
DARBY	Revelation	14	6	And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven , having [ the ] everlasting glad tidings to announce to those settled on the earth , and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people ,
DARBY	Revelation	14	7	saying with a loud voice , Fear God and give him glory , for the hour of his judgment has come ; and do homage to him who has made the heaven and the earth and the sea and fountains of waters .
DARBY	Revelation	14	8	And another , a second , angel followed , saying , Great Babylon has fallen , has fallen , which of the wine of the fury of her fornication has made all nations drink .
DARBY	Revelation	14	9	And another , a third , angel followed them , saying with a loud voice , If any one do homage to the beast and its image , and receive a mark upon his forehead or upon his hand ,
DARBY	Revelation	14	10	he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God prepared unmixed in the cup of his wrath , and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb .
DARBY	Revelation	14	11	And the smoke of their torment goes up to ages of ages , and they have no respite day and night who do homage to the beast and to its image , and if any one receive the mark of its name .
DARBY	Revelation	14	12	Here is the endurance of the saints , who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus .
DARBY	Revelation	14	13	And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying , Write , Blessed the dead who die in [ the ] Lord from henceforth . Yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labours ; for their works follow with them .
DARBY	Revelation	14	15	And another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Send thy sickle and reap ; for the hour of reaping is come , for the harvest of the earth is dried .
DARBY	Revelation	14	16	And he that sat on the cloud put his sickle on the earth , and the earth was reaped .
DARBY	Revelation	14	17	And another angel came out of the temple which [ is ] in the heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
DARBY	Revelation	14	18	And another angel came out of the altar , having power over fire , and called with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle , saying , Send thy sharp sickle , and gather the bunches of the vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripened .
DARBY	Revelation	14	19	And the angel put his sickle to the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast [ the bunches ] into the great wine-press of the fury of God ;
DARBY	Revelation	14	20	and the wine-press was trodden without the city , and blood went out of the wine-press to the bits of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia .
DARBY	Revelation	15	15	And I saw another sign in the heaven , great and wonderful : seven angels having seven plagues , the last ; for in them the fury of God is completed .
DARBY	Revelation	15	2	And I saw as a glass sea , mingled with fire , and those that had gained the victory over the beast , and over its image , and over the number of its name , standing upon the glass sea , having harps of God .
DARBY	Revelation	15	3	And they sing the song of Moses bondman of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , Great and wonderful [ are ] thy works , Lord God Almighty ; righteous and true [ are ] thy ways , O King of nations .
DARBY	Revelation	15	4	Who shall not fear [ thee ] , O Lord , and glorify thy name ? for [ thou ] only [ art ] holy ; for all nations shall come and do homage before thee ; for thy righteousnesses have been made manifest .
DARBY	Revelation	15	5	And after these things I saw , and the temple of the tabernacle of witness in the heaven was opened ;
DARBY	Revelation	15	6	and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple , clothed in pure bright linen , and girded about the breasts with golden girdles .
DARBY	Revelation	15	7	And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls , full of the fury of God , who lives to the ages of ages .
DARBY	Revelation	15	8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power : and no one could enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed .
DARBY	Revelation	16	16	And he gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew , Armagedon .
DARBY	Revelation	16	2	And the first went and poured out his bowl on the earth ; and there came an evil and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast , and those who worshipped its image .
DARBY	Revelation	16	3	And the second poured out his bowl on the sea ; and it became blood , as of a dead man ; and every living soul died in the sea .
DARBY	Revelation	16	4	And the third poured out his bowl on the rivers , and [ on ] the fountains of waters ; and they became blood .
DARBY	Revelation	16	5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying , Thou art righteous , who art and wast , the holy one , that thou hast judged so ;
DARBY	Revelation	16	6	for they have poured out the blood of saints and prophets , and thou hast given them blood to drink ; they are worthy .
DARBY	Revelation	16	7	And I heard the altar saying , Yea , Lord God Almighty , true and righteous [ are ] thy judgments .
DARBY	Revelation	16	8	And the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun ; and it was given to it to burn men with fire .
DARBY	Revelation	16	9	And the men were burnt with great heat , and blasphemed the name of God , who had authority over these plagues , and did not repent to give him glory .
DARBY	Revelation	16	10	And the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast ; and its kingdom became darkened ; and they gnawed their tongues with distress ,
DARBY	Revelation	16	11	and blasphemed the God of the heaven for their distresses and their sores , and did not repent of their works .
DARBY	Revelation	16	12	And the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates ; and its water was dried up , that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared .
DARBY	Revelation	16	13	And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , as frogs ;
DARBY	Revelation	16	14	for they are [ the ] spirits of demons , doing signs ; which go out to the kings of the whole habitable world to gather them together to the war of [ that ] great day of God the Almighty .
DARBY	Revelation	16	15	( Behold , I come as a thief . Blessed [ is ] he that watches and keeps his garments , that he may not walk naked , and that they [ may not ] see his shame . )
DARBY	Revelation	16	17	And the seventh poured out his bowl on the air ; and there came out a great voice from the temple of the heaven , from the throne , saying , It is done .
DARBY	Revelation	16	18	And there were lightnings , and voices , and thunders ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , such an earthquake , so great .
DARBY	Revelation	16	19	And the great city was [ divided ] into three parts ; and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath .
DARBY	Revelation	16	20	And every island fled , and mountains were not found ;
DARBY	Revelation	16	21	and a great hail , as of a talent weight , comes down out of the heaven upon men ; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of hail , for the plague of it is exceeding great .
DARBY	Revelation	17	17	for God has given to their hearts to do his mind , and to act with one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled .
DARBY	Revelation	17	2	with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication ; and they that dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication .
DARBY	Revelation	17	3	And he carried me away in spirit to a desert ; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
DARBY	Revelation	17	4	And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet , and had ornaments of gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication ;
DARBY	Revelation	17	5	and upon her forehead a name written , Mystery , great Babylon , the mother of the harlots , and of the abominations of the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	17	6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus . And I wondered , seeing her , with great wonder .
DARBY	Revelation	17	7	And the angel said to me , Why hast thou wondered ? * I * will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast which carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
DARBY	Revelation	17	8	The beast which thou sawest was , and is not , and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into destruction : and they who dwell on the earth , whose names are not written from the founding of the world in the book of life , shall wonder , seeing the beast , that it was , and is not , and shall be present .
DARBY	Revelation	17	9	Here is the mind that has wisdom : The seven heads are seven mountains , whereon the woman sits .
DARBY	Revelation	17	10	And there are seven kings : five have fallen , one is , the other has not yet come ; and when he comes he must remain [ only ] a little while .
DARBY	Revelation	17	11	And the beast that was and is not , he also is an eighth , and is of the seven , and goes into destruction .
DARBY	Revelation	17	12	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings , which have not yet received a kingdom , but receive authority as kings one hour with the beast .
DARBY	Revelation	17	13	These have one mind , and give their power and authority to the beast .
DARBY	Revelation	17	14	These shall make war with the Lamb , and the Lamb shall overcome them ; for he is Lord of lords and King of kings : and they [ that are ] with him called , and chosen , and faithful .
DARBY	Revelation	17	15	And he says to me , The waters which thou sawest , where the harlot sits , are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues .
DARBY	Revelation	17	16	And the ten horns which thou sawest , and the beast , these shall hate the harlot , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and shall burn her with fire ;
DARBY	Revelation	17	18	And the woman which thou sawest is the great city , which has kingship over the kings of the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	18	18	and cried , seeing the smoke of her burning , saying , What [ city ] is like to the great city ?
DARBY	Revelation	18	2	And he cried with a strong voice , saying , Great Babylon has fallen , has fallen , and has become the habitation of demons , and a hold of every unclean spirit , and a hold of every unclean and hated bird ;
DARBY	Revelation	18	3	because all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication ; and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth have been enriched through the might of her luxury .
DARBY	Revelation	18	4	And I heard another voice out of the heaven saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye have not fellowship in her sins , and that ye do not receive of her plagues :
DARBY	Revelation	18	5	for her sins have been heaped on one another up to the heaven , and God has remembered her unrighteousnesses .
DARBY	Revelation	18	6	Recompense her even as she has recompensed ; and double [ to her ] double , according to her works . In the cup which she has mixed , mix to her double .
DARBY	Revelation	18	7	So much as she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously , so much torment and grief give to her . Because she says in her heart , I sit a queen , and I am not a widow ; and I shall in no wise see grief :
DARBY	Revelation	18	8	for this reason in one day shall her plagues come , death and grief and famine , and she shall be burnt with fire ; for strong [ is the ] Lord God who has judged her .
DARBY	Revelation	18	9	And the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication , and lived luxuriously with her , shall weep and wail over her , when they see the smoke of her burning ,
DARBY	Revelation	18	10	standing afar off , through fear of her torment , saying , Woe , woe , the great city , Babylon , the strong city ! for in one hour thy judgment is come .
DARBY	Revelation	18	11	And the merchants of the earth weep and grieve over her , because no one buys their lading any more ;
DARBY	Revelation	18	12	lading of gold , and silver , and precious stones , and pearl , and fine linen , and purple , and silk , and scarlet dye , and all thyine wood , and every article in ivory , and every article in most precious wood , and in brass , and in iron , and in marble ,
DARBY	Revelation	18	13	and cinnamon , and amomum , and incense , and unguent , and frankincense , and wine , and oil , and fine flour , and wheat , and cattle , and sheep , and of horses , and of chariots , and of bodies , and souls of men .
DARBY	Revelation	18	14	And the ripe fruits which were the lust of thy soul have departed from thee , and all fair and splendid things have perished from thee , and they shall not find them any more at all .
DARBY	Revelation	18	15	The merchants of these things , who had been enriched through her , shall stand afar off through fear of her torment , weeping and grieving ,
DARBY	Revelation	18	16	saying , Woe , woe , the great city , which [ was ] clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet , and had ornaments of gold and precious stones and pearls !
DARBY	Revelation	18	17	for in one hour so great riches has been made desolate . And every steersman , and every one who sailed to any place , and sailors , and all who exercise their calling on the sea , stood afar off ,
DARBY	Revelation	18	19	and cast dust upon their heads , and cried , weeping and grieving , saying , Woe , woe , the great city , in which all that had ships in the sea were enriched through her costliness ! for in one hour she has been made desolate .
DARBY	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her , heaven , and [ ye ] saints and apostles and prophets ; for God has judged your judgment upon her .
DARBY	Revelation	18	21	And a strong angel took up a stone , as a great millstone , and cast [ it ] into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall Babylon the great city be cast down , and shall be found no more at all ;
DARBY	Revelation	18	22	and voice of harp-singers and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters shall not be heard any more at all in thee , and no artificer of any art shall be found any more at all in thee , and voice of millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee ,
DARBY	Revelation	18	23	and light of lamp shall shine no more at all in thee , and voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more at all in thee ; for thy merchants were the great ones of the earth ; for by thy sorcery have all the nations been deceived .
DARBY	Revelation	18	24	And in her was found [ the ] blood of prophets and saints , and of all the slain upon the earth .
DARBY	Revelation	19	19	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse , and against his army .
DARBY	Revelation	19	2	for true and righteous [ are ] his judgments ; for he has judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication , and has avenged the blood of his bondmen at her hand .
DARBY	Revelation	19	3	And a second time they said , Hallelujah . And her smoke goes up to the ages of ages .
DARBY	Revelation	19	4	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and did homage to God who sits upon the throne , saying , Amen , Hallelujah .
DARBY	Revelation	19	5	And a voice came out of the throne , saying , Praise our God , all ye his bondmen , [ and ] ye that fear him , small and great .
DARBY	Revelation	19	6	And I heard as a voice of a great crowd , and as a voice of many waters , and as a voice of strong thunders , saying , Hallelujah , for [ the ] Lord our God the Almighty has taken to himself kingly power .
DARBY	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and exult , and give him glory ; for the marriage of the Lamb is come , and his wife has made herself ready .
DARBY	Revelation	19	8	And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen , bright [ and ] pure ; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints .
DARBY	Revelation	19	9	And he says to me , Write , Blessed [ are ] they who are called to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb . And he says to me , These are the true words of God .
DARBY	Revelation	19	10	And I fell before his feet to do him homage . And he says to me , See [ thou do it ] not . I am thy fellow-bondman , and [ the fellow-bondman ] of thy brethren who have the testimony of Jesus . Do homage to God . For the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus .
DARBY	Revelation	19	11	And I saw the heaven opened , and behold , a white horse , and one sitting on it , [ called ] Faithful and True , and he judges and makes war in righteousness .
DARBY	Revelation	19	12	And his eyes are a flame of fire , and upon his head many diadems , having a name written which no one knows but himself ;
DARBY	Revelation	19	13	and [ he is ] clothed with a garment dipped in blood ; and his name is called The Word of God .
DARBY	Revelation	19	14	And the armies which [ are ] in the heaven followed him upon white horses , clad in white , pure , fine linen .
DARBY	Revelation	19	15	And out of his mouth goes a sharp [ two-edged ] sword , that with it he might smite the nations ; and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod ; and he treads the wine-press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty .
DARBY	Revelation	19	16	And he has upon his garment , and upon his thigh , a name written , King of kings , and Lord of lords .
DARBY	Revelation	19	17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven , Come , gather yourselves to the great supper of God ,
DARBY	Revelation	19	18	that ye may eat flesh of kings , and flesh of chiliarchs , and flesh of strong men , and flesh of horses and of those that sit upon them , and flesh of all , both free and bond , and small and great .
DARBY	Revelation	19	20	And the beast was taken , and the false prophet that [ was ] with him , who wrought the signs before him by which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast , and those that worship his image . Alive were both cast into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone ;
DARBY	Revelation	19	21	and the rest were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse , which goes out of his mouth ; and all the birds were filled with their flesh .
DARBY	Revelation	20	20	And I saw an angel descending from the heaven , having the key of the abyss , and a great chain in his hand .
DARBY	Revelation	20	2	And he laid hold of the dragon , the ancient serpent who is [ the ] devil and Satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
DARBY	Revelation	20	3	and cast him into the abyss , and shut [ it ] and sealed [ it ] over him , that he should not any more deceive the nations until the thousand years were completed ; after these things he must be loosed for a little time .
DARBY	Revelation	20	4	And I saw thrones ; and they sat upon them , and judgment was given to them ; and the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus , and on account of the word of God ; and those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image , and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand ; and they lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years :
DARBY	Revelation	20	5	the rest of the dead did not live till the thousand years had been completed . This [ is ] the first resurrection .
DARBY	Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection : over these the second death has no power ; but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
DARBY	Revelation	20	7	And when the thousand years have been completed , Satan shall be loosed from his prison ,
DARBY	Revelation	20	8	and shall go out to deceive the nations which [ are ] in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to the war , whose number [ is ] as the sand of the sea .
DARBY	Revelation	20	9	And they went up on the breadth of the earth , and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city : and fire came down [ from God ] out of the heaven and devoured them .
DARBY	Revelation	20	10	And the devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where [ are ] both the beast and the false prophet ; and they shall be tormented day and night for the ages of ages .
DARBY	Revelation	20	11	And I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled , and place was not found for them .
DARBY	Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead , great and small , standing before the throne , and books were opened ; and another book was opened , which is [ that ] of life . And the dead were judged out of the things written in the books according to their works .
DARBY	Revelation	20	13	And the sea gave up the dead which [ were ] in it , and death and hades gave up the dead which [ were ] in them ; and they were judged each according to their works :
DARBY	Revelation	20	14	and death and hades were cast into the lake of fire . This is the second death , [ even ] the lake of fire .
DARBY	Revelation	20	15	And if any one was not found written in the book of life , he was cast into the lake of fire .
DARBY	Revelation	21	21	And the twelve gates , twelve pearls ; each one of the gates , respectively , was of one pearl ; and the street of the city pure gold , as transparent glass .
DARBY	Revelation	21	2	And I saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , coming down out of the heaven from God , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
DARBY	Revelation	21	3	And I heard a loud voice out of the heaven , saying , Behold , the tabernacle of God [ is ] with men , and he shall tabernacle with them , and they shall be his people , and God himself shall be with them , their God .
DARBY	Revelation	21	4	And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes ; and death shall not exist any more , nor grief , nor cry , nor distress shall exist any more , for the former things have passed away .
DARBY	Revelation	21	5	And he that sat on the throne said , Behold , I make all things new . And he says [ to me ] , Write , for these words are true and faithful .
DARBY	Revelation	21	6	And he said to me , It is done . I am the Alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the end . I will give to him that thirsts of the fountain of the water of life freely .
DARBY	Revelation	21	7	He that overcomes shall inherit these things , and I will be to him God , and he shall be to me son .
DARBY	Revelation	21	8	But to the fearful and unbelieving , [ and sinners ] , and those who make themselves abominable , and murderers , and fornicators , and sorcerers , and idolaters , and all liars , their part [ is ] in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone ; which is the second death .
DARBY	Revelation	21	9	And there came one of the seven angels which had had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues , and spoke with me , saying , Come here , I will shew thee the bride , the Lamb 's wife .
DARBY	Revelation	21	10	And he carried me away in [ the ] Spirit , [ and set me ] on a great and high mountain , and shewed me the holy city , Jerusalem , coming down out of the heaven from God ,
DARBY	Revelation	21	11	having the glory of God . Her shining [ was ] like a most precious stone , as a crystal-like jasper stone ;
DARBY	Revelation	21	12	having a great and high wall ; having twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels , and names inscribed , which are those of the twelve tribes of [ the ] sons of Israel .
DARBY	Revelation	21	13	On [ the ] east three gates ; and on [ the ] north three gates ; and on [ the ] south three gates ; and on [ the ] west three gates .
DARBY	Revelation	21	14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
DARBY	Revelation	21	15	And he that spoke with me had a golden reed [ as ] a measure , that he might measure the city , and its gates , and its wall .
DARBY	Revelation	21	16	And the city lies four-square , and its length [ is ] as much as the breadth . And he measured the city with the reed—twelve thousand stadia : the length and the breadth and height of it are equal .
DARBY	Revelation	21	17	And he measured its wall , a hundred [ and ] forty-four cubits , [ a ] man 's measure , that is , [ the ] angel 's .
DARBY	Revelation	21	18	And the building of its wall [ was ] jasper ; and the city pure gold , like pure glass :
DARBY	Revelation	21	19	the foundations of the wall of the city [ were ] adorned with every precious stone : the first foundation , jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , chalcedony ; the fourth , emerald ;
DARBY	Revelation	21	20	the fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , sardius ; the seventh , chrysolite ; the eighth , beryl ; the ninth , topaz ; the tenth , chrysoprasus ; the eleventh , jacinth ; the twelfth , amethyst .
DARBY	Revelation	21	22	And I saw no temple in it ; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple , and the Lamb .
DARBY	Revelation	21	23	And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon , that they should shine for it ; for the glory of God has enlightened it , and the lamp thereof [ is ] the Lamb .
DARBY	Revelation	21	24	And the nations shall walk by its light ; and the kings of the earth bring their glory to it .
DARBY	Revelation	21	25	And its gates shall not be shut at all by day , for night shall not be there .
DARBY	Revelation	21	26	And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations to it .
DARBY	Revelation	21	27	And nothing common , nor that maketh an abomination and a lie , shall at all enter into it ; but those only who [ are ] written in the book of life of the Lamb .
DARBY	Revelation	22	22	And he shewed me a river of water of life , bright as crystal , going out of the throne of God and of the Lamb .
DARBY	Revelation	22	2	In the midst of its street , and of the river , on this side and on that side , [ the ] tree of life , producing twelve fruits , in each month yielding its fruit ; and the leaves of the tree for healing of the nations .
DARBY	Revelation	22	3	And no curse shall be any more ; and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him ,
DARBY	Revelation	22	4	and they shall see his face ; and his name [ is ] on their foreheads .
DARBY	Revelation	22	5	And night shall not be any more , and no need of a lamp , and light of [ the ] sun ; for [ the ] Lord God shall shine upon them , and they shall reign to the ages of ages .
DARBY	Revelation	22	6	And he said to me , These words [ are ] faithful and true ; and [ the ] Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to shew to his bondmen the things which must soon come to pass .
DARBY	Revelation	22	7	And behold , I come quickly . Blessed [ is ] he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book .
DARBY	Revelation	22	8	And I , John , [ was ] he who heard and saw these things . And when I heard and saw , I fell down to do homage before the feet of the angel who shewed me these things .
DARBY	Revelation	22	9	And he says to me , See [ thou do it ] not . I am thy fellow-bondman , and [ the fellow-bondman ] of thy brethren the prophets , and of those who keep the words of this book . Do homage to God .
DARBY	Revelation	22	10	And he says to me , Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book . The time is near .
DARBY	Revelation	22	11	Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still ; and let the filthy make himself filthy still ; and let him that is righteous practise righteousness still ; and he that is holy , let him be sanctified still .
DARBY	Revelation	22	12	Behold , I come quickly , and my reward with me , to render to every one as his work shall be .
DARBY	Revelation	22	13	* I * [ am ] the Alpha and the Omega , [ the ] first and [ the ] last , the beginning and the end .
DARBY	Revelation	22	14	Blessed [ are ] they that wash their robes , that they may have right to the tree of life , and that they should go in by the gates into the city .
DARBY	Revelation	22	15	Without [ are ] the dogs , and the sorcerers , and the fornicators , and the murderers , and the idolaters , and every one that loves and makes a lie .
DARBY	Revelation	22	16	* I * Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies . * I * am the root and offspring of David , the bright [ and ] morning star .
DARBY	Revelation	22	17	And the Spirit and the bride say , Come . And let him that hears say , Come . And let him that is athirst come ; he that will , let him take [ the ] water of life freely .
DARBY	Revelation	22	18	* I * testify to every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book , If any one shall add to these things , God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book .
DARBY	Revelation	22	19	And if any one take from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part from the tree of life , and out of the holy city , which are written in this book .
DARBY	Revelation	22	20	He that testifies these things says , Yea , I come quickly . Amen ; come , Lord Jesus .
DARBY	Revelation	22	21	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with all the saints .
