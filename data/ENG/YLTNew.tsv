YLT	Matthew	1	3	and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar , and Pharez begat Hezron , and Hezron begat Ram ,
YLT	Matthew	1	4	and Ram begat Amminadab , and Amminadab begat Nahshon , and Nahshon begat Salmon ,
YLT	Matthew	1	5	and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab , and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth , and Obed begat Jesse ,
YLT	Matthew	1	6	and Jesse begat David the king . And David the king begat Solomon , of her [ who had been ] Uriah 's ,
YLT	Matthew	1	7	and Solomon begat Rehoboam , and Rehoboam begat Abijah , and Abijah begat Asa ,
YLT	Matthew	1	8	and Asa begat Jehoshaphat , and Jehoshaphat begat Joram , and Joram begat Uzziah ,
YLT	Matthew	1	9	and Uzziah begat Jotham , and Jotham begat Ahaz , and Ahaz begat Hezekiah ,
YLT	Matthew	1	10	and Hezekiah begat Manasseh , and Manasseh begat Amon , and Amon begat Josiah ,
YLT	Matthew	1	11	and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren , at the Babylonian removal .
YLT	Matthew	1	12	And after the Babylonian removal , Jeconiah begat Shealtiel , and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel ,
YLT	Matthew	1	13	and Zerubbabel begat Abiud , and Abiud begat Eliakim , and Eliakim begat Azor ,
YLT	Matthew	1	14	and Azor begat Sadok , and Sadok begat Achim , and Achim begat Eliud ,
YLT	Matthew	1	15	and Eliud begat Eleazar , and Eleazar begat Matthan , and Matthan begat Jacob ,
YLT	Matthew	1	16	and Jacob begat Joseph , the husband of Mary , of whom was begotten Jesus , who is named Christ .
YLT	Matthew	1	17	All the generations , therefore , from Abraham unto David [ are ] fourteen generations , and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations , and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ , fourteen generations .
YLT	Matthew	1	18	And of Jesus Christ , the birth was thus : For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph , before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit ,
YLT	Matthew	1	19	and Joseph her husband being righteous , and not willing to make her an example , did wish privately to send her away .
YLT	Matthew	1	20	And on his thinking of these things , lo , a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him , saying , ` Joseph , son of David , thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife , for that which in her was begotten [ is ] of the Holy Spirit ,
YLT	Matthew	1	21	and she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus , for he shall save his people from their sins . '
YLT	Matthew	1	22	And all this hath come to pass , that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	1	23	` Lo , the virgin shall conceive , and she shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , ' which is , being interpreted ` With us [ he is ] God . '
YLT	Matthew	1	24	And Joseph , having risen from the sleep , did as the messenger of the Lord directed him , and received his wife ,
YLT	Matthew	1	25	and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first-born , and he called his name Jesus .
YLT	Matthew	2	2	saying , ` Where is he who was born king of the Jews ? for we saw his star in the east , and we came to bow to him . '
YLT	Matthew	2	3	And Herod the king having heard , was stirred , and all Jerusalem with him ,
YLT	Matthew	2	4	and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born .
YLT	Matthew	2	5	And they said to him , ` In Beth-Lehem of Judea , for thus it hath been written through the prophet ,
YLT	Matthew	2	6	And thou , Beth-Lehem , the land of Judah , thou art by no means the least among the leaders of Judah , for out of thee shall come one leading , who shall feed My people Israel . '
YLT	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod , privately having called the mages , did inquire exactly from them the time of the appearing star ,
YLT	Matthew	2	8	and having sent them to Beth-Lehem , he said , ` Having gone -- inquire ye exactly for the child , and whenever ye may have found , bring me back word , that I also having come may bow to him . '
YLT	Matthew	2	9	And they , having heard the king , departed , and lo , the star , that they did see in the east , did go before them , till , having come , it stood over where the child was .
YLT	Matthew	2	10	And having seen the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy ,
YLT	Matthew	2	11	and having come to the house , they found the child with Mary his mother , and having fallen down they bowed to him , and having opened their treasures , they presented to him gifts , gold , and frankincense , and myrrh ,
YLT	Matthew	2	12	and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back unto Herod , through another way they withdrew to their own region .
YLT	Matthew	2	13	And on their having withdrawn , lo , a messenger of the Lord doth appear in a dream to Joseph , saying , ` Having risen , take the child and his mother , and flee to Egypt , and be thou there till I may speak to thee , for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him . '
YLT	Matthew	2	14	And he , having risen , took the child and his mother by night , and withdrew to Egypt ,
YLT	Matthew	2	15	and he was there till the death of Herod , that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , ` Out of Egypt I did call My Son . '
YLT	Matthew	2	16	Then Herod , having seen that he was deceived by the mages , was very wroth , and having sent forth , he slew all the male children in Beth-Lehem , and in all its borders , from two years and under , according to the time that he inquired exactly from the mages .
YLT	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	2	18	` A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and much mourning -- Rachel weeping [ for ] her children , and she would not be comforted because they are not . '
YLT	Matthew	2	19	And Herod having died , lo , a messenger of the Lord in a dream doth appear to Joseph in Egypt ,
YLT	Matthew	2	20	saying , ` Having risen , take the child and his mother , and be going to the land of Israel , for they have died -- those seeking the life of the child . '
YLT	Matthew	2	21	And he , having risen , took the child and his mother , and came to the land of Israel ,
YLT	Matthew	2	22	and having heard that Archelaus doth reign over Judea instead of Herod his father , he was afraid to go thither , and having been divinely warned in a dream , he withdrew to the parts of Galilee ,
YLT	Matthew	2	23	and coming , he dwelt in a city named Nazareth , that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets , that ` A Nazarene he shall be called . '
YLT	Matthew	3	3	for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet , saying , ` A voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , straight make ye His paths . '
YLT	Matthew	3	2	and saying , ` Reform , for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens , '
YLT	Matthew	3	4	And this John had his clothing of camel 's hair , and a girdle of skin round his loins , and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field .
YLT	Matthew	3	5	Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem , and all Judea , and all the region round about the Jordan ,
YLT	Matthew	3	6	and they were baptized in the Jordan by him , confessing their sins .
YLT	Matthew	3	7	And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism , he said to them , ` Brood of vipers ! who did shew you to flee from the coming wrath ?
YLT	Matthew	3	8	bear , therefore , fruits worthy of the reformation ,
YLT	Matthew	3	9	and do not think to say in yourselves , A father we have -- Abraham , for I say to you , that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham ,
YLT	Matthew	3	10	and now also , the axe unto the root of the trees is laid , every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down , and to fire is cast .
YLT	Matthew	3	11	` I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation , but he who after me is coming is mightier than I , of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals , he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire ,
YLT	Matthew	3	12	whose fan [ is ] in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor , and will gather his wheat to the storehouse , but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . '
YLT	Matthew	3	13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan , unto John to be baptized by him ,
YLT	Matthew	3	14	but John was forbidding him , saying , ` I have need by thee to be baptized -- and thou dost come unto me ! '
YLT	Matthew	3	15	But Jesus answering said to him , ` Suffer now , for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness , ' then he doth suffer him .
YLT	Matthew	3	16	And having been baptized , Jesus went up immediately from the water , and lo , opened to him were the heavens , and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming upon him ,
YLT	Matthew	3	17	and lo , a voice out of the heavens , saying , ` This is My Son -- the Beloved , in whom I did delight . '
YLT	Matthew	4	4	But he answering said , ` It hath been written , Not upon bread alone doth man live , but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God . '
YLT	Matthew	4	2	and having fasted forty days and forty nights , afterwards he did hunger .
YLT	Matthew	4	3	And the Tempter having come to him said , ` If Son thou art of God -- speak that these stones may become loaves . '
YLT	Matthew	4	5	Then doth the Devil take him to the [ holy ] city , and doth set him on the pinnacle of the temple ,
YLT	Matthew	4	6	and saith to him , ` If Son thou art of God -- cast thyself down , for it hath been written , that , His messengers He shall charge concerning thee , and on hands they shall bear thee up , that thou mayest not dash on a stone thy foot . '
YLT	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said to him again , ` It hath been written , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . '
YLT	Matthew	4	8	Again doth the Devil take him to a very high mount , and doth shew to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them ,
YLT	Matthew	4	9	and saith to him , ` All these to thee I will give , if falling down thou mayest bow to me . '
YLT	Matthew	4	10	Then saith Jesus to him , ` Go -- Adversary , for it hath been written , The Lord thy God thou shalt bow to , and Him only thou shalt serve . '
YLT	Matthew	4	11	Then doth the Devil leave him , and lo , messengers came and were ministering to him .
YLT	Matthew	4	12	And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up , did withdraw to Galilee ,
YLT	Matthew	4	13	and having left Nazareth , having come , he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea , in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalim ,
YLT	Matthew	4	14	that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	4	15	` Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , way of the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the nations ! --
YLT	Matthew	4	16	the people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light , and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light arose to them . '
YLT	Matthew	4	17	From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say , ` Reform ye , for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens . '
YLT	Matthew	4	18	And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brothers , Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother , casting a drag into the sea -- for they were fishers --
YLT	Matthew	4	19	and he saith to them , ` Come ye after me , and I will make you fishers of men , '
YLT	Matthew	4	20	and they , immediately , having left the nets , did follow him .
YLT	Matthew	4	21	And having advanced thence , he saw other two brothers , James of Zebedee , and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , refitting their nets , and he called them ,
YLT	Matthew	4	22	and they , immediately , having left the boat and their father , did follow him .
YLT	Matthew	4	23	And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues , and proclaiming the good news of the reign , and healing every disease , and every malady among the people ,
YLT	Matthew	4	24	and his fame went forth to all Syria , and they brought to him all having ailments , pressed with manifold sicknesses and pains , and demoniacs , and lunatics , and paralytics , and he healed them .
YLT	Matthew	4	25	And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee , and Decapolis , and Jerusalem , and Judea , and beyond the Jordan .
YLT	Matthew	5	5	` Happy the meek -- because they shall inherit the land .
YLT	Matthew	5	2	and having opened his mouth , he was teaching them , saying :
YLT	Matthew	5	3	` Happy the poor in spirit -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	5	4	` Happy the mourning -- because they shall be comforted .
YLT	Matthew	5	6	` Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness -- because they shall be filled .
YLT	Matthew	5	7	` Happy the kind -- because they shall find kindness .
YLT	Matthew	5	8	` Happy the clean in heart -- because they shall see God .
YLT	Matthew	5	9	` Happy the peacemakers -- because they shall be called Sons of God .
YLT	Matthew	5	10	` Happy those persecuted for righteousness ' sake -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	5	11	` Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you , and may persecute , and may say any evil thing against you falsely for my sake --
YLT	Matthew	5	12	rejoice ye and be glad , because your reward [ is ] great in the heavens , for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you .
YLT	Matthew	5	13	` Ye are the salt of the land , but if the salt may lose savour , in what shall it be salted ? for nothing is it good henceforth , except to be cast without , and to be trodden down by men .
YLT	Matthew	5	14	` Ye are the light of the world , a city set upon a mount is not able to be hid ;
YLT	Matthew	5	15	nor do they light a lamp , and put it under the measure , but on the lamp-stand , and it shineth to all those in the house ;
YLT	Matthew	5	16	so let your light shine before men , that they may see your good works , and may glorify your Father who [ is ] in the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	5	17	` Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the prophets -- I did not come to throw down , but to fulfill ;
YLT	Matthew	5	18	for , verily I say to you , till that the heaven and the earth may pass away , one iota or one tittle may not pass away from the law , till that all may come to pass .
YLT	Matthew	5	19	` Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the least -- and may teach men so , least he shall be called in the reign of the heavens , but whoever may do and may teach [ them ] , he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	5	20	` For I say to you , that if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees , ye may not enter to the reign of the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	5	21	` Ye heard that it was said to the ancients : Thou shalt not kill , and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment ;
YLT	Matthew	5	22	but I -- I say to you , that every one who is angry at his brother without cause , shall be in danger of the judgment , and whoever may say to his brother , Empty fellow ! shall be in danger of the sanhedrim , and whoever may say , Rebel ! shall be in danger of the gehenna of the fire .
YLT	Matthew	5	23	` If , therefore , thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar , and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything against thee ,
YLT	Matthew	5	24	leave there thy gift before the altar , and go -- first be reconciled to thy brother , and then having come bring thy gift .
YLT	Matthew	5	25	` Be agreeing with thy opponent quickly , while thou art in the way with him , that the opponent may not deliver thee to the judge , and the judge may deliver thee to the officer , and to prison thou mayest be cast ,
YLT	Matthew	5	26	verily I say to thee , thou mayest not come forth thence till that thou mayest pay the last farthing .
YLT	Matthew	5	27	` Ye heard that it was said to the ancients : Thou shalt not commit adultery ;
YLT	Matthew	5	28	but I -- I say to you , that every one who is looking on a woman to desire her , did already commit adultery with her in his heart .
YLT	Matthew	5	29	` But , if thy right eye doth cause thee to stumble , pluck it out and cast from thee , for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish , and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna .
YLT	Matthew	5	30	` And , if thy right hand doth cause thee to stumble , cut it off , and cast from thee , for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish , and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna .
YLT	Matthew	5	31	` And it was said , That whoever may put away his wife , let him give to her a writing of divorce ;
YLT	Matthew	5	32	but I -- I say to you , that whoever may put away his wife , save for the matter of whoredom , doth make her to commit adultery ; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth commit adultery .
YLT	Matthew	5	33	` Again , ye heard that it was said to the ancients : Thou shalt not swear falsely , but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine oaths ;
YLT	Matthew	5	34	but I -- I say to you , not to swear at all ; neither by the heaven , because it is the throne of God ,
YLT	Matthew	5	35	nor by the earth , because it is His footstool , nor by Jerusalem , because it is a city of a great king ,
YLT	Matthew	5	36	nor by thy head mayest thou swear , because thou art not able one hair to make white or black ;
YLT	Matthew	5	37	but let your word be , Yes , Yes , No , No , and that which is more than these is of the evil .
YLT	Matthew	5	38	` Ye heard that it was said : Eye for eye , and tooth for tooth ;
YLT	Matthew	5	39	but I -- I say to you , not to resist the evil , but whoever shall slap thee on thy right cheek , turn to him also the other ;
YLT	Matthew	5	40	and whoever is willing to take thee to law , and thy coat to take -- suffer to him also the cloak .
YLT	Matthew	5	41	` And whoever shall impress thee one mile , go with him two ,
YLT	Matthew	5	42	to him who is asking of thee be giving , and him who is willing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away .
YLT	Matthew	5	43	` Ye heard that it was said : Thou shalt love thy neighbor , and shalt hate thine enemy ;
YLT	Matthew	5	44	but I -- I say to you , Love your enemies , bless those cursing you , do good to those hating you , and pray for those accusing you falsely , and persecuting you ,
YLT	Matthew	5	45	that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens , because His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good , and He doth send rain on righteous and unrighteous .
YLT	Matthew	5	46	` For , if ye may love those loving you , what reward have ye ? do not also the tax-gatherers the same ?
YLT	Matthew	5	47	and if ye may salute your brethren only , what do ye abundant ? do not also the tax-gatherers so ?
YLT	Matthew	5	48	ye shall therefore be perfect , as your Father who [ is ] in the heavens is perfect .
YLT	Matthew	6	6	` But thou , when thou mayest pray , go into thy chamber , and having shut thy door , pray to thy Father who [ is ] in secret , and thy Father who is seeing in secret , shall reward thee manifestly .
YLT	Matthew	6	2	whenever , therefore , thou mayest do kindness , thou mayest not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do , in the synagogues , and in the streets , that they may have glory from men ; verily I say to you -- they have their reward !
YLT	Matthew	6	3	` But thou , doing kindness , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth ,
YLT	Matthew	6	4	that thy kindness may be in secret , and thy Father who is seeing in secret Himself shall reward thee manifestly .
YLT	Matthew	6	5	` And when thou mayest pray , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites , because they love in the synagogues , and in the corners of the broad places -- standing -- to pray , that they may be seen of men ; verily I say to you , that they have their reward .
YLT	Matthew	6	7	` And -- praying -- ye may not use vain repetitions like the nations , for they think that in their much speaking they shall be heard ,
YLT	Matthew	6	8	be ye not therefore like to them , for your Father doth know those things that ye have need of before your asking him ;
YLT	Matthew	6	9	thus therefore pray ye : ` Our Father who [ art ] in the heavens ! hallowed be Thy name .
YLT	Matthew	6	10	` Thy reign come : Thy will come to pass , as in heaven also on the earth .
YLT	Matthew	6	11	` Our appointed bread give us to-day .
YLT	Matthew	6	12	` And forgive us our debts , as also we forgive our debtors .
YLT	Matthew	6	13	` And mayest Thou not lead us to temptation , but deliver us from the evil , because Thine is the reign , and the power , and the glory -- to the ages . Amen .
YLT	Matthew	6	14	` For , if ye may forgive men their trespasses He also will forgive you -- your Father who [ is ] in the heavens ;
YLT	Matthew	6	15	but if ye may not forgive men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
YLT	Matthew	6	16	` And when ye may fast , be ye not as the hypocrites , of sour countenances , for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear to men fasting ; verily I say to you , that they have their reward .
YLT	Matthew	6	17	` But thou , fasting , anoint thy head , and wash thy face ,
YLT	Matthew	6	18	that thou mayest not appear to men fasting , but to thy Father who [ is ] in secret , and thy Father , who is seeing in secret , shall reward thee manifestly .
YLT	Matthew	6	19	` Treasure not up to yourselves treasures on the earth , where moth and rust disfigure , and where thieves break through and steal ,
YLT	Matthew	6	20	but treasure up to yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth disfigure , and where thieves do not break through nor steal ,
YLT	Matthew	6	21	for where your treasure is , there will be also your heart .
YLT	Matthew	6	22	` The lamp of the body is the eye , if , therefore , thine eye may be perfect , all thy body shall be enlightened ,
YLT	Matthew	6	23	but if thine eye may be evil , all thy body shall be dark ; if , therefore , the light that [ is ] in thee is darkness -- the darkness , how great !
YLT	Matthew	6	24	` None is able to serve two lords , for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will hold to the one , and despise the other ; ye are not able to serve God and Mammon .
YLT	Matthew	6	25	` Because of this I say to you , be not anxious for your life , what ye may eat , and what ye may drink , nor for your body , what ye may put on . Is not the life more than the nourishment , and the body than the clothing ?
YLT	Matthew	6	26	look to the fowls of the heaven , for they do not sow , nor reap , nor gather into storehouses , and your heavenly Father doth nourish them ; are not ye much better than they ?
YLT	Matthew	6	27	` And who of you , being anxious , is able to add to his age one cubit ?
YLT	Matthew	6	28	and about clothing why are ye anxious ? consider well the lilies of the field ; how do they grow ? they do not labour , nor do they spin ;
YLT	Matthew	6	29	and I say to you , that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these .
YLT	Matthew	6	30	` And if the herb of the field , that to-day is , and to-morrow is cast to the furnace , God doth so clothe -- not much more you , O ye of little faith ?
YLT	Matthew	6	31	therefore ye may not be anxious , saying , What may we eat ? or , What may we drink ? or , What may we put round ?
YLT	Matthew	6	32	for all these do the nations seek for , for your heavenly Father doth know that ye have need of all these ;
YLT	Matthew	6	33	but seek ye first the reign of God and His righteousness , and all these shall be added to you .
YLT	Matthew	6	34	Be not therefore anxious for the morrow , for the morrow shall be anxious for its own things ; sufficient for the day [ is ] the evil of it .
YLT	Matthew	7	7	` Ask , and it shall be given to you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened to you ;
YLT	Matthew	7	2	for in what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged , and in what measure ye measure , it shall be measured to you .
YLT	Matthew	7	3	` And why dost thou behold the mote that [ is ] in thy brother 's eye , and the beam that [ is ] in thine own eye dost not consider ?
YLT	Matthew	7	4	or , how wilt thou say to thy brother , Suffer I may cast out the mote from thine eye , and lo , the beam [ is ] in thine own eye ?
YLT	Matthew	7	5	Hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye .
YLT	Matthew	7	6	` Ye may not give that which is [ holy ] to the dogs , nor cast your pearls before the swine , that they may not trample them among their feet , and having turned -- may rend you .
YLT	Matthew	7	8	for every one who is asking doth receive , and he who is seeking doth find , and to him who is knocking it shall be opened .
YLT	Matthew	7	9	` Or what man is of you , of whom , if his son may ask a loaf -- a stone will he present to him ?
YLT	Matthew	7	10	and if a fish he may ask -- a serpent will he present to him ?
YLT	Matthew	7	11	if , therefore , ye being evil , have known good gifts to give to your children , how much more shall your Father who [ is ] in the heavens give good things to those asking him ?
YLT	Matthew	7	12	` All things , therefore , whatever ye may will that men may be doing to you , so also do to them , for this is the law and the prophets .
YLT	Matthew	7	13	` Go ye in through the strait gate , because wide [ is ] the gate , and broad the way that is leading to the destruction , and many are those going in through it ;
YLT	Matthew	7	14	how strait [ is ] the gate , and compressed the way that is leading to the life , and few are those finding it !
YLT	Matthew	7	15	` But , take heed of the false prophets , who come unto you in sheep 's clothing , and inwardly are ravening wolves .
YLT	Matthew	7	16	From their fruits ye shall know them ; do [ men ] gather from thorns grapes ? or from thistles figs ?
YLT	Matthew	7	17	so every good tree doth yield good fruits , but the bad tree doth yield evil fruits .
YLT	Matthew	7	18	A good tree is not able to yield evil fruits , nor a bad tree to yield good fruits .
YLT	Matthew	7	19	Every tree not yielding good fruit is cut down and is cast to fire :
YLT	Matthew	7	20	therefore from their fruits ye shall know them .
YLT	Matthew	7	21	` Not every one who is saying to me Lord , lord , shall come into the reign of the heavens ; but he who is doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to me in that day , Lord , lord , have we not in thy name prophesied ? and in thy name cast out demons ? and in thy name done many mighty things ?
YLT	Matthew	7	23	and then I will acknowledge to them , that -- I never knew you , depart from me ye who are working lawlessness .
YLT	Matthew	7	24	` Therefore , every one who doth hear of me these words , and doth do them , I will liken him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock ;
YLT	Matthew	7	25	and the rain did descend , and the streams came , and the winds blew , and they beat on that house , and it fell not , for it had been founded on the rock .
YLT	Matthew	7	26	` And every one who is hearing of me these words , and is not doing them , shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand ;
YLT	Matthew	7	27	and the rain did descend , and the streams came , and the winds blew , and they beat on that house , and it fell , and its fall was great . '
YLT	Matthew	7	28	And it came to pass , when Jesus ended these words , the multitudes were astonished at his teaching ,
YLT	Matthew	7	29	for he was teaching them as having authority , and not as the scribes .
YLT	Matthew	8	8	And the centurion answering said , ` Sir , I am not worthy that thou mayest enter under my roof , but only say a word , and my servant shall be healed ;
YLT	Matthew	8	2	and lo , a leper having come , was bowing to him , saying , ` Sir , if thou art willing , thou art able to cleanse me ; '
YLT	Matthew	8	3	and having stretched forth the hand , Jesus touched him , saying , ` I will , be thou cleansed , ' and immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
YLT	Matthew	8	4	And Jesus saith to him , ` See , thou mayest tell no one , but go , thyself shew to the priest , and bring the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony to them . '
YLT	Matthew	8	5	And Jesus having entered into Capernaum , there came to him a centurion calling upon him ,
YLT	Matthew	8	6	and saying , ` Sir , my young man hath been laid in the house a paralytic , fearfully afflicted , '
YLT	Matthew	8	7	and Jesus saith to him , ` I , having come , will heal him . '
YLT	Matthew	8	9	for I also am a man under authority , having under myself soldiers , and I say to this one , Go , and he goeth , and to another , Be coming , and he cometh , and to my servant , Do this , and he doth [ it ] . '
YLT	Matthew	8	10	And Jesus having heard , did wonder , and said to those following , ` Verily I say to you , not even in Israel so great faith have I found ;
YLT	Matthew	8	11	and I say to you , that many from east and west shall come and recline ( at meat ) with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the reign of the heavens ,
YLT	Matthew	8	12	but the sons of the reign shall be cast forth to the outer darkness -- there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth . '
YLT	Matthew	8	13	And Jesus said to the centurion , ` Go , and as thou didst believe let it be to thee ; ' and his young man was healed in that hour .
YLT	Matthew	8	14	And Jesus having come into the house of Peter , saw his mother-in-law laid , and fevered ,
YLT	Matthew	8	15	and he touched her hand , and the fever left her , and she arose , and was ministering to them .
YLT	Matthew	8	16	And evening having come , they brought to him many demoniacs , and he did cast out the spirits with a word , and did heal all who were ill ,
YLT	Matthew	8	17	that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying , ` Himself took our infirmities , and the sicknesses he did bear . '
YLT	Matthew	8	18	And Jesus having seen great multitudes about him , did command to depart to the other side ;
YLT	Matthew	8	19	and a certain scribe having come , said to him , ` Teacher , I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go ; '
YLT	Matthew	8	20	and Jesus saith to him , ` The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven places of rest , but the Son of Man hath not where he may lay the head . '
YLT	Matthew	8	21	And another of his disciples said to him , ` Sir , permit me first to depart and to bury my father ; '
YLT	Matthew	8	22	and Jesus said to him , ` Follow me , and suffer the dead to bury their own dead . '
YLT	Matthew	8	23	And when he entered into the boat his disciples did follow him ,
YLT	Matthew	8	24	and lo , a great tempest arose in the sea , so that the boat was being covered by the waves , but he was sleeping ,
YLT	Matthew	8	25	and his disciples having come to him , awoke him , saying , ` Sir , save us ; we are perishing . '
YLT	Matthew	8	26	And he saith to them , ` Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? ' Then having risen , he rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great calm ;
YLT	Matthew	8	27	and the men wondered , saying , ` What kind -- is this , that even the wind and the sea do obey him ? '
YLT	Matthew	8	28	And he having come to the other side , to the region of the Gergesenes , there met him two demoniacs , coming forth out of the tombs , very fierce , so that no one was able to pass over by that way ,
YLT	Matthew	8	29	and lo , they cried out , saying , ` What -- to us and to thee , Jesus , Son of God ? didst thou come hither , before the time , to afflict us ? '
YLT	Matthew	8	30	And there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding ,
YLT	Matthew	8	31	and the demons were calling on him , saying , ` If thou dost cast us forth , permit us to go away to the herd of the swine ; '
YLT	Matthew	8	32	and he saith to them , ` Go . ' And having come forth , they went to the herd of the swine , and lo , the whole herd of the swine rushed down the steep , to the sea , and died in the waters ,
YLT	Matthew	8	33	and those feeding did flee , and , having gone to the city , they declared all , and the matter of the demoniacs .
YLT	Matthew	8	34	And lo , all the city came forth to meet Jesus , and having seen him , they called on [ him ] that he might depart from their borders .
YLT	Matthew	9	9	And Jesus passing by thence , saw a man sitting at the tax-office , named Matthew , and saith to him , ` Be following me , ' and he , having risen , did follow him .
YLT	Matthew	9	2	and lo , they were bringing to him a paralytic , laid upon a couch , and Jesus having seen their faith , said to the paralytic , ` Be of good courage , child , thy sins have been forgiven thee . '
YLT	Matthew	9	3	And lo , certain of the scribes said within themselves , ` This one doth speak evil . '
YLT	Matthew	9	4	And Jesus , having known their thoughts , said , ` Why think ye evil in your hearts ?
YLT	Matthew	9	5	for which is easier ? to say , The sins have been forgiven to thee ; or to say , Rise , and walk ?
YLT	Matthew	9	6	` But , that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power upon the earth to forgive sins -- ( then saith he to the paralytic ) -- having risen , take up thy couch , and go to thy house . '
YLT	Matthew	9	7	And he , having risen , went to his house ,
YLT	Matthew	9	8	and the multitudes having seen , wondered , and glorified God , who did give such power to men .
YLT	Matthew	9	10	And it came to pass , he reclining ( at meat ) in the house , that lo , many tax-gatherers and sinners having come , were lying ( at meat ) with Jesus and his disciples ,
YLT	Matthew	9	11	and the Pharisees having seen , said to his disciples , ` Wherefore with the tax-gatherers and sinners doth your teacher eat ? '
YLT	Matthew	9	12	And Jesus having heard , said to them , ` They who are whole have no need of a physician , but they who are ill ;
YLT	Matthew	9	13	but having gone , learn ye what is , Kindness I will , and not sacrifice , for I did not come to call righteous men , but sinners , to reformation . '
YLT	Matthew	9	14	Then come to him do the disciples of John , saying , ` Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much , and thy disciples fast not ? '
YLT	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said to them , ` Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn , so long as the bridegroom is with them ? but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them , and then they shall fast .
YLT	Matthew	9	16	` And no one doth put a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment , for its filling up doth take from the garment , and a worse rent is made .
YLT	Matthew	9	17	` Nor do they put new wine into old skins , and if not -- the skins burst , and the wine doth run out , and the skins are destroyed , but they put new wine into new skins , and both are preserved together . '
YLT	Matthew	9	18	While he is speaking these things to them , lo , a ruler having come , was bowing to him , saying that ` My daughter just now died , but , having come , lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live . '
YLT	Matthew	9	19	And Jesus having risen , did follow him , also his disciples ,
YLT	Matthew	9	20	and lo , a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , having come to him behind , did touch the fringe of his garments ,
YLT	Matthew	9	21	for she said within herself , ` If only I may touch his garment , I shall be saved . '
YLT	Matthew	9	22	And Jesus having turned about , and having seen her , said , ` Be of good courage , daughter , thy faith hath saved thee , ' and the woman was saved from that hour .
YLT	Matthew	9	23	And Jesus having come to the house of the ruler , and having seen the minstrels and the multitude making tumult ,
YLT	Matthew	9	24	he saith to them , ` Withdraw , for the damsel did not die , but doth sleep , ' and they were deriding him ;
YLT	Matthew	9	25	but , when the multitude was put forth , having gone in , he took hold of her hand , and the damsel arose ,
YLT	Matthew	9	26	and the fame of this went forth to all the land .
YLT	Matthew	9	27	And Jesus passing on thence , two blind men followed him , calling and saying , ` Deal kindly with us , Son of David . '
YLT	Matthew	9	28	And he having come to the house , the blind men came to him , and Jesus saith to them , ` Believe ye that I am able to do this ? ' They say to him , ` Yes , sir . '
YLT	Matthew	9	29	Then touched he their eyes , saying , ` According to your faith let it be to you , '
YLT	Matthew	9	30	and their eyes were opened , and Jesus strictly charged them , saying , ` See , let no one know ; '
YLT	Matthew	9	31	but they , having gone forth , did spread his fame in all that land .
YLT	Matthew	9	32	And as they are coming forth , lo , they brought to him a man dumb , a demoniac ,
YLT	Matthew	9	33	and the demon having been cast out , the dumb spake , and the multitude did wonder , saying that ` It was never so seen in Israel : '
YLT	Matthew	9	34	but the Pharisees said , ` By the ruler of the demons he doth cast out the demons . '
YLT	Matthew	9	35	And Jesus was going up and down all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and proclaiming the good news of the reign , and healing every sickness and every malady among the people .
YLT	Matthew	9	36	And having seen the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , that they were faint and cast aside , as sheep not having a shepherd ,
YLT	Matthew	9	37	then saith he to his disciples , ` The harvest indeed [ is ] abundant , but the workmen few ;
YLT	Matthew	9	38	beseech ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he may put forth workmen to His harvest . '
YLT	Matthew	10	10	nor scrip for the way , nor two coats , nor sandals , nor staff -- for the workman is worthy of his nourishment .
YLT	Matthew	10	2	And of the twelve apostles the names are these : first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
YLT	Matthew	10	3	Philip , and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the tax-gatherer ; James of Alpheus , and Lebbeus who was surnamed Thaddeus ;
YLT	Matthew	10	4	Simon the Cananite , and Judas Iscariot , who did also deliver him up .
YLT	Matthew	10	5	These twelve did Jesus send forth , having given command to them , saying , ` To the way of the nations go not away , and into a city of the Samaritans go not in ,
YLT	Matthew	10	6	and be going rather unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
YLT	Matthew	10	7	` And , going on , proclaim saying that , the reign of the heavens hath come nigh ;
YLT	Matthew	10	8	infirm ones be healing , lepers be cleansing , dead be raising , demons be casting out -- freely ye did receive , freely give .
YLT	Matthew	10	9	` Provide not gold , nor silver , nor brass in your girdles ,
YLT	Matthew	10	11	` And into whatever city or village ye may enter , inquire ye who in it is worthy , and there abide , till ye may go forth .
YLT	Matthew	10	12	And coming to the house salute it ,
YLT	Matthew	10	13	and if indeed the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it ; and if it be not worthy , let your peace turn back to you .
YLT	Matthew	10	14	` And whoever may not receive you nor hear your words , coming forth from that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet ,
YLT	Matthew	10	15	verily I say to you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city .
YLT	Matthew	10	16	` Lo , I do send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves , be ye therefore wise as the serpents , and simple as the doves .
YLT	Matthew	10	17	And , take ye heed of men , for they will give you up to sanhedrims , and in their synagogues they will scourge you ,
YLT	Matthew	10	18	and before governors and kings ye shall be brought for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the nations .
YLT	Matthew	10	19	` And whenever they may deliver you up , be not anxious how or what ye may speak , for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak ;
YLT	Matthew	10	20	for ye are not the speakers , but the Spirit of your Father that is speaking in you .
YLT	Matthew	10	21	` And brother shall deliver up brother to death , and father child , and children shall rise up against parents , and shall put them to death ,
YLT	Matthew	10	22	and ye shall be hated by all because of my name , but he who hath endured to the end , he shall be saved .
YLT	Matthew	10	23	` And whenever they may persecute you in this city , flee to the other , for verily I say to you , ye may not have completed the cities of Israel till the Son of Man may come .
YLT	Matthew	10	24	` A disciple is not above the teacher , nor a servant above his lord ;
YLT	Matthew	10	25	sufficient to the disciple that he may be as his teacher , and the servant as his lord ; if the master of the house they did call Beelzeboul , how much more those of his household ?
YLT	Matthew	10	26	` Ye may not , therefore , fear them , for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed , and hid , that shall not be known ;
YLT	Matthew	10	27	that which I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light , and that which you hear at the ear , proclaim on the house-tops .
YLT	Matthew	10	28	` And be not afraid of those killing the body , and are not able to kill the soul , but fear rather Him who is able both soul and body to destroy in gehenna .
YLT	Matthew	10	29	` Are not two sparrows sold for an assar ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father ;
YLT	Matthew	10	30	and of you -- even the hairs of the head are all numbered ;
YLT	Matthew	10	31	be not therefore afraid , than many sparrows ye are better .
YLT	Matthew	10	32	` Every one , therefore , who shall confess in me before men , I also will confess in him before my Father who is in the heavens ;
YLT	Matthew	10	33	and whoever shall deny me before men , I also will deny him before my Father who is in the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	10	34	` Ye may not suppose that I came to put peace on the earth ; I did not come to put peace , but a sword ;
YLT	Matthew	10	35	for I came to set a man at variance against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ,
YLT	Matthew	10	36	and the enemies of a man are those of his household .
YLT	Matthew	10	37	` He who is loving father or mother above me , is not worthy of me , and he who is loving son or daughter above me , is not worthy of me ,
YLT	Matthew	10	38	and whoever doth not receive his cross and follow after me , is not worthy of me .
YLT	Matthew	10	39	` He who found his life shall lose it , and he who lost his life for my sake shall find it .
YLT	Matthew	10	40	` He who is receiving you doth receive me , and he who is receiving me doth receive Him who sent me ,
YLT	Matthew	10	41	he who is receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet , shall receive a prophet 's reward , and he who is receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man , shall receive a righteous man 's reward ,
YLT	Matthew	10	42	and whoever may give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily I say to you , he may not lose his reward . '
YLT	Matthew	11	11	Verily I say to you , there hath not risen , among those born of women , a greater than John the Baptist , but he who is least in the reign of the heavens is greater than he .
YLT	Matthew	11	2	And John having heard in the prison the works of the Christ , having sent two of his disciples ,
YLT	Matthew	11	3	said to him , ` Art thou He who is coming , or for another do we look ? '
YLT	Matthew	11	4	And Jesus answering said to them , ` Having gone , declare to John the things that ye hear and see ,
YLT	Matthew	11	5	blind receive sight , and lame walk , lepers are cleansed , and deaf hear , dead are raised , and poor have good news proclaimed ,
YLT	Matthew	11	6	and happy is he who may not be stumbled in me . '
YLT	Matthew	11	7	And as they are going , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John , ` What went ye out to the wilderness to view ? -- a reed shaken by the wind ?
YLT	Matthew	11	8	` But what went ye out to see ? -- a man clothed in soft garments ? lo , those wearing the soft things are in the kings ' houses .
YLT	Matthew	11	9	` But what went ye out to see ? -- a prophet ? yes , I say to you , and more than a prophet ,
YLT	Matthew	11	10	for this is he of whom it hath been written , Lo , I do send My messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee .
YLT	Matthew	11	12	` And , from the days of John the Baptist till now , the reign of the heavens doth suffer violence , and violent men do take it by force ,
YLT	Matthew	11	13	for all the prophets and the law till John did prophesy ,
YLT	Matthew	11	14	and if ye are willing to receive [ it ] , he is Elijah who was about to come ;
YLT	Matthew	11	15	he who is having ears to hear -- let him hear .
YLT	Matthew	11	16	` And to what shall I liken this generation ? it is like little children in market-places , sitting and calling to their comrades ,
YLT	Matthew	11	17	and saying , We piped unto you , and ye did not dance , we lamented to you , and ye did not smite the breast .
YLT	Matthew	11	18	` For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a demon ;
YLT	Matthew	11	19	the Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , Lo , a man , a glutton , and a wine-drinker , a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners , and wisdom was justified of her children . '
YLT	Matthew	11	20	Then began he to reproach the cities in which were done most of his mighty works , because they did not reform .
YLT	Matthew	11	21	` Wo to thee , Chorazin ! wo to thee , Bethsaida ! because , if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you , long ago in sackcloth and ashes they had reformed ;
YLT	Matthew	11	22	but I say to you , to Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in a day of judgment than for you .
YLT	Matthew	11	23	` And thou , Capernaum , which unto the heaven wast exalted , unto hades shalt be brought down , because if in Sodom had been done the mighty works that were done in thee , it had remained unto this day ;
YLT	Matthew	11	24	but I say to you , to the land of Sodom it shall be more tolerable in a day of judgment than to thee . '
YLT	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus answering said , ` I do confess to Thee , Father , Lord of the heavens and of the earth , that thou didst hide these things from wise and understanding ones , and didst reveal them to babes .
YLT	Matthew	11	26	Yes , Father , because so it was good pleasure before Thee .
YLT	Matthew	11	27	` All things were delivered to me by my Father , and none doth know the Son , except the Father , nor doth any know the Father , except the Son , and he to whom the Son may wish to reveal [ Him ] .
YLT	Matthew	11	28	` Come unto me , all ye labouring and burdened ones , and I will give you rest ,
YLT	Matthew	11	29	take up my yoke upon you , and learn from me , because I am meek and humble in heart , and ye shall find rest to your souls ,
YLT	Matthew	11	30	for my yoke [ is ] easy , and my burden is light . '
YLT	Matthew	12	12	How much better , therefore , is a man than a sheep ? -- so that it is lawful on the sabbaths to do good . '
YLT	Matthew	12	2	and the Pharisees having seen , said to him , ` Lo , thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on a sabbath . '
YLT	Matthew	12	3	And he said to them , ` Did ye not read what David did , when he was hungry , himself and those with him --
YLT	Matthew	12	4	how he went into the house of God , and the loaves of the presentation did eat , which it is not lawful to him to eat , nor to those with him , except to the priests alone ?
YLT	Matthew	12	5	` Or did ye not read in the Law , that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple do profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
YLT	Matthew	12	6	and I say to you , that a greater than the temple is here ;
YLT	Matthew	12	7	and if ye had known what is : Kindness I will , and not sacrifice -- ye had not condemned the blameless ,
YLT	Matthew	12	8	for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath . '
YLT	Matthew	12	9	And having departed thence , he went to their synagogue ,
YLT	Matthew	12	10	and lo , there was a man having the hand withered , and they questioned him , saying , ` Is it lawful to heal on the sabbaths ? ' that they might accuse him .
YLT	Matthew	12	11	And he said to them , ` What man shall be of you , who shall have one sheep , and if this may fall on the sabbaths into a ditch , will not lay hold on it and raise [ it ] ?
YLT	Matthew	12	13	Then saith he to the man , ` Stretch forth thy hand , ' and he stretched [ it ] forth , and it was restored whole as the other .
YLT	Matthew	12	14	And the Pharisees having gone forth , held a consultation against him , how they might destroy him ,
YLT	Matthew	12	15	and Jesus having known , withdrew thence , and there followed him great multitudes , and he healed them all ,
YLT	Matthew	12	16	and did charge them that they might not make him manifest ,
YLT	Matthew	12	17	that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	12	18	` Lo , My servant , whom I did choose , My beloved , in whom My soul did delight , I will put My Spirit upon him , and judgment to the nations he shall declare ,
YLT	Matthew	12	19	he shall not strive nor cry , nor shall any hear in the broad places his voice ,
YLT	Matthew	12	20	a bruised reed he shall not break , and smoking flax he shall not quench , till he may put forth judgment to victory ,
YLT	Matthew	12	21	and in his name shall nations hope . '
YLT	Matthew	12	22	Then was brought to him a demoniac , blind and dumb , and he healed him , so that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
YLT	Matthew	12	23	And all the multitudes were amazed , and said , ` Is this the Son of David ? '
YLT	Matthew	12	24	but the Pharisees having heard , said , ` This one doth not cast out demons , except by Beelzeboul , ruler of the demons . '
YLT	Matthew	12	25	And Jesus , knowing their thoughts , said to them , ` Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated , and no city or house having been divided against itself , doth stand ,
YLT	Matthew	12	26	and if the Adversary doth cast out the Adversary , against himself he was divided , how then doth his kingdom stand ?
YLT	Matthew	12	27	` And if I , by Beelzeboul , do cast out the demons , your sons -- by whom do they cast out ? because of this they -- they shall be your judges .
YLT	Matthew	12	28	` But if I , by the Spirit of God , do cast out the demons , then come already unto you did the reign of God .
YLT	Matthew	12	29	` Or how is one able to go into the house of the strong man , and to plunder his goods , if first he may not bind the strong man ? and then his house he will plunder .
YLT	Matthew	12	30	` He who is not with me is against me , and he who is not gathering with me , doth scatter .
YLT	Matthew	12	31	Because of this I say to you , all sin and evil speaking shall be forgiven to men , but the evil speaking of the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men .
YLT	Matthew	12	32	And whoever may speak a word against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven to him , but whoever may speak against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is coming .
YLT	Matthew	12	33	` Either make the tree good , and its fruit good , or make the tree bad , and its fruit bad , for from the fruit is the tree known .
YLT	Matthew	12	34	` Brood of vipers ! how are ye able to speak good things -- being evil ? for out of the abundance of the heart doth the mouth speak .
YLT	Matthew	12	35	The good man out of the good treasure of the heart doth put forth the good things , and the evil man out of the evil treasure doth put forth evil things .
YLT	Matthew	12	36	` And I say to you , that every idle word that men may speak , they shall give for it a reckoning in a day of judgment ;
YLT	Matthew	12	37	for from thy words thou shalt be declared righteous , and from thy words thou shalt be declared unrighteous . '
YLT	Matthew	12	38	Then answered certain of the scribes and Pharisees , saying , ` Teacher , we will to see a sign from thee . '
YLT	Matthew	12	39	And he answering said to them , ` A generation , evil and adulterous , doth seek a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it , except the sign of Jonah the prophet ;
YLT	Matthew	12	40	for , as Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights , so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights .
YLT	Matthew	12	41	` Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it , for they reformed at the proclamation of Jonah , and lo , a greater than Jonah here !
YLT	Matthew	12	42	` A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and lo , a greater than Solomon here !
YLT	Matthew	12	43	` And , when the unclean spirit may go forth from the man , it doth walk through dry places seeking rest , and doth not find ;
YLT	Matthew	12	44	then it saith , I will turn back to my house whence I came forth ; and having come , it findeth [ it ] unoccupied , swept , and adorned :
YLT	Matthew	12	45	then doth it go , and take with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself , and having gone in they dwell there , and the last of that man doth become worse than the first ; so shall it be also to this evil generation . '
YLT	Matthew	12	46	And while he was yet speaking to the multitudes , lo , his mother and brethren had stood without , seeking to speak to him ,
YLT	Matthew	12	47	and one said to him , ` Lo , thy mother and thy brethren do stand without , seeking to speak to thee . '
YLT	Matthew	12	48	And he answering said to him who spake to him , ` Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ? '
YLT	Matthew	12	49	And having stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , he said , ` Lo , my mother and my brethren !
YLT	Matthew	12	50	for whoever may do the will of my Father who is in the heavens , he is my brother , and sister , and mother . '
YLT	Matthew	13	13	` Because of this , in similes do I speak to them , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear , nor understand ,
YLT	Matthew	13	2	and gathered together unto him were many multitudes , so that he having gone into the boat did sit down , and all the multitude on the beach did stand ,
YLT	Matthew	13	3	and he spake to them many things in similes , saying : ` Lo , the sower went forth to sow ,
YLT	Matthew	13	4	and in his sowing , some indeed fell by the way , and the fowls did come and devour them ,
YLT	Matthew	13	5	and others fell upon the rocky places , where they had not much earth , and immediately they sprang forth , through not having depth of earth ,
YLT	Matthew	13	6	and the sun having risen they were scorched , and through not having root , they withered ,
YLT	Matthew	13	7	and others fell upon the thorns , and the thorns did come up and choke them ,
YLT	Matthew	13	8	and others fell upon the good ground , and were giving fruit , some indeed a hundredfold , and some sixty , and some thirty .
YLT	Matthew	13	9	He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear . '
YLT	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples having come near , said to him , ` Wherefore in similes dost thou speak to them ? '
YLT	Matthew	13	11	And he answering said to them that -- ` To you it hath been given to know the secrets of the reign of the heavens , and to these it hath not been given ,
YLT	Matthew	13	12	for whoever hath , it shall be given to him , and he shall have overabundance , and whoever hath not , even that which he hath shall be taken from him .
YLT	Matthew	13	14	and fulfilled on them is the prophecy of Isaiah , that saith , With hearing ye shall hear , and ye shall not understand , and seeing ye shall see , and ye shall not perceive ,
YLT	Matthew	13	15	for made gross was the heart of this people , and with the ears they heard heavily , and their eyes they did close , lest they might see with the eyes , and with the ears might hear , and with the heart understand , and turn back , and I might heal them .
YLT	Matthew	13	16	` And happy are your eyes because they see , and your ears because they hear ,
YLT	Matthew	13	17	for verily I say to you , that many prophets and righteous men did desire to see that which ye look on , and they did not see , and to hear that which ye hear , and they did not hear .
YLT	Matthew	13	18	` Ye , therefore , hear ye the simile of the sower :
YLT	Matthew	13	19	Every one hearing the word of the reign , and not understanding -- the evil one doth come , and doth catch that which hath been sown in his heart ; this is that sown by the way .
YLT	Matthew	13	20	` And that sown on the rocky places , this is he who is hearing the word , and immediately with joy is receiving it ,
YLT	Matthew	13	21	and he hath not root in himself , but is temporary , and persecution or tribulation having happened because of the word , immediately he is stumbled .
YLT	Matthew	13	22	` And that sown toward the thorns , this is he who is hearing the word , and the anxiety of this age , and the deceitfulness of the riches , do choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful .
YLT	Matthew	13	23	` And that sown on the good ground : this is he who is hearing the word , and is understanding , who indeed doth bear fruit , and doth make , some indeed a hundredfold , and some sixty , and some thirty . '
YLT	Matthew	13	24	Another simile he set before them , saying : ` The reign of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field ,
YLT	Matthew	13	25	and , while men are sleeping , his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat , and went away ,
YLT	Matthew	13	26	and when the herb sprang up , and yielded fruit , then appeared also the darnel .
YLT	Matthew	13	27	` And the servants of the householder , having come near , said to him , Sir , good seed didst thou not sow in thy field ? whence then hath it the darnel ?
YLT	Matthew	13	28	And he saith to them , A man , an enemy , did this ; and the servants said to him , Wilt thou , then , [ that ] having gone away we may gather it up ?
YLT	Matthew	13	29	` And he said , No , lest -- gathering up the darnel -- ye root up with it the wheat ,
YLT	Matthew	13	30	suffer both to grow together till the harvest , and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather up first the darnel , and bind it in bundles , to burn it , and the wheat gather up into my storehouse . '
YLT	Matthew	13	31	Another simile he set before them , saying : ` The reign of the heavens is like to a grain of mustard , which a man having taken , did sow in his field ,
YLT	Matthew	13	32	which less , indeed , is than all the seeds , but when it may be grown , is greatest of the herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the heaven do come and rest in its branches . '
YLT	Matthew	13	33	Another simile spake he to them : ` The reign of the heavens is like to leaven , which a woman having taken , hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened . '
YLT	Matthew	13	34	All these things spake Jesus in similes to the multitudes , and without a simile he was not speaking to them ,
YLT	Matthew	13	35	that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophet , saying , ` I will open in similes my mouth , I will utter things having been hidden from the foundation of the world . '
YLT	Matthew	13	36	Then having let away the multitudes , Jesus came to the house , and his disciples came near to him , saying , ` Explain to us the simile of the darnel of the field . '
YLT	Matthew	13	37	And he answering said to them , ` He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man ,
YLT	Matthew	13	38	and the field is the world , and the good seed , these are the sons of the reign , and the darnel are the sons of the evil one ,
YLT	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil , and the harvest is a full end of the age , and the reapers are messengers .
YLT	Matthew	13	40	` As , then , the darnel is gathered up , and is burned with fire , so shall it be in the full end of this age ,
YLT	Matthew	13	41	the Son of Man shall send forth his messengers , and they shall gather up out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks , and those doing the unlawlessness ,
YLT	Matthew	13	42	and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth .
YLT	Matthew	13	43	` Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the reign of their Father . He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear .
YLT	Matthew	13	44	` Again , the reign of the heavens is like to treasure hid in the field , which a man having found did hide , and from his joy goeth , and all , as much as he hath , he selleth , and buyeth that field .
YLT	Matthew	13	45	` Again , the reign of the heavens is like to a man , a merchant , seeking goodly pearls ,
YLT	Matthew	13	46	who having found one pearl of great price , having gone away , hath sold all , as much as he had , and bought it .
YLT	Matthew	13	47	` Again , the reign of the heavens is like to a net that was cast into the sea , and did gather together of every kind ,
YLT	Matthew	13	48	which , when it was filled , having drawn up again upon the beach , and having sat down , they gathered the good into vessels , and the bad they did cast out ,
YLT	Matthew	13	49	so shall it be in the full end of the age , the messengers shall come forth and separate the evil out of the midst of the righteous ,
YLT	Matthew	13	50	and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire , there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth . '
YLT	Matthew	13	51	Jesus saith to them , ` Did ye understand all these ? ' They say to him , ` Yes , sir . '
YLT	Matthew	13	52	And he said to them , ` Because of this every scribe having been discipled in regard to the reign of the heavens , is like to a man , a householder , who doth bring forth out of his treasure things new and old . '
YLT	Matthew	13	53	And it came to pass , when Jesus finished these similes , he removed thence ,
YLT	Matthew	13	54	and having come to his own country , he was teaching them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and were saying , ` Whence to this one this wisdom and the mighty works ?
YLT	Matthew	13	55	is not this the carpenter 's son ? is not his mother called Mary , and his brethren James , and Joses , and Simon , and Judas ?
YLT	Matthew	13	56	and his sisters -- are they not all with us ? whence , then , to this one all these ? '
YLT	Matthew	13	57	and they were stumbled at him . And Jesus said to them , ` A prophet is not without honor except in his own country , and in his own house : '
YLT	Matthew	13	58	and he did not there many mighty works , because of their unbelief .
YLT	Matthew	14	14	And Jesus having come forth , saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion upon them , and did heal their infirm ;
YLT	Matthew	14	2	and said to his servants , ` This is John the Baptist , he did rise from the dead , and because of this the mighty energies are working in him . '
YLT	Matthew	14	3	For Herod having laid hold on John , did bind him , and did put him in prison , because of Herodias his brother Philip 's wife ,
YLT	Matthew	14	4	for John was saying to him , ` It is not lawful to thee to have her , '
YLT	Matthew	14	5	and , willing to kill him , he feared the multitude , because as a prophet they were holding him .
YLT	Matthew	14	6	But the birthday of Herod being kept , the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst , and did please Herod ,
YLT	Matthew	14	7	whereupon with an oath he professed to give her whatever she might ask .
YLT	Matthew	14	8	And she having been instigated by her mother -- ` Give me ( says she ) here upon a plate the head of John the Baptist ;
YLT	Matthew	14	9	and the king was grieved , but because of the oaths and of those reclining with him , he commanded [ it ] to be given ;
YLT	Matthew	14	10	and having sent , he beheaded John in the prison ,
YLT	Matthew	14	11	and his head was brought upon a plate , and was given to the damsel , and she brought [ it ] nigh to her mother .
YLT	Matthew	14	12	And his disciples having come , took up the body , and buried it , and having come , they told Jesus ,
YLT	Matthew	14	13	and Jesus having heard , withdrew thence in a boat to a desolate place by himself , and the multitudes having heard did follow him on land from the cities .
YLT	Matthew	14	15	and evening having come , his disciples came to him , saying , ` The place is desolate , and the hour hath now past , let away the multitudes that , having gone to the villages , they may buy to themselves food . '
YLT	Matthew	14	16	And Jesus said to them , ` They have no need to go away -- give ye them to eat . '
YLT	Matthew	14	17	And they say to him , ` We have not here except five loaves , and two fishes . '
YLT	Matthew	14	18	And he said , ` Bring ye them to me hither . '
YLT	Matthew	14	19	And having commanded the multitudes to recline upon the grass , and having taken the five loaves and the two fishes , having looked up to the heaven , he did bless , and having broken , he gave the loaves to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes ,
YLT	Matthew	14	20	and they did all eat , and were filled , and they took up what was over of the broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full ;
YLT	Matthew	14	21	and those eating were about five thousand men , apart from women and children .
YLT	Matthew	14	22	And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the boat , and to go before him to the other side , till he might let away the multitudes ;
YLT	Matthew	14	23	and having let away the multitudes , he went up to the mountain by himself to pray , and evening having come , he was there alone ,
YLT	Matthew	14	24	and the boat was now in the midst of the sea , distressed by the waves , for the wind was contrary .
YLT	Matthew	14	25	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went away to them , walking upon the sea ,
YLT	Matthew	14	26	and the disciples having seen him walking upon the sea , were troubled saying -- ` It is an apparition , ' and from the fear they cried out ;
YLT	Matthew	14	27	and immediately Jesus spake to them , saying , ` Be of good courage , I am [ he ] , be not afraid . '
YLT	Matthew	14	28	And Peter answering him said , ` Sir , if it is thou , bid me come to thee upon the waters ; '
YLT	Matthew	14	29	and he said , ` Come ; ' and having gone down from the boat , Peter walked upon the waters to come unto Jesus ,
YLT	Matthew	14	30	but seeing the wind vehement , he was afraid , and having begun to sink , he cried out , saying , ` Sir , save me . '
YLT	Matthew	14	31	And immediately Jesus , having stretched forth the hand , laid hold of him , and saith to him , ` Little faith ! for what didst thou waver ? '
YLT	Matthew	14	32	and they having gone to the boat the wind lulled ,
YLT	Matthew	14	33	and those in the boat having come , did bow to him , saying , ` Truly -- God 's Son art thou . '
YLT	Matthew	14	34	And having passed over , they came to the land of Gennesaret ,
YLT	Matthew	14	35	and having recognized him , the men of that place sent forth to all that region round about , and they brought to him all who were ill ,
YLT	Matthew	14	36	and were calling on him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment , and as many as did touch were saved .
YLT	Matthew	15	15	And Peter answering said to him , ` Explain to us this simile . '
YLT	Matthew	15	2	` Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they do not wash their hands when they may eat bread . '
YLT	Matthew	15	3	And he answering said to them , ` Wherefore also do ye transgress the command of God because of your tradition ?
YLT	Matthew	15	4	for God did command , saying , Honour thy father and mother ; and , He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death ;
YLT	Matthew	15	5	but ye say , Whoever may say to father or mother , An offering [ is ] whatever thou mayest be profited by me ; --
YLT	Matthew	15	6	and he may not honour his father or his mother , and ye did set aside the command of God because of your tradition .
YLT	Matthew	15	7	` Hypocrites , well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	15	8	This people doth draw nigh to Me with their mouth , and with the lips it doth honour Me , but their heart is far off from Me ;
YLT	Matthew	15	9	and in vain do they worship Me , teaching teachings -- commands of men . '
YLT	Matthew	15	10	And having called near the multitude , he said to them , ` Hear and understand :
YLT	Matthew	15	11	not that which is coming into the mouth doth defile the man , but that which is coming forth from the mouth , this defileth the man . '
YLT	Matthew	15	12	Then his disciples having come near , said to him , ` Hast thou known that the Pharisees , having heard the word , were stumbled ? '
YLT	Matthew	15	13	And he answering said , ` Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant shall be rooted up ;
YLT	Matthew	15	14	let them alone , guides they are -- blind of blind ; and if blind may guide blind , both into a ditch shall fall . '
YLT	Matthew	15	16	And Jesus said , ` Are ye also yet without understanding ?
YLT	Matthew	15	17	do ye not understand that all that is going into the mouth doth pass into the belly , and into the drain is cast forth ?
YLT	Matthew	15	18	but the things coming forth from the mouth from the heart do come forth , and these defile the man ;
YLT	Matthew	15	19	for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , whoredoms , thefts , false witnessings , evil speakings :
YLT	Matthew	15	20	these are the things defiling the man ; but to eat with unwashen hands doth not defile the man . '
YLT	Matthew	15	21	And Jesus having come forth thence , withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon ,
YLT	Matthew	15	22	and lo , a woman , a Canaanitess , from those borders having come forth , did call to him , saying , ` Deal kindly with me , Sir -- Son of David ; my daughter is miserably demonized . '
YLT	Matthew	15	23	And he did not answer her a word ; and his disciples having come to him , were asking him , saying -- ` Let her away , because she crieth after us ; '
YLT	Matthew	15	24	and he answering said , ` I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . '
YLT	Matthew	15	25	And having come , she was bowing to him , saying , ` Sir , help me ; '
YLT	Matthew	15	26	and he answering said , ` It is not good to take the children 's bread , and to cast to the little dogs . '
YLT	Matthew	15	27	And she said , ` Yes , sir , for even the little dogs do eat of the crumbs that are falling from their lords ' table ; '
YLT	Matthew	15	28	then answering , Jesus said to her , ` O woman , great [ is ] thy faith , let it be to thee as thou wilt ; ' and her daughter was healed from that hour .
YLT	Matthew	15	29	And Jesus having passed thence , came nigh unto the sea of Galilee , and having gone up to the mountain , he was sitting there ,
YLT	Matthew	15	30	and there came to him great multitudes , having with them lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and they did cast them at the feet of Jesus , and he healed them ,
YLT	Matthew	15	31	so that the multitudes did wonder , seeing dumb ones speaking , maimed whole , lame walking , and blind seeing ; and they glorified the God of Israel .
YLT	Matthew	15	32	And Jesus having called near his disciples , said , ` I have compassion upon the multitude , because now three days they continue with me , and they have not what they may eat ; and to let them away fasting I will not , lest they faint in the way . '
YLT	Matthew	15	33	And his disciples say to him , ` Whence to us , in a wilderness , so many loaves , as to fill so great a multitude ? '
YLT	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus saith to them , ` How many loaves have ye ? ' and they said , ` Seven , and a few little fishes . '
YLT	Matthew	15	35	And he commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the ground ,
YLT	Matthew	15	36	and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes , having given thanks , he did break , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
YLT	Matthew	15	37	And they did all eat , and were filled , and they took up what was over of the broken pieces seven baskets full ,
YLT	Matthew	15	38	and those eating were four thousand men , apart from women and children .
YLT	Matthew	15	39	And having let away the multitudes , he went into the boat , and did come to the borders of Magdala .
YLT	Matthew	16	16	and Simon Peter answering said , ` Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God . '
YLT	Matthew	16	2	and he answering said to them , ` Evening having come , ye say , Fair weather , for the heaven is red ,
YLT	Matthew	16	3	and at morning , Foul weather to-day , for the heaven is red -- gloomy ; hypocrites , the face of the heavens indeed ye do know to discern , but the signs of the times ye are not able !
YLT	Matthew	16	4	` A generation evil and adulterous doth seek a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it , except the sign of Jonah the prophet ; ' and having left them he went away .
YLT	Matthew	16	5	And his disciples having come to the other side , forgot to take loaves ,
YLT	Matthew	16	6	and Jesus said to them , ` Beware , and take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ; '
YLT	Matthew	16	7	and they were reasoning in themselves , saying , ` Because we took no loaves . '
YLT	Matthew	16	8	And Jesus having known , said to them , ` Why reason ye in yourselves , ye of little faith , because ye took no loaves ?
YLT	Matthew	16	9	do ye not yet understand , nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many hand-baskets ye took up ?
YLT	Matthew	16	10	nor the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
YLT	Matthew	16	11	how do ye not understand that I did not speak to you of bread -- to take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ? '
YLT	Matthew	16	12	Then they understood that he did not say to take heed of the leaven of the bread , but of the teaching , of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
YLT	Matthew	16	13	And Jesus , having come to the parts of Cesarea Philippi , was asking his disciples , saying , ` Who do men say me to be -- the Son of Man ? '
YLT	Matthew	16	14	and they said , ` Some , John the Baptist , and others , Elijah , and others , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . '
YLT	Matthew	16	15	He saith to them , ` And ye -- who do ye say me to be ? '
YLT	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus answering said to him , ` Happy art thou , Simon Bar-Jona , because flesh and blood did not reveal [ it ] to thee , but my Father who is in the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	16	18	` And I also say to thee , that thou art a rock , and upon this rock I will build my assembly , and gates of Hades shall not prevail against it ;
YLT	Matthew	16	19	and I will give to thee the keys of the reign of the heavens , and whatever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be having been bound in the heavens , and whatever thou mayest loose upon the earth shall be having been loosed in the heavens . '
YLT	Matthew	16	20	Then did he charge his disciples that they may say to no one that he is Jesus the Christ .
YLT	Matthew	16	21	From that time began Jesus to shew to his disciples that it is necessary for him to go away to Jerusalem , and to suffer many things from the elders , and chief priests , and scribes , and to be put to death , and the third day to rise .
YLT	Matthew	16	22	And having taken him aside , Peter began to rebuke him , saying , ` Be kind to thyself , sir ; this shall not be to thee ; '
YLT	Matthew	16	23	and he having turned , said to Peter , ` Get thee behind me , adversary ! thou art a stumbling-block to me , for thou dost not mind the things of God , but the things of men . '
YLT	Matthew	16	24	Then said Jesus to his disciples , ` If any one doth will to come after me , let him disown himself , and take up his cross , and follow me ,
YLT	Matthew	16	25	for whoever may will to save his life , shall lose it , and whoever may lose his life for my sake shall find it ,
YLT	Matthew	16	26	for what is a man profited if he may gain the whole world , but of his life suffer loss ? or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life ?
YLT	Matthew	16	27	` For , the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of his Father , with his messengers , and then he will reward each , according to his work .
YLT	Matthew	16	28	Verily I say to you , there are certain of those standing here who shall not taste of death till they may see the Son of Man coming in his reign . '
YLT	Matthew	17	17	And Jesus answering said , ` O generation , unstedfast and perverse , till when shall I be with you ? till when shall I bear you ? bring him to me hither ; '
YLT	Matthew	17	2	and he was transfigured before them , and his face shone as the sun , and his garments did become white as the light ,
YLT	Matthew	17	3	and lo , appear to them did Moses and Elijah , talking together with him .
YLT	Matthew	17	4	And Peter answering said to Jesus , ` Sir , it is good to us to be here ; if thou wilt , we may make here three booths -- for thee one , and for Moses one , and one for Elijah . '
YLT	Matthew	17	5	While he is yet speaking , lo , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and lo , a voice out of the cloud , saying , ` This is My Son , -- the Beloved , in whom I did delight ; hear him . '
YLT	Matthew	17	6	And the disciples having heard , did fall upon their face , and were exceedingly afraid ,
YLT	Matthew	17	7	and Jesus having come near , touched them , and said , ` Rise , be not afraid , '
YLT	Matthew	17	8	and having lifted up their eyes , they saw no one , except Jesus only .
YLT	Matthew	17	9	And as they are coming down from the mount , Jesus charged them , saying , ` Say to no one the vision , till the Son of Man out of the dead may rise . '
YLT	Matthew	17	10	And his disciples questioned him , saying , ` Why then do the scribes say that Elijah it behoveth to come first ? '
YLT	Matthew	17	11	And Jesus answering said to them , ` Elijah doth indeed come first , and shall restore all things ,
YLT	Matthew	17	12	and I say to you -- Elijah did already come , and they did not know him , but did with him whatever they would , so also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them . '
YLT	Matthew	17	13	Then understood the disciples that concerning John the Baptist he spake to them .
YLT	Matthew	17	14	And when they came unto the multitude , there came to him a man , kneeling down to him ,
YLT	Matthew	17	15	and saying , ` Sir , deal kindly with my son , for he is lunatic , and doth suffer miserably , for often he doth fall into the fire , and often into the water ,
YLT	Matthew	17	16	and I brought him near to thy disciples , and they were not able to heal him . '
YLT	Matthew	17	18	and Jesus rebuked him , and the demon went out of him , and the lad was healed from that hour .
YLT	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples having come to Jesus by himself , said , ` Wherefore were we not able to cast him out ? '
YLT	Matthew	17	20	And Jesus said to them , ` Through your want of faith ; for verily I say to you , if ye may have faith as a grain of mustard , ye shall say to this mount , Remove hence to yonder place , and it shall remove , and nothing shall be impossible to you ,
YLT	Matthew	17	21	and this kind doth not go forth except in prayer and fasting . '
YLT	Matthew	17	22	And while they are living in Galilee , Jesus said to them , ` The Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men ,
YLT	Matthew	17	23	and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall rise , ' and they were exceeding sorry .
YLT	Matthew	17	24	And they having come to Capernaum , those receiving the didrachms came near to Peter , and said , ` Your teacher -- doth he not pay the didrachms ? ' He saith , ` Yes . '
YLT	Matthew	17	25	And when he came into the house , Jesus anticipated him , saying , ` What thinkest thou , Simon ? the kings of the earth -- from whom do they receive custom or poll-tax ? from their sons or from the strangers ? '
YLT	Matthew	17	26	Peter saith to him , ` From the strangers . ' Jesus said to him , ` Then are the sons free ;
YLT	Matthew	17	27	but , that we may not cause them to stumble , having gone to the sea , cast a hook , and the fish that hath come up first take thou up , and having opened its mouth , thou shalt find a stater , that having taken , give to them for me and thee . '
YLT	Matthew	18	18	` Verily I say to you , Whatever things ye may bind upon the earth shall be having been bound in the heavens , and whatever things ye may loose on the earth shall be having been loosed in the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	18	2	And Jesus having called near a child , did set him in the midst of them ,
YLT	Matthew	18	3	and said , ` Verily I say to you , if ye may not be turned and become as the children , ye may not enter into the reign of the heavens ;
YLT	Matthew	18	4	whoever then may humble himself as this child , he is the greater in the reign of the heavens .
YLT	Matthew	18	5	` And he who may receive one such child in my name , doth receive me ,
YLT	Matthew	18	6	and whoever may cause to stumble one of those little ones who are believing in me , it is better for him that a weighty millstone may be hanged upon his neck , and he may be sunk in the depth of the sea .
YLT	Matthew	18	7	` Wo to the world from the stumbling-blocks ! for there is a necessity for the stumbling-blocks to come , but wo to that man through whom the stumbling-block doth come !
YLT	Matthew	18	8	` And if thy hand or thy foot doth cause thee to stumble , cut them off and cast from thee ; it is good for thee to enter into the life lame or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet , to be cast to the fire the age-during .
YLT	Matthew	18	9	` And if thine eye doth cause thee to stumble , pluck it out and cast from thee ; it is good for thee one-eyed to enter into the life , rather than having two eyes to be cast to the gehenna of the fire .
YLT	Matthew	18	10	` Beware ! -- ye may not despise one of these little ones , for I say to you , that their messengers in the heavens do always behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens ,
YLT	Matthew	18	11	for the Son of Man did come to save the lost .
YLT	Matthew	18	12	` What think ye ? if a man may have an hundred sheep , and there may go astray one of them , doth he not -- having left the ninety-nine , having gone on the mountains -- seek that which is gone astray ?
YLT	Matthew	18	13	and if it may come to pass that he doth find it , verily I say to you , that he doth rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray ;
YLT	Matthew	18	14	so it is not will in presence of your Father who is in the heavens , that one of these little ones may perish .
YLT	Matthew	18	15	` And if thy brother may sin against thee , go and show him his fault between thee and him alone , if he may hear thee , thou didst gain thy brother ;
YLT	Matthew	18	16	and if he may not hear , take with thee yet one or two , that by the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may stand .
YLT	Matthew	18	17	` And if he may not hear them , say [ it ] to the assembly , and if also the assembly he may not hear , let him be to thee as the heathen man and the tax-gatherer .
YLT	Matthew	18	19	` Again , I say to you , that , if two of you may agree on the earth concerning anything , whatever they may ask -- it shall be done to them from my Father who is in the heavens ,
YLT	Matthew	18	20	for where there are two or three gathered together -- to my name , there am I in the midst of them . '
YLT	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter having come near to him , said , ` Sir , how often shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him -- till seven times ? '
YLT	Matthew	18	22	Jesus saith to him , ` I do not say to thee till seven times , but till seventy times seven .
YLT	Matthew	18	23	` Because of this was the reign of the heavens likened to a man , a king , who did will to take reckoning with his servants ,
YLT	Matthew	18	24	and he having begun to take account , there was brought near to him one debtor of a myriad of talents ,
YLT	Matthew	18	25	and he having nothing to pay , his lord did command him to be sold , and his wife , and the children , and all , whatever he had , and payment to be made .
YLT	Matthew	18	26	The servant then , having fallen down , was bowing to him , saying , Sir , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all ;
YLT	Matthew	18	27	and the lord of that servant having been moved with compassion did release him , and the debt he forgave him .
YLT	Matthew	18	28	` And , that servant having come forth , found one of his fellow-servants who was owing him an hundred denaries , and having laid hold , he took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that which thou owest .
YLT	Matthew	18	29	His fellow-servant then , having fallen down at his feet , was calling on him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all ;
YLT	Matthew	18	30	and he would not , but having gone away , he cast him into prison , till he might pay that which was owing .
YLT	Matthew	18	31	` And his fellow-servants having seen the things that were done , were grieved exceedingly , and having come , shewed fully to their lord all the things that were done ;
YLT	Matthew	18	32	then having called him , his lord saith to him , Evil servant ! all that debt I did forgive thee , seeing thou didst call upon me ,
YLT	Matthew	18	33	did it not behove also thee to have dealt kindly with thy fellow-servant , as I also dealt kindly with thee ?
YLT	Matthew	18	34	` And having been wroth , his lord delivered him to the inquisitors , till he might pay all that was owing to him ;
YLT	Matthew	18	35	so also my heavenly Father will do to you , if ye may not forgive each one his brother from your hearts their trespasses . '
YLT	Matthew	19	19	honour thy father and mother , and , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . '
YLT	Matthew	19	2	and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them there .
YLT	Matthew	19	3	And the Pharisees came near to him , tempting him , and saying to him , ` Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ? '
YLT	Matthew	19	4	And he answering said to them , ` Did ye not read , that He who made [ them ] , from the beginning a male and a female made them ,
YLT	Matthew	19	5	and said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and cleave to his wife , and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh ?
YLT	Matthew	19	6	so that they are no more two , but one flesh ; what therefore God did join together , let no man put asunder . '
YLT	Matthew	19	7	They say to him , ` Why then did Moses command to give a roll of divorce , and to put her away ? '
YLT	Matthew	19	8	He saith to them -- ` Moses for your stiffness of heart did suffer you to put away your wives , but from the beginning it hath not been so .
YLT	Matthew	19	9	` And I say to you , that , whoever may put away his wife , if not for whoredom , and may marry another , doth commit adultery ; and he who did marry her that hath been put away , doth commit adultery . '
YLT	Matthew	19	10	His disciples say to him , ` If the case of the man with the woman is so , it is not good to marry . '
YLT	Matthew	19	11	And he said to them , ` All do not receive this word , but those to whom it hath been given ;
YLT	Matthew	19	12	for there are eunuchs who from the mother 's womb were so born ; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men ; and there are eunuchs who kept themselves eunuchs because of the reign of the heavens : he who is able to receive [ it ] -- let him receive . '
YLT	Matthew	19	13	Then were brought near to him children that he might put hands on them and pray , and the disciples rebuked them .
YLT	Matthew	19	14	But Jesus said , ` Suffer the children , and forbid them not , to come unto me , for of such is the reign of the heavens ; '
YLT	Matthew	19	15	and having laid on them [ his ] hands , he departed thence .
YLT	Matthew	19	16	And lo , one having come near , said to him , ` Good teacher , what good thing shall I do , that I may have life age-during ? '
YLT	Matthew	19	17	And he said to him , ` Why me dost thou call good ? no one [ is ] good except One -- God ; but if thou dost will to enter into the life , keep the commands . '
YLT	Matthew	19	18	He saith to him , ` What kind ? ' And Jesus said , ` Thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not commit adultery , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not bear false witness ,
YLT	Matthew	19	20	The young man saith to him , ` All these did I keep from my youth ; what yet do I lack ? '
YLT	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said to him , ` If thou dost will to be perfect , go away , sell what thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , follow me . '
YLT	Matthew	19	22	And the young man , having heard the word , went away sorrowful , for he had many possessions ;
YLT	Matthew	19	23	and Jesus said to his disciples , ` Verily I say to you , that hardly shall a rich man enter into the reign of the heavens ;
YLT	Matthew	19	24	and again I say to you , it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to go , than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God . '
YLT	Matthew	19	25	And his disciples having heard , were amazed exceedingly , saying , ` Who , then , is able to be saved ? '
YLT	Matthew	19	26	And Jesus having earnestly beheld , said to them , ` With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . '
YLT	Matthew	19	27	Then Peter answering said to him , ` Lo , we did leave all , and follow thee , what then shall we have ? '
YLT	Matthew	19	28	And Jesus said to them , ` Verily I say to you , that ye who did follow me , in the regeneration , when the Son of Man may sit upon a throne of his glory , shall sit -- ye also -- upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel ;
YLT	Matthew	19	29	and every one who left houses , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or fields , for my name 's sake , an hundredfold shall receive , and life age-during shall inherit ;
YLT	Matthew	19	30	and many first shall be last , and last first .
YLT	Matthew	20	20	Then came near to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee , with her sons , bowing and asking something from him ,
YLT	Matthew	20	2	and having agreed with the workmen for a denary a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
YLT	Matthew	20	3	` And having gone forth about the third hour , he saw others standing in the market-place idle ,
YLT	Matthew	20	4	and to these he said , Go ye -- also ye -- to the vineyard , and whatever may be righteous I will give you ;
YLT	Matthew	20	5	and they went away . ` Again , having gone forth about the sixth and the ninth hour , he did in like manner .
YLT	Matthew	20	6	And about the eleventh hour , having gone forth , he found others standing idle , and saith to them , Why here have ye stood all the day idle ?
YLT	Matthew	20	7	they say to him , Because no one did hire us ; he saith to them , Go ye -- ye also -- to the vineyard , and whatever may be righteous ye shall receive .
YLT	Matthew	20	8	` And evening having come , the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward , Call the workmen , and pay them the reward , having begun from the last -- unto the first .
YLT	Matthew	20	9	And they of about the eleventh hour having come , did receive each a denary .
YLT	Matthew	20	10	` And the first having come , did suppose that they shall receive more , and they received , they also , each a denary ,
YLT	Matthew	20	11	and having received [ it ] , they were murmuring against the householder , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	20	12	that These , the last , wrought one hour , and thou didst make them equal to us , who were bearing the burden of the day -- and the heat .
YLT	Matthew	20	13	` And he answering said to one of them , Comrade , I do no unrighteousness to thee ; for a denary didst not thou agree with me ?
YLT	Matthew	20	14	take that which is thine , and go ; and I will to give to this , the last , also as to thee ;
YLT	Matthew	20	15	is it not lawful to me to do what I will in mine own ? is thine eye evil because I am good ?
YLT	Matthew	20	16	So the last shall be first , and the first last , for many are called , and few chosen . '
YLT	Matthew	20	17	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem , took the twelve disciples by themselves in the way , and said to them ,
YLT	Matthew	20	18	` Lo , we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes ,
YLT	Matthew	20	19	and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the nations to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify , and the third day he will rise again . '
YLT	Matthew	20	21	and he said to her , ` What wilt thou ? ' She saith to him , ` Say , that they may sit -- these my two sons -- one on thy right hand , and one on the left , in thy reign . '
YLT	Matthew	20	22	And Jesus answering said , ` Ye have not known what ye ask for yourselves ; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink ? and with the baptism that I am baptized with , to be baptized ? ' They say to him , ` We are able . '
YLT	Matthew	20	23	And he saith to them , ` Of my cup indeed ye shall drink , and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized ; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give , but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared by my father . '
YLT	Matthew	20	24	And the ten having heard , were much displeased with the two brothers ,
YLT	Matthew	20	25	and Jesus having called them near , said , ` Ye have known that the rulers of the nations do exercise lordship over them , and those great do exercise authority over them ,
YLT	Matthew	20	26	but not so shall it be among you , but whoever may will among you to become great , let him be your ministrant ;
YLT	Matthew	20	27	and whoever may will among you to be first , let him be your servant ;
YLT	Matthew	20	28	even as the Son of Man did not come to be ministered to , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . '
YLT	Matthew	20	29	And they going forth from Jericho , there followed him a great multitude ,
YLT	Matthew	20	30	and lo , two blind men sitting by the way , having heard that Jesus doth pass by , cried , saying , ` Deal kindly with us , sir -- Son of David . '
YLT	Matthew	20	31	And the multitude charged them that they might be silent , and they cried out the more , saying , ` Deal kindly with us sir -- Son of David . '
YLT	Matthew	20	32	And having stood , Jesus called them , and said , ` What will ye [ that ] I may do to you ? '
YLT	Matthew	20	33	they say to him , ` Sir , that our eyes may be opened ; '
YLT	Matthew	20	34	and having been moved with compassion , Jesus touched their eyes , and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him .
YLT	Matthew	21	21	And Jesus answering said to them , ` Verily I say to you , If ye may have faith , and may not doubt , not only this of the fig-tree shall ye do , but even if to this mount ye may say , Be lifted up and be cast into the sea , it shall come to pass ;
YLT	Matthew	21	2	saying to them , ` Go on to the village over-against you , and immediately ye shall find an ass bound , and a colt with her -- having loosed , bring ye to me ;
YLT	Matthew	21	3	and if any one may say anything to you , ye shall say , that the lord hath need of them , and immediately he will send them . '
YLT	Matthew	21	4	And all this came to pass , that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	21	5	` Tell ye the daughter of Zion , Lo , thy king doth come to thee , meek , and mounted on an ass , and a colt , a foal of a beast of burden . '
YLT	Matthew	21	6	And the disciples having gone and having done as Jesus commanded them ,
YLT	Matthew	21	7	brought the ass and the colt , and did put on them their garments , and set [ him ] upon them ;
YLT	Matthew	21	8	and the very great multitude spread their own garments in the way , and others were cutting branches from the trees , and were strewing in the way ,
YLT	Matthew	21	9	and the multitudes who were going before , and who were following , were crying , saying , ` Hosanna to the Son of David , blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest . '
YLT	Matthew	21	10	And he having entered into Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , ` Who is this ? '
YLT	Matthew	21	11	And the multitudes said , ` This is Jesus the prophet , who [ is ] from Nazareth of Galilee . '
YLT	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus entered into the temple of God , and did cast forth all those selling and buying in the temple , and the tables of the money-changers he overturned , and the seats of those selling the doves ,
YLT	Matthew	21	13	and he saith to them , ` It hath been written , My house a house of prayer shall be called , but ye did make it a den of robbers . '
YLT	Matthew	21	14	And there came to him blind and lame men in the temple , and he healed them ,
YLT	Matthew	21	15	and the chief priests and the scribes having seen the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , ` Hosanna to the Son of David , ' were much displeased ;
YLT	Matthew	21	16	and they said to him , ` Hearest thou what these say ? ' And Jesus saith to them , ` Yes , did ye never read , that , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou didst prepare praise ? '
YLT	Matthew	21	17	And having left them , he went forth out of the city to Bethany , and did lodge there ,
YLT	Matthew	21	18	and in the morning turning back to the city , he hungered ,
YLT	Matthew	21	19	and having seen a certain fig-tree on the way , he came to it , and found nothing in it except leaves only , and he saith to it , ` No more from thee may fruit be -- to the age ; ' and forthwith the fig-tree withered .
YLT	Matthew	21	20	And the disciples having seen , did wonder , saying , ` How did the fig-tree forthwith wither ? '
YLT	Matthew	21	22	and all -- as much as ye may ask in the prayer , believing , ye shall receive . '
YLT	Matthew	21	23	And he having come to the temple , there came to him when teaching the chief priests and the elders of the people , saying , ` By what authority dost thou do these things ? and who gave thee this authority ? '
YLT	Matthew	21	24	And Jesus answering said to them , ` I will ask you -- I also -- one word , which if ye may tell me , I also will tell you by what authority I do these things ;
YLT	Matthew	21	25	the baptism of John , whence was it ? -- from heaven , or from men ? ' And they were reasoning with themselves , saying , ` If we should say , From heaven ; he will say to us , Wherefore , then , did ye not believe him ?
YLT	Matthew	21	26	and if we should say , From men , we fear the multitude , for all hold John as a prophet . '
YLT	Matthew	21	27	And answering Jesus they said , ` We have not known . ' He said to them -- he also -- ` Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things .
YLT	Matthew	21	28	` And what think ye ? A man had two children , and having come to the first , he said , Child , go , to-day be working in my vineyard . '
YLT	Matthew	21	29	And he answering said , ` I will not , ' but at last , having repented , he went .
YLT	Matthew	21	30	` And having come to the second , he said in the same manner , and he answering said , I [ go ] , sir , and went not ;
YLT	Matthew	21	31	which of the two did the will of the father ? ' They say to him , ` The first . ' Jesus saith to them , ` Verily I say to you , that the tax-gatherers and the harlots do go before you into the reign of God ,
YLT	Matthew	21	32	for John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye did not believe him , and the tax-gatherers and the harlots did believe him , and ye , having seen , repented not at last -- to believe him .
YLT	Matthew	21	33	` Hear ye another simile : There was a certain man , a householder , who planted a vineyard , and did put a hedge round it , and digged in it a wine-press , and built a tower , and gave it out to husbandmen , and went abroad .
YLT	Matthew	21	34	` And when the season of the fruits came nigh , he sent his servants unto the husbandmen , to receive the fruits of it ,
YLT	Matthew	21	35	and the husbandmen having taken his servants , one they scourged , and one they killed , and one they stoned .
YLT	Matthew	21	36	` Again he sent other servants more than the first , and they did to them in the same manner .
YLT	Matthew	21	37	` And at last he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son ;
YLT	Matthew	21	38	and the husbandmen having seen the son , said among themselves , This is the heir , come , we may kill him , and may possess his inheritance ;
YLT	Matthew	21	39	and having taken him , they cast [ him ] out of the vineyard , and killed him ;
YLT	Matthew	21	40	whenever therefore the lord of the vineyard may come , what will he do to these husbandmen ? '
YLT	Matthew	21	41	They say to him , ` Evil men -- he will evilly destroy them , and the vineyard will give out to other husbandmen , who will give back to him the fruits in their seasons . '
YLT	Matthew	21	42	Jesus saith to them , ` Did ye never read in the Writings , A stone that the builders disallowed , it became head of a corner ; from the Lord hath this come to pass , and it is wonderful in our eyes .
YLT	Matthew	21	43	` Because of this I say to you , that the reign of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth its fruit ;
YLT	Matthew	21	44	and he who is falling on this stone shall be broken , and on whomsoever it may fall it will crush him to pieces . '
YLT	Matthew	21	45	And the chief priests and the Pharisees having heard his similes , knew that of them he speaketh ,
YLT	Matthew	21	46	and seeking to lay hold on him , they feared the multitudes , seeing they were holding him as a prophet .
YLT	Matthew	22	22	and having heard they wondered , and having left him they went away .
YLT	Matthew	22	2	` The reign of the heavens was likened to a man , a king , who made marriage-feasts for his son ,
YLT	Matthew	22	3	and he sent forth his servants to call those having been called to the marriage-feasts , and they were not willing to come .
YLT	Matthew	22	4	` Again he sent forth other servants , saying , Say to those who have been called : Lo , my dinner I prepared , my oxen and the fatlings have been killed , and all things [ are ] ready , come ye to the marriage-feasts ;
YLT	Matthew	22	5	and they , having disregarded [ it ] , went away , the one to his own field , and the other to his merchandise ;
YLT	Matthew	22	6	and the rest , having laid hold on his servants , did insult and slay [ them ] .
YLT	Matthew	22	7	` And the king having heard , was wroth , and having sent forth his soldiers , he destroyed those murderers , and their city he set on fire ;
YLT	Matthew	22	8	then saith he to his servants , The marriage-feast indeed is ready , and those called were not worthy ,
YLT	Matthew	22	9	be going , then , on to the cross-ways , and as many as ye may find , call ye to the marriage-feasts .
YLT	Matthew	22	10	` And those servants , having gone forth to the ways , did gather all , as many as they found , both bad and good , and the marriage-feast apartment was filled with those reclining .
YLT	Matthew	22	11	` And the king having come in to view those reclining , saw there a man not clothed with clothing of the marriage-feast ,
YLT	Matthew	22	12	and he saith to him , Comrade , how didst thou come in hither , not having clothing of the marriage-feast ? and he was speechless .
YLT	Matthew	22	13	` Then said the king to the ministrants , Having bound his feet and hands , take him up and cast forth to the outer darkness , there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth ;
YLT	Matthew	22	14	for many are called , and few chosen . '
YLT	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees having gone , took counsel how they might ensnare him in words ,
YLT	Matthew	22	16	and they send to him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , ` Teacher , we have known that thou art true , and the way of God in truth thou dost teach , and thou art not caring for any one , for thou dost not look to the face of men ;
YLT	Matthew	22	17	tell us , therefore , what dost thou think ? is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not ? '
YLT	Matthew	22	18	And Jesus having known their wickedness , said , ` Why me do ye tempt , hypocrites ?
YLT	Matthew	22	19	show me the tribute-coin ? ' and they brought to him a denary ;
YLT	Matthew	22	20	and he saith to them , ` Whose [ is ] this image and the inscription ? '
YLT	Matthew	22	21	they say to him , ` Caesar 's ; ' then saith he to them , ` Render therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar , and the things of God to God ; '
YLT	Matthew	22	23	In that day there came near to him Sadducees , who are saying there is not a rising again , and they questioned him , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	22	24	` Teacher , Moses said , If any one may die not having children , his brother shall marry his wife , and shall raise up seed to his brother .
YLT	Matthew	22	25	` And there were with us seven brothers , and the first having married did die , and not having seed , he left his wife to his brother ;
YLT	Matthew	22	26	in like manner also the second , and the third , unto the seventh ,
YLT	Matthew	22	27	and last of all died also the woman ;
YLT	Matthew	22	28	therefore in the rising again , of which of the seven shall she be wife -- for all had her ? '
YLT	Matthew	22	29	And Jesus answering said to them , ` Ye go astray , not knowing the Writings , nor the power of God ;
YLT	Matthew	22	30	for in the rising again they do not marry , nor are they given in marriage , but are as messengers of God in heaven .
YLT	Matthew	22	31	` And concerning the rising again of the dead , did ye not read that which was spoken to you by God , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	22	32	I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not a God of dead men , but of living . '
YLT	Matthew	22	33	And having heard , the multitudes were astonished at his teaching ;
YLT	Matthew	22	34	and the Pharisees , having heard that he did silence the Sadducees , were gathered together unto him ;
YLT	Matthew	22	35	and one of them , a lawyer , did question , tempting him , and saying ,
YLT	Matthew	22	36	` Teacher , which [ is ] the great command in the Law ? '
YLT	Matthew	22	37	And Jesus said to him , ` Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thine understanding --
YLT	Matthew	22	38	this is a first and great command ;
YLT	Matthew	22	39	and the second [ is ] like to it , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ;
YLT	Matthew	22	40	on these -- the two commands -- all the law and the prophets do hang . '
YLT	Matthew	22	41	And the Pharisees having been gathered together , Jesus did question them ,
YLT	Matthew	22	42	saying , ` What do ye think concerning the Christ ? of whom is he son ? ' They say to him , ` Of David . '
YLT	Matthew	22	43	He saith to them , ` How then doth David in the Spirit call him lord , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	22	44	The Lord said to my lord , Sit at my right hand , till I may make thine enemies thy footstool ?
YLT	Matthew	22	45	If then David doth call him lord , how is he his son ? '
YLT	Matthew	22	46	And no one was able to answer him a word , nor durst any from that day question him any more .
YLT	Matthew	23	23	` Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye give tithe of the mint , and the dill , and the cumin , and did neglect the weightier things of the Law -- the judgment , and the kindness , and the faith ; these it behoved [ you ] to do , and those not to neglect .
YLT	Matthew	23	2	saying , ` On the seat of Moses sat down the scribes and the Pharisees ;
YLT	Matthew	23	3	all , then , as much as they may say to you to observe , observe and do , but according to their works do not , for they say , and do not ;
YLT	Matthew	23	4	for they bind together burdens heavy and grievous to be borne , and lay upon the shoulders of men , but with their finger they will not move them .
YLT	Matthew	23	5	` And all their works they do to be seen by men , and they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the fringes of their garments ,
YLT	Matthew	23	6	they love also the chief couches in the supper , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
YLT	Matthew	23	7	and the salutations in the market-places , and to be called by men , Rabbi , Rabbi .
YLT	Matthew	23	8	` And ye -- ye may not be called Rabbi , for one is your director -- the Christ , and all ye are brethren ;
YLT	Matthew	23	9	and ye may not call [ any ] your father on the earth , for one is your Father , who is in the heavens ,
YLT	Matthew	23	10	nor may ye be called directors , for one is your director -- the Christ .
YLT	Matthew	23	11	And the greater of you shall be your ministrant ,
YLT	Matthew	23	12	and whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled , and whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted .
YLT	Matthew	23	13	` Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye shut up the reign of the heavens before men , for ye do not go in , nor those going in do ye suffer to enter .
YLT	Matthew	23	14	` Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye eat up the houses of the widows , and for a pretence make long prayers , because of this ye shall receive more abundant judgment .
YLT	Matthew	23	15	` Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye go round the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte , and whenever it may happen -- ye make him a son of gehenna twofold more than yourselves .
YLT	Matthew	23	16	` Wo to you , blind guides , who are saying , Whoever may swear by the sanctuary , it is nothing , but whoever may swear by the gold of the sanctuary -- is debtor !
YLT	Matthew	23	17	Fools and blind ! for which [ is ] greater , the gold , or the sanctuary that is sanctifying the gold ?
YLT	Matthew	23	18	` And , whoever may swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whoever may swear by the gift that is upon it -- is debtor !
YLT	Matthew	23	19	Fools and blind ! for which [ is ] greater , the gift , or the altar that is sanctifying the gift ?
YLT	Matthew	23	20	` He therefore who did swear by the altar , doth swear by it , and by all things on it ;
YLT	Matthew	23	21	and he who did swear by the sanctuary , doth swear by it , and by Him who is dwelling in it ;
YLT	Matthew	23	22	and he who did swear by the heaven , doth swear by the throne of God , and by Him who is sitting upon it .
YLT	Matthew	23	24	` Blind guides ! who are straining out the gnat , and the camel are swallowing .
YLT	Matthew	23	25	` Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye make clean the outside of the cup and the plate , and within they are full of rapine and incontinence .
YLT	Matthew	23	26	` Blind Pharisee ! cleanse first the inside of the cup and the plate , that the outside of them also may become clean .
YLT	Matthew	23	27	` Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye are like to whitewashed sepulchres , which outwardly indeed do appear beautiful , and within are full of bones of dead men , and of all uncleanness ;
YLT	Matthew	23	28	so also ye outwardly indeed do appear to men righteous , and within ye are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness .
YLT	Matthew	23	29	` Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and adorn the tombs of the righteous ,
YLT	Matthew	23	30	and say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
YLT	Matthew	23	31	So that ye testify to yourselves , that ye are sons of them who did murder the prophets ;
YLT	Matthew	23	32	and ye -- ye fill up the measure of your fathers .
YLT	Matthew	23	33	` Serpents ! brood of vipers ! how may ye escape from the judgment of the gehenna ?
YLT	Matthew	23	34	` Because of this , lo , I send to you prophets , and wise men , and scribes , and of them ye will kill and crucify , and of them ye will scourge in your synagogues , and will pursue from city to city ;
YLT	Matthew	23	35	that on you may come all the righteous blood being poured out on the earth from the blood of Abel the righteous , unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar :
YLT	Matthew	23	36	verily I say to you , all these things shall come upon this generation .
YLT	Matthew	23	37	` Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that art killing the prophets , and stoning those sent unto thee , how often did I will to gather thy children together , as a hen doth gather her own chickens under the wings , and ye did not will .
YLT	Matthew	23	38	Lo , left desolate to you is your house ;
YLT	Matthew	23	39	for I say to you , ye may not see me henceforth , till ye may say , Blessed [ is ] he who is coming in the name of the Lord . '
YLT	Matthew	24	24	for there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and they shall give great signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if possible , also the chosen .
YLT	Matthew	24	2	and Jesus said to them , ` Do ye not see all these ? verily I say to you , There may not be left here a stone upon a stone , that shall not be thrown down . '
YLT	Matthew	24	3	And when he is sitting on the mount of the Olives , the disciples came near to him by himself , saying , ` Tell us , when shall these be ? and what [ is ] the sign of thy presence , and of the full end of the age ? '
YLT	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answering said to them , ` Take heed that no one may lead you astray ,
YLT	Matthew	24	5	for many shall come in my name , saying , I am the Christ , and they shall lead many astray ,
YLT	Matthew	24	6	and ye shall begin to hear of wars , and reports of wars ; see , be not troubled , for it behoveth all [ these ] to come to pass , but the end is not yet .
YLT	Matthew	24	7	` For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places ;
YLT	Matthew	24	8	and all these [ are ] the beginning of sorrows ;
YLT	Matthew	24	9	then they shall deliver you up to tribulation , and shall kill you , and ye shall be hated by all the nations because of my name ;
YLT	Matthew	24	10	and then shall many be stumbled , and they shall deliver up one another , and shall hate one another .
YLT	Matthew	24	11	` And many false prophets shall arise , and shall lead many astray ;
YLT	Matthew	24	12	and because of the abounding of the lawlessness , the love of the many shall become cold ;
YLT	Matthew	24	13	but he who did endure to the end , he shall be saved ;
YLT	Matthew	24	14	and this good news of the reign shall be proclaimed in all the world , for a testimony to all the nations ; and then shall the end arrive .
YLT	Matthew	24	15	` Whenever , therefore , ye may see the abomination of the desolation , that was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( whoever is reading let him observe )
YLT	Matthew	24	16	then those in Judea -- let them flee to the mounts ;
YLT	Matthew	24	17	he on the house-top -- let him not come down to take up any thing out of his house ;
YLT	Matthew	24	18	and he in the field -- let him not turn back to take his garments .
YLT	Matthew	24	19	` And wo to those with child , and to those giving suck in those days ;
YLT	Matthew	24	20	and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter , nor on a sabbath ;
YLT	Matthew	24	21	for there shall be then great tribulation , such as was not from the beginning of the world till now , no , nor may be .
YLT	Matthew	24	22	And if those days were not shortened , no flesh would have been saved ; but because of the chosen , shall those days be shortened .
YLT	Matthew	24	23	` Then if any one may say to you , Lo , here [ is ] the Christ ! or here ! ye may not believe ;
YLT	Matthew	24	25	Lo , I did tell you beforehand .
YLT	Matthew	24	26	` If therefore they may say to you , Lo , in the wilderness he is , ye may not go forth ; lo , in the inner chambers , ye may not believe ;
YLT	Matthew	24	27	for as the lightning doth come forth from the east , and doth appear unto the west , so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man ;
YLT	Matthew	24	28	for wherever the carcase may be , there shall the eagles be gathered together .
YLT	Matthew	24	29	` And immediately after the tribulation of those days , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from the heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken ;
YLT	Matthew	24	30	and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heaven ; and then shall all the tribes of the earth smite the breast , and they shall see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of the heaven , with power and much glory ;
YLT	Matthew	24	31	and he shall send his messengers with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his chosen from the four winds , from the ends of the heavens unto the ends thereof .
YLT	Matthew	24	32	` And from the fig-tree learn ye the simile : When already its branch may have become tender , and the leaves it may put forth , ye know that summer [ is ] nigh ,
YLT	Matthew	24	33	so also ye , when ye may see all these , ye know that it is nigh -- at the doors .
YLT	Matthew	24	34	Verily I say to you , this generation may not pass away till all these may come to pass .
YLT	Matthew	24	35	The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
YLT	Matthew	24	36	` And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known -- not even the messengers of the heavens -- except my Father only ;
YLT	Matthew	24	37	and as the days of Noah -- so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man ;
YLT	Matthew	24	38	for as they were , in the days before the flood , eating , and drinking , marrying , and giving in marriage , till the day Noah entered into the ark ,
YLT	Matthew	24	39	and they did not know till the flood came and took all away ; so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man .
YLT	Matthew	24	40	Then two men shall be in the field , the one is received , and the one is left ;
YLT	Matthew	24	41	two women shall be grinding in the mill , one is received , and one is left .
YLT	Matthew	24	42	` Watch ye therefore , because ye have not known in what hour your Lord doth come ;
YLT	Matthew	24	43	and this know , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief doth come , he had watched , and not suffered his house to be broken through ;
YLT	Matthew	24	44	because of this also ye , become ye ready , because in what hour ye do not think , the Son of Man doth come .
YLT	Matthew	24	45	` Who , then , is the servant , faithful and wise , whom his lord did set over his household , to give them the nourishment in season ?
YLT	Matthew	24	46	Happy that servant , whom his lord , having come , shall find doing so ;
YLT	Matthew	24	47	verily I say to you , that over all his substance he will set him .
YLT	Matthew	24	48	` And , if that evil servant may say in his heart , My Lord doth delay to come ,
YLT	Matthew	24	49	and may begin to beat the fellow-servants , and to eat and to drink with the drunken ,
YLT	Matthew	24	50	the lord of that servant will arrive in a day when he doth not expect , and in an hour of which he doth not know ,
YLT	Matthew	24	51	and will cut him off , and his portion with the hypocrites will appoint ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth .
YLT	Matthew	25	25	and having been afraid , having gone away , I hid thy talent in the earth ; lo , thou hast thine own !
YLT	Matthew	25	2	and five of them were prudent , and five foolish ;
YLT	Matthew	25	3	they who were foolish having taken their lamps , did not take with themselves oil ;
YLT	Matthew	25	4	and the prudent took oil in their vessels , with their lamps .
YLT	Matthew	25	5	` And the bridegroom tarrying , they all nodded and were sleeping ,
YLT	Matthew	25	6	and in the middle of the night a cry was made , Lo , the bridegroom doth come ; go ye forth to meet him .
YLT	Matthew	25	7	` Then rose all those virgins , and trimmed their lamps ,
YLT	Matthew	25	8	and the foolish said to the prudent , Give us of your oil , because our lamps are going out ;
YLT	Matthew	25	9	and the prudent answered , saying -- Lest there may not be sufficient for us and you , go ye rather unto those selling , and buy for yourselves .
YLT	Matthew	25	10	` And while they are going away to buy , the bridegroom came , and those ready went in with him to the marriage-feasts , and the door was shut ;
YLT	Matthew	25	11	and afterwards come also do the rest of the virgins , saying , Sir , sir , open to us ;
YLT	Matthew	25	12	and he answering said , Verily I say to you , I have not known you .
YLT	Matthew	25	13	` Watch therefore , for ye have not known the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man doth come .
YLT	Matthew	25	14	` For -- as a man going abroad did call his own servants , and did deliver to them his substance ,
YLT	Matthew	25	15	and to one he gave five talents , and to another two , and to another one , to each according to his several ability , went abroad immediately .
YLT	Matthew	25	16	` And he who did receive the five talents , having gone , wrought with them , and made other five talents ;
YLT	Matthew	25	17	in like manner also he who [ received ] the two , he gained , also he , other two ;
YLT	Matthew	25	18	and he who did receive the one , having gone away , digged in the earth , and hid his lord 's money .
YLT	Matthew	25	19	` And after a long time cometh the lord of those servants , and taketh reckoning with them ;
YLT	Matthew	25	20	and he who did receive the five talents having come , brought other five talents , saying , ` Sir , five talents thou didst deliver to me ; lo , other five talents did I gain besides them .
YLT	Matthew	25	21	` And his lord said to him , Well done , servant , good and faithful , over a few things thou wast faithful , over many things I will set thee ; enter into the joy of thy lord .
YLT	Matthew	25	22	` And he who also did receive the two talents having come , said , Sir , two talents thou didst deliver to me ; lo , other two talents I did gain besides them .
YLT	Matthew	25	23	` His lord said to him , Well done , servant , good and faithful , over a few things thou wast faithful , over many things I will set thee ; enter into the joy of thy lord .
YLT	Matthew	25	24	` And he also who hath received the one talent having come , said , Sir , I knew thee , that thou art a hard man , reaping where thou didst not sow , and gathering from whence thou didst not scatter ;
YLT	Matthew	25	26	` And his lord answering said to him , Evil servant , and slothful , thou hadst known that I reap where I did not sow , and I gather whence I did not scatter !
YLT	Matthew	25	27	it behoved thee then to put my money to the money-lenders , and having come I had received mine own with increase .
YLT	Matthew	25	28	` Take therefore from him the talent , and give to him having the ten talents ,
YLT	Matthew	25	29	for to every one having shall be given , and he shall have overabundance , and from him who is not having , even that which he hath shall be taken from him ;
YLT	Matthew	25	30	and the unprofitable servant cast ye forth to the outer darkness ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth .
YLT	Matthew	25	31	` And whenever the Son of Man may come in his glory , and all the holy messengers with him , then he shall sit upon a throne of his glory ;
YLT	Matthew	25	32	and gathered together before him shall be all the nations , and he shall separate them from one another , as the shepherd doth separate the sheep from the goats ,
YLT	Matthew	25	33	and he shall set the sheep indeed on his right hand , and the goats on the left .
YLT	Matthew	25	34	` Then shall the king say to those on his right hand , Come ye , the blessed of my Father , inherit the reign that hath been prepared for you from the foundation of the world ;
YLT	Matthew	25	35	for I did hunger , and ye gave me to eat ; I did thirst , and ye gave me to drink ; I was a stranger , and ye received me ;
YLT	Matthew	25	36	naked , and ye put around me ; I was infirm , and ye looked after me ; in prison I was , and ye came unto me .
YLT	Matthew	25	37	` Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when did we see thee hungering , and we nourished ? or thirsting , and we gave to drink ?
YLT	Matthew	25	38	and when did we see thee a stranger , and we received ? or naked , and we put around ?
YLT	Matthew	25	39	and when did we see thee infirm , or in prison , and we came unto thee ?
YLT	Matthew	25	40	` And the king answering , shall say to them , Verily I say to you , Inasmuch as ye did [ it ] to one of these my brethren -- the least -- to me ye did [ it ] .
YLT	Matthew	25	41	Then shall he say also to those on the left hand , Go ye from me , the cursed , to the fire , the age-during , that hath been prepared for the Devil and his messengers ;
YLT	Matthew	25	42	for I did hunger , and ye gave me not to eat ; I did thirst , and ye gave me not to drink ;
YLT	Matthew	25	43	a stranger I was , and ye did not receive me ; naked , and ye put not around me ; infirm , and in prison , and ye did not look after me .
YLT	Matthew	25	44	` Then shall they answer , they also , saying , Lord , when did we see thee hungering , or thirsting , or a stranger , or naked , or infirm , or in prison , and we did not minister to thee ?
YLT	Matthew	25	45	` Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say to you , Inasmuch as ye did [ it ] not to one of these , the least , ye did [ it ] not to me .
YLT	Matthew	25	46	And these shall go away to punishment age-during , but the righteous to life age-during . '
YLT	Matthew	26	26	And while they were eating , Jesus having taken the bread , and having blessed , did brake , and was giving to the disciples , and said , ` Take , eat , this is my body ; '
YLT	Matthew	26	2	` Ye have known that after two days the passover cometh , and the Son of Man is delivered up to be crucified . '
YLT	Matthew	26	3	Then were gathered together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , to the court of the chief priest who was called Caiaphas ;
YLT	Matthew	26	4	and they consulted together that they might take Jesus by guile , and kill [ him ] ,
YLT	Matthew	26	5	and they said , ` Not in the feast , that there may not be a tumult among the people . '
YLT	Matthew	26	6	And Jesus having been in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
YLT	Matthew	26	7	there came to him a woman having an alabaster box of ointment , very precious , and she poured on his head as he is reclining ( at meat ) .
YLT	Matthew	26	8	And having seen [ it ] , his disciples were much displeased , saying , ` To what purpose [ is ] this waste ?
YLT	Matthew	26	9	for this ointment could have been sold for much , and given to the poor . '
YLT	Matthew	26	10	And Jesus having known , said to them , ` Why do ye give trouble to the woman ? for a good work she wrought for me ;
YLT	Matthew	26	11	for the poor always ye have with you , and me ye have not always ;
YLT	Matthew	26	12	for she having put this ointment on my body -- for my burial she did [ it ] .
YLT	Matthew	26	13	Verily I say to you , Wherever this good news may be proclaimed in the whole world , what this [ one ] did shall also be spoken of -- for a memorial of her . '
YLT	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the twelve , who is called Judas Iscariot , having gone unto the chief priests , said ,
YLT	Matthew	26	15	` What are ye willing to give me , and I will deliver him up to you ? ' and they weighed out to him thirty silverlings ,
YLT	Matthew	26	16	and from that time he was seeking a convenient season to deliver him up .
YLT	Matthew	26	17	And on the first [ day ] of the unleavened food came the disciples near to Jesus , saying to him , ` Where wilt thou [ that ] we may prepare for thee to eat the passover ? '
YLT	Matthew	26	18	and he said , ` Go away to the city , unto such a one , and say to him , The Teacher saith , My time is nigh ; near thee I keep the passover , with my disciples ; '
YLT	Matthew	26	19	and the disciples did as Jesus appointed them , and prepared the passover .
YLT	Matthew	26	20	And evening having come , he was reclining ( at meat ) with the twelve ,
YLT	Matthew	26	21	and while they are eating , he said , ` Verily I say to you , that one of you shall deliver me up . '
YLT	Matthew	26	22	And being grieved exceedingly , they began to say to him , each of them , ` Is it I , Sir ? '
YLT	Matthew	26	23	And he answering said , ` He who did dip with me the hand in the dish , he will deliver me up ;
YLT	Matthew	26	24	the Son of Man doth indeed go , as it hath been written concerning him , but wo to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up ! good it were for him if that man had not been born . '
YLT	Matthew	26	25	And Judas -- he who delivered him up -- answering said , ` Is it I , Rabbi ? ' He saith to him , ` Thou hast said . '
YLT	Matthew	26	27	and having taken the cup , and having given thanks , he gave to them , saying , ` Drink ye of it -- all ;
YLT	Matthew	26	28	for this is my blood of the new covenant , that for many is being poured out -- to remission of sins ;
YLT	Matthew	26	29	and I say to you , that I may not drink henceforth on this produce of the vine , till that day when I may drink it with you new in the reign of my Father . '
YLT	Matthew	26	30	And having sung a hymn , they went forth to the mount of the Olives ;
YLT	Matthew	26	31	then saith Jesus to them , ` All ye shall be stumbled at me this night ; for it hath been written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad ;
YLT	Matthew	26	32	but , after my having risen , I will go before you to Galilee . '
YLT	Matthew	26	33	And Peter answering said to him , ` Even if all shall be stumbled at thee , I will never be stumbled . '
YLT	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said to him , ` Verily I say to thee , that , this night , before cock-crowing , thrice thou wilt deny me . '
YLT	Matthew	26	35	Peter saith to him , ` Even if it may be necessary for me to die with thee , I will not deny thee ; ' in like manner also said all the disciples .
YLT	Matthew	26	36	Then come with them doth Jesus to a place called Gethsemane , and he saith to the disciples , ` Sit ye here , till having gone away , I shall pray yonder . '
YLT	Matthew	26	37	And having taken Peter , and the two sons of Zebedee , he began to be sorrowful , and to be very heavy ;
YLT	Matthew	26	38	then saith he to them , ` Exceedingly sorrowful is my soul -- unto death ; abide ye here , and watch with me . '
YLT	Matthew	26	39	And having gone forward a little , he fell on his face , praying , and saying , ` My Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me ; nevertheless , not as I will , but as Thou . '
YLT	Matthew	26	40	And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them sleeping , and he saith to Peter , ` So ! ye were not able one hour to watch with me !
YLT	Matthew	26	41	watch , and pray , that ye may not enter into temptation : the spirit indeed is forward , but the flesh weak . '
YLT	Matthew	26	42	Again , a second time , having gone away , he prayed , saying , ` My Father , if this cup can not pass away from me except I drink it , Thy will be done ; '
YLT	Matthew	26	43	and having come , he findeth them again sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
YLT	Matthew	26	44	And having left them , having gone away again , he prayed a third time , saying the same word ;
YLT	Matthew	26	45	then cometh he unto his disciples , and saith to them , ` Sleep on henceforth , and rest ! lo , the hour hath come nigh , and the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of sinners .
YLT	Matthew	26	46	Rise , let us go ; lo , he hath come nigh who is delivering me up . '
YLT	Matthew	26	47	And while he is yet speaking , lo , Judas , one of the twelve did come , and with him a great multitude , with swords and sticks , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
YLT	Matthew	26	48	And he who did deliver him up did give them a sign , saying , ` Whomsoever I will kiss , it is he : lay hold on him ; '
YLT	Matthew	26	49	and immediately , having come to Jesus , he said , ` Hail , Rabbi , ' and kissed him ;
YLT	Matthew	26	50	and Jesus said to him , ` Comrade , for what art thou present ? ' Then having come near , they laid hands on Jesus , and took hold on him .
YLT	Matthew	26	51	And lo , one of those with Jesus , having stretched forth the hand , drew his sword , and having struck the servant of the chief priest , he took off his ear .
YLT	Matthew	26	52	Then saith Jesus to him , ` Turn back thy sword to its place ; for all who did take the sword , by the sword shall perish ;
YLT	Matthew	26	53	dost thou think that I am not able now to call upon my Father , and He will place beside me more than twelve legions of messengers ?
YLT	Matthew	26	54	how then may the Writings be fulfilled , that thus it behoveth to happen ? '
YLT	Matthew	26	55	In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes , ` As against a robber ye did come forth , with swords and sticks , to take me ! daily with you I was sitting teaching in the temple , and ye did not lay hold on me ;
YLT	Matthew	26	56	but all this hath come to pass , that the Writings of the prophets may be fulfilled ; ' then all the disciples , having left him , fled .
YLT	Matthew	26	57	And those laying hold on Jesus led [ him ] away unto Caiaphas the chief priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together ,
YLT	Matthew	26	58	and Peter was following him afar off , unto the court of the chief priest , and having gone in within , he was sitting with the officers , to see the end .
YLT	Matthew	26	59	And the chief priests , and the elders , and all the council , were seeking false witness against Jesus , that they might put him to death ,
YLT	Matthew	26	60	and they did not find ; and many false witnesses having come near , they did not find ; and at last two false witnesses having come near ,
YLT	Matthew	26	61	said , ` This one said , I am able to throw down the sanctuary of God , and after three days to build it . '
YLT	Matthew	26	62	And the chief priest having stood up , said to him , ` Nothing thou dost answer ! what do these witness against thee ?
YLT	Matthew	26	63	and Jesus was silent . And the chief priest answering said to him , ` I adjure thee , by the living God , that thou mayest say to us , if thou art the Christ -- the Son of God . '
YLT	Matthew	26	64	Jesus saith to him , ` Thou hast said ; nevertheless I say to you , hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power , and coming upon the clouds , of the heaven . '
YLT	Matthew	26	65	Then the chief priest rent his garments , saying , -- ` He hath spoken evil ; what need have we yet of witnesses ? lo , now ye heard his evil speaking ;
YLT	Matthew	26	66	what think ye ? ' and they answering said , ` He is worthy of death . '
YLT	Matthew	26	67	Then did they spit in his face and buffet him , and others did slap ,
YLT	Matthew	26	68	saying , ` Declare to us , O Christ , who he is that struck thee ? '
YLT	Matthew	26	69	And Peter without was sitting in the court , and there came near to him a certain maid , saying , ` And thou wast with Jesus of Galilee ! '
YLT	Matthew	26	70	And he denied before all , saying , ` I have not known what thou sayest . '
YLT	Matthew	26	71	And he having gone forth to the porch , another female saw him , and saith to those there , ` And this one was with Jesus of Nazareth ; '
YLT	Matthew	26	72	and again did he deny with an oath -- ` I have not known the man . '
YLT	Matthew	26	73	And after a little those standing near having come , said to Peter , ` Truly thou also art of them , for even thy speech doth make thee manifest . '
YLT	Matthew	26	74	Then began he to anathematise , and to swear -- ` I have not known the man ; ' and immediately did a cock crow ,
YLT	Matthew	26	75	and Peter remembered the saying of Jesus , he having said to him -- ` Before cock-crowing , thrice thou wilt deny me ; ' and having gone without , he did weep bitterly .
YLT	Matthew	27	27	then the soldiers of the governor having taken Jesus to the Praetorium , did gather to him all the band ;
YLT	Matthew	27	2	and having bound him , they did lead away , and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate , the governor .
YLT	Matthew	27	3	Then Judas -- he who delivered him up -- having seen that he was condemned , having repented , brought back the thirty silverlings to the chief priests , and to the elders , saying ,
YLT	Matthew	27	4	` I did sin , having delivered up innocent blood ; ' and they said , ` What -- to us ? thou shalt see ! '
YLT	Matthew	27	5	and having cast down the silverlings in the sanctuary , he departed , and having gone away , he did strangle himself .
YLT	Matthew	27	6	And the chief priests having taken the silverlings , said , ` It is not lawful to put them to the treasury , seeing it is the price of blood ; '
YLT	Matthew	27	7	and having taken counsel , they bought with them the field of the potter , for the burial of strangers ;
YLT	Matthew	27	8	therefore was that field called , ` Field of blood , ' unto this day .
YLT	Matthew	27	9	Then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the prophet , saying , ` And I took the thirty silverlings , the price of him who hath been priced , whom they of the sons of Israel did price ,
YLT	Matthew	27	10	and gave them for the field of the potter , as the Lord did appoint to me . '
YLT	Matthew	27	11	And Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor did question him , saying , ` Art thou the king of the Jews ! ' And Jesus said to him , ` Thou sayest . '
YLT	Matthew	27	12	And in his being accused by the chief priests and the elders , he did not answer any thing ,
YLT	Matthew	27	13	then saith Pilate to him , ` Dost thou not hear how many things they witness against thee ? '
YLT	Matthew	27	14	And he did not answer him , not even to one word , so that the governor did wonder greatly .
YLT	Matthew	27	15	And at the feast the governor had been accustomed to release one to the multitude , a prisoner , whom they willed ,
YLT	Matthew	27	16	and they had then a noted prisoner , called Barabbas ,
YLT	Matthew	27	17	they therefore having been gathered together , Pilate said to them , ` Whom will ye I shall release to you ? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ ? '
YLT	Matthew	27	18	for he had known that because of envy they had delivered him up .
YLT	Matthew	27	19	And as he is sitting on the tribunal , his wife sent unto him , saying , ` Nothing -- to thee and to that righteous one , for many things did I suffer to-day in a dream because of him . '
YLT	Matthew	27	20	And the chief priests and the elders did persuade the multitudes that they might ask for themselves Barabbas , and might destroy Jesus ;
YLT	Matthew	27	21	and the governor answering said to them , ` Which of the two will ye [ that ] I shall release to you ? ' And they said , ` Barabbas . '
YLT	Matthew	27	22	Pilate saith to them , ` What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? ' They all say to him , ` Let be crucified ! '
YLT	Matthew	27	23	And the governor said , ` Why , what evil did he ? ' and they were crying out the more , saying , ` Let be crucified . '
YLT	Matthew	27	24	And Pilate having seen that it profiteth nothing , but rather a tumult is made , having taken water , he did wash the hands before the multitude , saying , ` I am innocent from the blood of this righteous one ; ye -- ye shall see ; '
YLT	Matthew	27	25	and all the people answering said , ` His blood [ is ] upon us , and upon our children ! '
YLT	Matthew	27	26	Then did he release to them Barabbas , and having scourged Jesus , he delivered [ him ] up that he may be crucified ;
YLT	Matthew	27	28	and having unclothed him , they put around him a crimson cloak ,
YLT	Matthew	27	29	and having plaited him a crown out of thorns they put [ it ] on his head , and a reed in his right hand , and having kneeled before him , they were mocking him , saying , ` Hail , the king of the Jews . '
YLT	Matthew	27	30	And having spit on him , they took the reed , and were smiting on his head ;
YLT	Matthew	27	31	and when they had mocked him , they took off from him the cloak , and put on him his own garments , and led him away to crucify [ him ] .
YLT	Matthew	27	32	And coming forth , they found a man , a Cyrenian , by name Simon : him they impressed that he might bear his cross ;
YLT	Matthew	27	33	and having come to a place called Golgotha , that is called Place of a Skull ,
YLT	Matthew	27	34	they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall , and having tasted , he would not drink .
YLT	Matthew	27	35	And having crucified him , they divided his garments , casting a lot , that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the prophet , ` They divided my garments to themselves , and over my vesture they cast a lot ; '
YLT	Matthew	27	36	and sitting down , they were watching him there ,
YLT	Matthew	27	37	and they put up over his head , his accusation written , ` This is Jesus , the king of the Jews . '
YLT	Matthew	27	38	Then crucified with him are two robbers , one on the right hand , and one on the left ,
YLT	Matthew	27	39	and those passing by were speaking evil of him , wagging their heads ,
YLT	Matthew	27	40	and saying , ` Thou that art throwing down the sanctuary , and in three days building [ it ] , save thyself ; if Son thou art of God , come down from the cross . '
YLT	Matthew	27	41	And in like manner also the chief priests mocking , with the scribes and elders , said ,
YLT	Matthew	27	42	` Others he saved ; himself he is not able to save ! If he be King of Israel , let him come down now from the cross , and we will believe him ;
YLT	Matthew	27	43	he hath trusted on God , let Him now deliver him , if He wish him , because he said -- Son of God I am ; '
YLT	Matthew	27	44	with the same also the robbers , who were crucified with him , were reproaching him .
YLT	Matthew	27	45	And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land unto the ninth hour ,
YLT	Matthew	27	46	and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a great voice , saying , ` Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? ' that is , ` My God , my God , why didst Thou forsake me ? '
YLT	Matthew	27	47	And certain of those standing there having heard , said -- ` Elijah he doth call ; '
YLT	Matthew	27	48	and immediately , one of them having run , and having taken a spunge , having filled [ it ] with vinegar , and having put [ it ] on a reed , was giving him to drink ,
YLT	Matthew	27	49	but the rest said , ` Let alone , let us see if Elijah doth come -- about to save him . '
YLT	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus having again cried with a great voice , yielded the spirit ;
YLT	Matthew	27	51	and lo , the vail of the sanctuary was rent in two from top unto bottom , and the earth did quake , and the rocks were rent ,
YLT	Matthew	27	52	and the tombs were opened , and many bodies of the saints who have fallen asleep , arose ,
YLT	Matthew	27	53	and having come forth out of the tombs after his rising , they went into the holy city , and appeared to many .
YLT	Matthew	27	54	And the centurion , and those with him watching Jesus , having seen the earthquake , and the things that were done , were exceedingly afraid , saying , ` Truly this was God 's Son . '
YLT	Matthew	27	55	And there were there many women beholding from afar , who did follow Jesus from Galilee , ministering to him ,
YLT	Matthew	27	56	among whom was Mary the Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and of Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
YLT	Matthew	27	57	And evening having come , there came a rich man , from Arimathea , named Joseph , who also himself was discipled to Jesus ,
YLT	Matthew	27	58	he having gone near to Pilate , asked for himself the body of Jesus ; then Pilate commanded the body to be given back .
YLT	Matthew	27	59	And having taken the body , Joseph wrapped it in clean linen ,
YLT	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his new tomb , that he hewed in the rock , and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , he went away ;
YLT	Matthew	27	61	and there were there Mary the Magdalene , and the other Mary , sitting over-against the sepulchre .
YLT	Matthew	27	62	And on the morrow that is after the preparation , were gathered together the chief priests , and the Pharisees , unto Pilate ,
YLT	Matthew	27	63	saying , ` Sir , we have remembered that that deceiver said while yet living , After three days I do rise ;
YLT	Matthew	27	64	command , then , the sepulchre to be made secure till the third day , lest his disciples , having come by night , may steal him away , and may say to the people , He rose from the dead , and the last deceit shall be worse than the first . '
YLT	Matthew	27	65	And Pilate said to them , ` Ye have a watch , go away , make secure -- as ye have known ; '
YLT	Matthew	27	66	and they , having gone , did make the sepulchre secure , having sealed the stone , together with the watch .
YLT	Matthew	28	28	And on the eve of the sabbaths , at the dawn , toward the first of the sabbaths , came Mary the Magdalene , and the other Mary , to see the sepulchre ,
YLT	Matthew	28	2	and lo , there came a great earthquake , for a messenger of the Lord , having come down out of heaven , having come , did roll away the stone from the door , and was sitting upon it ,
YLT	Matthew	28	3	and his countenance was as lightning , and his clothing white as snow ,
YLT	Matthew	28	4	and from the fear of him did the keepers shake , and they became as dead men .
YLT	Matthew	28	5	And the messenger answering said to the women , ` Fear not ye , for I have known that Jesus , who hath been crucified , ye seek ;
YLT	Matthew	28	6	he is not here , for he rose , as he said ; come , see the place where the Lord was lying ;
YLT	Matthew	28	7	and having gone quickly , say ye to his disciples , that he rose from the dead ; and lo , he doth go before you to Galilee , there ye shall see him ; lo , I have told you . '
YLT	Matthew	28	8	And having gone forth quickly from the tomb , with fear and great joy , they ran to tell to his disciples ;
YLT	Matthew	28	9	and as they were going to tell to his disciples , then lo , Jesus met them , saying , ` Hail ! ' and they having come near , laid hold of his feet , and did bow to him .
YLT	Matthew	28	10	Then saith Jesus to them , ` Fear ye not , go away , tell to my brethren that they may go away to Galilee , and there they shall see me . '
YLT	Matthew	28	11	And while they are going on , lo , certain of the watch having come to the city , told to the chief priests all the things that happened ,
YLT	Matthew	28	12	and having been gathered together with the elders , counsel also having taken , they gave much money to the soldiers ,
YLT	Matthew	28	13	saying , ` Say ye , that his disciples having come by night , stole him -- we being asleep ;
YLT	Matthew	28	14	and if this be heard by the governor , we will persuade him , and you keep free from anxiety . '
YLT	Matthew	28	15	And they , having received the money , did as they were taught , and this account was spread abroad among Jews till this day .
YLT	Matthew	28	16	And the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mount where Jesus appointed them ,
YLT	Matthew	28	17	and having seen him , they bowed to him , but some did waver .
YLT	Matthew	28	18	And having come near , Jesus spake to them , saying , ` Given to me was all authority in heaven and on earth ;
YLT	Matthew	28	19	having gone , then , disciple all the nations , ( baptizing them -- to the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit ,
YLT	Matthew	28	20	teaching them to observe all , whatever I did command you , ) and lo , I am with you all the days -- till the full end of the age . '
YLT	Mark	1	1	A beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ , Son of God .
YLT	Mark	1	2	As it hath been written in the prophets , ` Lo , I send My messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee , ' --
YLT	Mark	1	3	` A voice of one calling in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , straight make ye his paths , ' --
YLT	Mark	1	4	John came baptizing in the wilderness , and proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins ,
YLT	Mark	1	5	and there were going forth to him all the region of Judea , and they of Jerusalem , and they were all baptized by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
YLT	Mark	1	6	And John was clothed with camel 's hair , and a girdle of skin around his loins , and eating locusts and honey of the field ,
YLT	Mark	1	7	and he proclaimed , saying , ` He doth come -- who is mightier than I -- after me , of whom I am not worthy -- having stooped down -- to loose the latchet of his sandals ;
YLT	Mark	1	8	I indeed did baptize you with water , but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit . '
YLT	Mark	1	9	And it came to pass in those days , Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized by John at the Jordan ;
YLT	Mark	1	10	and immediately coming up from the water , he saw the heavens dividing , and the Spirit as a dove coming down upon him ;
YLT	Mark	1	11	and a voice came out of the heavens , ` Thou art My Son -- the Beloved , in whom I did delight . '
YLT	Mark	1	12	And immediately doth the Spirit put him forth to the wilderness ,
YLT	Mark	1	13	and he was there in the wilderness forty days , being tempted by the Adversary , and he was with the beasts , and the messengers were ministering to him .
YLT	Mark	1	14	And after the delivering up of John , Jesus came to Galilee , proclaiming the good news of the reign of God ,
YLT	Mark	1	15	and saying -- ` Fulfilled hath been the time , and the reign of God hath come nigh , reform ye , and believe in the good news . '
YLT	Mark	1	16	And , walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon , and Andrew his brother , casting a drag into the sea , for they were fishers ,
YLT	Mark	1	17	and Jesus said to them , ` Come ye after me , and I shall make you to become fishers of men ; '
YLT	Mark	1	18	and immediately , having left their nets , they followed him .
YLT	Mark	1	19	And having gone on thence a little , he saw James of Zebedee , and John his brother , and they were in the boat refitting the nets ,
YLT	Mark	1	20	and immediately he called them , and , having left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , they went away after him .
YLT	Mark	1	21	And they go on to Capernaum , and immediately , on the sabbaths , having gone into the synagogue , he was teaching ,
YLT	Mark	1	22	and they were astonished at his teaching , for he was teaching them as having authority , and not as the scribes .
YLT	Mark	1	23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit , and he cried out ,
YLT	Mark	1	24	saying , ` Away ! what -- to us and to thee , Jesus the Nazarene ? thou didst come to destroy us ; I have known thee who thou art -- the Holy One of God . '
YLT	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , ` Be silenced , and come forth out of him , '
YLT	Mark	1	26	and the unclean spirit having torn him , and having cried with a great voice , came forth out of him ,
YLT	Mark	1	27	and they were all amazed , so as to reason among themselves , saying , ` What is this ? what new teaching [ is ] this ? that with authority also the unclean spirits he commandeth , and they obey him ! '
YLT	Mark	1	28	And the fame of him went forth immediately to all the region , round about , of Galilee .
YLT	Mark	1	29	And immediately , having come forth out of the synagogue , they went to the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John ,
YLT	Mark	1	30	and the mother-in-law of Simon was lying fevered , and immediately they tell him about her ,
YLT	Mark	1	31	and having come near , he raised her up , having laid hold of her hand , and the fever left her immediately , and she was ministering to them .
YLT	Mark	1	32	And evening having come , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all who were ill , and who were demoniacs ,
YLT	Mark	1	33	and the whole city was gathered together near the door ,
YLT	Mark	1	34	and he healed many who were ill of manifold diseases , and many demons he cast forth , and was not suffering the demons to speak , because they knew him .
YLT	Mark	1	35	And very early , it being yet night , having risen , he went forth , and went away to a desert place , and was there praying ;
YLT	Mark	1	36	and Simon and those with him went in quest of him ,
YLT	Mark	1	37	and having found him , they say to him , -- ` All do seek thee ; '
YLT	Mark	1	38	and he saith to them , ` We may go to the next towns , that there also I may preach , for for this I came forth . '
YLT	Mark	1	39	And he was preaching in their synagogues , in all Galilee , and is casting out the demons ,
YLT	Mark	1	40	and there doth come to him a leper , calling on him , and kneeling to him , and saying to him -- ` If thou mayest will , thou art able to cleanse me . '
YLT	Mark	1	41	And Jesus having been moved with compassion , having stretched forth the hand , touched him , and saith to him , ` I will ; be thou cleansed ; '
YLT	Mark	1	42	and he having spoken , immediately the leprosy went away from him , and he was cleansed .
YLT	Mark	1	43	And having sternly charged him , immediately he put him forth ,
YLT	Mark	1	44	and saith to him , ` See thou mayest say nothing to any one , but go away , thyself shew to the priest , and bring near for thy cleansing the things Moses directed , for a testimony to them . '
YLT	Mark	1	45	And he , having gone forth , began to proclaim much , and to spread abroad the thing , so that no more he was able openly to enter into the city , but he was without in desert places , and they were coming unto him from every quarter .
YLT	Mark	2	2	and immediately many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even at the door , and he was speaking to them the word .
YLT	Mark	2	3	And they come unto him , bringing a paralytic , borne by four ,
YLT	Mark	2	4	and not being able to come near to him because of the multitude , they uncovered the roof where he was , and , having broken [ it ] up , they let down the couch on which the paralytic was lying ,
YLT	Mark	2	5	and Jesus having seen their faith , saith to the paralytic , ` Child , thy sins have been forgiven thee . '
YLT	Mark	2	6	And there were certain of the scribes there sitting , and reasoning in their hearts ,
YLT	Mark	2	7	` Why doth this one thus speak evil words ? who is able to forgive sins except one -- God ? '
YLT	Mark	2	8	And immediately Jesus , having known in his spirit that they thus reason in themselves , said to them , ` Why these things reason ye in your hearts ?
YLT	Mark	2	9	which is easier , to say to the paralytic , The sins have been forgiven to thee ? or to say , Rise , and take up thy couch , and walk ?
YLT	Mark	2	10	` And , that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority on the earth to forgive sins -- ( he saith to the paralytic ) --
YLT	Mark	2	11	I say to thee , Rise , and take up thy couch , and go away to thy house ; '
YLT	Mark	2	12	and he rose immediately , and having taken up the couch , he went forth before all , so that all were astonished , and do glorify God , saying -- ` Never thus did we see . '
YLT	Mark	2	13	And he went forth again by the sea , and all the multitude was coming unto him , and he was teaching them ,
YLT	Mark	2	14	and passing by , he saw Levi of Alpheus sitting at the tax-office , and saith to him , ` Be following me , ' and he , having risen , did follow him .
YLT	Mark	2	15	And it came to pass , in his reclining ( at meat ) in his house , that many tax-gatherers and sinners were reclining ( at meat ) with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many , and they followed him .
YLT	Mark	2	16	And the scribes and the Pharisees , having seen him eating with the tax-gatherers and sinners , said to his disciples , ` Why -- that with the tax-gatherers and sinners he doth eat and drink ? '
YLT	Mark	2	17	And Jesus , having heard , saith to them , ` They who are strong have no need of a physician , but they who are ill ; I came not to call righteous men , but sinners to reformation . '
YLT	Mark	2	18	And the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were fasting , and they come and say to him , ` Wherefore do the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast , and thy disciples do not fast ? '
YLT	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said to them , ` Are the sons of the bride-chamber able , while the bridegroom is with them , to fast ? so long time as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast ;
YLT	Mark	2	20	but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them , and then they shall fast -- in those days .
YLT	Mark	2	21	` And no one a patch of undressed cloth doth sew on an old garment , and if not -- the new filling it up doth take from the old and the rent doth become worse ;
YLT	Mark	2	22	and no one doth put new wine into old skins , and if not -- the new wine doth burst the skins , and the wine is poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but new wine into new skins is to be put . '
YLT	Mark	2	23	And it came to pass -- he is going along on the sabbaths through the corn-fields -- and his disciples began to make a way , plucking the ears ,
YLT	Mark	2	24	and the Pharisees said to him , ` Lo , why do they on the sabbaths that which is not lawful ? '
YLT	Mark	2	25	And he said to them , ` Did ye never read what David did , when he had need and was hungry , he and those with him ?
YLT	Mark	2	26	how he went into the house of God , ( at ` Abiathar the chief priest , ' ) and the loaves of the presentation did eat , which it is not lawful to eat , except to the priests , and he gave also to those who were with him ? '
YLT	Mark	2	27	And he said to them , ` The sabbath for man was made , not man for the sabbath ,
YLT	Mark	2	28	so that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath . '
YLT	Mark	3	3	And he saith to the man having the hand withered , ` Rise up in the midst . '
YLT	Mark	3	2	and they were watching him , whether on the sabbaths he will heal him , that they might accuse him .
YLT	Mark	3	4	And he saith to them , ` Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good , or to do evil ? life to save , or to kill ? ' but they were silent .
YLT	Mark	3	5	And having looked round upon them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their heart , he saith to the man , ` Stretch forth thy hand ; ' and he stretched forth , and his hand was restored whole as the other ;
YLT	Mark	3	6	and the Pharisees having gone forth , immediately , with the Herodians , were taking counsel against him how they might destroy him .
YLT	Mark	3	7	And Jesus withdrew with his disciples unto the sea , and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judea ,
YLT	Mark	3	8	and from Jerusalem , and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon -- a great multitude -- having heard how great things he was doing , came unto him .
YLT	Mark	3	9	And he said to his disciples that a little boat may wait on him , because of the multitude , that they may not press upon him ,
YLT	Mark	3	10	for he did heal many , so that they threw themselves on him , in order to touch him -- as many as had plagues ;
YLT	Mark	3	11	and the unclean spirits , when they were seeing him , were falling down before him , and were crying , saying -- ` Thou art the Son of God ; '
YLT	Mark	3	12	and many times he was charging them that they might not make him manifest .
YLT	Mark	3	13	And he goeth up to the mountain , and doth call near whom he willed , and they went away to him ;
YLT	Mark	3	14	and he appointed twelve , that they may be with him , and that he may send them forth to preach ,
YLT	Mark	3	15	and to have power to heal the sicknesses , and to cast out the demons .
YLT	Mark	3	16	And he put on Simon the name Peter ;
YLT	Mark	3	17	and James of Zebedee , and John the brother of James , and he put on them names -- Boanerges , that is , ` Sons of thunder ; '
YLT	Mark	3	18	and Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James of Alpheus , and Thaddeus , and Simon the Cananite ,
YLT	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot , who did also deliver him up ; and they come into a house .
YLT	Mark	3	20	And come together again doth a multitude , so that they are not able even to eat bread ;
YLT	Mark	3	21	and his friends having heard , went forth to lay hold on him , for they said that he was beside himself ,
YLT	Mark	3	22	and the scribes who [ are ] from Jerusalem having come down , said -- ` He hath Beelzeboul , ' and -- ` By the ruler of the demons he doth cast out the demons . '
YLT	Mark	3	23	And , having called them near , in similes he said to them , ` How is the Adversary able to cast out the Adversary ?
YLT	Mark	3	24	and if a kingdom against itself be divided , that kingdom can not be made to stand ;
YLT	Mark	3	25	and if a house against itself be divided , that house can not be made to stand ;
YLT	Mark	3	26	and if the Adversary did rise against himself , and hath been divided , he can not be made to stand , but hath an end .
YLT	Mark	3	27	` No one is able the vessels of the strong man -- having entered into his house -- to spoil , if first he may not bind the strong man , and then his house he will spoil .
YLT	Mark	3	28	` Verily I say to you , that all the sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men , and evil speakings with which they might speak evil ,
YLT	Mark	3	29	but whoever may speak evil in regard to the Holy Spirit hath not forgiveness -- to the age , but is in danger of age-during judgment ; '
YLT	Mark	3	30	because they said , ` He hath an unclean spirit . '
YLT	Mark	3	31	Then come do his brethren and mother , and standing without , they sent unto him , calling him ,
YLT	Mark	3	32	and a multitude was sitting about him , and they said to him , ` Lo , thy mother and thy brethren without do seek thee . '
YLT	Mark	3	33	And he answered them , saying , ` Who is my mother , or my brethren ? '
YLT	Mark	3	34	And having looked round in a circle to those sitting about him , he saith , ` Lo , my mother and my brethren !
YLT	Mark	3	35	for whoever may do the will of God , he is my brother , and my sister , and mother . '
YLT	Mark	4	4	and it came to pass , in the sowing , some fell by the way , and the fowls of the heaven did come and devour it ;
YLT	Mark	4	2	and he taught them many things in similes , and he said to them in his teaching :
YLT	Mark	4	3	` Hearken , lo , the sower went forth to sow ;
YLT	Mark	4	5	and other fell upon the rocky ground , where it had not much earth , and immediately it sprang forth , because of not having depth of earth ,
YLT	Mark	4	6	and the sun having risen , it was scorched , and because of not having root it did wither ;
YLT	Mark	4	7	and other fell toward the thorns , and the thorns did come up , and choke it , and fruit it gave not ;
YLT	Mark	4	8	and other fell to the good ground , and was giving fruit , coming up and increasing , and it bare , one thirty-fold , and one sixty , and one an hundred . '
YLT	Mark	4	9	And he said to them , ` He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear . '
YLT	Mark	4	10	And when he was alone , those about him , with the twelve , did ask him of the simile ,
YLT	Mark	4	11	and he said to them , ` To you it hath been given to know the secret of the reign of God , but to those who are without , in similes are all the things done ;
YLT	Mark	4	12	that seeing they may see and not perceive , and hearing they may hear and not understand , lest they may turn , and the sins may be forgiven them . '
YLT	Mark	4	13	And he saith to them , ` Have ye not known this simile ? and how shall ye know all the similes ?
YLT	Mark	4	14	He who is sowing doth sow the word ;
YLT	Mark	4	15	and these are they by the way where the word is sown : and whenever they may hear , immediately cometh the Adversary , and he taketh away the word that hath been sown in their hearts .
YLT	Mark	4	16	` And these are they , in like manner , who on the rocky ground are sown : who , whenever they may hear the word , immediately with joy do receive it ,
YLT	Mark	4	17	and have not root in themselves , but are temporary ; afterward tribulation or persecution having come because of the word , immediately they are stumbled .
YLT	Mark	4	18	` And these are they who toward the thorns are sown : these are they who are hearing the word ,
YLT	Mark	4	19	and the anxieties of this age , and the deceitfulness of the riches , and the desires concerning the other things , entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful .
YLT	Mark	4	20	` And these are they who on the good ground have been sown : who do hear the word , and receive , and do bear fruit , one thirty-fold , and one sixty , and one an hundred . '
YLT	Mark	4	21	And he said to them , ` Doth the lamp come that under the measure it may be put , or under the couch -- not that it may be put on the lamp-stand ?
YLT	Mark	4	22	for there is not anything hid that may not be manifested , nor was anything kept hid but that it may come to light .
YLT	Mark	4	23	If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear . '
YLT	Mark	4	24	And he said to them , ` Take heed what ye hear ; in what measure ye measure , it shall be measured to you ; and to you who hear it shall be added ;
YLT	Mark	4	25	for whoever may have , there shall be given to him , and whoever hath not , also that which he hath shall be taken from him . '
YLT	Mark	4	26	And he said , ` Thus is the reign of God : as if a man may cast the seed on the earth ,
YLT	Mark	4	27	and may sleep , and may rise night and day , and the seed spring up and grow , he hath not known how ;
YLT	Mark	4	28	for of itself doth the earth bear fruit , first a blade , afterwards an ear , afterwards full corn in the ear ;
YLT	Mark	4	29	and whenever the fruit may yield itself , immediately he doth send forth the sickle , because the harvest hath come . '
YLT	Mark	4	30	And he said , ` To what may we liken the reign of God , or in what simile may we compare it ?
YLT	Mark	4	31	As a grain of mustard , which , whenever it may be sown on the earth , is less than any of the seeds that are on the earth ;
YLT	Mark	4	32	and whenever it may be sown , it cometh up , and doth become greater than any of the herbs , and doth make great branches , so that under its shade the fowls of the heaven are able to rest . '
YLT	Mark	4	33	And with many such similes he was speaking to them the word , as they were able to hear ,
YLT	Mark	4	34	and without a simile he was not speaking to them , and by themselves , to his disciples he was expounding all .
YLT	Mark	4	35	And he saith to them on that day , evening having come , ` We may pass over to the other side ; '
YLT	Mark	4	36	and having let away the multitude , they take him up as he was in the boat , and other little boats also were with him .
YLT	Mark	4	37	And there cometh a great storm of wind , and the waves were beating on the boat , so that it is now being filled ,
YLT	Mark	4	38	and he himself was upon the stern , upon the pillow sleeping , and they wake him up , and say to him , ` Teacher , art thou not caring that we perish ? '
YLT	Mark	4	39	And having waked up , he rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , ` Peace , be stilled ; ' and the wind did lull , and there was a great calm :
YLT	Mark	4	40	and he said to them , ` Why are ye so fearful ? how have ye not faith ? '
YLT	Mark	4	41	and they feared a great fear , and said one to another , ` Who , then , is this , that even the wind and the sea do obey him ? '
YLT	Mark	5	5	and always , night and day , in the mountains , and in the tombs he was , crying and cutting himself with stones .
YLT	Mark	5	2	and he having come forth out of the boat , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
YLT	Mark	5	3	who had his dwelling in the tombs , and not even with chains was any one able to bind him ,
YLT	Mark	5	4	because that he many times with fetters and chains had been bound , and pulled in pieces by him had been the chains , and the fetters broken in pieces , and none was able to tame him ,
YLT	Mark	5	6	And , having seen Jesus from afar , he ran and bowed before him ,
YLT	Mark	5	7	and having called with a loud voice , he said , ` What -- to me and to thee , Jesus , Son of God the Most High ? I adjure thee by God , mayest thou not afflict me ! '
YLT	Mark	5	8	( for he said to him , ` Come forth , spirit unclean , out of the man , ' )
YLT	Mark	5	9	and he was questioning him , ` What [ is ] thy name ? ' and he answered , saying , ` Legion [ is ] my name , because we are many ; '
YLT	Mark	5	10	and he was calling on him much , that he may not send them out of the region .
YLT	Mark	5	11	And there was there , near the mountains , a great herd of swine feeding ,
YLT	Mark	5	12	and all the demons did call upon him , saying , ` Send us to the swine , that into them we may enter ; '
YLT	Mark	5	13	and immediately Jesus gave them leave , and having come forth , the unclean spirits did enter into the swine , and the herd did rush down the steep place to the sea -- and they were about two thousand -- and they were choked in the sea .
YLT	Mark	5	14	And those feeding the swine did flee , and told in the city , and in the fields , and they came forth to see what it is that hath been done ;
YLT	Mark	5	15	and they come unto Jesus , and see the demoniac , sitting , and clothed , and right-minded -- him having had the legion -- and they were afraid ;
YLT	Mark	5	16	and those having seen [ it ] , declared to them how it had come to pass to the demoniac , and about the swine ;
YLT	Mark	5	17	and they began to call upon him to go away from their borders .
YLT	Mark	5	18	And he having gone into the boat , the demoniac was calling on him that he may be with him ,
YLT	Mark	5	19	and Jesus did not suffer him , but saith to him , ` Go away to thy house , unto thine own [ friends ] , and tell them how great things the Lord did to thee , and dealt kindly with thee ;
YLT	Mark	5	20	and he went away , and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus did to him , and all were wondering .
YLT	Mark	5	21	And Jesus having passed over in the boat again to the other side , there was gathered a great multitude to him , and he was near the sea ,
YLT	Mark	5	22	and lo , there doth come one of the chiefs of the synagogue , by name Jairus , and having seen him , he doth fall at his feet ,
YLT	Mark	5	23	and he was calling upon him much , saying -- ` My little daughter is at the last extremity -- that having come , thou mayest lay on her [ thy ] hands , so that she may be saved , and she shall live ; '
YLT	Mark	5	24	and he went away with him . And there was following him a great multitude , and they were thronging him ,
YLT	Mark	5	25	and a certain woman , having an issue of blood twelve years ,
YLT	Mark	5	26	and many things having suffered under many physicians , and having spent all that she had , and having profited nothing , but rather having come to the worse ,
YLT	Mark	5	27	having heard about Jesus , having come in the multitude behind , she touched his garment ,
YLT	Mark	5	28	for she said -- ` If even his garments I may touch , I shall be saved ; '
YLT	Mark	5	29	and immediately was the fountain of her blood dried up , and she knew in the body that she hath been healed of the plague .
YLT	Mark	5	30	And immediately Jesus having known in himself that out of him power had gone forth , having turned about in the multitude , said , ` Who did touch my garments ? '
YLT	Mark	5	31	and his disciples said to him , ` Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and thou sayest , ` Who did touch me ! '
YLT	Mark	5	32	And he was looking round to see her who did this ,
YLT	Mark	5	33	and the woman , having been afraid , and trembling , knowing what was done on her , came , and fell down before him , and told him all the truth ,
YLT	Mark	5	34	and he said to her , ` Daughter , thy faith hath saved thee ; go away in peace , and be whole from thy plague . '
YLT	Mark	5	35	As he is yet speaking , there come from the chief of the synagogue 's [ house , certain ] , saying -- ` Thy daughter did die , why still dost thou harass the Teacher ? '
YLT	Mark	5	36	And Jesus immediately , having heard the word that is spoken , saith to the chief of the synagogue , ` Be not afraid , only believe . '
YLT	Mark	5	37	And he did not suffer any one to follow with him , except Peter , and James , and John the brother of James ;
YLT	Mark	5	38	and he cometh to the house of the chief of the synagogue , and seeth a tumult , much weeping and wailing ;
YLT	Mark	5	39	and having gone in he saith to them , ` Why do ye make a tumult , and weep ? the child did not die , but doth sleep ;
YLT	Mark	5	40	and they were laughing at him . And he , having put all forth , doth take the father of the child , and the mother , and those with him , and goeth in where the child is lying ,
YLT	Mark	5	41	and , having taken the hand of the child , he saith to her , ` Talitha cumi ; ' which is , being interpreted , ` Damsel ( I say to thee ) , arise . '
YLT	Mark	5	42	And immediately the damsel arose , and was walking , for she was twelve years [ old ] ; and they were amazed with a great amazement ,
YLT	Mark	5	43	and he charged them much , that no one may know this thing , and he said that there be given to her to eat .
YLT	Mark	6	6	and he wondered because of their unbelief . And he was going round the villages , in a circle , teaching ,
YLT	Mark	6	2	and sabbath having come , he began in the synagogue to teach , and many hearing were astonished , saying , ` Whence hath this one these things ? and what the wisdom that was given to him , that also such mighty works through his hands are done ?
YLT	Mark	6	3	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and brother of James , and Joses , and Judas , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? ' -- and they were being stumbled at him .
YLT	Mark	6	4	And Jesus said to them -- ` A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his kindred , and in his own house ; '
YLT	Mark	6	5	and he was not able there any mighty work to do , except on a few infirm people having put hands he did heal [ them ] ;
YLT	Mark	6	7	and he doth call near the twelve , and he began to send them forth two by two , and he was giving them power over the unclean spirits ,
YLT	Mark	6	8	and he commanded them that they may take nothing for the way , except a staff only -- no scrip , no bread , no brass in the girdle ,
YLT	Mark	6	9	but having been shod with sandals , and ye may not put on two coats .
YLT	Mark	6	10	And he said to them , ` Whenever ye may enter into a house , there remain till ye may depart thence ,
YLT	Mark	6	11	and as many as may not receive you , nor hear you , going out thence , shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony to them ; verily I say to you , It shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in a day of judgment than for that city . '
YLT	Mark	6	12	And having gone forth they were preaching that [ men ] might reform ,
YLT	Mark	6	13	and many demons they were casting out , and they were anointing with oil many infirm , and they were healing [ them ] .
YLT	Mark	6	14	And the king Herod heard , ( for his name became public , ) and he said -- ` John the Baptist out of the dead was raised , and because of this the mighty powers are working in him . '
YLT	Mark	6	15	Others said -- ` It is Elijah , ' and others said -- ` It is a prophet , or as one of the prophets . '
YLT	Mark	6	16	And Herod having heard , said -- ` He whom I did behead -- John -- this is he ; he was raised out of the dead . '
YLT	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself , having sent forth , did lay hold on John , and bound him in the prison , because of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother , because he married her ,
YLT	Mark	6	18	for John said to Herod -- ` It is not lawful to thee to have the wife of thy brother ; '
YLT	Mark	6	19	and Herodias was having a quarrel with him , and was willing to kill him , and was not able ,
YLT	Mark	6	20	for Herod was fearing John , knowing him a man righteous and holy , and was keeping watch over him , and having heard him , was doing many things , and hearing him gladly .
YLT	Mark	6	21	And a seasonable day having come , when Herod on his birthday was making a supper to his great men , and to the chiefs of thousands , and to the first men of Galilee ,
YLT	Mark	6	22	and the daughter of that Herodias having come in , and having danced , and having pleased Herod and those reclining ( at meat ) with him , the king said to the damsel , ` Ask of me whatever thou wilt , and I will give to thee , '
YLT	Mark	6	23	and he sware to her -- ` Whatever thou mayest ask me , I will give to thee -- unto the half of my kingdom . '
YLT	Mark	6	24	And she , having gone forth , said to her mother , ` What shall I ask for myself ? ' and she said , ` The head of John the Baptist ; '
YLT	Mark	6	25	and having come in immediately with haste unto the king , she asked , saying , ` I will that thou mayest give me presently , upon a plate , the head of John the Baptist . '
YLT	Mark	6	26	And the king -- made very sorrowful -- because of the oaths and of those reclining ( at meat ) with him , would not put her away ,
YLT	Mark	6	27	and immediately the king having sent a guardsman , did command his head to be brought ,
YLT	Mark	6	28	and he having gone , beheaded him in the prison , and brought his head upon a plate , and did give it to the damsel , and the damsel did give it to her mother ;
YLT	Mark	6	29	and having heard , his disciples came and took up his corpse , and laid it in the tomb .
YLT	Mark	6	30	And the apostles are gathered together unto Jesus , and they told him all , and how many things they did , and how many things they taught ,
YLT	Mark	6	31	and he said to them , ` Come ye yourselves apart to a desert place , and rest a little , ' for those coming and those going were many , and not even to eat had they opportunity ,
YLT	Mark	6	32	and they went away to a desert place , in the boat , by themselves .
YLT	Mark	6	33	And the multitudes saw them going away , and many recognised him , and by land from all the cities they ran thither , and went before them , and came together to him ,
YLT	Mark	6	34	and having come forth , Jesus saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion on them , that they were as sheep not having a shepherd , and he began to teach many things .
YLT	Mark	6	35	And now the hour being advanced , his disciples having come near to him , say , -- ` The place is desolate , and the hour is now advanced ,
YLT	Mark	6	36	let them away , that , having gone away to the surrounding fields and villages , they may buy to themselves loaves , for what they may eat they have not . '
YLT	Mark	6	37	And he answering said to them , ` Give ye them to eat , ' and they say to him , ` Having gone away , may we buy two hundred denaries ' worth of loaves , and give to them to eat ? '
YLT	Mark	6	38	And he saith to them , ` How many loaves have ye ? go and see ; ' and having known , they say , ` Five , and two fishes . '
YLT	Mark	6	39	And he commanded them to make all recline in companies upon the green grass ,
YLT	Mark	6	40	and they sat down in squares , by hundreds , and by fifties .
YLT	Mark	6	41	And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes , having looked up to the heaven , he blessed , and brake the loaves , and was giving to his disciples , that they may set before them , and the two fishes divided he to all ,
YLT	Mark	6	42	and they did all eat , and were filled ,
YLT	Mark	6	43	and they took up of broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full , and of the fishes ,
YLT	Mark	6	44	and those eating of the loaves were about five thousand men .
YLT	Mark	6	45	And immediately he constrained his disciples to go into the boat , and to go before to the other side , unto Bethsaida , till he may let the multitude away ,
YLT	Mark	6	46	and having taken leave of them , he went away to the mountain to pray .
YLT	Mark	6	47	And evening having come , the boat was in the midst of the sea , and he alone upon the land ;
YLT	Mark	6	48	and he saw them harassed in the rowing , for the wind was against them , and about the fourth watch of the night he doth come to them walking on the sea , and wished to pass by them .
YLT	Mark	6	49	And they having seen him walking on the sea , thought [ it ] to be an apparition , and cried out ,
YLT	Mark	6	50	for they all saw him , and were troubled , and immediately he spake with them , and saith to them , ` Take courage , I am [ he ] , be not afraid . '
YLT	Mark	6	51	And he went up unto them to the boat , and the wind lulled , and greatly out of measure were they amazed in themselves , and were wondering ,
YLT	Mark	6	52	for they understood not concerning the loaves , for their heart hath been hard .
YLT	Mark	6	53	And having passed over , they came upon the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore ,
YLT	Mark	6	54	and they having come forth out of the boat , immediately having recognised him ,
YLT	Mark	6	55	having run about through all that region round about , they began upon the couches to carry about those ill , where they were hearing that he is ,
YLT	Mark	6	56	and wherever he was going , to villages , or cities , or fields , in the market-places they were laying the infirm , and were calling upon him , that they may touch if it were but the fringe of his garment , and as many as were touching him were saved .
YLT	Mark	7	7	and in vain do they worship Me , teaching teachings , commands of men ;
YLT	Mark	7	2	and having seen certain of his disciples with defiled hands -- that is , unwashed -- eating bread , they found fault ;
YLT	Mark	7	3	for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , if they do not wash the hands to the wrist , do not eat , holding the tradition of the elders ,
YLT	Mark	7	4	and , [ coming ] from the market-place , if they do not baptize themselves , they do not eat ; and many other things there are that they received to hold , baptisms of cups , and pots , and brazen vessels , and couches .
YLT	Mark	7	5	Then question him do the Pharisees and the scribes , ` Wherefore do thy disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders , but with unwashed hands do eat the bread ? '
YLT	Mark	7	6	and he answering said to them -- ` Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you , hypocrites , as it hath been written , This people with the lips doth honor Me , and their heart is far from Me ;
YLT	Mark	7	8	for , having put away the command of God , ye hold the tradition of men , baptisms of pots and cups ; and many other such like things ye do . '
YLT	Mark	7	9	And he said to them , ` Well do ye put away the command of God that your tradition ye may keep ;
YLT	Mark	7	10	for Moses said , Honour thy father and thy mother ; and , He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death ;
YLT	Mark	7	11	and ye say , If a man may say to father or to mother , Korban ( that is , a gift ) , [ is ] whatever thou mayest be profited out of mine ,
YLT	Mark	7	12	and no more do ye suffer him to do anything for his father or for his mother ,
YLT	Mark	7	13	setting aside the word of God for your tradition that ye delivered ; and many such like things ye do . '
YLT	Mark	7	14	And having called near all the multitude , he said to them , ` Hearken to me , ye all , and understand ;
YLT	Mark	7	15	there is nothing from without the man entering into him that is able to defile him , but the things coming out from him , those are the things defiling the man .
YLT	Mark	7	16	If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear . '
YLT	Mark	7	17	And when he entered into a house from the multitude , his disciples were questioning him about the simile ,
YLT	Mark	7	18	and he saith to them , ` So also ye are without understanding ! Do ye not perceive that nothing from without entering into the man is able to defile him ?
YLT	Mark	7	19	because it doth not enter into his heart , but into the belly , and into the drain it doth go out , purifying all the meats . '
YLT	Mark	7	20	And he said -- ` That which is coming out from the man , that doth defile the man ;
YLT	Mark	7	21	for from within , out of the heart of men , the evil reasonings do come forth , adulteries , whoredoms , murders ,
YLT	Mark	7	22	thefts , covetous desires , wickedness , deceit , arrogance , an evil eye , evil speaking , pride , foolishness ;
YLT	Mark	7	23	all these evils do come forth from within , and they defile the man . '
YLT	Mark	7	24	And from thence having risen , he went away to the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and having entered into the house , he wished none to know , and he was not able to be hid ,
YLT	Mark	7	25	for a woman having heard about him , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having come , fell at his feet , --
YLT	Mark	7	26	and the woman was a Greek , a Syro-Phenician by nation -- and was asking him , that the demon he may cast forth out of her daughter .
YLT	Mark	7	27	And Jesus said to her , ` Suffer first the children to be filled , for it is not good to take the children 's bread , and to cast [ it ] to the little dogs . '
YLT	Mark	7	28	And she answered and saith to him , ` Yes , sir ; for the little dogs also under the table do eat of the children 's crumbs . '
YLT	Mark	7	29	And he said to her , ` Because of this word go ; the demon hath gone forth out of thy daughter ; '
YLT	Mark	7	30	and having come away to her house , she found the demon gone forth , and the daughter laid upon the couch .
YLT	Mark	7	31	And again , having gone forth from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , he came unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis ,
YLT	Mark	7	32	and they bring to him a deaf , stuttering man , and they call on him that he may put the hand on him .
YLT	Mark	7	33	And having taken him away from the multitude by himself , he put his fingers to his ears , and having spit , he touched his tongue ,
YLT	Mark	7	34	and having looked to the heaven , he sighed , and saith to him , ` Ephphatha , ' that is , ` Be thou opened ; '
YLT	Mark	7	35	and immediately were his ears opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he was speaking plain .
YLT	Mark	7	36	And he charged them that they may tell no one , but the more he was charging them , the more abundantly they were proclaiming [ it ] ,
YLT	Mark	7	37	and they were being beyond measure astonished , saying , ` Well hath he done all things ; both the deaf he doth make to hear , and the dumb to speak . '
YLT	Mark	8	8	and they did eat and were filled , and they took up that which was over of broken pieces -- seven baskets ;
YLT	Mark	8	2	` I have compassion upon the multitude , because now three days they do continue with me , and they have not what they may eat ;
YLT	Mark	8	3	and if I shall let them away fasting to their home , they will faint in the way , for certain of them are come from far . '
YLT	Mark	8	4	And his disciples answered him , ` Whence shall any one be able these here to feed with bread in a wilderness ? '
YLT	Mark	8	5	And he was questioning them , ` How many loaves have ye ? ' and they said , ` Seven . '
YLT	Mark	8	6	And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground , and having taken the seven loaves , having given thanks , he brake , and was giving to his disciples that they may set before [ them ] ; and they did set before the multitude .
YLT	Mark	8	7	And they had a few small fishes , and having blessed , he said to set them also before [ them ] ;
YLT	Mark	8	9	and those eating were about four thousand . And he let them away ,
YLT	Mark	8	10	and immediately having entered into the boat with his disciples , he came to the parts of Dalmanutha ,
YLT	Mark	8	11	and the Pharisees came forth , and began to dispute with him , seeking from him a sign from the heaven , tempting him ;
YLT	Mark	8	12	and having sighed deeply in his spirit , he saith , ` Why doth this generation seek after a sign ? Verily I say to you , no sign shall be given to this generation . '
YLT	Mark	8	13	And having left them , having entered again into the boat , he went away to the other side ;
YLT	Mark	8	14	and they forgot to take loaves , and except one loaf they had nothing with them in the boat ,
YLT	Mark	8	15	and he was charging them , saying , ` Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod , '
YLT	Mark	8	16	and they were reasoning with one another , saying -- ` Because we have no loaves . '
YLT	Mark	8	17	And Jesus having known , saith to them , ` Why do ye reason , because ye have no loaves ? do ye not yet perceive , nor understand , yet have ye your heart hardened ?
YLT	Mark	8	18	Having eyes , do ye not see ? and having ears , do ye not hear ? and do ye not remember ?
YLT	Mark	8	19	When the five loaves I did brake to the five thousand , how many hand-baskets full of broken pieces took ye up ? ' they say to him , ` Twelve . '
YLT	Mark	8	20	` And when the seven to the four thousand , how many hand-baskets full of broken pieces took ye up ? ' and they said , ` Seven . '
YLT	Mark	8	21	And he said to them , ` How do ye not understand ? '
YLT	Mark	8	22	And he cometh to Bethsaida , and they bring to him one blind , and call upon him that he may touch him ,
YLT	Mark	8	23	and having taken the hand of the blind man , he led him forth without the village , and having spit on his eyes , having put [ his ] hands on him , he was questioning him if he doth behold anything :
YLT	Mark	8	24	and he , having looked up , said , ` I behold men , as I see trees , walking . '
YLT	Mark	8	25	Afterwards again he put [ his ] hands on his eyes , and made him look up , and he was restored , and discerned all things clearly ,
YLT	Mark	8	26	and he sent him away to his house , saying , ` Neither to the village mayest thou go , nor tell [ it ] to any in the village . '
YLT	Mark	8	27	And Jesus went forth , and his disciples , to the villages of Cesarea Philippi , and in the way he was questioning his disciples , saying to them , ` Who do men say me to be ? '
YLT	Mark	8	28	And they answered , ` John the Baptist , and others Elijah , but others one of the prophets . '
YLT	Mark	8	29	And he saith to them , ` And ye -- who do ye say me to be ? ' and Peter answering saith to him , ` Thou art the Christ . '
YLT	Mark	8	30	And he strictly charged them that they may tell no one about it ,
YLT	Mark	8	31	and began to teach them , that it behoveth the Son of Man to suffer many things , and to be rejected by the elders , and chief priests , and scribes , and to be killed , and after three days to rise again ;
YLT	Mark	8	32	and openly he was speaking the word . And Peter having taken him aside , began to rebuke him ,
YLT	Mark	8	33	and he , having turned , and having looked on his disciples , rebuked Peter , saying , ` Get behind me , Adversary , because thou dost not mind the things of God , but the things of men . '
YLT	Mark	8	34	And having called near the multitude , with his disciples , he said to them , ` Whoever doth will to come after me -- let him disown himself , and take up his cross , and follow me ;
YLT	Mark	8	35	for whoever may will to save his life shall lose it ; and whoever may lose his life for my sake and for the good news ' sake , he shall save it ;
YLT	Mark	8	36	for what shall it profit a man , if he may gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ?
YLT	Mark	8	37	Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life ?
YLT	Mark	8	38	for whoever may be ashamed of me , and of my words , in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of Man also shall be ashamed of him , when he may come in the glory of his Father , with the holy messengers . '
YLT	Mark	9	9	And as they are coming down from the mount , he charged them that they may declare to no one the things that they saw , except when the Son of Man may rise out of the dead ;
YLT	Mark	9	2	And after six days doth Jesus take Peter , and James , and John , and bringeth them up to a high mount by themselves , alone , and he was transfigured before them ,
YLT	Mark	9	3	and his garments became glittering , white exceedingly , as snow , so as a fuller upon the earth is not able to whiten [ them ] .
YLT	Mark	9	4	And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus .
YLT	Mark	9	5	And Peter answering saith to Jesus , ` Rabbi , it is good to us to be here ; and we may make three booths , for thee one , and for Moses one , and for Elijah one : '
YLT	Mark	9	6	for he was not knowing what he might say , for they were greatly afraid .
YLT	Mark	9	7	And there came a cloud overshadowing them , and there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , ` This is My Son -- the Beloved , hear ye him ; '
YLT	Mark	9	8	and suddenly , having looked around , they saw no one any more , but Jesus only with themselves .
YLT	Mark	9	10	and the thing they kept to themselves , questioning together what the rising out of the dead is .
YLT	Mark	9	11	And they were questioning him , saying , that the scribes say that Elijah it behoveth to come first .
YLT	Mark	9	12	And he answering said to them , ` Elijah indeed , having come first , doth restore all things ; and how hath it been written concerning the Son of Man , that many things he may suffer , and be set at nought ?
YLT	Mark	9	13	But I say to you , That also Elijah hath come , and they did to him what they willed , as it hath been written of him . '
YLT	Mark	9	14	And having come unto the disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and scribes questioning with them ,
YLT	Mark	9	15	and immediately , all the multitude having seen him , were amazed , and running near , were saluting him .
YLT	Mark	9	16	And he questioned the scribes , ` What dispute ye with them ? '
YLT	Mark	9	17	and one out of the multitude answering said , ` Teacher , I brought my son unto thee , having a dumb spirit ;
YLT	Mark	9	18	and wherever it doth seize him , it doth tear him , and he foameth , and gnasheth his teeth , and pineth away ; and I spake to thy disciples that they may cast it out , and they were not able . '
YLT	Mark	9	19	And he answering him , said , ` O generation unbelieving , till when shall I be with you ? till when shall I suffer you ? bring him unto me ; '
YLT	Mark	9	20	and they brought him unto him , and he having seen him , immediately the spirit tare him , and he , having fallen upon the earth , was wallowing -- foaming .
YLT	Mark	9	21	And he questioned his father , ` How long time is it since this came to him ? ' and he said , ` From childhood ,
YLT	Mark	9	22	and many times also it cast him into fire , and into water , that it might destroy him ; but if thou art able to do anything , help us , having compassion on us . '
YLT	Mark	9	23	And Jesus said to him , ` If thou art able to believe ! all things are possible to the one that is believing ; '
YLT	Mark	9	24	and immediately the father of the child , having cried out , with tears said , ` I believe , sir ; be helping mine unbelief . '
YLT	Mark	9	25	Jesus having seen that a multitude doth run together , rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , ` Spirit -- dumb and deaf -- I charge thee , come forth out of him , and no more thou mayest enter into him ; '
YLT	Mark	9	26	and having cried , and rent him much , it came forth , and he became as dead , so that many said that he was dead ,
YLT	Mark	9	27	but Jesus , having taken him by the hand , lifted him up , and he arose .
YLT	Mark	9	28	And he having come into the house , his disciples were questioning him by himself -- ` Why were we not able to cast it forth ? '
YLT	Mark	9	29	And he said to them , ` This kind is able to come forth with nothing except with prayer and fasting . '
YLT	Mark	9	30	And having gone forth thence , they were passing through Galilee , and he did not wish that any may know ,
YLT	Mark	9	31	for he was teaching his disciples , and he said to them , ` The Son of Man is being delivered to the hands of men , and they shall kill him , and having been killed the third day he shall rise , '
YLT	Mark	9	32	but they were not understanding the saying , and they were afraid to question him .
YLT	Mark	9	33	And he came to Capernaum , and being in the house , he was questioning them , ` What were ye reasoning in the way among yourselves ? '
YLT	Mark	9	34	and they were silent , for with one another they did reason in the way who is greater ;
YLT	Mark	9	35	and having sat down he called the twelve , and he saith to them , ` If any doth will to be first , he shall be last of all , and minister of all . '
YLT	Mark	9	36	And having taken a child , he set him in the midst of them , and having taken him in his arms , said to them ,
YLT	Mark	9	37	` Whoever may receive one of such children in my name , doth receive me , and whoever may receive me , doth not receive me , but Him who sent me . '
YLT	Mark	9	38	And John did answer him , saying , ` Teacher , we saw a certain one in thy name casting out demons , who doth not follow us , and we forbade him , because he doth not follow us . '
YLT	Mark	9	39	And Jesus said , ` Forbid him not , for there is no one who shall do a mighty work in my name , and shall be able readily to speak evil of me :
YLT	Mark	9	40	for he who is not against us is for us ;
YLT	Mark	9	41	for whoever may give you to drink a cup of water in my name , because ye are Christ 's , verily I say to you , he may not lose his reward ;
YLT	Mark	9	42	and whoever may cause to stumble one of the little ones believing in me , better is it for him if a millstone is hanged about his neck , and he hath been cast into the sea .
YLT	Mark	9	43	` And if thy hand may cause thee to stumble , cut it off ; it is better for thee maimed to enter into the life , than having the two hands , to go away to the gehenna , to the fire -- the unquenchable --
YLT	Mark	9	44	where there worm is not dying , and the fire is not being quenched .
YLT	Mark	9	45	` And if thy foot may cause thee to stumble , cut it off ; it is better for thee to enter into the life lame , than having the two feet to be cast to the gehenna , to the fire -- the unquenchable --
YLT	Mark	9	46	where there worm is not dying , and the fire is not being quenched .
YLT	Mark	9	47	And if thine eye may cause thee to stumble , cast it out ; it is better for thee one-eyed to enter into the reign of God , than having two eyes , to be cast to the gehenna of the fire --
YLT	Mark	9	48	where their worm is not dying , and the fire is not being quenched ;
YLT	Mark	9	49	for every one with fire shall be salted , and every sacrifice with salt shall be salted .
YLT	Mark	9	50	The salt [ is ] good , but if the salt may become saltless , in what will ye season [ it ] ? Have in yourselves salt , and have peace in one another . '
YLT	Mark	10	10	And in the house again his disciples of the same thing questioned him ,
YLT	Mark	10	2	And the Pharisees , having come near , questioned him , if it is lawful for a husband to put away a wife , tempting him ,
YLT	Mark	10	3	and he answering said to them , ` What did Moses command you ? '
YLT	Mark	10	4	and they said , ` Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce , and to put away . '
YLT	Mark	10	5	And Jesus answering said to them , ` For the stiffness of your heart he wrote you this command ,
YLT	Mark	10	6	but from the beginning of the creation , a male and a female God did make them ;
YLT	Mark	10	7	on this account shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave unto his wife ,
YLT	Mark	10	8	and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh ; so that they are no more two , but one flesh ;
YLT	Mark	10	9	what therefore God did join together , let not man put asunder . '
YLT	Mark	10	11	and he saith to them , ` Whoever may put away his wife , and may marry another , doth commit adultery against her ;
YLT	Mark	10	12	and if a woman may put away her husband , and is married to another , she committeth adultery . '
YLT	Mark	10	13	And they were bringing to him children , that he might touch them , and the disciples were rebuking those bringing them ,
YLT	Mark	10	14	and Jesus having seen , was much displeased , and he said to them , ` Suffer the children to come unto me , and forbid them not , for of such is the reign of God ;
YLT	Mark	10	15	verily I say to you , whoever may not receive the reign of God , as a child -- he may not enter into it ; '
YLT	Mark	10	16	and having taken them in his arms , having put [ his ] hands upon them , he was blessing them .
YLT	Mark	10	17	And as he is going forth into the way , one having run and having kneeled to him , was questioning him , ` Good teacher , what may I do , that life age-during I may inherit ? '
YLT	Mark	10	18	And Jesus said to him , ` Why me dost thou call good ? no one [ is ] good except One -- God ;
YLT	Mark	10	19	the commands thou hast known : Thou mayest not commit adultery , Thou mayest do no murder , Thou mayest not steal , Thou mayest not bear false witness , Thou mayest not defraud , Honour thy father and mother . '
YLT	Mark	10	20	And he answering said to him , ` Teacher , all these did I keep from my youth . '
YLT	Mark	10	21	And Jesus having looked upon him , did love him , and said to him , ` One thing thou dost lack ; go away , whatever thou hast -- sell , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , be following me , having taken up the cross . '
YLT	Mark	10	22	And he -- gloomy at the word -- went away sorrowing , for he was having many possessions .
YLT	Mark	10	23	And Jesus having looked round , saith to his disciples , ` How hardly shall they who have riches enter into the reign of God ! '
YLT	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were astonished at his words , and Jesus again answering saith to them , ` Children , how hard is it to those trusting on the riches to enter into the reign of God !
YLT	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel through the eye of the needle to enter , than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God . '
YLT	Mark	10	26	And they were astonished beyond measure , saying unto themselves , ` And who is able to be saved ? '
YLT	Mark	10	27	And Jesus , having looked upon them , saith , ` With men it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God . '
YLT	Mark	10	28	And Peter began to say to him , ` Lo , we left all , and we followed thee . '
YLT	Mark	10	29	And Jesus answering said , ` Verily I say to you , there is no one who left house , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or fields , for my sake , and for the good news ' ,
YLT	Mark	10	30	who may not receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brothers , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and fields , with persecutions , and in the age that is coming , life age-during ;
YLT	Mark	10	31	and many first shall be last , and the last first . '
YLT	Mark	10	32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was going before them , and they were amazed , and following they were afraid . And having again taken the twelve , he began to tell them the things about to happen to him ,
YLT	Mark	10	33	-- ` Lo , we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests , and to the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the nations ,
YLT	Mark	10	34	and they shall mock him , and scourge him , and spit on him , and kill him , and the third day he shall rise again . '
YLT	Mark	10	35	And there come near to him James and John , the sons of Zebedee , saying , ` Teacher , we wish that whatever we may ask for ourselves , thou mayest do for us ; '
YLT	Mark	10	36	and he said to them , ` What do ye wish me to do for you ? '
YLT	Mark	10	37	and they said to him , ` Grant to us that , one on thy right hand and one on thy left , we may sit in thy glory ; '
YLT	Mark	10	38	and Jesus said to them , ` Ye have not known what ye ask ; are ye able to drink of the cup that I drink of , and with the baptism that I am baptized with -- to be baptized ? '
YLT	Mark	10	39	And they said to him , ` We are able ; ' and Jesus said to them , ` Of the cup indeed that I drink of , ye shall drink , and with the baptism that I am baptized with , ye shall be baptized ;
YLT	Mark	10	40	but to sit on my right and on my left , is not mine to give , but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared . '
YLT	Mark	10	41	And the ten having heard , began to be much displeased at James and John ,
YLT	Mark	10	42	but Jesus having called them near , saith to them , ` Ye have known that they who are considered to rule the nations do exercise lordship over them , and their great ones do exercise authority upon them ;
YLT	Mark	10	43	but not so shall it be among you ; but whoever may will to become great among you , he shall be your minister ,
YLT	Mark	10	44	and whoever of you may will to become first , he shall be servant of all ;
YLT	Mark	10	45	for even the Son of Man came not to be ministered to , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . '
YLT	Mark	10	46	And they come to Jericho , and as he is going forth from Jericho , with his disciples and a great multitude , a son of Timaeus -- Bartimaeus the blind -- was sitting beside the way begging ,
YLT	Mark	10	47	and having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out , and to say , ` The Son of David -- Jesus ! deal kindly with me ; '
YLT	Mark	10	48	and many were rebuking him , that he might keep silent , but the more abundantly he cried out , ` Son of David , deal kindly with me . '
YLT	Mark	10	49	And Jesus having stood , he commanded him to be called , and they call the blind man , saying to him , ` Take courage , rise , he doth call thee ; '
YLT	Mark	10	50	and he , having cast away his garment , having risen , did come unto Jesus .
YLT	Mark	10	51	And answering , Jesus saith to him , ` What wilt thou I may do to thee ? ' and the blind man said to him , ` Rabboni , that I may see again ; '
YLT	Mark	10	52	and Jesus said to him , ` Go , thy faith hath saved thee : ' and immediately he saw again , and was following Jesus in the way .
YLT	Mark	11	11	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple , and having looked round on all things , it being now evening , he went forth to Bethany with the twelve .
YLT	Mark	11	2	and saith to them , ` Go away to the village that is over-against you , and immediately , entering into it , ye shall find a colt tied , on which no one of men hath sat , having loosed it , bring [ it ] :
YLT	Mark	11	3	and if any one may say to you , Why do ye this ? say ye that the lord hath need of it , and immediately he will send it hither . '
YLT	Mark	11	4	And they went away , and found the colt tied at the door without , by the two ways , and they loose it ,
YLT	Mark	11	5	and certain of those standing there said to them , ` What do ye -- loosing the colt ? '
YLT	Mark	11	6	and they said to them as Jesus commanded , and they suffered them .
YLT	Mark	11	7	And they brought the colt unto Jesus , and did cast upon it their garments , and he sat upon it ,
YLT	Mark	11	8	and many did spread their garments in the way , and others were cutting down branches from the trees , and were strewing in the way .
YLT	Mark	11	9	And those going before and those following were crying out , saying , ` Hosanna ! blessed [ is ] he who is coming in the name of the Lord ;
YLT	Mark	11	10	blessed is the coming reign , in the name of the Lord , of our father David ; Hosanna in the highest . '
YLT	Mark	11	12	And on the morrow , they having come forth from Bethany , he hungered ,
YLT	Mark	11	13	and having seen a fig-tree afar off having leaves , he came , if perhaps he shall find anything in it , and having come to it , he found nothing except leaves , for it was not a time of figs ,
YLT	Mark	11	14	and Jesus answering said to it , ` No more from thee -- to the age -- may any eat fruit ; ' and his disciples were hearing .
YLT	Mark	11	15	And they come to Jerusalem , and Jesus having gone into the temple , began to cast forth those selling and buying in the temple , and the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those selling the doves , he overthrew ,
YLT	Mark	11	16	and he did not suffer that any might bear a vessel through the temple ,
YLT	Mark	11	17	and he was teaching , saying to them , ` Hath it not been written -- My house a house of prayer shall be called for all the nations , and ye did make it a den of robbers ? '
YLT	Mark	11	18	And the scribes and the chief priests heard , and they were seeking how they shall destroy him , for they were afraid of him , because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching ;
YLT	Mark	11	19	and when evening came , he was going forth without the city .
YLT	Mark	11	20	And in the morning , passing by , they saw the fig-tree having been dried up from the roots ,
YLT	Mark	11	21	and Peter having remembered saith to him , ` Rabbi , lo , the fig-tree that thou didst curse is dried up . '
YLT	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answering saith to them , ` Have faith of God ;
YLT	Mark	11	23	for verily I say to you , that whoever may say to this mount , Be taken up , and be cast into the sea , and may not doubt in his heart , but may believe that the things that he saith do come to pass , it shall be to him whatever he may say .
YLT	Mark	11	24	Because of this I say to you , all whatever -- praying -- ye do ask , believe that ye receive , and it shall be to you .
YLT	Mark	11	25	` And whenever ye may stand praying , forgive , if ye have anything against any one , that your Father also who is in the heavens may forgive you your trespasses ;
YLT	Mark	11	26	and , if ye do not forgive , neither will your Father who is in the heavens forgive your trespasses . '
YLT	Mark	11	27	And they come again to Jerusalem , and in the temple , as he is walking , there come unto him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ,
YLT	Mark	11	28	and they say to him , ` By what authority dost thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority that these things thou mayest do ? '
YLT	Mark	11	29	And Jesus answering said to them , ` I will question you -- I also -- one word ; and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things ;
YLT	Mark	11	30	the baptism of John -- from heaven was it ? or from men ? answer me . '
YLT	Mark	11	31	And they were reasoning with themselves , saying , ` If we may say , From heaven , he will say , Wherefore , then , did ye not believe him ?
YLT	Mark	11	32	But if we may say , From men , ' -- they were fearing the people , for all were holding John that he was indeed a prophet ;
YLT	Mark	11	33	and answering they say to Jesus , ` We have not known ; ' and Jesus answering saith to them , ` Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . '
YLT	Mark	12	12	And they were seeking to lay hold on him , and they feared the multitude , for they knew that against them he spake the simile , and having left him , they went away ;
YLT	Mark	12	2	and he sent unto the husbandmen at the due time a servant , that from the husbandmen he may receive from the fruit of the vineyard ,
YLT	Mark	12	3	and they , having taken him , did severely beat [ him ] , and did send him away empty .
YLT	Mark	12	4	` And again he sent unto them another servant , and at that one having cast stones , they wounded [ him ] in the head , and sent away -- dishonoured .
YLT	Mark	12	5	` And again he sent another , and that one they killed ; and many others , some beating , and some killing .
YLT	Mark	12	6	` Having yet therefore one son -- his beloved -- he sent also him unto them last , saying -- They will reverence my son ;
YLT	Mark	12	7	and those husbandmen said among themselves -- This is the heir , come , we may kill him , and ours shall be the inheritance ;
YLT	Mark	12	8	and having taken him , they did kill , and cast [ him ] forth without the vineyard .
YLT	Mark	12	9	` What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others .
YLT	Mark	12	10	And this Writing did ye not read : A stone that the builders rejected , it did become the head of a corner :
YLT	Mark	12	11	from the Lord was this , and it is wonderful in our eyes . '
YLT	Mark	12	13	and they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , that they may ensnare him in discourse ,
YLT	Mark	12	14	and they having come , say to him , ` Teacher , we have known that thou art true , and thou art not caring for any one , for thou dost not look to the face of men , but in truth the way of God dost teach ; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not ? may we give , or may we not give ? '
YLT	Mark	12	15	And he , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , ` Why me do ye tempt ? bring me a denary , that I may see ; '
YLT	Mark	12	16	and they brought , and he saith to them , ` Whose [ is ] this image , and the inscription ? ' and they said to him , ` Caesar 's ; '
YLT	Mark	12	17	and Jesus answering said to them , ` Give back the things of Caesar to Caesar , and the things of God to God ; ' and they did wonder at him .
YLT	Mark	12	18	And the Sadducees come unto him , who say there is not a rising again , and they questioned him , saying ,
YLT	Mark	12	19	` Teacher , Moses wrote to us , that if any one 's brother may die , and may leave a wife , and may leave no children , that his brother may take his wife , and raise up seed to his brother .
YLT	Mark	12	20	` There were then seven brothers , and the first took a wife , and dying , he left no seed ;
YLT	Mark	12	21	and the second took her , and died , neither left he seed , and the third in like manner ,
YLT	Mark	12	22	and the seven took her , and left no seed , last of all died also the woman ;
YLT	Mark	12	23	in the rising again , then , whenever they may rise , of which of them shall she be wife -- for the seven had her as wife ? '
YLT	Mark	12	24	And Jesus answering said to them , ` Do ye not because of this go astray , not knowing the Writings , nor the power of God ?
YLT	Mark	12	25	for when they may rise out of the dead , they neither marry nor are they given in marriage , but are as messengers who are in the heavens .
YLT	Mark	12	26	` And concerning the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the Book of Moses ( at The Bush ) , how God spake to him , saying , I [ am ] the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ;
YLT	Mark	12	27	he is not the God of dead men , but a God of living men ; ye then go greatly astray . '
YLT	Mark	12	28	And one of the scribes having come near , having heard them disputing , knowing that he answered them well , questioned him , ` Which is the first command of all ? '
YLT	Mark	12	29	and Jesus answered him -- ` The first of all the commands [ is ] , Hear , O Israel , the Lord is our God , the Lord is one ;
YLT	Mark	12	30	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart , and out of thy soul , and out of all thine understanding , and out of all thy strength -- this [ is ] the first command ;
YLT	Mark	12	31	and the second [ is ] like [ it ] , this , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ; -- greater than these there is no other command . '
YLT	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said to him , ` Well , Teacher , in truth thou hast spoken that there is one God , and there is none other but He ;
YLT	Mark	12	33	and to love Him out of all the heart , and out of all the understanding , and out of all the soul , and out of all the strength , and to love one 's neighbor as one 's self , is more than all the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices . '
YLT	Mark	12	34	And Jesus , having seen him that he answered with understanding , said to him , ` Thou art not far from the reign of God ; ' and no one any more durst question him .
YLT	Mark	12	35	And Jesus answering said , teaching in the temple , ` How say the scribes that the Christ is son of David ?
YLT	Mark	12	36	for David himself said in the Holy Spirit , The Lord said to my lord , Sit thou on My right hand , till I place thine enemies -- thy footstool ;
YLT	Mark	12	37	therefore David himself saith of him Lord , and whence is he his son ? ' And the great multitude were hearing him gladly ,
YLT	Mark	12	38	and he was saying to them in his teaching , ` Beware of the scribes , who will in long robes to walk , and love salutations in the market-places ,
YLT	Mark	12	39	and first seats in the synagogues , and first couches in suppers ,
YLT	Mark	12	40	who are devouring the widows ' houses , and for a pretense are making long prayers ; these shall receive more abundant judgment . '
YLT	Mark	12	41	And Jesus having sat down over-against the treasury , was beholding how the multitude do put brass into the treasury , and many rich were putting in much ,
YLT	Mark	12	42	and having come , a poor widow did put in two mites , which are a farthing .
YLT	Mark	12	43	And having called near his disciples , he saith to them , ` Verily I say to you , that this poor widow hath put in more than all those putting into the treasury ;
YLT	Mark	12	44	for all , out of their abundance , put in , but she , out of her want , all that she had put in -- all her living . '
YLT	Mark	13	13	and ye shall be hated by all because of my name , but he who hath endured to the end -- he shall be saved .
YLT	Mark	13	2	and Jesus answering said to him , ` Seest thou these great buildings ? there may not be left a stone upon a stone , that may not be thrown down . '
YLT	Mark	13	3	And as he is sitting at the mount of the Olives , over-against the temple , Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , were questioning him by himself ,
YLT	Mark	13	4	` Tell us when these things shall be ? and what [ is ] the sign when all these may be about to be fulfilled ? '
YLT	Mark	13	5	And Jesus answering them , began to say , ` Take heed lest any one may lead you astray ,
YLT	Mark	13	6	for many shall come in my name , saying -- I am [ he ] , and many they shall lead astray ;
YLT	Mark	13	7	and when ye may hear of wars and reports of wars , be not troubled , for these behove to be , but the end [ is ] not yet ;
YLT	Mark	13	8	for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles ; beginnings of sorrows [ are ] these .
YLT	Mark	13	9	` And take ye heed to yourselves , for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrims , and to synagogues , ye shall be beaten , and before governors and kings ye shall be set for my sake , for a testimony to them ;
YLT	Mark	13	10	and to all the nations it behoveth first that the good news be proclaimed .
YLT	Mark	13	11	` And when they may lead you , delivering up , be not anxious beforehand what ye may speak , nor premeditate , but whatever may be given to you in that hour , that speak ye , for it is not ye who are speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
YLT	Mark	13	12	` And brother shall deliver up brother to death , and father child , and children shall rise up against parents , and shall put them to death ,
YLT	Mark	13	14	` And when ye may see the abomination of the desolation , that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( whoever is reading let him understand ) , then those in Judea , let them flee to the mountains ;
YLT	Mark	13	15	and he upon the house-top , let him not come down to the house , nor come in to take anything out of his house ;
YLT	Mark	13	16	and he who is in the field , let him not turn to the things behind , to take up his garment .
YLT	Mark	13	17	` And wo to those with child , and to those giving suck , in those days ;
YLT	Mark	13	18	and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter ,
YLT	Mark	13	19	for those days shall be tribulation , such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation that God created , till now , and may not be ;
YLT	Mark	13	20	and if the Lord did not shorten the days , no flesh had been saved ; but because of the chosen , whom He did choose to Himself , He did shorten the days .
YLT	Mark	13	21	` And then , if any may say to you , Lo , here [ is ] the Christ , or , Lo , there , ye may not believe ;
YLT	Mark	13	22	for there shall rise false Christs and false prophets , and they shall give signs and wonders , to seduce , if possible , also the chosen ;
YLT	Mark	13	23	and ye , take heed ; lo , I have foretold you all things .
YLT	Mark	13	24	` But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
YLT	Mark	13	25	and the stars of the heaven shall be falling , and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken .
YLT	Mark	13	26	` And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds with much power and glory ,
YLT	Mark	13	27	and then he shall send his messengers , and gather together his chosen from the four winds , from the end of the earth unto the end of heaven .
YLT	Mark	13	28	` And from the fig-tree learn ye the simile : when the branch may already become tender , and may put forth the leaves , ye know that nigh is the summer ;
YLT	Mark	13	29	so ye , also , when these ye may see coming to pass , ye know that it is nigh , at the doors .
YLT	Mark	13	30	Verily I say to you , that this generation may not pass away till all these things may come to pass ;
YLT	Mark	13	31	the heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
YLT	Mark	13	32	` And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known -- not even the messengers who are in the heaven , not even the Son -- except the Father .
YLT	Mark	13	33	Take heed , watch and pray , for ye have not known when the time is ;
YLT	Mark	13	34	as a man who is gone abroad , having left his house , and given to his servants the authority , and to each one his work , did command also the porter that he may watch ;
YLT	Mark	13	35	watch ye , therefore , for ye have not known when the lord of the house doth come , at even , or at midnight , or at cock-crowing , or at the morning ;
YLT	Mark	13	36	lest , having come suddenly , he may find you sleeping ;
YLT	Mark	13	37	and what I say to you , I say to all , Watch . '
YLT	Mark	14	14	and wherever he may go in , say ye to the master of the house -- The Teacher saith , Where is the guest-chamber , where the passover , with my disciples , I may eat ?
YLT	Mark	14	2	and they said , ` Not in the feast , lest there shall be a tumult of the people . '
YLT	Mark	14	3	And he , being in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , at his reclining ( at meat ) , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment , of spikenard , very precious , and having broken the alabaster box , did pour on his head ;
YLT	Mark	14	4	and there were certain much displeased within themselves , and saying , ` For what hath this waste of the ointment been made ?
YLT	Mark	14	5	for this could have been sold for more than three hundred denaries , and given to the poor ; ' and they were murmuring at her .
YLT	Mark	14	6	And Jesus said , ` Let her alone ; why are ye giving her trouble ? a good work she wrought on me ;
YLT	Mark	14	7	for the poor always ye have with you , and whenever ye may will ye are able to do them good , but me ye have not always ;
YLT	Mark	14	8	what she could she did , she anticipated to anoint my body for the embalming .
YLT	Mark	14	9	Verily I say to you , wherever this good news may be proclaimed in the whole world , what also this woman did shall be spoken of -- for a memorial of her . '
YLT	Mark	14	10	And Judas the Iscariot , one of the twelve , went away unto the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them ,
YLT	Mark	14	11	and having heard , they were glad , and promised to give him money , and he was seeking how , conveniently , he might deliver him up .
YLT	Mark	14	12	And the first day of the unleavened food , when they were killing the passover , his disciples say to him , ` Where wilt thou , [ that , ] having gone , we may prepare , that thou mayest eat the passover ? '
YLT	Mark	14	13	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith to them , ` Go ye away to the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water , follow him ;
YLT	Mark	14	15	and he will shew you a large upper room , furnished , prepared -- there make ready for us . '
YLT	Mark	14	16	And his disciples went forth , and came to the city , and found as he said to them , and they made ready the passover .
YLT	Mark	14	17	And evening having come , he cometh with the twelve ,
YLT	Mark	14	18	and as they are reclining , and eating , Jesus said , ` Verily I say to you -- one of you , who is eating with me -- shall deliver me up . '
YLT	Mark	14	19	And they began to be sorrowful , and to say to him , one by one , ` Is it I ? ' and another , ` Is it I ? '
YLT	Mark	14	20	And he answering said to them , ` One of the twelve who is dipping with me in the dish ;
YLT	Mark	14	21	the Son of Man doth indeed go , as it hath been written concerning him , but wo to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up ; good were it to him if that man had not been born . '
YLT	Mark	14	22	And as they are eating , Jesus having taken bread , having blessed , brake , and gave to them , and said , ` Take , eat ; this is my body . '
YLT	Mark	14	23	And having taken the cup , having given thanks , he gave to them , and they drank of it -- all ;
YLT	Mark	14	24	and he said to them , ` This is my blood of the new covenant , which for many is being poured out ;
YLT	Mark	14	25	verily I say to you , that no more may I drink of the produce of the vine till that day when I may drink it new in the reign of God . '
YLT	Mark	14	26	And having sung an hymn , they went forth to the mount of the Olives ,
YLT	Mark	14	27	and Jesus saith to them -- ` All ye shall be stumbled at me this night , because it hath been written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered abroad ,
YLT	Mark	14	28	but after my having risen I will go before you to Galilee . '
YLT	Mark	14	29	And Peter said to him , ` And if all shall be stumbled , yet not I ; '
YLT	Mark	14	30	And Jesus said to him , ` Verily I say to thee , that to-day , this night , before a cock shall crow twice , thrice thou shalt deny me . '
YLT	Mark	14	31	And he spake the more vehemently , ` If it may be necessary for me to die with thee -- I will in nowise deny thee ; ' and in like manner also said they all .
YLT	Mark	14	32	And they come to a spot , the name of which [ is ] Gethsemane , and he saith to his disciples , ` Sit ye here till I may pray ; '
YLT	Mark	14	33	and he taketh Peter , and James , and John with him , and began to be amazed , and to be very heavy ,
YLT	Mark	14	34	and he saith to them , ` Exceeding sorrowful is my soul -- to death ; remain here , and watch . '
YLT	Mark	14	35	And having gone forward a little , he fell upon the earth , and was praying , that , if it be possible the hour may pass from him ,
YLT	Mark	14	36	and he said , ` Abba , Father ; all things are possible to Thee ; make this cup pass from me ; but , not what I will , but what Thou . '
YLT	Mark	14	37	And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith to Peter , ` Simon , thou dost sleep ! thou wast not able to watch one hour !
YLT	Mark	14	38	Watch ye and pray , that ye may not enter into temptation ; the spirit indeed is forward , but the flesh weak . '
YLT	Mark	14	39	And again having gone away , he prayed , the same word saying ;
YLT	Mark	14	40	and having returned , he found them again sleeping , for their eyes were heavy , and they had not known what they might answer him .
YLT	Mark	14	41	And he cometh the third time , and saith to them , ` Sleep on henceforth , and rest -- it is over ; the hour did come ; lo , the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of the sinful ;
YLT	Mark	14	42	rise , we may go , lo , he who is delivering me up hath come nigh . '
YLT	Mark	14	43	And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- cometh near Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude , with swords and sticks , from the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ;
YLT	Mark	14	44	and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them , saying , ` Whomsoever I shall kiss , he it is , lay hold on him , and lead him away safely , '
YLT	Mark	14	45	and having come , immediately , having gone near him , he saith , ` Rabbi , Rabbi , ' and kissed him .
YLT	Mark	14	46	And they laid on him their hands , and kept hold on him ;
YLT	Mark	14	47	and a certain one of those standing by , having drawn the sword , struck the servant of the chief priest , and took off his ear .
YLT	Mark	14	48	And Jesus answering said to them , ` As against a robber ye came out , with swords and sticks , to take me !
YLT	Mark	14	49	daily I was with you in the temple teaching , and ye did not lay hold on me -- but that the Writings may be fulfilled . '
YLT	Mark	14	50	And having left him they all fled ;
YLT	Mark	14	51	and a certain young man was following him , having put a linen cloth about [ his ] naked body , and the young men lay hold on him ,
YLT	Mark	14	52	and he , having left the linen cloth , did flee from them naked .
YLT	Mark	14	53	And they led away Jesus unto the chief priest , and come together to him do all the chief priests , and the elders , and the scribes ;
YLT	Mark	14	54	and Peter afar off did follow him , to the inside of the hall of the chief priest , and he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself near the fire .
YLT	Mark	14	55	And the chief priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death , and they were not finding ,
YLT	Mark	14	56	for many were bearing false testimony against him , and their testimonies were not alike .
YLT	Mark	14	57	And certain having risen up , were bearing false testimony against him , saying --
YLT	Mark	14	58	` We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary made with hands , and by three days , another made without hands I will build ; '
YLT	Mark	14	59	and neither so was their testimony alike .
YLT	Mark	14	60	And the chief priest , having risen up in the midst , questioned Jesus , saying , ` Thou dost not answer anything ! what do these testify against thee ? '
YLT	Mark	14	61	and he was keeping silent , and did not answer anything . Again the chief priest was questioning him , and saith to him , ` Art thou the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed ? '
YLT	Mark	14	62	and Jesus said , ` I am ; and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power , and coming with the clouds , of the heaven . '
YLT	Mark	14	63	And the chief priest , having rent his garments , saith , ` What need have we yet of witnesses ?
YLT	Mark	14	64	Ye heard the evil speaking , what appeareth to you ? ' and they all condemned him to be worthy of death ,
YLT	Mark	14	65	and certain began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say to him , ` Prophesy ; ' and the officers were striking him with their palms .
YLT	Mark	14	66	And Peter being in the hall beneath , there doth come one of the maids of the chief priest ,
YLT	Mark	14	67	and having seen Peter warming himself , having looked on him , she said , ` And thou wast with Jesus of Nazareth ! '
YLT	Mark	14	68	and he denied , saying , ` I have not known [ him ] , neither do I understand what thou sayest ; ' and he went forth without to the porch , and a cock crew .
YLT	Mark	14	69	And the maid having seen him again , began to say to those standing near -- ` This is of them ; '
YLT	Mark	14	70	and he was again denying . And after a little again , those standing near said to Peter , ` Truly thou art of them , for thou also art a Galilean , and thy speech is alike ; '
YLT	Mark	14	71	and he began to anathematize , and to swear -- ` I have not known this man of whom ye speak ; '
YLT	Mark	14	72	and a second time a cock crew , and Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him -- ` Before a cock crow twice , thou mayest deny me thrice ; ' and having thought thereon -- he was weeping .
YLT	Mark	15	15	and Pilate , wishing to content the multitude , released to them Barabbas , and delivered up Jesus -- having scourged [ him ] -- that he might be crucified .
YLT	Mark	15	2	and Pilate questioned him , ` Art thou the king of the Jews ? ' and he answering said to him , ` Thou dost say [ it ] . '
YLT	Mark	15	3	And the chief priests were accusing him of many things , [ but he answered nothing . ]
YLT	Mark	15	4	And Pilate again questioned him , saying , ` Thou dost not answer anything ! lo , how many things they do testify against thee ! '
YLT	Mark	15	5	and Jesus did no more answer anything , so that Pilate wondered .
YLT	Mark	15	6	And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner , whomsoever they were asking ;
YLT	Mark	15	7	and there was [ one ] named Barabbas , bound with those making insurrection with him , who had in the insurrection committed murder .
YLT	Mark	15	8	And the multitude having cried out , began to ask for themselves as he was always doing to them ,
YLT	Mark	15	9	and Pilate answered them , saying , ` Will ye [ that ] I shall release to you the king of the Jews ? '
YLT	Mark	15	10	for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered him up ;
YLT	Mark	15	11	and the chief priests did move the multitude , that he might rather release Barabbas to them .
YLT	Mark	15	12	And Pilate answering , again said to them , ` What , then , will ye [ that ] I shall do to him whom ye call king of the Jews ? '
YLT	Mark	15	13	and they again cried out , ` Crucify him . '
YLT	Mark	15	14	And Pilate said to them , ` Why -- what evil did he ? ' and they cried out the more vehemently , ` Crucify him ; '
YLT	Mark	15	16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall , which is Praetorium , and call together the whole band ,
YLT	Mark	15	17	and clothe him with purple , and having plaited a crown of thorns , they put [ it ] on him ,
YLT	Mark	15	18	and began to salute him , ` Hail , King of the Jews . '
YLT	Mark	15	19	And they were smiting him on the head with a reed , and were spitting on him , and having bent the knee , were bowing to him ,
YLT	Mark	15	20	and when they [ had ] mocked him , they took the purple from off him , and clothed him in his own garments , and they led him forth , that they may crucify him .
YLT	Mark	15	21	And they impress a certain one passing by -- Simon , a Cyrenian , coming from the field , the father of Alexander and Rufus -- that he may bear his cross ,
YLT	Mark	15	22	and they bring him to the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , ` Place of a skull ; '
YLT	Mark	15	23	and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh , and he did not receive .
YLT	Mark	15	24	And having crucified him , they were dividing his garments , casting a lot upon them , what each may take ;
YLT	Mark	15	25	and it was the third hour , and they crucified him ;
YLT	Mark	15	26	and the inscription of his accusation was written above -- ` The King of the Jews . '
YLT	Mark	15	27	And with him they crucify two robbers , one on the right hand , and one on his left ,
YLT	Mark	15	28	and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying , ` And with lawless ones he was numbered . '
YLT	Mark	15	29	And those passing by were speaking evil of him , shaking their heads , and saying , ` Ah , the thrower down of the sanctuary , and in three days the builder !
YLT	Mark	15	30	save thyself , and come down from the cross ! '
YLT	Mark	15	31	And in like manner also the chief priests , mocking with one another , with the scribes , said , ` Others he saved ; himself he is not able to save .
YLT	Mark	15	32	The Christ ! the king of Israel -- let him come down now from the cross , that we may see and believe ; ' and those crucified with him were reproaching him .
YLT	Mark	15	33	And the sixth hour having come , darkness came over the whole land till the ninth hour ,
YLT	Mark	15	34	and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice , saying , ` Eloi , Eloi , lamma sabachthani ? ' which is , being interpreted , ` My God , my God , why didst Thou forsake me ? '
YLT	Mark	15	35	And certain of those standing by , having heard , said , ` Lo , Elijah he doth call ; '
YLT	Mark	15	36	and one having run , and having filled a spunge with vinegar , having put [ it ] also on a reed , was giving him to drink , saying , ` Let alone , let us see if Elijah doth come to take him down . '
YLT	Mark	15	37	And Jesus having uttered a loud cry , yielded the spirit ,
YLT	Mark	15	38	and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two , from top to bottom ,
YLT	Mark	15	39	and the centurion who was standing over-against him , having seen that , having so cried out , he yielded the spirit , said , ` Truly this man was Son of God . '
YLT	Mark	15	40	And there were also women afar off beholding , among whom was also Mary the Magdalene , and Mary of James the less , and of Joses , and Salome ,
YLT	Mark	15	41	( who also , when he was in Galilee , were following him , and were ministering to him , ) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem .
YLT	Mark	15	42	And now evening having come , seeing it was the preparation , that is , the fore-sabbath ,
YLT	Mark	15	43	Joseph of Arimathea , an honourable counsellor , who also himself was waiting for the reign of God , came , boldly entered in unto Pilate , and asked the body of Jesus .
YLT	Mark	15	44	And Pilate wondered if he were already dead , and having called near the centurion , did question him if he were long dead ,
YLT	Mark	15	45	and having known [ it ] from the centurion , he granted the body to Joseph .
YLT	Mark	15	46	And he , having brought fine linen , and having taken him down , wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre that had been hewn out of a rock , and he rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre ,
YLT	Mark	15	47	and Mary the Magdalene , and Mary of Joses , were beholding where he is laid .
YLT	Mark	16	16	he who hath believed , and hath been baptized , shall be saved ; and he who hath not believed , shall be condemned .
YLT	Mark	16	2	and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths , they come unto the sepulchre , at the rising of the sun ,
YLT	Mark	16	3	and they said among themselves , ` Who shall roll away for us the stone out of the door of the sepulchre ? '
YLT	Mark	16	4	And having looked , they see that the stone hath been rolled away -- for it was very great ,
YLT	Mark	16	5	and having entered into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right hand , arrayed in a long white robe , and they were amazed .
YLT	Mark	16	6	And he saith to them , ` Be not amazed , ye seek Jesus the Nazarene , the crucified : he did rise -- he is not here ; lo , the place where they laid him !
YLT	Mark	16	7	and go , say to his disciples , and Peter , that he doth go before you to Galilee ; there ye shall see him , as he said to you . '
YLT	Mark	16	8	And , having come forth quickly , they fled from the sepulchre , and trembling and amazement had seized them , and to no one said they anything , for they were afraid .
YLT	Mark	16	9	And he , having risen in the morning of the first of the sabbaths , did appear first to Mary the Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven demons ;
YLT	Mark	16	10	she having gone , told those who had been with him , mourning and weeping ;
YLT	Mark	16	11	and they , having heard that he is alive , and was seen by her , did not believe .
YLT	Mark	16	12	And after these things , to two of them , as they are going into a field , walking , he was manifested in another form ,
YLT	Mark	16	13	and they having gone , told to the rest ; not even them did they believe .
YLT	Mark	16	14	Afterwards , as they are reclining ( at meat ) , he was manifested to the eleven , and did reproach their unbelief and stiffness of heart , because they believed not those having seen him being raised ;
YLT	Mark	16	15	and he said to them , ` Having gone to all the world , proclaim the good news to all the creation ;
YLT	Mark	16	17	` And signs shall accompany those believing these things ; in my name demons they shall cast out ; with new tongues they shall speak ;
YLT	Mark	16	18	serpents they shall take up ; and if any deadly thing they may drink , it shall not hurt them ; on the ailing they shall lay hands , and they shall be well . '
YLT	Mark	16	19	The Lord , then , indeed , after speaking to them , was received up to the heaven , and sat on the right hand of God ;
YLT	Mark	16	20	and they , having gone forth , did preach everywhere , the Lord working with [ them ] , and confirming the word , through the signs following . Amen .
YLT	Luke	1	1	Seeing that many did take in hand to set in order a narration of the matters that have been fully assured among us ,
YLT	Luke	1	2	as they did deliver to us , who from the beginning became eye-witnesses , and officers of the Word , --
YLT	Luke	1	3	it seemed good also to me , having followed from the first after all things exactly , to write to thee in order , most noble Theophilus ,
YLT	Luke	1	4	that thou mayest know the certainty of the things wherein thou wast instructed .
YLT	Luke	1	5	There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judea , a certain priest , by name Zacharias , of the course of Abijah , and his wife of the daughters of Aaron , and her name Elisabeth ;
YLT	Luke	1	6	and they were both righteous before God , going on in all the commands and righteousnesses of the Lord blameless ,
YLT	Luke	1	7	and they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and both were advanced in their days .
YLT	Luke	1	8	And it came to pass , in his acting as priest , in the order of his course before God ,
YLT	Luke	1	9	according to the custom of the priesthood , his lot was to make perfume , having gone into the sanctuary of the Lord ,
YLT	Luke	1	10	and all the multitude of the people were praying without , at the hour of the perfume .
YLT	Luke	1	11	And there appeared to him a messenger of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of the perfume ,
YLT	Luke	1	12	and Zacharias , having seen , was troubled , and fear fell on him ;
YLT	Luke	1	13	and the messenger said unto him , ` Fear not , Zacharias , for thy supplication was heard , and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear a son to thee , and thou shalt call his name John ,
YLT	Luke	1	14	and there shall be joy to thee , and gladness , and many at his birth shall joy ,
YLT	Luke	1	15	for he shall be great before the Lord , and wine and strong drink he may not drink , and of the Holy Spirit he shall be full , even from his mother 's womb ;
YLT	Luke	1	16	and many of the sons of Israel he shall turn to the Lord their God ,
YLT	Luke	1	17	and he shall go before Him , in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn hearts of fathers unto children , and disobedient ones to the wisdom of righteous ones , to make ready for the Lord , a people prepared . '
YLT	Luke	1	18	And Zacharias said unto the messenger , ` Whereby shall I know this ? for I am aged , and my wife is advanced in her days ? '
YLT	Luke	1	19	And the messenger answering said to him , ` I am Gabriel , who have been standing near before God , and I was sent to speak unto thee , and to proclaim these good news to thee ,
YLT	Luke	1	20	and lo , thou shalt be silent , and not able to speak , till the day that these things shall come to pass , because thou didst not believe my words , that shall be fulfilled in their season . '
YLT	Luke	1	21	And the people were waiting for Zacharias , and wondering at his tarrying in the sanctuary ,
YLT	Luke	1	22	and having come out , he was not able to speak to them , and they perceived that a vision he had seen in the sanctuary , and he was beckoning to them , and did remain dumb .
YLT	Luke	1	23	And it came to pass , when the days of his service were fulfilled , he went away to his house ,
YLT	Luke	1	24	and after those days , his wife Elisabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying --
YLT	Luke	1	25	` Thus hath the Lord done to me , in days in which He looked upon [ me ] , to take away my reproach among men . '
YLT	Luke	1	26	And in the sixth month was the messenger Gabriel sent by God , to a city of Galilee , the name of which [ is ] Nazareth ,
YLT	Luke	1	27	to a virgin , betrothed to a man , whose name [ is ] Joseph , of the house of David , and the name of the virgin [ is ] Mary .
YLT	Luke	1	28	And the messenger having come in unto her , said , ` Hail , favoured one , the Lord [ is ] with thee ; blessed [ art ] thou among women ; '
YLT	Luke	1	29	and she , having seen , was troubled at his word , and was reasoning of what kind this salutation may be .
YLT	Luke	1	30	And the messenger said to her , ` Fear not , Mary , for thou hast found favour with God ;
YLT	Luke	1	31	and lo , thou shalt conceive in the womb , and shalt bring forth a son , and call his name Jesus ;
YLT	Luke	1	32	he shall be great , and Son of the Highest he shall be called , and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father ,
YLT	Luke	1	33	and he shall reign over the house of Jacob to the ages ; and of his reign there shall be no end . '
YLT	Luke	1	34	And Mary said unto the messenger , ` How shall this be , seeing a husband I do not know ? '
YLT	Luke	1	35	And the messenger answering said to her , ` The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee , therefore also the holy-begotten thing shall be called Son of God ;
YLT	Luke	1	36	and lo , Elisabeth , thy kinswoman , she also hath conceived a son in her old age , and this is the sixth month to her who was called barren ;
YLT	Luke	1	37	because nothing shall be impossible with God . '
YLT	Luke	1	38	And Mary said , ` Lo , the maid-servant of the Lord ; let it be to me according to thy saying , ' and the messenger went away from her .
YLT	Luke	1	39	And Mary having arisen in those days , went to the hill-country , with haste , to a city of Judea ,
YLT	Luke	1	40	and entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth .
YLT	Luke	1	41	And it came to pass , when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe did leap in her womb ; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit ,
YLT	Luke	1	42	and spake out with a loud voice , and said , ` Blessed [ art ] thou among women , and blessed [ is ] the fruit of thy womb ;
YLT	Luke	1	43	and whence [ is ] this to me , that the mother of my Lord might come unto me ?
YLT	Luke	1	44	for , lo , when the voice of thy salutation came to my ears , leap in gladness did the babe in my womb ;
YLT	Luke	1	45	and happy [ is ] she who did believe , for there shall be a completion to the things spoken to her from the Lord . '
YLT	Luke	1	46	And Mary said , ` My soul doth magnify the Lord ,
YLT	Luke	1	47	And my spirit was glad on God my Saviour ,
YLT	Luke	1	48	Because He looked on the lowliness of His maid-servant , For , lo , henceforth call me happy shall all the generations ,
YLT	Luke	1	49	For He who is mighty did to me great things , And holy [ is ] His name ,
YLT	Luke	1	50	And His kindness [ is ] to generations of generations , To those fearing Him ,
YLT	Luke	1	51	He did powerfully with His arm , He scattered abroad the proud in the thought of their heart ,
YLT	Luke	1	52	He brought down the mighty from thrones , And He exalted the lowly ,
YLT	Luke	1	53	The hungry He did fill with good , And the rich He sent away empty ,
YLT	Luke	1	54	He received again Israel His servant , To remember kindness ,
YLT	Luke	1	55	As He spake unto our fathers , To Abraham and to his seed -- to the age . '
YLT	Luke	1	56	And Mary remained with her about three months , and turned back to her house .
YLT	Luke	1	57	And to Elisabeth was the time fulfilled for her bringing forth , and she bare a son ,
YLT	Luke	1	58	and the neighbours and her kindred heard that the Lord was making His kindness great with her , and they were rejoicing with her .
YLT	Luke	1	59	And it came to pass , on the eighth day , they came to circumcise the child , and they were calling him by the name of his father , Zacharias ,
YLT	Luke	1	60	and his mother answering said , ` No , but he shall be called John . '
YLT	Luke	1	61	And they said unto her -- ` There is none among thy kindred who is called by this name , '
YLT	Luke	1	62	and they were making signs to his father , what he would wish him to be called ,
YLT	Luke	1	63	and having asked for a tablet , he wrote , saying , ` John is his name ; ' and they did all wonder ;
YLT	Luke	1	64	and his mouth was opened presently , and his tongue , and he was speaking , praising God .
YLT	Luke	1	65	And fear came upon all those dwelling around them , and in all the hill-country of Judea were all these sayings spoken of ,
YLT	Luke	1	66	and all who heard did lay them up in their hearts , saying , ` What then shall this child be ? ' and the hand of the Lord was with him .
YLT	Luke	1	67	And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Spirit , and did prophesy , saying ,
YLT	Luke	1	68	` Blessed [ is ] the Lord , the God of Israel , Because He did look upon , And wrought redemption for His people ,
YLT	Luke	1	69	And did raise an horn of salvation to us , In the house of David His servant ,
YLT	Luke	1	70	As He spake by the mouth of His holy prophets , Which have been from the age ;
YLT	Luke	1	71	Salvation from our enemies , And out of the hand of all hating us ,
YLT	Luke	1	72	To do kindness with our fathers , And to be mindful of His holy covenant ,
YLT	Luke	1	73	An oath that He sware to Abraham our father ,
YLT	Luke	1	74	To give to us , without fear , Out of the hand of our enemies having been delivered ,
YLT	Luke	1	75	To serve Him , in holiness and righteousness Before Him , all the days of our life .
YLT	Luke	1	76	And thou , child , Prophet of the Highest Shalt thou be called ; For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord , To prepare His ways .
YLT	Luke	1	77	To give knowledge of salvation to His people In remission of their sins ,
YLT	Luke	1	78	Through the tender mercies of our God , In which the rising from on high did look upon us ,
YLT	Luke	1	79	To give light to those sitting in darkness and death-shade , To guide our feet to a way of peace . '
YLT	Luke	1	80	And the child grew , and was strengthened in spirit , and he was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel .
YLT	Luke	2	2	this enrollment first came to pass when Cyrenius was governor of Syria --
YLT	Luke	2	3	and all were going to be enrolled , each to his proper city ,
YLT	Luke	2	4	and Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , to Judea , to the city of David , that is called Bethlehem , because of his being of the house and family of David ,
YLT	Luke	2	5	to enroll himself with Mary his betrothed wife , being with child .
YLT	Luke	2	6	And it came to pass , in their being there , the days were fulfilled for her bringing forth ,
YLT	Luke	2	7	and she brought forth her son -- the first-born , and wrapped him up , and laid him down in the manger , because there was not for them a place in the guest-chamber .
YLT	Luke	2	8	And there were shepherds in the same region , lodging in the field , and keeping the night-watches over their flock ,
YLT	Luke	2	9	and lo , a messenger of the Lord stood over them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they feared a great fear .
YLT	Luke	2	10	And the messenger said to them , ` Fear not , for lo , I bring you good news of great joy , that shall be to all the people --
YLT	Luke	2	11	because there was born to you to-day a Saviour -- who is Christ the Lord -- in the city of David ,
YLT	Luke	2	12	and this [ is ] to you the sign : Ye shall find a babe wrapped up , lying in the manger . '
YLT	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there came with the messenger a multitude of the heavenly host , praising God , and saying ,
YLT	Luke	2	14	` Glory in the highest to God , and upon earth peace , among men -- good will . '
YLT	Luke	2	15	And it came to pass , when the messengers were gone away from them to the heavens , that the men , the shepherds , said unto one another , ` We may go over indeed unto Bethlehem , and see this thing that hath come to pass , that the Lord did make known to us . '
YLT	Luke	2	16	And they came , having hasted , and found both Mary , and Joseph , and the babe lying in the manger ,
YLT	Luke	2	17	and having seen , they made known abroad concerning the saying spoken to them concerning the child .
YLT	Luke	2	18	And all who heard , did wonder concerning the things spoken by the shepherds unto them ;
YLT	Luke	2	19	and Mary was preserving all these things , pondering in her heart ;
YLT	Luke	2	20	and the shepherds turned back , glorifying and praising God , for all those things they heard and saw , as it was spoken unto them .
YLT	Luke	2	21	And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child , then was his name called Jesus , having been so called by the messenger before his being conceived in the womb .
YLT	Luke	2	22	And when the days of their purification were fulfilled , according to the law of Moses , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present to the Lord ,
YLT	Luke	2	23	as it hath been written in the Law of the Lord , -- ` Every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord , '
YLT	Luke	2	24	and to give a sacrifice , according to that said in the Law of the Lord , ` A pair of turtle-doves , or two young pigeons . '
YLT	Luke	2	25	And lo , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name [ is ] Simeon , and this man is righteous and devout , looking for the comforting of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him ,
YLT	Luke	2	26	and it hath been divinely told him by the Holy Spirit -- not to see death before he may see the Christ of the Lord .
YLT	Luke	2	27	And he came in the Spirit to the temple , and in the parents bringing in the child Jesus , for their doing according to the custom of the law regarding him ,
YLT	Luke	2	28	then he took him in his arms , and blessed God , and he said ,
YLT	Luke	2	29	` Now Thou dost send away Thy servant , Lord , according to Thy word , in peace ,
YLT	Luke	2	30	because mine eyes did see Thy salvation ,
YLT	Luke	2	31	which Thou didst prepare before the face of all the peoples ,
YLT	Luke	2	32	a light to the uncovering of nations , and the glory of Thy people Israel . '
YLT	Luke	2	33	And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things spoken concerning him ,
YLT	Luke	2	34	and Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , ` Lo , this [ one ] is set for the falling and rising again of many in Israel , and for a sign spoken against --
YLT	Luke	2	35	( and also thine own soul shall a sword pass through ) -- that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed . '
YLT	Luke	2	36	And there was Anna , a prophetess , daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher , she was much advanced in days , having lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ,
YLT	Luke	2	37	and she [ is ] a widow of about eighty-four years , who did depart not from the temple , with fasts and supplications serving , night and day ,
YLT	Luke	2	38	and she , at that hour , having come in , was confessing , likewise , to the Lord , and was speaking concerning him , to all those looking for redemption in Jerusalem .
YLT	Luke	2	39	And when they finished all things , according to the Law of the Lord , they turned back to Galilee , to their city Nazareth ;
YLT	Luke	2	40	and the child grew and was strengthened in spirit , being filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him .
YLT	Luke	2	41	And his parents were going yearly to Jerusalem , at the feast of the passover ,
YLT	Luke	2	42	and when he became twelve years old , they having gone up to Jerusalem , according to the custom of the feast ,
YLT	Luke	2	43	and having finished the days , in their returning the child Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem , and Joseph and his mother did not know ,
YLT	Luke	2	44	and , having supposed him to be in the company , they went a day 's journey , and were seeking him among the kindred and among the acquaintances ,
YLT	Luke	2	45	and not having found him , they turned back to Jerusalem seeking him .
YLT	Luke	2	46	And it came to pass , after three days , they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers , both hearing them and questioning them ,
YLT	Luke	2	47	and all those hearing him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
YLT	Luke	2	48	And , having seen him , they were amazed , and his mother said unto him , ` Child , why didst thou thus to us ? lo , thy father and I , sorrowing , were seeking thee . '
YLT	Luke	2	49	And he said unto them , ` Why [ is it ] that ye were seeking me ? did ye not know that in the things of my Father it behoveth me to be ? '
YLT	Luke	2	50	and they did not understand the saying that he spake to them ,
YLT	Luke	2	51	and he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and he was subject to them , and his mother was keeping all these sayings in her heart ,
YLT	Luke	2	52	and Jesus was advancing in wisdom , and in stature , and in favour with God and men .
YLT	Luke	3	3	and he came to all the region round the Jordan , proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins ,
YLT	Luke	3	2	Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests -- there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness ,
YLT	Luke	3	4	as it hath been written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet , saying , ` A voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , straight make ye His paths ;
YLT	Luke	3	5	every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be made low , and the crooked shall become straightness , and the rough become smooth ways ;
YLT	Luke	3	6	and all flesh shall see the salvation of God . '
YLT	Luke	3	7	Then said he to the multitudes coming forth to be baptised by him , ` Brood of vipers ! who did prompt you to flee from the coming wrath ?
YLT	Luke	3	8	make , therefore , fruits worthy of the reformation , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have a father -- Abraham ; for I say to you , that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham ;
YLT	Luke	3	9	and already also the axe unto the root of the trees is laid , every tree , therefore , not making good fruit is cut down , and to fire it is cast . '
YLT	Luke	3	10	And the multitudes were questioning him , saying , ` What , then , shall we do ? '
YLT	Luke	3	11	and he answering saith to them , ` He having two coats -- let him impart to him having none , and he having victuals -- in like manner let him do . '
YLT	Luke	3	12	And there came also tax-gatherers to be baptised , and they said unto him , ` Teacher , what shall we do ? '
YLT	Luke	3	13	and he said unto them , ` Exact no more than that directed you . '
YLT	Luke	3	14	And questioning him also were those warring , saying , ` And we , what shall we do ? ' and he said unto them , ` Do violence to no one , nor accuse falsely , and be content with your wages . '
YLT	Luke	3	15	And the people are looking forward , and all are reasoning in their hearts concerning John , whether or not he may be the Christ ;
YLT	Luke	3	16	John answered , saying to all , ` I indeed with water do baptise you , but he cometh who is mightier than I , of whom I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his sandals -- he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire ;
YLT	Luke	3	17	whose winnowing shovel [ is ] in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor , and will gather the wheat to his storehouse , and the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . '
YLT	Luke	3	18	And , therefore , indeed with many other things , exhorting , he was proclaiming good news to the people ,
YLT	Luke	3	19	and Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him concerning Herodias the wife of Philip his brother , and concerning all the evils that Herod did ,
YLT	Luke	3	20	added also this to all , that he shut up John in the prison .
YLT	Luke	3	21	And it came to pass , in all the people being baptised , Jesus also being baptised , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
YLT	Luke	3	22	and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily appearance , as if a dove , upon him , and a voice came out of heaven , saying , ` Thou art My Son -- the Beloved , in thee I did delight . '
YLT	Luke	3	23	And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years of age , being , as was supposed , son of Joseph ,
YLT	Luke	3	24	the [ son ] of Eli , the [ son ] of Matthat , the [ son ] of Levi , the [ son ] of Melchi , the [ son ] of Janna , the [ son ] of Joseph ,
YLT	Luke	3	25	the [ son ] of Mattathias , the [ son ] of Amos , the [ son ] of Naum , the [ son ] of Esli ,

YLT	Luke	3	27	the [ son ] of Joanna , the [ son ] of Rhesa , the [ son ] of Zerubbabel , the [ son ] of Shealtiel ,
YLT	Luke	3	28	the [ son ] of Neri , the [ son ] of Melchi , the [ son ] of Addi , the [ son ] of Cosam , the [ son ] of Elmodam , the [ son ] of Er ,
YLT	Luke	3	29	the [ son ] of Jose , the [ son ] of Eliezer , the [ son ] of Jorim , the [ son ] of Matthat ,
YLT	Luke	3	30	the [ son ] of Levi , the [ son ] of Simeon , the [ son ] of Juda , the [ son ] of Joseph , the [ son ] of Jonan , the [ son ] of Eliakim ,
YLT	Luke	3	31	the [ son ] of Melea , the [ son ] of Mainan , the [ son ] of Mattatha , the [ son ] of Nathan ,
YLT	Luke	3	32	the [ son ] of David , the [ son ] of Jesse , the [ son ] of Obed , the [ son ] of Booz , the [ son ] of Salmon , the [ son ] of Nahshon ,
YLT	Luke	3	33	the [ son ] of Amminadab , the [ son ] of Aram , the [ son ] of Esrom , the [ son ] of Pharez ,
YLT	Luke	3	34	the [ son ] of Judah , the [ son ] of Jacob , the [ son ] of Isaac , the [ son ] of Abraham , the [ son ] of Terah , the [ son ] of Nahor ,
YLT	Luke	3	35	the [ son ] of Serug , the [ son ] of Reu , the [ son ] of Peleg , the [ son ] of Eber ,
YLT	Luke	3	36	the [ son ] of Salah , the [ son ] of Cainan , the [ son ] of Arphaxad , the [ son ] of Shem , the [ son ] of Noah , the [ son ] of Lamech ,
YLT	Luke	3	37	the [ son ] of Methuselah , the [ son ] of Enoch , the [ son ] of Jared , the [ son ] of Mahalaleel ,
YLT	Luke	3	38	the [ son ] of Cainan , the [ son ] of Enos , the [ son ] of Seth , the [ son ] of Adam , the [ son ] of God .
YLT	Luke	4	4	And Jesus answered him , saying , ` It hath been written , that , not on bread only shall man live , but on every saying of God . '
YLT	Luke	4	2	forty days being tempted by the Devil , and he did not eat anything in those days , and they having been ended , he afterward hungered ,
YLT	Luke	4	3	and the Devil said to him , ` If Son thou art of God , speak to this stone that it may become bread . '
YLT	Luke	4	5	And the Devil having brought him up to an high mountain , shewed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time ,
YLT	Luke	4	6	and the Devil said to him , ` To thee I will give all this authority , and their glory , because to me it hath been delivered , and to whomsoever I will , I do give it ;
YLT	Luke	4	7	thou , then , if thou mayest bow before me -- all shall be thine . '
YLT	Luke	4	8	And Jesus answering him said , ` Get thee behind me , Adversary , for it hath been written , Thou shalt bow before the Lord thy God , and Him only thou shalt serve . '
YLT	Luke	4	9	And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to him , ` If the Son thou art of God , cast thyself down hence ,
YLT	Luke	4	10	for it hath been written -- To His messengers He will give charge concerning thee , to guard over thee ,
YLT	Luke	4	11	and -- On hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou mayest dash against a stone thy foot . '
YLT	Luke	4	12	And Jesus answering said to him -- ` It hath been said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . '
YLT	Luke	4	13	And having ended all temptation , the Devil departed from him till a convenient season .
YLT	Luke	4	14	And Jesus turned back in the power of the Spirit to Galilee , and a fame went forth through all the region round about concerning him ,
YLT	Luke	4	15	and he was teaching in their synagogues , being glorified by all .
YLT	Luke	4	16	And he came to Nazareth , where he hath been brought up , and he went in , according to his custom , on the sabbath-day , to the synagogue , and stood up to read ;
YLT	Luke	4	17	and there was given over to him a roll of Isaiah the prophet , and having unfolded the roll , he found the place where it hath been written :
YLT	Luke	4	18	` The Spirit of the Lord [ is ] upon me , Because He did anoint me ; To proclaim good news to the poor , Sent me to heal the broken of heart , To proclaim to captives deliverance , And to blind receiving of sight , To send away the bruised with deliverance ,
YLT	Luke	4	19	To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord . '
YLT	Luke	4	20	And having folded the roll , having given [ it ] back to the officer , he sat down , and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing on him .
YLT	Luke	4	21	And he began to say unto them -- ` To-day hath this writing been fulfilled in your ears ; '
YLT	Luke	4	22	and all were bearing testimony to him , and were wondering at the gracious words that are coming forth out of his mouth , and they said , ` Is not this the son of Joseph ? '
YLT	Luke	4	23	And he said unto them , ` Certainly ye will say to me this simile , Physician , heal thyself ; as great things as we heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country ; '
YLT	Luke	4	24	and he said , ` Verily I say to you -- No prophet is accepted in his own country ;
YLT	Luke	4	25	and of a truth I say to you , Many widows were in the days of Elijah , in Israel , when the heaven was shut for three years and six months , when great famine came on all the land ,
YLT	Luke	4	26	and unto none of them was Elijah sent , but -- to Sarepta of Sidon , unto a woman , a widow ;
YLT	Luke	4	27	and many lepers were in the time of Elisha the prophet , in Israel , and none of them was cleansed , but -- Naaman the Syrian . '
YLT	Luke	4	28	And all in the synagogue were filled with wrath , hearing these things ,
YLT	Luke	4	29	and having risen , they put him forth without the city , and brought him unto the brow of the hill on which their city had been built -- to cast him down headlong ,
YLT	Luke	4	30	and he , having gone through the midst of them , went away .
YLT	Luke	4	31	And he came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and was teaching them on the sabbaths ,
YLT	Luke	4	32	and they were astonished at his teaching , because his word was with authority .
YLT	Luke	4	33	And in the synagogue was a man , having a spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried out with a great voice ,
YLT	Luke	4	34	saying , ` Away , what -- to us and to thee , Jesus , O Nazarene ? thou didst come to destroy us ; I have known thee who thou art -- the Holy One of God . '
YLT	Luke	4	35	And Jesus did rebuke him , saying , ` Be silenced , and come forth out of him ; ' and the demon having cast him into the midst , came forth from him , having hurt him nought ;
YLT	Luke	4	36	and amazement came upon all , and they were speaking together , with one another , saying , ` What [ is ] this word , that with authority and power he doth command the unclean spirits , and they come forth ? '
YLT	Luke	4	37	and there was going forth a fame concerning him to every place of the region round about .
YLT	Luke	4	38	And having risen out of the synagogue , he entered into the house of Simon , and the mother-in-law of Simon was pressed with a great fever , and they did ask him about her ,
YLT	Luke	4	39	and having stood over her , he rebuked the fever , and it left her , and presently , having risen , she was ministering to them .
YLT	Luke	4	40	And at the setting of the sun , all , as many as had any ailing with manifold sicknesses , brought them unto him , and he on each one of them [ his ] hands having put , did heal them .
YLT	Luke	4	41	And demons also were coming forth from many , crying out and saying -- ` Thou art the Christ , the Son of God ; ' and rebuking , he did not suffer them to speak , because they knew him to be the Christ .
YLT	Luke	4	42	And day having come , having gone forth , he went on to a desert place , and the multitudes were seeking him , and they came unto him , and were staying him -- not to go on from them ,
YLT	Luke	4	43	and he said unto them -- ` Also to the other cities it behoveth me to proclaim good news of the reign of God , because for this I have been sent ; '
YLT	Luke	4	44	and he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee .
YLT	Luke	5	5	and Simon answering said to him , ` Master , through the whole night , having laboured , we have taken nothing , but at thy saying I will let down the net . '
YLT	Luke	5	2	and he saw two boats standing beside the lake , and the fishers , having gone away from them , were washing the nets ,
YLT	Luke	5	3	and having entered into one of the boats , that was Simon 's , he asked him to put back a little from the land , and having sat down , was teaching the multitudes out of the boat .
YLT	Luke	5	4	And when he left off speaking , he said unto Simon , ` Put back to the deep , and let down your nets for a draught ; '
YLT	Luke	5	6	And having done this , they enclosed a great multitude of fishes , and their net was breaking ,
YLT	Luke	5	7	and they beckoned to the partners , who [ are ] in the other boat , having come , to help them ; and they came , and filled both the boats , so that they were sinking .
YLT	Luke	5	8	And Simon Peter having seen , fell down at the knees of Jesus , saying , ` Depart from me , because I am a sinful man , O lord ; '
YLT	Luke	5	9	for astonishment seized him , and all those with him , at the draught of the fishes that they took ,
YLT	Luke	5	10	and in like manner also James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon ; and Jesus said unto Simon , ` Fear not , henceforth thou shalt be catching men ; '
YLT	Luke	5	11	and they , having brought the boats upon the land , having left all , did follow him .
YLT	Luke	5	12	And it came to pass , in his being in one of the cities , that lo , a man full of leprosy , and having seen Jesus , having fallen on [ his ] face , he besought him , saying , ` Sir , if thou mayest will , thou art able to cleanse me ; '
YLT	Luke	5	13	and having stretched forth [ his ] hand , he touched him , having said , ` I will ; be thou cleansed ; ' and immediately the leprosy went away from him .
YLT	Luke	5	14	And he charged him to tell no one , ` But , having gone away , shew thyself to the priest , and bring near for thy cleansing according as Moses directed , for a testimony to them ; '
YLT	Luke	5	15	but the more was the report going abroad concerning him , and great multitudes were coming together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities ,
YLT	Luke	5	16	and he was withdrawing himself in the desert places and was praying .
YLT	Luke	5	17	And it came to pass , on one of the days , that he was teaching , and there were sitting by Pharisees and teachers of the Law , who were come out of every village of Galilee , and Judea , and Jerusalem , and the power of the Lord was -- to heal them .
YLT	Luke	5	18	And lo , men bearing upon a couch a man , who hath been struck with palsy , and they were seeking to bring him in , and to place before him ,
YLT	Luke	5	19	and not having found by what way they may bring him in because of the multitude , having gone up on the house-top , through the tiles they let him down , with the little couch , into the midst before Jesus ,
YLT	Luke	5	20	and he having seen their faith , said to him , ` Man , thy sins have been forgiven thee . '
YLT	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , ` Who is this that doth speak evil words ? who is able to forgive sins , except God only ? '
YLT	Luke	5	22	And Jesus having known their reasonings , answering , said unto them , ` What reason ye in your hearts ?
YLT	Luke	5	23	which is easier -- to say , Thy sins have been forgiven thee ? or to say , Arise , and walk ?
YLT	Luke	5	24	` And that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority upon the earth to forgive sins -- ( he said to the one struck with palsy ) -- I say to thee , Arise , and having taken up thy little couch , be going on to thy house . '
YLT	Luke	5	25	And presently having risen before them , having taken up [ that ] on which he was lying , he went away to his house , glorifying God ,
YLT	Luke	5	26	and astonishment took all , and they were glorifying God , and were filled with fear , saying -- ` We saw strange things to-day . '
YLT	Luke	5	27	And after these things he went forth , and beheld a tax-gatherer , by name Levi , sitting at the tax-office , and said to him , ` Be following me ; '
YLT	Luke	5	28	and he , having left all , having arisen , did follow him .
YLT	Luke	5	29	And Levi made a great entertainment to him in his house , and there was a great multitude of tax-gatherers and others who were with them reclining ( at meat ) ,
YLT	Luke	5	30	and the scribes and the Pharisees among them were murmuring at his disciples , saying , ` Wherefore with tax-gatherers and sinners do ye eat and drink ? '
YLT	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answering said unto them , ` They who are well have no need of a physician , but they that are ill :
YLT	Luke	5	32	I came not to call righteous men , but sinners , to reformation . '
YLT	Luke	5	33	And they said unto him , ` Wherefore do the disciples of John fast often , and make supplications -- in like manner also those of the Pharisees -- but thine do eat and drink ? '
YLT	Luke	5	34	And he said unto them , ` Are ye able to make the sons of the bride-chamber -- in the bridegroom being with them -- to fast ?
YLT	Luke	5	35	but days will come , and , when the bridegroom may be taken away from them , then they shall fast in those days . '
YLT	Luke	5	36	And he spake also a simile unto them -- ` No one a patch of new clothing doth put on old clothing , and if otherwise , the new also doth make a rent , and with the old the patch doth not agree , that [ is ] from the new .
YLT	Luke	5	37	` And no one doth put new wine into old skins , and if otherwise , the new wine will burst the skins , and itself will be poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ;
YLT	Luke	5	38	but new wine into new skins is to be put , and both are preserved together ;
YLT	Luke	5	39	and no one having drunk old [ wine ] , doth immediately wish new , for he saith , The old is better . '
YLT	Luke	6	6	And it came to pass also , on another sabbath , that he goeth into the synagogue , and teacheth , and there was there a man , and his right hand was withered ,
YLT	Luke	6	2	and certain of the Pharisees said to them , ` Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbaths ? '
YLT	Luke	6	3	And Jesus answering said unto them , ` Did ye not read even this that David did , when he hungered , himself and those who are with him ,
YLT	Luke	6	4	how he went into the house of God , and the loaves of the presentation did take , and did eat , and gave also to those with him , which it is not lawful to eat , except only to the priests ? '
YLT	Luke	6	5	and he said to them , -- ` The Son of Man is lord also of the sabbath . '
YLT	Luke	6	7	and the scribes and the Pharisees were watching him , if on the sabbath he will heal , that they might find an accusation against him .
YLT	Luke	6	8	And he himself had known their reasonings , and said to the man having the withered hand , ` Rise , and stand in the midst ; ' and he having risen , stood .
YLT	Luke	6	9	Then said Jesus unto them , ` I will question you something : Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good , or to do evil ? life to save or to kill ? '
YLT	Luke	6	10	And having looked round on them all , he said to the man , ` Stretch forth thy hand ; ' and he did so , and his hand was restored whole as the other ;
YLT	Luke	6	11	and they were filled with madness , and were speaking with one another what they might do to Jesus .
YLT	Luke	6	12	And it came to pass in those days , he went forth to the mountain to pray , and was passing the night in the prayer of God ,
YLT	Luke	6	13	and when it became day , he called near his disciples , and having chosen from them twelve , whom also he named apostles ,
YLT	Luke	6	14	( Simon , whom also he named Peter , and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
YLT	Luke	6	15	Matthew and Thomas , James of Alphaeus , and Simon called Zelotes ,
YLT	Luke	6	16	Judas of James , and Judas Iscariot , who also became betrayer ; )
YLT	Luke	6	17	and having come down with them , he stood upon a level spot , and a crowd of his disciples , and a great multitude of the people from all Judea , and Jerusalem , and the maritime Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear him , and to be healed of their sicknesses ,
YLT	Luke	6	18	and those harassed by unclean spirits , and they were healed ,
YLT	Luke	6	19	and all the multitude were seeking to touch him , because power from him was going forth , and he was healing all .
YLT	Luke	6	20	And he , having lifted up his eyes to his disciples , said : ` Happy the poor -- because yours is the reign of God .
YLT	Luke	6	21	` Happy those hungering now -- because ye shall be filled . ` Happy those weeping now -- because ye shall laugh .
YLT	Luke	6	22	` Happy are ye when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you , and shall reproach , and shall cast forth your name as evil , for the Son of Man 's sake --
YLT	Luke	6	23	rejoice in that day , and leap , for lo , your reward [ is ] great in the heaven , for according to these things were their fathers doing to the prophets .
YLT	Luke	6	24	` But wo to you -- the rich , because ye have got your comfort .
YLT	Luke	6	25	` Wo to you who have been filled -- because ye shall hunger . ` Wo to you who are laughing now -- because ye shall mourn and weep .
YLT	Luke	6	26	` Wo to you when all men shall speak well of you -- for according to these things were their fathers doing to false prophets .
YLT	Luke	6	27	` But I say to you who are hearing , Love your enemies , do good to those hating you ,
YLT	Luke	6	28	bless those cursing you , and pray for those accusing you falsely ;
YLT	Luke	6	29	and to him smiting thee upon the cheek , give also the other , and from him taking away from thee the mantle , also the coat thou mayest not keep back .
YLT	Luke	6	30	` And to every one who is asking of thee , be giving ; and from him who is taking away thy goods , be not asking again ;
YLT	Luke	6	31	and as ye wish that men may do to you , do ye also to them in like manner ;
YLT	Luke	6	32	and -- if ye love those loving you , what grace have ye ? for also the sinful love those loving them ;
YLT	Luke	6	33	and if ye do good to those doing good to you , what grace have ye ? for also the sinful do the same ;
YLT	Luke	6	34	and if ye lend [ to those ] of whom ye hope to receive back , what grace have ye ? for also the sinful lend to sinners -- that they may receive again as much .
YLT	Luke	6	35	` But love your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again , and your reward will be great , and ye shall be sons of the Highest , because He is kind unto the ungracious and evil ;
YLT	Luke	6	36	be ye therefore merciful , as also your Father is merciful .
YLT	Luke	6	37	` And judge not , and ye may not be judged ; condemn not , and ye may not be condemned ; release , and ye shall be released .
YLT	Luke	6	38	` Give , and it shall be given to you ; good measure , pressed , and shaken , and running over , they shall give into your bosom ; for with that measure with which ye measure , it shall be measured to you again . '
YLT	Luke	6	39	And he spake a simile to them , ` Is blind able to lead blind ? shall they not both fall into a pit ?
YLT	Luke	6	40	A disciple is not above his teacher , but every one perfected shall be as his teacher .
YLT	Luke	6	41	` And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , and the beam that [ is ] in thine own eye dost not consider ?
YLT	Luke	6	42	or how art thou able to say to thy brother , Brother , suffer , I may take out the mote that [ is ] in thine eye -- thyself the beam in thine own eye not beholding ? Hypocrite , take first the beam out of thine own eye , and then thou shalt see clearly to take out the mote that [ is ] in thy brother 's eye .
YLT	Luke	6	43	` For there is not a good tree making bad fruit , nor a bad tree making good fruit ;
YLT	Luke	6	44	for each tree from its own fruit is known , for not from thorns do they gather figs , nor from a bramble do they crop a grape .
YLT	Luke	6	45	` The good man out of the good treasure of his heart doth bring forth that which [ is ] good ; and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart doth bring forth that which [ is ] evil ; for out of the abounding of the heart doth his mouth speak .
YLT	Luke	6	46	` And why do ye call me , Lord , Lord , and do not what I say ?
YLT	Luke	6	47	Every one who is coming unto me , and is hearing my words , and is doing them , I will shew you to whom he is like ;
YLT	Luke	6	48	he is like to a man building a house , who did dig , and deepen , and laid a foundation upon the rock , and a flood having come , the stream broke forth on that house , and was not able to shake it , for it had been founded upon the rock .
YLT	Luke	6	49	` And he who heard and did not , is like to a man having builded a house upon the earth , without a foundation , against which the stream brake forth , and immediately it fell , and the ruin of that house became great . '
YLT	Luke	7	7	wherefore not even myself thought I worthy to come unto thee , but say in a word , and my lad shall be healed ;
YLT	Luke	7	2	and a certain centurion 's servant being ill , was about to die , who was much valued by him ,
YLT	Luke	7	3	and having heard about Jesus , he sent unto him elders of the Jews , beseeching him , that having come he might thoroughly save his servant .
YLT	Luke	7	4	And they , having come near unto Jesus , were calling upon him earnestly , saying -- ` He is worthy to whom thou shalt do this ,
YLT	Luke	7	5	for he doth love our nation , and the synagogue he did build to us . '
YLT	Luke	7	6	And Jesus was going on with them , and now when he is not far distant from the house the centurion sent unto him friends , saying to him , ` Sir , be not troubled , for I am not worthy that under my roof thou mayest enter ;
YLT	Luke	7	8	for I also am a man placed under authority , having under myself soldiers , and I say to this [ one ] , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Be coming , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doth [ it ] . '
YLT	Luke	7	9	And having heard these things Jesus wondered at him , and having turned to the multitude following him , he said , ` I say to you , not even in Israel so much faith did I find ; '
YLT	Luke	7	10	and those sent , having turned back to the house , found the ailing servant in health .
YLT	Luke	7	11	And it came to pass , on the morrow , he was going on to a city called Nain , and there were going with him many of his disciples , and a great multitude ,
YLT	Luke	7	12	and as he came nigh to the gate of the city , then , lo , one dead was being carried forth , an only son of his mother , and she a widow , and a great multitude of the city was with her .
YLT	Luke	7	13	And the Lord having seen her , was moved with compassion towards her , and said to her , ` Be not weeping ; '
YLT	Luke	7	14	and having come near , he touched the bier , and those bearing [ it ] stood still , and he said , ` Young man , to thee I say , Arise ; '
YLT	Luke	7	15	and the dead sat up , and began to speak , and he gave him to his mother ;
YLT	Luke	7	16	and fear took hold of all , and they were glorifying God , saying -- ` A great prophet hath risen among us , ' and -- ` God did look upon His people . '
YLT	Luke	7	17	And the account of this went forth in all Judea about him , and in all the region around .
YLT	Luke	7	18	And the disciples of John told him about all these things ,
YLT	Luke	7	19	and John having called near a certain two of his disciples , sent unto Jesus , saying , ` Art thou he who is coming , or for another do we look ? '
YLT	Luke	7	20	And having come near to him , the men said , ` John the Baptist sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he who is coming , or for another do we look ? '
YLT	Luke	7	21	And in that hour he cured many from sicknesses , and plagues , and evil spirits , and to many blind he granted sight .
YLT	Luke	7	22	And Jesus answering said to them , ` Having gone on , report to John what ye saw and heard , that blind men do see again , lame do walk , lepers are cleansed , deaf do hear , dead are raised , poor have good news proclaimed ;
YLT	Luke	7	23	and happy is he whoever may not be stumbled in me . '
YLT	Luke	7	24	And the messengers of John having gone away , he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John : ` What have ye gone forth to the wilderness to look on ? a reed by the wind shaken ?
YLT	Luke	7	25	but what have ye gone forth to see ? a man in soft garments clothed ? lo , they in splendid apparellings , and living in luxury , are in the houses of kings !
YLT	Luke	7	26	` But what have ye gone forth to see ? a prophet ? Yes , I say to you , and much more than a prophet :
YLT	Luke	7	27	this is he concerning whom it hath been written , Lo , I send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee ;
YLT	Luke	7	28	for I say to you , a greater prophet , among those born of women , than John the Baptist there is not ; but the least in the reign of God is greater than he . '
YLT	Luke	7	29	And all the people having heard , and the tax-gatherers , declared God righteous , having been baptized with the baptism of John ,
YLT	Luke	7	30	but the Pharisees , and the lawyers , the counsel of God did put away for themselves , not having been baptized by him .
YLT	Luke	7	31	And the Lord said , ` To what , then , shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
YLT	Luke	7	32	they are like to children , to those sitting in a market-place , and calling one to another , and saying , We piped to you , and ye did not dance , we mourned to you , and ye did not weep !
YLT	Luke	7	33	` For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and ye say , He hath a demon ;
YLT	Luke	7	34	the Son of Man came eating and drinking , and ye say , Lo , a man , a glutton , and a wine drinker , a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners ;
YLT	Luke	7	35	and the wisdom was justified from all her children . '
YLT	Luke	7	36	And a certain one of the Pharisees was asking him that he might eat with him , and having gone into the house of the Pharisee he reclined ( at meat ) ,
YLT	Luke	7	37	and lo , a woman in the city , who was a sinner , having known that he reclineth ( at meat ) in the house of the Pharisee , having provided an alabaster box of ointment ,
YLT	Luke	7	38	and having stood behind , beside his feet , weeping , she began to wet his feet with the tears , and with the hairs of her head she was wiping , and was kissing his feet , and was anointing with the ointment .
YLT	Luke	7	39	And the Pharisee who did call him , having seen , spake within himself , saying , ` This one , if he were a prophet , would have known who and of what kind [ is ] the woman who doth touch him , that she is a sinner . '
YLT	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answering said unto him , ` Simon , I have something to say to thee ; ' and he saith , ` Teacher , say on . '
YLT	Luke	7	41	` Two debtors were to a certain creditor ; the one was owing five hundred denaries , and the other fifty ;
YLT	Luke	7	42	and they not having [ wherewith ] to give back , he forgave both ; which then of them , say thou , will love him more ? '
YLT	Luke	7	43	And Simon answering said , ` I suppose that to whom he forgave the more ; ' and he said to him , ` Rightly thou didst judge . '
YLT	Luke	7	44	And having turned unto the woman , he said to Simon , ` Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thy house ; water for my feet thou didst not give , but this woman with tears did wet my feet , and with the hairs of her head did wipe ;
YLT	Luke	7	45	a kiss to me thou didst not give , but this woman , from what [ time ] I came in , did not cease kissing my feet ;
YLT	Luke	7	46	with oil my head thou didst not anoint , but this woman with ointment did anoint my feet ;
YLT	Luke	7	47	therefore I say to thee , her many sins have been forgiven , because she did love much ; but to whom little is forgiven , little he doth love . '
YLT	Luke	7	48	And he said to her , ` Thy sins have been forgiven ; '
YLT	Luke	7	49	and those reclining with him ( at meat ) began to say within themselves , ` Who is this , who also doth forgive sins ? '
YLT	Luke	7	50	and he said unto the woman , ` Thy faith have saved thee , be going on to peace . '
YLT	Luke	8	8	` And other fell upon the good ground , and having sprung up , it made fruit an hundred fold . ' These things saying , he was calling , ` He having ears to hear -- let him hear . '
YLT	Luke	8	2	and certain women , who were healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary who is called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone forth ,
YLT	Luke	8	3	and Joanna wife of Chuza , steward of Herod , and Susanna , and many others , who were ministering to him from their substance .
YLT	Luke	8	4	And a great multitude having gathered , and those who from city and city were coming unto him , he spake by a simile :
YLT	Luke	8	5	` The sower went forth to sow his seed , and in his sowing some indeed fell beside the way , and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the heaven did devour it .
YLT	Luke	8	6	` And other fell upon the rock , and having sprung up , it did wither , through not having moisture .
YLT	Luke	8	7	` And other fell amidst the thorns , and the thorns having sprung up with it , did choke it .
YLT	Luke	8	9	And his disciples were questioning him , saying , ` What may this simile be ? '
YLT	Luke	8	10	And he said , ` To you it hath been given to know the secrets of the reign of God , and to the rest in similes ; that seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand .
YLT	Luke	8	11	` And this is the simile : The seed is the word of God ,
YLT	Luke	8	12	and those beside the way are those hearing , then cometh the Devil , and taketh up the word from their heart , lest having believed , they may be saved .
YLT	Luke	8	13	` And those upon the rock : They who , when they may hear , with joy do receive the word , and these have no root , who for a time believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
YLT	Luke	8	14	` And that which fell to the thorns : These are they who have heard , and going forth , through anxieties , and riches , and pleasures of life , are choked , and bear not to completion .
YLT	Luke	8	15	` And that in the good ground : These are they , who in an upright and good heart , having heard the word , do retain [ it ] , and bear fruit in continuance .
YLT	Luke	8	16	` And no one having lighted a lamp doth cover it with a vessel , or under a couch doth put [ it ] ; but upon a lamp-stand he doth put [ it ] , that those coming in may see the light ,
YLT	Luke	8	17	for nothing is secret , that shall not become manifest , nor hid , that shall not be known , and become manifest .
YLT	Luke	8	18	` See , therefore , how ye hear , for whoever may have , there shall be given to him , and whoever may not have , also what he seemeth to have , shall be taken from him . '
YLT	Luke	8	19	And there came unto him his mother and brethren , and they were not able to get to him because of the multitude ,
YLT	Luke	8	20	and it was told him , saying , ` Thy mother and thy brethren do stand without , wishing to see thee ; '
YLT	Luke	8	21	and he answering said unto them , ` My mother and my brethren ! they are those who the word of God are hearing , and doing . '
YLT	Luke	8	22	And it came to pass , on one of the days , that he himself went into a boat with his disciples , and he said unto them , ` We may go over to the other side of the lake ; ' and they set forth ,
YLT	Luke	8	23	and as they are sailing he fell deeply asleep , and there came down a storm of wind to the lake , and they were filling , and were in peril .
YLT	Luke	8	24	And having come near , they awoke him , saying , ` Master , master , we perish ; ' and he , having arisen , rebuked the wind and the raging of the water , and they ceased , and there came a calm ,
YLT	Luke	8	25	and he said to them , ` Where is your faith ? ' and they being afraid did wonder , saying unto one another , ` Who , then , is this , that even the winds he doth command , and the water , and they obey him ? '
YLT	Luke	8	26	And they sailed down to the region of the Gadarenes , that is over-against Galilee ,
YLT	Luke	8	27	and he having gone forth upon the land , there met him a certain man , out of the city , who had demons for a long time , and with a garment was not clothed , and in a house was not abiding , but in the tombs ,
YLT	Luke	8	28	and having seen Jesus , and having cried out , he fell before him , and with a loud voice , said , ` What -- to me and to thee , Jesus , Son of God Most High ? I beseech thee , mayest thou not afflict me ! '
YLT	Luke	8	29	For he commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the man , for many times it had caught him , and he was being bound with chains and fetters -- guarded , and breaking asunder the bonds he was driven by the demons to the deserts .
YLT	Luke	8	30	And Jesus questioned him , saying , ` What is thy name ? ' and he said , ` Legion , ' ( because many demons were entered into him , )
YLT	Luke	8	31	and he was calling on him , that he may not command them to go away to the abyss ,
YLT	Luke	8	32	and there was there a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain , and they were calling on him , that he might suffer them to enter into these , and he suffered them ,
YLT	Luke	8	33	and the demons having gone forth from the man , did enter into the swine , and the herd rushed down the steep to the lake , and were choked .
YLT	Luke	8	34	And those feeding [ them ] , having seen what was come to pass , fled , and having gone , told [ it ] to the city , and to the fields ;
YLT	Luke	8	35	and they came forth to see what was come to pass , and they came unto Jesus , and found the man sitting , out of whom the demons had gone forth , clothed , and right-minded , at the feet of Jesus , and they were afraid ;
YLT	Luke	8	36	and those also having seen [ it ] , told them how the demoniac was saved .
YLT	Luke	8	37	And the whole multitude of the region of the Gadarenes round about asked him to go away from them , because with great fear they were pressed , and he having entered into the boat , did turn back .
YLT	Luke	8	38	And the man from whom the demons had gone forth was beseeching of him to be with him , and Jesus sent him away , saying ,
YLT	Luke	8	39	` Turn back to thy house , and tell how great things God did to thee ; ' and he went away through all the city proclaiming how great things Jesus did to him .
YLT	Luke	8	40	And it came to pass , in the turning back of Jesus , the multitude received him , for they were all looking for him ,
YLT	Luke	8	41	and lo , there came a man , whose name [ is ] Jairus , and he was a chief of the synagogue , and having fallen at the feet of Jesus , was calling on him to come to his house ;
YLT	Luke	8	42	because he had an only daughter about twelve years [ old ] , and she was dying . And in his going away , the multitudes were thronging him ,
YLT	Luke	8	43	and a woman , having an issue of blood for twelve years , who , having spent on physicians all her living , was not able to be healed by any ,
YLT	Luke	8	44	having come near behind , touched the fringe of his garment , and presently the issue of her blood stood .
YLT	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , ` Who [ is ] it that touched me ? ' and all denying , Peter and those with him said , ` Master , the multitudes press thee , and throng [ thee ] , and thou dost say , Who [ is ] it that touched me ! '
YLT	Luke	8	46	And Jesus said , ` Some one did touch me , for I knew power having gone forth from me . '
YLT	Luke	8	47	And the woman , having seen that she was not hid , trembling , came , and having fallen before him , for what cause she touched him declared to him before all the people , and how she was healed presently ;
YLT	Luke	8	48	and he said to her , ` Take courage , daughter , thy faith hath saved thee , be going on to peace . '
YLT	Luke	8	49	While he is yet speaking , there doth come a certain one from the chief of the synagogue 's [ house ] , saying to him -- ` Thy daughter hath died , harass not the Teacher ; '
YLT	Luke	8	50	and Jesus having heard , answered him , saying , ` Be not afraid , only believe , and she shall be saved . '
YLT	Luke	8	51	And having come to the house , he suffered no one to go in , except Peter , and James , and John , and the father of the child , and the mother ;
YLT	Luke	8	52	and they were all weeping , and beating themselves for her , and he said , ` Weep not , she did not die , but doth sleep ;
YLT	Luke	8	53	and they were deriding him , knowing that she did die ;
YLT	Luke	8	54	and he having put all forth without , and having taken hold of her hand , called , saying , ` Child , arise ; '
YLT	Luke	8	55	and her spirit came back , and she arose presently , and he directed that there be given to her to eat ;
YLT	Luke	8	56	and her parents were amazed , but he charged them to say to no one what was come to pass .
YLT	Luke	9	9	and Herod said , ` John I did behead , but who is this concerning whom I hear such things ? ' and he was seeking to see him .
YLT	Luke	9	2	and he sent them to proclaim the reign of God , and to heal the ailing .
YLT	Luke	9	3	And he said unto them , ` Take nothing for the way , neither staff , nor scrip , nor bread , nor money ; neither have two coats each ;
YLT	Luke	9	4	and into whatever house ye may enter , there remain , and thence depart ;
YLT	Luke	9	5	and as many as may not receive you , going forth from that city , even the dust from your feet shake off , for a testimony against them . '
YLT	Luke	9	6	And going forth they were going through the several villages , proclaiming good news , and healing everywhere .
YLT	Luke	9	7	And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things being done by him , and was perplexed , because it was said by certain , that John hath been raised out of the dead ;
YLT	Luke	9	8	and by certain , that Elijah did appear , and by others , that a prophet , one of the ancients , was risen ;
YLT	Luke	9	10	And the apostles having turned back , declared to him how great things they did , and having taken them , he withdrew by himself to a desert place of a city called Bethsaida ,
YLT	Luke	9	11	and the multitudes having known did follow him , and having received them , he was speaking to them concerning the reign of God , and those having need of service he cured .
YLT	Luke	9	12	And the day began to decline , and the twelve having come near , said to him , ` Let away the multitude , that having gone to the villages and the fields round about , they may lodge and may find provision , because here we are in a desert place . '
YLT	Luke	9	13	And he said unto them , ` Give ye them to eat ; ' and they said , ` We have no more than five loaves , and two fishes : except , having gone , we may buy for all this people victuals ; '
YLT	Luke	9	14	for they were about five thousand men . And he said unto his disciples , ` Cause them to recline in companies , in each fifty ; '
YLT	Luke	9	15	and they did so , and made all to recline ;
YLT	Luke	9	16	and having taken the five loaves , and the two fishes , having looked up to the heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and was giving to the disciples to set before the multitude ;
YLT	Luke	9	17	and they did eat , and were all filled , and there was taken up what was over to them of broken pieces , twelve baskets .
YLT	Luke	9	18	And it came to pass , as he is praying alone , the disciples were with him , and he questioned them , saying , ` Who do the multitudes say me to be ? '
YLT	Luke	9	19	And they answering said , ` John the Baptist ; and others , Elijah ; and others , that a prophet , one of the ancients , was risen ; '
YLT	Luke	9	20	and he said to them , ` And ye -- who do ye say me to be ? ' and Peter answering said , ` The Christ of God . '
YLT	Luke	9	21	And having charged them , he commanded [ them ] to say this to no one ,
YLT	Luke	9	22	saying -- ` It behoveth the Son of Man to suffer many things , and to be rejected by the elders , and chief priests , and scribes , and to be killed , and the third day to be raised . '
YLT	Luke	9	23	And he said unto all , ` If any one doth will to come after me , let him disown himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me ;
YLT	Luke	9	24	for whoever may will to save his life , shall lose it , and whoever may lose his life for my sake , he shall save it ;
YLT	Luke	9	25	for what is a man profited , having gained the whole world , and having lost or having forfeited himself ?
YLT	Luke	9	26	` For whoever may be ashamed of me , and of my words , of this one shall the Son of Man be ashamed , when he may come in his glory , and the Father 's , and the holy messengers ' ;
YLT	Luke	9	27	and I say to you , truly , there are certain of those here standing , who shall not taste of death till they may see the reign of God . '
YLT	Luke	9	28	And it came to pass , after these words , as it were eight days , that having taken Peter , and John , and James , he went up to the mountain to pray ,
YLT	Luke	9	29	and it came to pass , in his praying , the appearance of his face became altered , and his garment white -- sparkling .
YLT	Luke	9	30	And lo , two men were speaking together with him , who were Moses and Elijah ,
YLT	Luke	9	31	who having appeared in glory , spake of his outgoing that he was about to fulfil in Jerusalem ,
YLT	Luke	9	32	but Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep , and having waked , they saw his glory , and the two men standing with him .
YLT	Luke	9	33	And it came to pass , in their parting from him , Peter said unto Jesus , ` Master , it is good to us to be here ; and we may make three booths , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah , ' not knowing what he saith :
YLT	Luke	9	34	and as he was speaking these things , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them , and they feared in their entering into the cloud ,
YLT	Luke	9	35	and a voice came out of the cloud saying , ` This is My Son -- the Beloved ; hear ye him ; '
YLT	Luke	9	36	and when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone ; and they were silent , and declared to no one in those days anything of what they have seen .
YLT	Luke	9	37	And it came to pass on the next day , they having come down from the mount , there met him a great multitude ,
YLT	Luke	9	38	and lo , a man from the multitude cried out , saying , ` Teacher , I beseech thee , look upon my son , because he is my only begotten ;
YLT	Luke	9	39	and lo , a spirit doth take him , and suddenly he doth cry out , and it teareth him , with foaming , and it hardly departeth from him , bruising him ,
YLT	Luke	9	40	and I besought thy disciples that they might cast it out , and they were not able . '
YLT	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answering said , ` O generation , unstedfast and perverse , till when shall I be with you , and suffer you ? bring near hither thy son ; '
YLT	Luke	9	42	and as he is yet coming near , the demon rent him , and tore [ him ] sore , and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the youth , and gave him back to his father .
YLT	Luke	9	43	And they were all amazed at the greatness of God , and while all are wondering at all things that Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
YLT	Luke	9	44	` Lay ye to your ears these words , for the Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men . '
YLT	Luke	9	45	And they were not knowing this saying , and it was veiled from them , that they might not perceive it , and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
YLT	Luke	9	46	And there entered a reasoning among them , this , Who may be greater of them ?
YLT	Luke	9	47	and Jesus having seen the reasoning of their heart , having taken hold of a child , set him beside himself ,
YLT	Luke	9	48	and said to them , ` Whoever may receive this child in my name , doth receive me , and whoever may receive me , doth receive Him who sent me , for he who is least among you all -- he shall be great . '
YLT	Luke	9	49	And John answering said , ` Master , we saw a certain one in thy name casting forth the demons , and we forbade him , because he doth not follow with us ; '
YLT	Luke	9	50	and Jesus said unto him , ` Forbid not , for he who is not against us , is for us . '
YLT	Luke	9	51	And it came to pass , in the completing of the days of his being taken up , that he fixed his face to go on to Jerusalem ,
YLT	Luke	9	52	and he sent messengers before his face , and having gone on , they went into a village of Samaritans , to make ready for him ,
YLT	Luke	9	53	and they did not receive him , because his face was going on to Jerusalem .
YLT	Luke	9	54	And his disciples James and John having seen , said , ` Sir , wilt thou [ that ] we may command fire to come down from the heaven , and to consume them , as also Elijah did ? '
YLT	Luke	9	55	and having turned , he rebuked them , and said , ` Ye have not known of what spirit ye are ;
YLT	Luke	9	56	for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save ; ' and they went on to another village .
YLT	Luke	9	57	And it came to pass , as they are going on in the way , a certain one said unto him , ` I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go , sir ; '
YLT	Luke	9	58	and Jesus said to him , ` The foxes have holes , and the fowls of the heaven places of rest , but the Son of Man hath not where he may recline the head . '
YLT	Luke	9	59	And he said unto another , ` Be following me ; ' and he said , ` Sir , permit me , having gone away , first to bury my father ; '
YLT	Luke	9	60	and Jesus said to him , ` Suffer the dead to bury their own dead , and thou , having gone away , publish the reign of God . '
YLT	Luke	9	61	And another also said , ` I will follow thee , sir , but first permit me to take leave of those in my house ; '
YLT	Luke	9	62	and Jesus said unto him , ` No one having put his hand on a plough , and looking back , is fit for the reign of God . '
YLT	Luke	10	10	` And into whatever city ye do enter , and they may not receive you , having gone forth to its broad places , say ,
YLT	Luke	10	2	then said he unto them , ` The harvest indeed [ is ] abundant , but the workmen few ; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest , that He may put forth workmen to His harvest .
YLT	Luke	10	3	` Go away ; lo , I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves ;
YLT	Luke	10	4	carry no bag , no scrip , nor sandals ; and salute no one on the way ;
YLT	Luke	10	5	and into whatever house ye do enter , first say , Peace to this house ;
YLT	Luke	10	6	and if indeed there may be there the son of peace , rest on it shall your peace ; and if not so , upon you it shall turn back .
YLT	Luke	10	7	` And in that house remain , eating and drinking the things they have , for worthy [ is ] the workman of his hire ; go not from house to house ,
YLT	Luke	10	8	and into whatever city ye enter , and they may receive you , eat the things set before you ,
YLT	Luke	10	9	and heal the ailing in it , and say to them , The reign of God hath come nigh to you .
YLT	Luke	10	11	And the dust that hath cleaved to us , from your city , we do wipe off against you , but this know ye , that the reign of God hath come nigh to you ;
YLT	Luke	10	12	and I say to you , that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city .
YLT	Luke	10	13	` Wo to thee , Chorazin ; wo to thee , Bethsaida ; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you , long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes , they had reformed ;
YLT	Luke	10	14	but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you .
YLT	Luke	10	15	` And thou , Capernaum , which unto the heaven wast exalted , unto hades thou shalt be brought down .
YLT	Luke	10	16	` He who is hearing you , doth hear me ; and he who is putting you away , doth put me away ; and he who is putting me away , doth put away Him who sent me . '
YLT	Luke	10	17	And the seventy turned back with joy , saying , ` Sir , and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name ; '
YLT	Luke	10	18	and he said to them , ` I was beholding the Adversary , as lightning from the heaven having fallen ;
YLT	Luke	10	19	lo , I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions , and on all the power of the enemy , and nothing by any means shall hurt you ;
YLT	Luke	10	20	but , in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subjected to you , but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens . '
YLT	Luke	10	21	In that hour was Jesus glad in the Spirit , and said , ` I do confess to thee , Father , Lord of the heaven and of the earth , that Thou didst hide these things from wise men and understanding , and didst reveal them to babes ; yes , Father , because so it became good pleasure before Thee .
YLT	Luke	10	22	` All things were delivered up to me by my Father , and no one doth know who the Son is , except the Father , and who the Father is , except the Son , and he to whom the Son may wish to reveal [ Him ] . '
YLT	Luke	10	23	And having turned unto the disciples , he said , by themselves , ` Happy the eyes that are perceiving what ye perceive ;
YLT	Luke	10	24	for I say to you , that many prophets and kings did wish to see what ye perceive , and did not see , and to hear what ye hear , and did not hear . '
YLT	Luke	10	25	And lo , a certain lawyer stood up , trying him , and saying , ` Teacher , what having done , life age-during shall I inherit ? '
YLT	Luke	10	26	And he said unto him , ` In the law what hath been written ? how dost thou read ? '
YLT	Luke	10	27	And he answering said , ` Thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart , and out of all thy soul , and out of all thy strength , and out of all thy understanding , and thy neighbour as thyself . '
YLT	Luke	10	28	And he said to him , ` Rightly thou didst answer ; this do , and thou shalt live . '
YLT	Luke	10	29	And he , willing to declare himself righteous , said unto Jesus , ` And who is my neighbour ? '
YLT	Luke	10	30	and Jesus having taken up [ the word ] , said , ` A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among robbers , and having stripped him and inflicted blows , they went away , leaving [ him ] half dead .
YLT	Luke	10	31	` And by a coincidence a certain priest was going down in that way , and having seen him , he passed over on the opposite side ;
YLT	Luke	10	32	and in like manner also , a Levite , having been about the place , having come and seen , passed over on the opposite side .
YLT	Luke	10	33	` But a certain Samaritan , journeying , came along him , and having seen him , he was moved with compassion ,
YLT	Luke	10	34	and having come near , he bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine , and having lifted him up on his own beast , he brought him to an inn , and was careful of him ;
YLT	Luke	10	35	and on the morrow , going forth , taking out two denaries , he gave to the innkeeper , and said to him , Be careful of him , and whatever thou mayest spend more , I , in my coming again , will give back to thee .
YLT	Luke	10	36	` Who , then , of these three , seemeth to thee to have become neighbour of him who fell among the robbers ? '
YLT	Luke	10	37	and he said , ` He who did the kindness with him , ' then Jesus said to him , ` Be going on , and thou be doing in like manner . '
YLT	Luke	10	38	And it came to pass , in their going on , that he entered into a certain village , and a certain woman , by name Martha , did receive him into her house ,
YLT	Luke	10	39	and she had also a sister , called Mary , who also , having seated herself beside the feet of Jesus , was hearing the word ,
YLT	Luke	10	40	and Martha was distracted about much serving , and having stood by him , she said , ` Sir , dost thou not care that my sister left me alone to serve ? say then to her , that she may partake along with me . '
YLT	Luke	10	41	And Jesus answering said to her , ` Martha , Martha , thou art anxious and disquieted about many things ,
YLT	Luke	10	42	but of one thing there is need , and Mary the good part did choose , that shall not be taken away from her . '
YLT	Luke	11	11	` And of which of you -- the father -- if the son shall ask a loaf , a stone will he present to him ? and if a fish , will he instead of a fish , a serpent present to him ?
YLT	Luke	11	2	And he said to them , ` When ye may pray , say ye : Our Father who art in the heavens ; hallowed be Thy name : Thy reign come ; Thy will come to pass , as in heaven also on earth ;
YLT	Luke	11	3	our appointed bread be giving us daily ;
YLT	Luke	11	4	and forgive us our sins , for also we ourselves forgive every one indebted to us ; and mayest Thou not bring us into temptation ; but do Thou deliver us from the evil . '
YLT	Luke	11	5	And he said unto them , ` Who of you shall have a friend , and shall go on unto him at midnight , and may say to him , Friend , lend me three loaves ,
YLT	Luke	11	6	seeing a friend of mine came out of the way unto me , and I have not what I shall set before him ,
YLT	Luke	11	7	and he from within answering may say , Do not give me trouble , already the door hath been shut , and my children with me are in the bed , I am not able , having risen , to give to thee .
YLT	Luke	11	8	` I say to you , even if he will not give to him , having risen , because of his being his friend , yet because of his importunity , having risen , he will give him as many as he doth need ;
YLT	Luke	11	9	and I say to you , Ask , and it shall be given to you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened to you ;
YLT	Luke	11	10	for every one who is asking doth receive ; and he who is seeking doth find ; and to him who is knocking it shall be opened .
YLT	Luke	11	12	and if he may ask an egg , will he present to him a scorpion ?
YLT	Luke	11	13	If , then , ye , being evil , have known good gifts to be giving to your children , how much more shall the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those asking Him ! '
YLT	Luke	11	14	And he was casting forth a demon , and it was dumb , and it came to pass , the demon having gone forth , the dumb man spake , and the multitudes wondered ,
YLT	Luke	11	15	and certain of them said , ` By Beelzeboul , ruler of the demons , he doth cast forth the demons ; '
YLT	Luke	11	16	and others , tempting , a sign out of heaven from him were asking .
YLT	Luke	11	17	And he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , ` Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated ; and house against house doth fall ;
YLT	Luke	11	18	and if also the Adversary against himself was divided , how shall his kingdom be made to stand ? for ye say , by Beelzeboul is my casting forth the demons .
YLT	Luke	11	19	` But if I by Beelzeboul cast forth the demons -- your sons , by whom do they cast forth ? because of this your judges they shall be ;
YLT	Luke	11	20	but if by the finger of God I cast forth the demons , then come unawares upon you did the reign of God .
YLT	Luke	11	21	` When the strong man armed may keep his hall , in peace are his goods ;
YLT	Luke	11	22	but when the stronger than he , having come upon [ him ] , may overcome him , his whole-armour he doth take away in which he had trusted , and his spoils he distributeth ;
YLT	Luke	11	23	he who is not with me is against me , and he who is not gathering with me doth scatter .
YLT	Luke	11	24	` When the unclean spirit may go forth from the man it walketh through waterless places seeking rest , and not finding , it saith , I will turn back to my house whence I came forth ;
YLT	Luke	11	25	and having come , it findeth [ it ] swept and adorned ;
YLT	Luke	11	26	then doth it go , and take to it seven other spirits more evil than itself , and having entered , they dwell there , and the last of that man becometh worst than the first . '
YLT	Luke	11	27	And it came to pass , in his saying these things , a certain woman having lifted up the voice out of the multitude , said to him , ` Happy the womb that carried thee , and the paps that thou didst suck ! '
YLT	Luke	11	28	And he said , ` Yea , rather , happy those hearing the word of God , and keeping [ it ] ! '
YLT	Luke	11	29	And the multitudes crowding together upon him , he began to say , ` This generation is evil , a sign it doth seek after , and a sign shall not be given to it , except the sign of Jonah the prophet ,
YLT	Luke	11	30	for as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so also shall the Son of Man be to this generation .
YLT	Luke	11	31	` A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and lo , greater than Solomon here !
YLT	Luke	11	32	` Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it , because they reformed at the proclamation of Jonah ; and lo , greater than Jonah here !
YLT	Luke	11	33	` And no one having lighted a lamp , doth put [ it ] in a secret place , nor under the measure , but on the lamp-stand , that those coming in may behold the light .
YLT	Luke	11	34	` The lamp of the body is the eye , when then thine eye may be simple , thy whole body also is lightened ; and when it may be evil , thy body also is darkened ;
YLT	Luke	11	35	take heed , then , lest the light that [ is ] in thee be darkness ;
YLT	Luke	11	36	if then thy whole body is lightened , not having any part darkened , the whole shall be lightened , as when the lamp by the brightness may give thee light . '
YLT	Luke	11	37	And in [ his ] speaking , a certain Pharisee was asking him that he might dine with him , and having gone in , he reclined ( at meat ) ,
YLT	Luke	11	38	and the Pharisee having seen , did wonder that he did not first baptize himself before the dinner .
YLT	Luke	11	39	And the Lord said unto him , ` Now do ye , the Pharisees , the outside of the cup and of the plate make clean , but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness ;
YLT	Luke	11	40	unthinking ! did not He who made the outside also the inside make ?
YLT	Luke	11	41	But what ye have give ye [ as ] alms , and , lo , all things are clean to you .
YLT	Luke	11	42	` But wo to you , the Pharisees , because ye tithe the mint , and the rue , and every herb , and ye pass by the judgment , and the love of God ; these things it behoveth to do , and those not to be neglecting .
YLT	Luke	11	43	` Wo to you , the Pharisees , because ye love the first seats in the synagogues , and the salutations in the market-places .
YLT	Luke	11	44	` Wo to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , because ye are as the unseen tombs , and the men walking above have not known . '
YLT	Luke	11	45	And one of the lawyers answering , saith to him , ` Teacher , these things saying , us also thou dost insult ; '
YLT	Luke	11	46	and he said , ` And to you , the lawyers , wo ! because ye burden men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves with one of your fingers do not touch the burdens .
YLT	Luke	11	47	` Wo to you , because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
YLT	Luke	11	48	Then do ye testify , and are well pleased with the works of your fathers , because they indeed killed them , and ye do build their tombs ;
YLT	Luke	11	49	because of this also the wisdom of God said : I will send to them prophets , and apostles , and some of them they shall kill and persecute ,
YLT	Luke	11	50	that the blood of all the prophets , that is being poured forth from the foundation of the world , may be required from this generation ;
YLT	Luke	11	51	from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias , who perished between the altar and the house ; yes , I say to you , It shall be required from this generation .
YLT	Luke	11	52	` Wo to you , the lawyers , because ye took away the key of the knowledge ; yourselves ye did not enter ; and those coming in , ye did hinder . '
YLT	Luke	11	53	And in his speaking these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began fearfully to urge and to press him to speak about many things ,
YLT	Luke	11	54	laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him .
YLT	Luke	12	12	for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that hour what it behoveth [ you ] to say . '
YLT	Luke	12	2	and there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known ;
YLT	Luke	12	3	because whatever in the darkness ye said , in the light shall be heard : and what to the ear ye spake in the inner-chambers , shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops .
YLT	Luke	12	4	` And I say to you , my friends , be not afraid of those killing the body , and after these things are not having anything over to do ;
YLT	Luke	12	5	but I will show to you , whom ye may fear ; Fear him who , after the killing , is having authority to cast to the gehenna ; yes , I say to you , Fear ye Him .
YLT	Luke	12	6	` Are not five sparrows sold for two assars ? and one of them is not forgotten before God ,
YLT	Luke	12	7	but even the hairs of your head have been all numbered ; therefore fear ye not , than many sparrows ye are of more value .
YLT	Luke	12	8	` And I say to you , Every one -- whoever may confess with me before men , the Son of Man also shall confess with him before the messengers of God ,
YLT	Luke	12	9	and he who hath denied me before men , shall be denied before the messengers of God ,
YLT	Luke	12	10	and every one whoever shall say a word to the Son of Man , it shall be forgiven to him , but to him who to the Holy Spirit did speak evil , it shall not be forgiven .
YLT	Luke	12	11	` And when they bring you before the synagogues , and the rulers , and the authorities , be not anxious how or what ye may reply , or what ye may say ,
YLT	Luke	12	13	And a certain one said to him , out of the multitude , ` Teacher , say to my brother to divide with me the inheritance . '
YLT	Luke	12	14	And he said to him , ` Man , who set me a judge or a divider over you ? '
YLT	Luke	12	15	And he said unto them , ` Observe , and beware of the covetousness , because not in the abundance of one 's goods is his life . '
YLT	Luke	12	16	And he spake a simile unto them , saying , ` Of a certain rich man the field brought forth well ;
YLT	Luke	12	17	and he was reasoning within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have not where I shall gather together my fruits ?
YLT	Luke	12	18	and he said , This I will do , I will take down my storehouses , and greater ones I will build , and I will gather together there all my products and my good things ,
YLT	Luke	12	19	and I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast many good things laid up for many years , be resting , eat , drink , be merry .
YLT	Luke	12	20	` And God said to him , Unthinking one ! this night thy soul they shall require from thee , and what things thou didst prepare -- to whom shall they be ?
YLT	Luke	12	21	so [ is ] he who is treasuring up to himself , and is not rich toward God . '
YLT	Luke	12	22	And he said unto his disciples , ` Because of this , to you I say , Be not anxious for your life , what ye may eat ; nor for the body , what ye may put on ;
YLT	Luke	12	23	the life is more than the nourishment , and the body than the clothing .
YLT	Luke	12	24	` Consider the ravens , that they sow not , nor reap , to which there is no barn nor storehouse , and God doth nourish them ; how much better are ye than the fowls ?
YLT	Luke	12	25	and who of you , being anxious , is able to add to his age one cubit ?
YLT	Luke	12	26	If , then , ye are not able for the least -- why for the rest are ye anxious ?
YLT	Luke	12	27	` Consider the lilies , how do they grow ? they labour not , nor do they spin , and I say to you , not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these ;
YLT	Luke	12	28	and if the herbage in the field , that to-day is , and to-morrow into an oven is cast , God doth so clothe , how much more you -- ye of little faith ?
YLT	Luke	12	29	` And ye -- seek not what ye may eat , or what ye may drink , and be not in suspense ,
YLT	Luke	12	30	for all these things do the nations of the world seek after , and your Father hath known that ye have need of these things ;
YLT	Luke	12	31	but , seek ye the reign of God , and all these things shall be added to you .
YLT	Luke	12	32	` Fear not , little flock , because your Father did delight to give you the reign ;
YLT	Luke	12	33	sell your goods , and give alms , make to yourselves bags that become not old , a treasure unfailing in the heavens , where thief doth not come near , nor moth destroy ;
YLT	Luke	12	34	for where your treasure is , there also your heart will be .
YLT	Luke	12	35	` Let your loins be girded , and the lamps burning ,
YLT	Luke	12	36	and ye like to men waiting for their lord , when he shall return out of the wedding feasts , that he having come and knocked , immediately they may open to him .
YLT	Luke	12	37	` Happy those servants , whom the lord , having come , shall find watching ; verily I say to you , that he will gird himself , and will cause them to recline ( at meat ) , and having come near , will minister to them ;
YLT	Luke	12	38	and if he may come in the second watch , and in the third watch he may come , and may find [ it ] so , happy are those servants .
YLT	Luke	12	39	` And this know , that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief doth come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken through ;
YLT	Luke	12	40	and ye , then , become ye ready , because at the hour ye think not , the Son of Man doth come . '
YLT	Luke	12	41	And Peter said to him , ` Sir , unto us this simile dost thou speak , or also unto all ? '
YLT	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , ` Who , then , is the faithful and prudent steward whom the lord shall set over his household , to give in season the wheat measure ?
YLT	Luke	12	43	Happy that servant , whom his lord , having come , shall find doing so ;
YLT	Luke	12	44	truly I say to you , that over all his goods he will set him .
YLT	Luke	12	45	` And if that servant may say in his heart , My lord doth delay to come , and may begin to beat the men-servants and the maid-servants , to eat also , and to drink , and to be drunken ;
YLT	Luke	12	46	the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he doth not look for [ him ] , and in an hour that he doth not know , and will cut him off , and his portion with the unfaithful he will appoint .
YLT	Luke	12	47	` And that servant , who having known his lord 's will , and not having prepared , nor having gone according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes ,
YLT	Luke	12	48	and he who , not having known , and having done things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few ; and to every one to whom much was given , much shall be required from him ; and to whom they did commit much , more abundantly they will ask of him .
YLT	Luke	12	49	` Fire I came to cast to the earth , and what will I if already it was kindled ?
YLT	Luke	12	50	but I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how am I pressed till it may be completed !
YLT	Luke	12	51	` Think ye that peace I came to give in the earth ? no , I say to you , but rather division ;
YLT	Luke	12	52	for there shall be henceforth five in one house divided -- three against two , and two against three ;
YLT	Luke	12	53	a father shall be divided against a son , and a son against a father , a mother against a daughter , and a daughter against a mother , a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law . '
YLT	Luke	12	54	And he said also to the multitudes , ` When ye may see the cloud rising from the west , immediately ye say , A shower doth come , and it is so ;
YLT	Luke	12	55	and when -- a south wind blowing , ye say , that there will be heat , and it is ;
YLT	Luke	12	56	hypocrites ! the face of the earth and of the heaven ye have known to make proof of , but this time -- how do ye not make proof of [ it ] ?
YLT	Luke	12	57	` And why , also , of yourselves , judge ye not what is righteous ?
YLT	Luke	12	58	for , as thou art going away with thy opponent to the ruler , in the way give diligence to be released from him , lest he may drag thee unto the judge , and the judge may deliver thee to the officer , and the officer may cast thee into prison ;
YLT	Luke	12	59	I say to thee , thou mayest not come forth thence till even the last mite thou mayest give back . '
YLT	Luke	13	13	and he laid on her [ his ] hands , and presently she was set upright , and was glorifying God .
YLT	Luke	13	2	and Jesus answering said to them , ` Think ye that these Galileans became sinners beyond all the Galileans , because they have suffered such things ?
YLT	Luke	13	3	No -- I say to you , but , if ye may not reform , all ye even so shall perish .
YLT	Luke	13	4	` Or those eighteen , on whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them ; think ye that these became debtors beyond all men who are dwelling in Jerusalem ?
YLT	Luke	13	5	No -- I say to you , but , if ye may not reform , all ye in like manner shall perish . '
YLT	Luke	13	6	And he spake this simile : ` A certain one had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit in it , and he did not find ;
YLT	Luke	13	7	and he said unto the vine-dresser , Lo , three years I come seeking fruit in this fig-tree , and do not find , cut it off , why also the ground doth it render useless ?
YLT	Luke	13	8	` And he answering saith to him , Sir , suffer it also this year , till that I may dig about it , and cast in dung ;
YLT	Luke	13	9	and if indeed it may bear fruit -- ; and if not so , thereafter thou shalt cut it off . '
YLT	Luke	13	10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath ,
YLT	Luke	13	11	and lo , there was a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and she was bowed together , and not able to bend back at all ,
YLT	Luke	13	12	and Jesus having seen her , did call [ her ] near , and said to her , ` Woman , thou hast been loosed from thy infirmity ; '
YLT	Luke	13	14	And the chief of the synagogue answering -- much displeased that on the sabbath Jesus healed -- said to the multitude , ` Six days there are in which it behoveth [ us ] to be working ; in these , then , coming , be healed , and not on the sabbath-day . '
YLT	Luke	13	15	Then the Lord answered him and said , ` Hypocrite , doth not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass from the stall , and having led away , doth water [ it ] ?
YLT	Luke	13	16	and this one , being a daughter of Abraham , whom the Adversary bound , lo , eighteen years , did it not behove to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day ? '
YLT	Luke	13	17	And he saying these things , all who were opposed to him were being ashamed , and all the multitude were rejoicing over all the glorious things that are being done by him .
YLT	Luke	13	18	And he said , ` To what is the reign of God like ? and to what shall I liken it ?
YLT	Luke	13	19	It is like to a grain of mustard , which a man having taken , did cast into his garden , and it increased , and came to a great tree , and the fowls of the heavens did rest in its branches . '
YLT	Luke	13	20	And again he said , ` To what shall I liken the reign of God ?
YLT	Luke	13	21	It is like leaven , which a woman , having taken , did hide in three measures of meal , till that all was leavened . '
YLT	Luke	13	22	And he was going through cities and villages , teaching , and making progress toward Jerusalem ;
YLT	Luke	13	23	and a certain one said to him , ` Sir , are those saved few ? ' and he said unto them ,
YLT	Luke	13	24	` Be striving to go in through the straight gate , because many , I say to you , will seek to go in , and shall not be able ;
YLT	Luke	13	25	from the time the master of the house may have risen up , and may have shut the door , and ye may begin without to stand , and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , lord , open to us , and he answering shall say to you , I have not known you whence ye are ,
YLT	Luke	13	26	then ye may begin to say , We did eat before thee , and did drink , and in our broad places thou didst teach ;
YLT	Luke	13	27	and he shall say , I say to you , I have not known you whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of the unrighteousness .
YLT	Luke	13	28	` There shall be there the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth , when ye may see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the reign of God , and yourselves being cast out without ;
YLT	Luke	13	29	and they shall come from east and west , and from north and south , and shall recline in the reign of God ,
YLT	Luke	13	30	and lo , there are last who shall be first , and there are first who shall be last . '
YLT	Luke	13	31	On that day there came near certain Pharisees , saying to him , ` Go forth , and be going on hence , for Herod doth wish to kill thee ; '
YLT	Luke	13	32	and he said to them , ` Having gone , say to this fox , Lo , I cast forth demons , and perfect cures to-day and to-morrow , and the third [ day ] I am being perfected ;
YLT	Luke	13	33	but it behoveth me to-day , and to-morrow , and the [ day ] following , to go on , because it is not possible for a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem .
YLT	Luke	13	34	` Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that is killing the prophets , and stoning those sent unto her , how often did I will to gather together thy children , as a hen her brood under the wings , and ye did not will .
YLT	Luke	13	35	` Lo , your house is being left to you desolate , and verily I say to you -- ye may not see me , till it may come , when ye may say , Blessed [ is ] he who is coming in the name of the Lord . '
YLT	Luke	14	14	and happy thou shalt be , because they have not to recompense thee , for it shall be recompensed to thee in the rising again of the righteous . '
YLT	Luke	14	2	and lo , there was a certain dropsical man before him ;
YLT	Luke	14	3	and Jesus answering spake to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , ` Is it lawful on the sabbath-day to heal ? '
YLT	Luke	14	4	and they were silent , and having taken hold of [ him ] , he healed him , and let [ him ] go ;
YLT	Luke	14	5	and answering them he said , ` Of which of you shall an ass or ox fall into a pit , and he will not immediately draw it up on the sabbath-day ? '
YLT	Luke	14	6	and they were not able to answer him again unto these things .
YLT	Luke	14	7	And he spake a simile unto those called , marking how they were choosing out the first couches , saying unto them ,
YLT	Luke	14	8	` When thou mayest be called by any one to marriage-feasts , thou mayest not recline on the first couch , lest a more honourable than thou may have been called by him ,
YLT	Luke	14	9	and he who did call thee and him having come shall say to thee , Give to this one place , and then thou mayest begin with shame to occupy the last place .
YLT	Luke	14	10	` But , when thou mayest be called , having gone on , recline in the last place , that when he who called thee may come , he may say to thee , Friend , come up higher ; then thou shalt have glory before those reclining with thee ;
YLT	Luke	14	11	because every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled , and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted . '
YLT	Luke	14	12	And he said also to him who did call him , ` When thou mayest make a dinner or a supper , be not calling thy friends , nor thy brethren , nor thy kindred , nor rich neighbours , lest they may also call thee again , and a recompense may come to thee ;
YLT	Luke	14	13	but when thou mayest make a feast , be calling poor , maimed , lame , blind ,
YLT	Luke	14	15	And one of those reclining with him , having heard these things , said to him , ` Happy [ is ] he who shall eat bread in the reign of God ; '
YLT	Luke	14	16	and he said to him , ` A certain man made a great supper , and called many ,
YLT	Luke	14	17	and he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to those having been called , Be coming , because now are all things ready .
YLT	Luke	14	18	` And they began with one consent all to excuse themselves : The first said to him , A field I bought , and I have need to go forth and see it ; I beg of thee , have me excused .
YLT	Luke	14	19	` And another said , Five yoke of oxen I bought , and I go on to prove them ; I beg of thee , have me excused :
YLT	Luke	14	20	and another said , A wife I married , and because of this I am not able to come .
YLT	Luke	14	21	` And that servant having come , told to his lord these things , then the master of the house , having been angry , said to his servant , Go forth quickly to the broad places and lanes of the city , and the poor , and maimed , and lame , and blind , bring in hither .
YLT	Luke	14	22	` And the servant said , Sir , it hath been done as thou didst command , and still there is room .
YLT	Luke	14	23	` And the lord said unto the servant , Go forth to the ways and hedges , and constrain to come in , that my house may be filled ;
YLT	Luke	14	24	for I say to you , that none of those men who have been called shall taste of my supper . '
YLT	Luke	14	25	And there were going on with him great multitudes , and having turned , he said unto them ,
YLT	Luke	14	26	` If any one doth come unto me , and doth not hate his own father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brothers , and sisters , and yet even his own life , he is not able to be my disciple ;
YLT	Luke	14	27	and whoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , is not able to be my disciple .
YLT	Luke	14	28	` For who of you , willing to build a tower , doth not first , having sat down , count the expense , whether he have the things for completing ?
YLT	Luke	14	29	lest that he having laid a foundation , and not being able to finish , all who are beholding may begin to mock him ,
YLT	Luke	14	30	saying -- This man began to build , and was not able to finish .
YLT	Luke	14	31	` Or what king going on to engage with another king in war , doth not , having sat down , first consult if he be able with ten thousand to meet him who with twenty thousand is coming against him ?
YLT	Luke	14	32	and if not so -- he being yet a long way off -- having sent an embassy , he doth ask the things for peace .
YLT	Luke	14	33	` So , then , every one of you who doth not take leave of all that he himself hath , is not able to be my disciple .
YLT	Luke	14	34	` The salt [ is ] good , but if the salt doth become tasteless , with what shall it be seasoned ?
YLT	Luke	14	35	neither for land nor for manure is it fit -- they cast it without . He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear . '
YLT	Luke	15	15	and having gone on , he joined himself to one of the citizens of that country , and he sent him to the fields to feed swine ,
YLT	Luke	15	2	and the Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring , saying -- This one doth receive sinners , and doth eat with them . '
YLT	Luke	15	3	And he spake unto them this simile , saying ,
YLT	Luke	15	4	` What man of you having a hundred sheep , and having lost one out of them , doth not leave behind the ninety-nine in the wilderness , and go on after the lost one , till he may find it ?
YLT	Luke	15	5	and having found , he doth lay [ it ] on his shoulders rejoicing ,
YLT	Luke	15	6	and having come to the house , he doth call together the friends and the neighbours , saying to them , Rejoice with me , because I found my sheep -- the lost one .
YLT	Luke	15	7	` I say to you , that so joy shall be in the heaven over one sinner reforming , rather than over ninety-nine righteous men , who have no need of reformation .
YLT	Luke	15	8	` Or what woman having ten drachms , if she may lose one drachm , doth not light a lamp , and sweep the house , and seek carefully till that she may find ?
YLT	Luke	15	9	and having found , she doth call together the female friends and the neighbours , saying , Rejoice with me , for I found the drachm that I lost .
YLT	Luke	15	10	` So I say to you , joy doth come before the messengers of God over one sinner reforming . '
YLT	Luke	15	11	And he said , ` A certain man had two sons ,
YLT	Luke	15	12	and the younger of them said to the father , Father , give me the portion of the substance falling to [ me ] , and he divided to them the living .
YLT	Luke	15	13	` And not many days after , having gathered all together , the younger son went abroad to a far country , and there he scattered his substance , living riotously ;
YLT	Luke	15	14	and he having spent all , there came a mighty famine on that country , and himself began to be in want ;
YLT	Luke	15	16	and he was desirous to fill his belly from the husks that the swine were eating , and no one was giving to him .
YLT	Luke	15	17	` And having come to himself , he said , How many hirelings of my father have a superabundance of bread , and I here with hunger am perishing !
YLT	Luke	15	18	having risen , I will go on unto my father , and will say to him , Father , I did sin -- to the heaven , and before thee ,
YLT	Luke	15	19	and no more am I worthy to be called thy son ; make me as one of thy hirelings .
YLT	Luke	15	20	` And having risen , he went unto his own father , and he being yet far distant , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and having ran he fell upon his neck and kissed him ;
YLT	Luke	15	21	and the son said to him , Father , I did sin -- to the heaven , and before thee , and no more am I worthy to be called thy son .
YLT	Luke	15	22	` And the father said unto his servants , Bring forth the first robe , and clothe him , and give a ring for his hand , and sandals for the feet ;
YLT	Luke	15	23	and having brought the fatted calf , kill [ it ] , and having eaten , we may be merry ,
YLT	Luke	15	24	because this my son was dead , and did live again , and he was lost , and was found ; and they began to be merry .
YLT	Luke	15	25	` And his elder son was in a field , and as , coming , he drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing ,
YLT	Luke	15	26	and having called near one of the young men , he was inquiring what these things might be ,
YLT	Luke	15	27	and he said to him -- Thy brother is arrived , and thy father did kill the fatted calf , because in health he did receive him back .
YLT	Luke	15	28	` And he was angry , and would not go in , therefore his father , having come forth , was entreating him ;
YLT	Luke	15	29	and he answering said to the father , Lo , so many years I do serve thee , and never thy command did I transgress , and to me thou didst never give a kid , that with my friends I might make merry ;
YLT	Luke	15	30	but when thy son -- this one who did devour thy living with harlots -- came , thou didst kill to him the fatted calf .
YLT	Luke	15	31	` And he said to him , Child , thou art always with me , and all my things are thine ;
YLT	Luke	15	32	but to be merry , and to be glad , it was needful , because this thy brother was dead , and did live again , he was lost , and was found . '
YLT	Luke	16	16	the law and the prophets [ are ] till John ; since then the reign of God is proclaimed good news , and every one doth press into it ;
YLT	Luke	16	2	and having called him , he said to him , What [ is ] this I hear about thee ? render the account of thy stewardship , for thou mayest not any longer be steward .
YLT	Luke	16	3	` And the steward said in himself , What shall I do , because my lord doth take away the stewardship from me ? to dig I am not able , to beg I am ashamed : --
YLT	Luke	16	4	I have known what I shall do , that , when I may be removed from the stewardship , they may receive me to their houses .
YLT	Luke	16	5	` And having called near each one of his lord 's debtors , he said to the first , How much dost thou owe to my lord ?
YLT	Luke	16	6	and he said , A hundred baths of oil ; and he said to him , Take thy bill , and having sat down write fifty .
YLT	Luke	16	7	` Afterward to another he said , And thou , how much dost thou owe ? and he said , A hundred cors of wheat ; and he saith to him , Take thy bill , and write eighty .
YLT	Luke	16	8	` And the lord commended the unrighteous steward that he did prudently , because the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of the light , in respect to their generation .
YLT	Luke	16	9	and I say to you , Make to yourselves friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness , that when ye may fail , they may receive you to the age-during tabernacles .
YLT	Luke	16	10	` He who is faithful in the least , [ is ] also faithful in much ; and he who in the least [ is ] unrighteous , is also unrighteous in much ;
YLT	Luke	16	11	if , then , in the unrighteous mammon ye became not faithful -- the true who will entrust to you ?
YLT	Luke	16	12	and if in the other 's ye became not faithful -- your own , who shall give to you ?
YLT	Luke	16	13	` No domestic is able to serve two lords , for either the one he will hate , and the other he will love ; or one he will hold to , and of the other he will be heedless ; ye are not able to serve God and mammon . '
YLT	Luke	16	14	And also the Pharisees , being lovers of money , were hearing all these things , and were deriding him ,
YLT	Luke	16	15	and he said to them , ` Ye are those declaring yourselves righteous before men , but God doth know your hearts ; because that which among men is high , [ is ] abomination before God ;
YLT	Luke	16	17	and it is easier to the heaven and the earth to pass away , than of the law one tittle to fall .
YLT	Luke	16	18	` Every one who is sending away his wife , and marrying another , doth commit adultery ; and every one who is marrying her sent away from a husband doth commit adultery .
YLT	Luke	16	19	` And -- a certain man was rich , and was clothed in purple and fine linen , making merry sumptuously every day ,
YLT	Luke	16	20	and there was a certain poor man , by name Lazarus , who was laid at his porch , full of sores ,
YLT	Luke	16	21	and desiring to be filled from the crumbs that are falling from the table of the rich man ; yea , also the dogs , coming , were licking his sores .
YLT	Luke	16	22	` And it came to pass , that the poor man died , and that he was carried away by the messengers to the bosom of Abraham -- and the rich man also died , and was buried ;
YLT	Luke	16	23	and in the hades having lifted up his eyes , being in torments , he doth see Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom ,
YLT	Luke	16	24	and having cried , he said , Father Abraham , deal kindly with me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and may cool my tongue , because I am distressed in this flame .
YLT	Luke	16	25	` And Abraham said , Child , remember that thou did receive -- thou -- thy good things in thy life , and Lazarus in like manner the evil things , and now he is comforted , and thou art distressed ;
YLT	Luke	16	26	and besides all these things , between us and you a great chasm is fixed , so that they who are willing to go over from hence unto you are not able , nor do they from thence to us pass through .
YLT	Luke	16	27	` And he said , I pray thee , then , father , that thou mayest send him to the house of my father ,
YLT	Luke	16	28	for I have five brothers , so that he may thoroughly testify to them , that they also may not come to this place of torment .
YLT	Luke	16	29	` Abraham saith to him , They have Moses and the prophets , let them hear them ;
YLT	Luke	16	30	and he said , No , father Abraham , but if any one from the dead may go unto them , they will reform .
YLT	Luke	16	31	And he said to him , If Moses and the prophets they do not hear , neither if one may rise out of the dead will they be persuaded . '
YLT	Luke	17	17	And Jesus answering said , ` Were not the ten cleansed , and the nine -- where ?
YLT	Luke	17	2	it is more profitable to him if a weighty millstone is put round about his neck , and he hath been cast into the sea , than that he may cause one of these little ones to stumble .
YLT	Luke	17	3	` Take heed to yourselves , and , if thy brother may sin in regard to thee , rebuke him , and if he may reform , forgive him ,
YLT	Luke	17	4	and if seven times in the day he may sin against thee , and seven times in the day may turn back to thee , saying , I reform ; thou shalt forgive him . '
YLT	Luke	17	5	And the apostles said to the Lord , ` Add to us faith ; '
YLT	Luke	17	6	and the Lord said , ` If ye had faith as a grain of mustard , ye would have said to this sycamine , Be uprooted , and be planted in the sea , and it would have obeyed you .
YLT	Luke	17	7	` But , who is he of you -- having a servant ploughing or feeding -- who , to him having come in out of the field , will say , Having come near , recline at meat ?
YLT	Luke	17	8	but will not [ rather ] say to him , Prepare what I may sup , and having girded thyself about , minister to me , till I eat and drink , and after these things thou shalt eat and drink ?
YLT	Luke	17	9	Hath he favour to that servant because he did the things directed ? I think not .
YLT	Luke	17	10	` So also ye , when ye may have done all the things directed you , say -- We are unprofitable servants , because that which we owed to do -- we have done . '
YLT	Luke	17	11	And it came to pass , in his going on to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee ,
YLT	Luke	17	12	and he entering into a certain village , there met him ten leprous men , who stood afar off ,
YLT	Luke	17	13	and they lifted up the voice , saying , ` Jesus , master , deal kindly with us ; '
YLT	Luke	17	14	and having seen [ them ] , he said to them , ` Having gone on , shew yourselves to the priests ; ' and it came to pass , in their going , they were cleansed ,
YLT	Luke	17	15	and one of them having seen that he was healed did turn back , with a loud voice glorifying God ,
YLT	Luke	17	16	and he fell upon [ his ] face at his feet , giving thanks to him , and he was a Samaritan .
YLT	Luke	17	18	There were not found who did turn back to give glory to God , except this alien ; '
YLT	Luke	17	19	and he said to him , ` Having risen , be going on , thy faith hath saved thee . '
YLT	Luke	17	20	And having been questioned by the Pharisees , when the reign of God doth come , he answered them , and said , ` The reign of God doth not come with observation ;
YLT	Luke	17	21	nor shall they say , Lo , here ; or lo , there ; for lo , the reign of God is within you . '
YLT	Luke	17	22	And he said unto his disciples , ` Days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and ye shall not behold [ it ] ;
YLT	Luke	17	23	and they shall say to you , Lo , here ; or lo , there ; ye may not go away , nor follow ;
YLT	Luke	17	24	for as the lightning that is lightening out of the one [ part ] under heaven , to the other part under heaven doth shine , so shall be also the Son of Man in his day ;
YLT	Luke	17	25	and first it behoveth him to suffer many things , and to be rejected by this generation .
YLT	Luke	17	26	` And , as it came to pass in the days of Noah , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man ;
YLT	Luke	17	27	they were eating , they were drinking , they were marrying , they were given in marriage , till the day that Noah entered into the ark , and the deluge came , and destroyed all ;
YLT	Luke	17	28	in like manner also , as it came to pass in the days of Lot ; they were eating , they were drinking , they were buying , they were selling , they were planting , they were building ;
YLT	Luke	17	29	and on the day Lot went forth from Sodom , He rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed all .
YLT	Luke	17	30	` According to these things it shall be , in the day the Son of Man is revealed ;
YLT	Luke	17	31	in that day , he who shall be on the house top , and his vessels in the house , let him not come down to take them away ; and he in the field , in like manner , let him not turn backward ;
YLT	Luke	17	32	remember the wife of Lot .
YLT	Luke	17	33	Whoever may seek to save his life , shall lose it ; and whoever may lose it , shall preserve it .
YLT	Luke	17	34	` I say to you , In that night , there shall be two men on one couch , the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left ;
YLT	Luke	17	35	two women shall be grinding at the same place together , the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left ;
YLT	Luke	17	36	two men shall be in the field , the one shall be taken , and the other left . '
YLT	Luke	17	37	And they answering say to him , ` Where , sir ? ' and he said to them , ` Where the body [ is ] , there will the eagles be gathered together . '
YLT	Luke	18	18	And a certain ruler questioned him , saying , ` Good teacher , what having done -- shall I inherit life age-during ? '
YLT	Luke	18	2	saying , ` A certain judge was in a certain city -- God he is not fearing , and man he is not regarding --
YLT	Luke	18	3	and a widow was in that city , and she was coming unto him , saying , Do me justice on my opponent ,
YLT	Luke	18	4	and he would not for a time , but after these things he said in himself , Even if God I do not fear , and man do not regard ,
YLT	Luke	18	5	yet because this widow doth give me trouble , I will do her justice , lest , perpetually coming , she may plague me . '
YLT	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said , ` Hear ye what the unrighteous judge saith :
YLT	Luke	18	7	and shall not God execute the justice to His choice ones , who are crying unto Him day and night -- bearing long in regard to them ?
YLT	Luke	18	8	I say to you , that He will execute the justice to them quickly ; but the Son of Man having come , shall he find the faith upon the earth ? '
YLT	Luke	18	9	And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in themselves that they were righteous , and have been despising the rest , this simile :
YLT	Luke	18	10	` Two men went up to the temple to pray , the one a Pharisee , and the other a tax-gatherer ;
YLT	Luke	18	11	the Pharisee having stood by himself , thus prayed : God , I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men , rapacious , unrighteous , adulterers , or even as this tax-gatherer ;
YLT	Luke	18	12	I fast twice in the week , I give tithes of all things -- as many as I possess .
YLT	Luke	18	13	` And the tax-gatherer , having stood afar off , would not even the eyes lift up to the heaven , but was smiting on his breast , saying , God be propitious to me -- the sinner !
YLT	Luke	18	14	I say to you , this one went down declared righteous , to his house , rather than that one : for every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled , and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted . '
YLT	Luke	18	15	And they were bringing near also the babes , that he may touch them , and the disciples having seen did rebuke them ,
YLT	Luke	18	16	and Jesus having called them near , said , ` Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not , for of such is the reign of God ;
YLT	Luke	18	17	verily I say to you , Whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child , may not enter into it . '
YLT	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said to him , ` Why me dost thou call good ? no one [ is ] good , except One -- God ;
YLT	Luke	18	20	the commands thou hast known : Thou mayest not commit adultery , Thou mayest do no murder , Thou mayest not steal , Thou mayest not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother . '
YLT	Luke	18	21	And he said , ` All these I did keep from my youth ; '
YLT	Luke	18	22	and having heard these things , Jesus said to him , ` Yet one thing to thee is lacking ; all things -- as many as thou hast -- sell , and distribute to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , be following me ; '
YLT	Luke	18	23	and he , having heard these things , became very sorrowful , for he was exceeding rich .
YLT	Luke	18	24	And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful , said , ` How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of God !
YLT	Luke	18	25	for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to enter , than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter . '
YLT	Luke	18	26	And those who heard , said , ` And who is able to be saved ? '
YLT	Luke	18	27	and he said , ` The things impossible with men are possible with God . '
YLT	Luke	18	28	And Peter said , ` Lo , we left all , and did follow thee ; '
YLT	Luke	18	29	and he said to them , ` Verily I say to you , that there is not one who left house , or parents , or brothers , or wife , or children , for the sake of the reign of God ,
YLT	Luke	18	30	who may not receive back manifold more in this time , and in the coming age , life age-during . '
YLT	Luke	18	31	And having taken the twelve aside , he said unto them , ` Lo , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things shall be completed -- that have been written through the prophets -- to the Son of Man ,
YLT	Luke	18	32	for he shall be delivered up to the nations , and shall be mocked , and insulted , and spit upon ,
YLT	Luke	18	33	and having scourged they shall put him to death , and on the third day he shall rise again . '
YLT	Luke	18	34	And they none of these things understood , and this saying was hid from them , and they were not knowing the things said .
YLT	Luke	18	35	And it came to pass , in his coming nigh to Jericho , a certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging ,
YLT	Luke	18	36	and having heard a multitude going by , he was inquiring what this may be ,
YLT	Luke	18	37	and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene doth pass by ,
YLT	Luke	18	38	and he cried out , saying , ` Jesus , Son of David , deal kindly with me ; '
YLT	Luke	18	39	and those going before were rebuking him , that he might be silent , but he was much more crying out , ` Son of David , deal kindly with me . '
YLT	Luke	18	40	And Jesus having stood , commanded him to be brought unto him , and he having come nigh , he questioned him ,
YLT	Luke	18	41	saying , ` What wilt thou I shall do to thee ? ' and he said , ` Sir , that I may receive sight . '
YLT	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said to him , ` Receive thy sight ; thy faith hath saved thee ; '
YLT	Luke	18	43	and presently he did receive sight , and was following him , glorifying God ; and all the people , having seen , did give praise to God .
YLT	Luke	19	19	and he said also to this one , And thou , become thou over five cities .
YLT	Luke	19	2	and lo , a man , by name called Zaccheus , and he was a chief tax-gatherer , and he was rich ,
YLT	Luke	19	3	and he was seeking to see Jesus , who he is , and was not able for the multitude , because in stature he was small ,
YLT	Luke	19	4	and having run forward before , he went up on a sycamore , that he may see him , because through that [ way ] he was about to pass by .
YLT	Luke	19	5	And as Jesus came up to the place , having looked up , he saw him , and said unto him , ` Zaccheus , having hastened , come down , for to-day in thy house it behoveth me to remain ; '
YLT	Luke	19	6	and he having hastened did come down , and did receive him rejoicing ;
YLT	Luke	19	7	and having seen [ it ] , they were all murmuring , saying -- ` With a sinful man he went in to lodge ! '
YLT	Luke	19	8	And Zaccheus having stood , said unto the Lord , ` Lo , the half of my goods , sir , I give to the poor , and if of any one anything I did take by false accusation , I give back fourfold . '
YLT	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said unto him -- ` To-day salvation did come to this house , inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham ;
YLT	Luke	19	10	for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost . '
YLT	Luke	19	11	And while they are hearing these things , having added he spake a simile , because of his being nigh to Jerusalem , and of their thinking that the reign of God is about presently to be made manifest .
YLT	Luke	19	12	He said therefore , ` A certain man of birth went on to a far country , to take to himself a kingdom , and to return ,
YLT	Luke	19	13	and having called ten servants of his own , he gave to them ten pounds , and said unto them , Do business -- till I come ;
YLT	Luke	19	14	and his citizens were hating him , and did send an embassy after him , saying , We do not wish this one to reign over us .
YLT	Luke	19	15	` And it came to pass , on his coming back , having taken the kingdom , that he commanded these servants to be called to him , to whom he gave the money , that he might know what any one had done in business .
YLT	Luke	19	16	` And the first came near , saying , Sir , thy pound did gain ten pounds ;
YLT	Luke	19	17	and he said to him , Well done , good servant , because in a very little thou didst become faithful , be having authority over ten cities .
YLT	Luke	19	18	` And the second came , saying , Sir , thy pound made five pounds ;
YLT	Luke	19	20	` And another came , saying , Sir , lo , thy pound , that I had lying away in a napkin ;
YLT	Luke	19	21	for I was afraid of thee , because thou art an austere man ; thou takest up what thou didst not lay down , and reapest what thou didst not sow .
YLT	Luke	19	22	` And he saith to him , Out of thy mouth I will judge thee , evil servant : thou knewest that I am an austere man , taking up what I did not lay down , and reaping what I did not sow !
YLT	Luke	19	23	and wherefore didst thou not give my money to the bank , and I , having come , with interest might have received it ?
YLT	Luke	19	24	` And to those standing by he said , Take from him the pound , and give to him having the ten pounds --
YLT	Luke	19	25	( and they said to him , Sir , he hath ten pounds ) --
YLT	Luke	19	26	for I say to you , that to every one having shall be given , and from him not having , also what he hath shall be taken from him ,
YLT	Luke	19	27	but those my enemies , who did not wish me to reign over them , bring hither and slay before me . '
YLT	Luke	19	28	And having said these things , he went on before , going up to Jerusalem .
YLT	Luke	19	29	And it came to pass , as he came nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , unto the mount called of the Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
YLT	Luke	19	30	having said , Go away to the village over-against , in which , entering into , ye shall find a colt bound , on which no one of men did ever sit , having loosed it , bring [ it ] ;
YLT	Luke	19	31	and if any one doth question you , Wherefore do ye loose [ it ] ? thus ye shall say to him -- The Lord hath need of it . '
YLT	Luke	19	32	And those sent , having gone away , found according as he said to them ,
YLT	Luke	19	33	and while they are loosing the colt , its owners said unto them , ` Why loose ye the colt ? '
YLT	Luke	19	34	and they said , ` The Lord hath need of it ; '
YLT	Luke	19	35	and they brought it unto Jesus , and having cast their garments upon the colt , they did set Jesus upon it .
YLT	Luke	19	36	And as he is going , they were spreading their garments in the way ,
YLT	Luke	19	37	and as he is coming nigh now , at the descent of the mount of the Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a great voice for all the mighty works they had seen ,
YLT	Luke	19	38	saying , ` blessed [ is ] he who is coming , a king in the name of the Lord ; peace in heaven , and glory in the highest . '
YLT	Luke	19	39	And certain of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him , ` Teacher , rebuke thy disciples ; '
YLT	Luke	19	40	and he answering said to them , ` I say to you , that , if these shall be silent , the stones will cry out ! '
YLT	Luke	19	41	And when he came nigh , having seen the city , he wept over it ,
YLT	Luke	19	42	saying -- ` If thou didst know , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things for thy peace ; but now they were hid from thine eyes .
YLT	Luke	19	43	` Because days shall come upon thee , and thine enemies shall cast around thee a rampart , and compass thee round , and press thee on every side ,
YLT	Luke	19	44	and lay thee low , and thy children within thee , and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone , because thou didst not know the time of thy inspection . '
YLT	Luke	19	45	And having entered into the temple , he began to cast forth those selling in it , and those buying ,
YLT	Luke	19	46	saying to them , ` It hath been written , My house is a house of prayer -- but ye made it a den of robbers . '
YLT	Luke	19	47	And he was teaching daily in the temple , but the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him -- also the chiefs of the people --
YLT	Luke	19	48	and they were not finding what they shall do , for all the people were hanging on him , hearing him .
YLT	Luke	20	20	And , having watched [ him ] , they sent forth liers in wait , feigning themselves to be righteous , that they might take hold of his word , to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor ,
YLT	Luke	20	2	and spake unto him , saying , ` Tell us by what authority thou dost these things ? or who is he that gave to thee this authority ? '
YLT	Luke	20	3	And he answering said unto them , ` I will question you -- I also -- one thing , and tell me :
YLT	Luke	20	4	the baptism of John , from heaven was it , or from men ? '
YLT	Luke	20	5	And they reasoned with themselves , saying -- ` If we may say , From heaven , he will say , Wherefore , then , did ye not believe him ?
YLT	Luke	20	6	and if we may say , From men , all the people will stone us , for they are having been persuaded John to be a prophet . '
YLT	Luke	20	7	And they answered , that they knew not whence [ it was ] ,
YLT	Luke	20	8	and Jesus said to them , ` Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these things . '
YLT	Luke	20	9	And he began to speak unto the people this simile : ` A certain man planted a vineyard , and gave it out to husbandmen , and went abroad for a long time ,
YLT	Luke	20	10	and at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant , that from the fruit of the vineyard they may give to him , but the husbandmen having beat him , did send [ him ] away empty .
YLT	Luke	20	11	` And he added to send another servant , and they that one also having beaten and dishonoured , did send away empty ;
YLT	Luke	20	12	and he added to send a third , and this one also , having wounded , they did cast out .
YLT	Luke	20	13	` And the owner of the vineyard said , What shall I do ? I will send my son -- the beloved , perhaps having seen this one , they will do reverence ;
YLT	Luke	20	14	and having seen him , the husbandmen reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir ; come , we may kill him , that the inheritance may become ours ;
YLT	Luke	20	15	and having cast him outside of the vineyard , they killed [ him ] ; what , then , shall the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
YLT	Luke	20	16	He will come , and destroy these husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . ' And having heard , they said , ` Let it not be ! '
YLT	Luke	20	17	and he , having looked upon them , said , ` What , then , is this that hath been written : A stone that the builders rejected -- this became head of a corner ?
YLT	Luke	20	18	every one who hath fallen on that stone shall be broken , and on whom it may fall , it will crush him to pieces . '
YLT	Luke	20	19	And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him in that hour , and they feared the people , for they knew that against them he spake this simile .
YLT	Luke	20	21	and they questioned him , saying , ` Teacher , we have known that thou dost say and teach rightly , and dost not accept a person , but in truth the way of God dost teach ;
YLT	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful to us to give tribute to Caesar or not ? '
YLT	Luke	20	23	And he , having perceived their craftiness , said unto them , ` Why me do ye tempt ?
YLT	Luke	20	24	shew me a denary ; of whom hath it an image and superscription ? ' and they answering said , ` Of Caesar : '
YLT	Luke	20	25	and he said to them , ` Give back , therefore , the things of Caesar to Caesar , and the things of God to God ; '
YLT	Luke	20	26	and they were not able to take hold on his saying before the people , and having wondered at his answer , they were silent .
YLT	Luke	20	27	And certain of the Sadducees , who are denying that there is a rising again , having come near , questioned him ,
YLT	Luke	20	28	saying , ` Teacher , Moses wrote to us , If any one 's brother may die , having a wife , and he may die childless -- that his brother may take the wife , and may raise up seed to his brother .
YLT	Luke	20	29	` There were , then , seven brothers , and the first having taken a wife , died childless ,
YLT	Luke	20	30	and the second took the wife , and he died childless ,
YLT	Luke	20	31	and the third took her , and in like manner also the seven -- they left not children , and they died ;
YLT	Luke	20	32	and last of all died also the woman :
YLT	Luke	20	33	in the rising again , then , of which of them doth she become wife ? -- for the seven had her as wife . '
YLT	Luke	20	34	And Jesus answering said to them , ` The sons of this age do marry and are given in marriage ,
YLT	Luke	20	35	but those accounted worthy to obtain that age , and the rising again that is out of the dead , neither marry , nor are they given in marriage ;
YLT	Luke	20	36	for neither are they able to die any more -- for they are like messengers -- and they are sons of God , being sons of the rising again .
YLT	Luke	20	37	` And that the dead are raised , even Moses shewed at the Bush , since he doth call the Lord , the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ;
YLT	Luke	20	38	and He is not a God of dead men , but of living , for all live to Him . '
YLT	Luke	20	39	And certain of the scribes answering said , ` Teacher , thou didst say well ; '
YLT	Luke	20	40	and no more durst they question him anything .
YLT	Luke	20	41	And he said unto them , ` How do they say the Christ to be son of David ,
YLT	Luke	20	42	and David himself saith in the Book of Psalms , The Lord said to my lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
YLT	Luke	20	43	till I shall make thine enemies thy footstool ;
YLT	Luke	20	44	David , then , doth call him lord , and how is he his son ? '
YLT	Luke	20	45	And , all the people hearing , he said to his disciples ,
YLT	Luke	20	46	` Take heed of the scribes , who are wishing to walk in long robes , and are loving salutations in the markets , and first seats in the synagogues , and first couches in the suppers ,
YLT	Luke	20	47	who devour the houses of the widows , and for a pretence make long prayers , these shall receive more abundant judgment . '
YLT	Luke	21	21	then those in Judea , let them flee to the mountains ; and those in her midst , let them depart out ; and those in the countries , let them not come in to her ;
YLT	Luke	21	2	and he saw also a certain poor widow casting there two mites ,
YLT	Luke	21	3	and he said , ` Truly I say to you , that this poor widow did cast in more than all ;
YLT	Luke	21	4	for all these out of their superabundance did cast into the gifts to God , but this one out of her want , all the living that she had , did cast in . '
YLT	Luke	21	5	And certain saying about the temple , that with goodly stones and devoted things it hath been adorned , he said ,
YLT	Luke	21	6	` These things that ye behold -- days will come , in which there shall not be left a stone upon a stone , that shall not be thrown down . '
YLT	Luke	21	7	And they questioned him , saying , ` Teacher , when , then , shall these things be ? and what [ is ] the sign when these things may be about to happen ? '
YLT	Luke	21	8	And he said , ` See -- ye may not be led astray , for many shall come in my name , saying -- I am [ he ] , and the time hath come nigh ; go not on then after them ;
YLT	Luke	21	9	and when ye may hear of wars and uprisings , be not terrified , for it behoveth these things to happen first , but the end [ is ] not immediately . '
YLT	Luke	21	10	Then said he to them , ` Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ,
YLT	Luke	21	11	great shakings also in every place , and famines , and pestilences , there shall be ; fearful things also , and great signs from heaven there shall be ;
YLT	Luke	21	12	and before all these , they shall lay on you their hands , and persecute , delivering up to synagogues and prisons , being brought before kings and governors for my name 's sake ;
YLT	Luke	21	13	and it shall become to you for a testimony .
YLT	Luke	21	14	` Settle , then , to your hearts , not to meditate beforehand to reply ,
YLT	Luke	21	15	for I will give to you a mouth and wisdom that all your opposers shall not be able to refute or resist .
YLT	Luke	21	16	` And ye shall be delivered up also by parents , and brothers , and kindred , and friends , and they shall put of you to death ;
YLT	Luke	21	17	and ye shall be hated by all because of my name --
YLT	Luke	21	18	and a hair out of your head shall not perish ;
YLT	Luke	21	19	in your patience possess ye your souls .
YLT	Luke	21	20	` And when ye may see Jerusalem surrounded by encampments , then know that come nigh did her desolation ;
YLT	Luke	21	22	because these are days of vengeance , to fulfil all things that have been written .
YLT	Luke	21	23	` And wo to those with child , and to those giving suck , in those days ; for there shall be great distress on the land , and wrath on this people ;
YLT	Luke	21	24	and they shall fall by the mouth of the sword , and shall be led captive to all the nations , and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by nations , till the times of nations be fulfilled .
YLT	Luke	21	25	` And there shall be signs in sun , and moon , and stars , and on the land [ is ] distress of nations with perplexity , sea and billow roaring ;
YLT	Luke	21	26	men fainting at heart from fear , and expectation of the things coming on the world , for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken .
YLT	Luke	21	27	` And then they shall see the Son of Man , coming in a cloud , with power and much glory ;
YLT	Luke	21	28	and these things beginning to happen bend yourselves back , and lift up your heads , because your redemption doth draw nigh . '
YLT	Luke	21	29	And he spake a simile to them : ` See the fig-tree , and all the trees ,
YLT	Luke	21	30	when they may now cast forth , having seen , of yourselves ye know that now is the summer nigh ;
YLT	Luke	21	31	so also ye , when ye may see these things happening , ye know that near is the reign of God ;
YLT	Luke	21	32	verily I say to you -- This generation may not pass away till all may have come to pass ;
YLT	Luke	21	33	the heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words may not pass away .
YLT	Luke	21	34	` And take heed to yourselves , lest your hearts may be weighed down with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and anxieties of life , and suddenly that day may come on you ,
YLT	Luke	21	35	for as a snare it shall come on all those dwelling on the face of all the land ,
YLT	Luke	21	36	watch ye , then , in every season , praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are about to come to pass , and to stand before the Son of Man . '
YLT	Luke	21	37	And he was during the days in the temple teaching , and during the nights , going forth , he was lodging at the mount called of Olives ;
YLT	Luke	21	38	and all the people were coming early unto him in the temple to hear him .
YLT	Luke	22	22	and indeed the Son of Man doth go according to what hath been determined ; but wo to that man through whom he is being delivered up . '
YLT	Luke	22	2	and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they may take him up , for they were afraid of the people .
YLT	Luke	22	3	And the Adversary entered into Judas , who is surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve ,
YLT	Luke	22	4	and he , having gone away , spake with the chief priests and the magistrates , how he might deliver him up to them ,
YLT	Luke	22	5	and they rejoiced , and covenanted to give him money ,
YLT	Luke	22	6	and he agreed , and was seeking a favourable season to deliver him up to them without tumult .
YLT	Luke	22	7	And the day of the unleavened food came , in which it was behoving the passover to be sacrificed ,
YLT	Luke	22	8	and he sent Peter and John , saying , ` Having gone on , prepare to us the passover , that we may eat ; '
YLT	Luke	22	9	and they said to him , ` Where wilt thou that we might prepare ? '
YLT	Luke	22	10	And he said to them , ` Lo , in your entering into the city , there shall meet you a man , bearing a pitcher of water , follow him to the house where he doth go in ,
YLT	Luke	22	11	and ye shall say to the master of the house , The Teacher saith to thee , Where is the guest-chamber where the passover with my disciples I may eat ?
YLT	Luke	22	12	and he shall show you a large upper room furnished , there make ready ; '
YLT	Luke	22	13	and they , having gone away , found as he hath said to them , and they made ready the passover .
YLT	Luke	22	14	And when the hour come , he reclined ( at meat ) , and the twelve apostles with him ,
YLT	Luke	22	15	and he said unto them , ` With desire I did desire to eat this passover with you before my suffering ,
YLT	Luke	22	16	for I say to you , that no more may I eat of it till it may be fulfilled in the reign of God . '
YLT	Luke	22	17	And having taken a cup , having given thanks , he said , ` Take this and divide to yourselves ,
YLT	Luke	22	18	for I say to you that I may not drink of the produce of the vine till the reign of God may come . '
YLT	Luke	22	19	And having taken bread , having given thanks , he brake and gave to them , saying , ` This is my body , that for you is being given , this do ye -- to remembrance of me . '
YLT	Luke	22	20	In like manner , also , the cup after the supping , saying , ` This cup [ is ] the new covenant in my blood , that for you is being poured forth .
YLT	Luke	22	21	` But , lo , the hand of him delivering me up [ is ] with me on the table ,
YLT	Luke	22	23	And they began to reason among themselves , who then of them it may be , who is about to do this thing .
YLT	Luke	22	24	And there happened also a strife among them -- who of them is accounted to be greater .
YLT	Luke	22	25	And he said to them , ` The kings of the nations do exercise lordship over them , and those exercising authority upon them are called benefactors ;
YLT	Luke	22	26	but ye [ are ] not so , but he who is greater among you -- let him be as the younger ; and he who is leading , as he who is ministering ;
YLT	Luke	22	27	for who is greater ? he who is reclining ( at meat ) , or he who is ministering ? is it not he who is reclining ( at meat ) ? and I -- I am in your midst as he who is ministering .
YLT	Luke	22	28	` And ye -- ye are those who have remained with me in my temptations ,
YLT	Luke	22	29	and I appoint to you , as my Father did appoint to me , a kingdom ,
YLT	Luke	22	30	that ye may eat and may drink at my table , in my kingdom , and may sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . '
YLT	Luke	22	31	And the Lord said , ` Simon , Simon , lo , the Adversary did ask you for himself to sift as the wheat ,
YLT	Luke	22	32	and I besought for thee , that thy faith may not fail ; and thou , when thou didst turn , strengthen thy brethren . '
YLT	Luke	22	33	And he said to him , ` Sir , with thee I am ready both to prison and to death to go ; '
YLT	Luke	22	34	and he said , ` I say to thee , Peter , a cock shall not crow to-day , before thrice thou mayest disown knowing me . '
YLT	Luke	22	35	And he said to them , ` When I sent you without bag , and scrip , and sandals , did ye lack anything ? ' and they said , ` Nothing . '
YLT	Luke	22	36	Then said he to them , ` But , now , he who is having a bag , let him take [ it ] up , and in like manner also a scrip ; and he who is not having , let him sell his garment , and buy a sword ,
YLT	Luke	22	37	for I say to you , that yet this that hath been written it behoveth to be fulfilled in me : And with lawless ones he was reckoned , for also the things concerning me have an end . '
YLT	Luke	22	38	And they said , ` Sir , lo , here [ are ] two swords ; ' and he said to them , ` It is sufficient . '
YLT	Luke	22	39	And having gone forth , he went on , according to custom , to the mount of the Olives , and his disciples also followed him ,
YLT	Luke	22	40	and having come to the place , he said to them , ` Pray ye not to enter into temptation . '
YLT	Luke	22	41	And he was withdrawn from them , as it were a stone 's cast , and having fallen on the knees he was praying ,
YLT	Luke	22	42	saying , ` Father , if Thou be counselling to make this cup pass from me -- ; but , not my will , but Thine be done . ' --
YLT	Luke	22	43	And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven strengthening him ;
YLT	Luke	22	44	and having been in agony , he was more earnestly praying , and his sweat became , as it were , great drops of blood falling upon the ground .
YLT	Luke	22	45	And having risen up from the prayer , having come unto the disciples , he found them sleeping from the sorrow ,
YLT	Luke	22	46	and he said to them , ` Why do ye sleep ? having risen , pray that ye may not enter into temptation . '
YLT	Luke	22	47	And while he is speaking , lo , a multitude , and he who is called Judas , one of the twelve , was coming before them , and he came nigh to Jesus to kiss him ,
YLT	Luke	22	48	and Jesus said to him , ` Judas , with a kiss the Son of Man dost thou deliver up ? '
YLT	Luke	22	49	And those about him , having seen what was about to be , said to him , ` Sir , shall we smite with a sword ? '
YLT	Luke	22	50	And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief priest , and took off his right ear ,
YLT	Luke	22	51	and Jesus answering said , ` Suffer ye thus far , ' and having touched his ear , he healed him .
YLT	Luke	22	52	And Jesus said to those having come upon him -- chief priests , and magistrates of the temple , and elders -- ` As upon a robber have ye come forth , with swords and sticks ?
YLT	Luke	22	53	while daily I was with you in the temple , ye did stretch forth no hands against me ; but this is your hour and the power of the darkness . '
YLT	Luke	22	54	And having taken him , they led and brought him to the house of the chief priest . And Peter was following afar off ,
YLT	Luke	22	55	and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court , and having sat down together , Peter was sitting in the midst of them ,
YLT	Luke	22	56	and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light , and having earnestly looked at him , she said , ` And this one was with him ! '
YLT	Luke	22	57	and he disowned him , saying , ` Woman , I have not known him . '
YLT	Luke	22	58	And after a little , another having seen him , said , ` And thou art of them ! ' and Peter said , ` Man , I am not . '
YLT	Luke	22	59	And one hour , as it were , having intervened , a certain other was confidently affirming , saying , ` Of a truth this one also was with him , for he is also a Galilean ; '
YLT	Luke	22	60	and Peter said , ` Man , I have not known what thou sayest ; ' and presently , while he is speaking , a cock crew .
YLT	Luke	22	61	And the Lord having turned did look on Peter , and Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he said to him -- ` Before a cock shall crow , thou mayest disown me thrice ; '
YLT	Luke	22	62	and Peter having gone without , wept bitterly .
YLT	Luke	22	63	And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him , beating [ him ] ;
YLT	Luke	22	64	and having blindfolded him , they were striking him on the face , and were questioning him , saying , ` Prophesy who he is who smote thee ? '
YLT	Luke	22	65	and many other things , speaking evilly , they spake in regard to him .
YLT	Luke	22	66	And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people , chief priests also , and scribes , and they led him up to their own sanhedrim ,
YLT	Luke	22	67	saying , ` If thou be the Christ , tell us . ' And he said to them , ` If I may tell you , ye will not believe ;
YLT	Luke	22	68	and if I also question [ you ] , ye will not answer me or send me away ;
YLT	Luke	22	69	henceforth , there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God . '
YLT	Luke	22	70	And they all said , ` Thou , then , art the Son of God ? ' and he said unto them , ` Ye say [ it ] , because I am ; '
YLT	Luke	22	71	and they said , ` What need yet have we of testimony ? for we ourselves did hear [ it ] from his mouth . '
YLT	Luke	23	23	And they were pressing with loud voices asking him to be crucified , and their voices , and those of the chief priests , were prevailing ,
YLT	Luke	23	2	and began to accuse him , saying , ` This one we found perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying himself to be Christ a king . '
YLT	Luke	23	3	And Pilate questioned him , saying , ` Thou art the king of the Jews ? ' and he answering him , said , ` Thou dost say [ it ] . '
YLT	Luke	23	4	And Pilate said unto the chief priests , and the multitude , ` I find no fault in this man ; '
YLT	Luke	23	5	and they were the more urgent , saying -- ` He doth stir up the people , teaching throughout the whole of Judea -- having begun from Galilee -- unto this place . '
YLT	Luke	23	6	And Pilate having heard of Galilee , questioned if the man is a Galilean ,
YLT	Luke	23	7	and having known that he is from the jurisdiction of Herod , he sent him back unto Herod , he being also in Jerusalem in those days .
YLT	Luke	23	8	And Herod having seen Jesus did rejoice exceedingly , for he was wishing for a long [ time ] to see him , because of hearing many things about him , and he was hoping some sign to see done by him ,
YLT	Luke	23	9	and was questioning him in many words , and he answered him nothing .
YLT	Luke	23	10	And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him ,
YLT	Luke	23	11	and Herod with his soldiers having set him at nought , and having mocked , having put around him gorgeous apparel , did send him back to Pilate ,
YLT	Luke	23	12	and both Pilate and Herod became friends on that day with one another , for they were before at enmity between themselves .
YLT	Luke	23	13	And Pilate having called together the chief priests , and the rulers , and the people ,
YLT	Luke	23	14	said unto them , ` Ye brought to me this man as perverting the people , and lo , I before you having examined , found in this man no fault in those things ye bring forward against him ;
YLT	Luke	23	15	no , nor yet Herod , for I sent you back unto him , and lo , nothing worthy of death is having been done by him ;
YLT	Luke	23	16	having chastised , therefore , I will release him , '
YLT	Luke	23	17	for it was necessary for him to release to them one at every feast ,
YLT	Luke	23	18	and they cried out -- the whole multitude -- saying , ` Away with this one , and release to us Barabbas , '
YLT	Luke	23	19	who had been , because of a certain sedition made in the city , and murder , cast into prison .
YLT	Luke	23	20	Pilate again then -- wishing to release Jesus -- called to them ,
YLT	Luke	23	21	but they were calling out , saying , ` Crucify , crucify him . '
YLT	Luke	23	22	And he a third time said unto them , ` Why , what evil did he ? no cause of death did I find in him ; having chastised him , then , I will release [ him ] . '
YLT	Luke	23	24	and Pilate gave judgment for their request being done ,
YLT	Luke	23	25	and he released him who because of sedition and murder hath been cast into the prison , whom they were asking , and Jesus he gave up to their will .
YLT	Luke	23	26	And as they led him away , having taken hold on Simon , a certain Cyrenian , coming from the field , they put on him the cross , to bear [ it ] behind Jesus .
YLT	Luke	23	27	And there was following him a great multitude of the people , and of women , who also were beating themselves and lamenting him ,
YLT	Luke	23	28	and Jesus having turned unto them , said , ` Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but for yourselves weep ye , and for your children ;
YLT	Luke	23	29	for , lo , days do come , in which they shall say , Happy the barren , and wombs that did not bare , and paps that did not give suck ;
YLT	Luke	23	30	then they shall begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us , and to the hills , Cover us ; --
YLT	Luke	23	31	for , if in the green tree they do these things -- in the dry what may happen ? '
YLT	Luke	23	32	And there were also others -- two evil-doers -- with him , to be put to death ;
YLT	Luke	23	33	and when they came to the place that is called Skull , there they crucified him and the evil-doers , one on the right hand and one on the left .
YLT	Luke	23	34	And Jesus said , ` Father , forgive them , for they have not known what they do ; ' and parting his garments they cast a lot .
YLT	Luke	23	35	And the people were standing , looking on , and the rulers also were sneering with them , saying , ` Others he saved , let him save himself , if this be the Christ , the choice one of God . '
YLT	Luke	23	36	And mocking him also were the soldiers , coming near and offering vinegar to him ,
YLT	Luke	23	37	and saying , ` If thou be the king of the Jews , save thyself . '
YLT	Luke	23	38	And there was also a superscription written over him , in letters of Greek , and Roman , and Hebrew , ` This is the King of the Jews . '
YLT	Luke	23	39	And one of the evil-doers who were hanged , was speaking evil of him , saying , ` If thou be the Christ , save thyself and us . '
YLT	Luke	23	40	And the other answering , was rebuking him , saying , ` Dost thou not even fear God , that thou art in the same judgment ?
YLT	Luke	23	41	and we indeed righteously , for things worthy of what we did we receive back , but this one did nothing out of place ; '
YLT	Luke	23	42	and he said to Jesus , ` Remember me , lord , when thou mayest come in thy reign ; '
YLT	Luke	23	43	and Jesus said to him , ` Verily I say to thee , To-day with me thou shalt be in the paradise . '
YLT	Luke	23	44	And it was , as it were , the sixth hour , and darkness came over all the land till the ninth hour ,
YLT	Luke	23	45	and the sun was darkened , and the vail of the sanctuary was rent in the midst ,
YLT	Luke	23	46	and having cried with a loud voice , Jesus said , ` Father , to Thy hands I commit my spirit ; ' and these things having said , he breathed forth the spirit .
YLT	Luke	23	47	And the centurion having seen what was done , did glorify God , saying , ` Really this man was righteous ; '
YLT	Luke	23	48	and all the multitudes who were come together to this sight , beholding the things that came to pass , smiting their breasts did turn back ;
YLT	Luke	23	49	and all his acquaintances stood afar off , and women who did follow him from Galilee , beholding these things .
YLT	Luke	23	50	And lo , a man , by name Joseph , being a counsellor , a man good and righteous ,
YLT	Luke	23	51	-- he was not consenting to their counsel and deed -- from Arimathea , a city of the Jews , who also himself was expecting the reign of God ,
YLT	Luke	23	52	he , having gone near to Pilate , asked the body of Jesus ,
YLT	Luke	23	53	and having taken it down , he wrapped it in fine linen , and placed it in a tomb hewn out , where no one was yet laid .
YLT	Luke	23	54	And the day was a preparation , and sabbath was approaching ,
YLT	Luke	23	55	and the women also who have come with him out of Galilee having followed after , beheld the tomb , and how his body was placed ,
YLT	Luke	23	56	and having turned back , they made ready spices and ointments , and on the sabbath , indeed , they rested , according to the command .
YLT	Luke	24	24	and certain of those with us went away unto the tomb , and found as even the women said , and him they saw not . '
YLT	Luke	24	2	and they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb ,
YLT	Luke	24	3	and having gone in , they found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
YLT	Luke	24	4	And it came to pass , while they are perplexed about this , that lo , two men stood by them in glittering apparel ,
YLT	Luke	24	5	and on their having become afraid , and having inclined the face to the earth , they said to them , ` Why do ye seek the living with the dead ?
YLT	Luke	24	6	he is not here , but was raised ; remember how he spake to you , being yet in Galilee ,
YLT	Luke	24	7	saying -- It behoveth the Son of Man to be delivered up to the hands of sinful men , and to be crucified , and the third day to rise again . '
YLT	Luke	24	8	And they remembered his sayings ,
YLT	Luke	24	9	and having turned back from the tomb told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
YLT	Luke	24	10	And it was the Magdalene Mary , and Joanna , and Mary of James , and the other women with them , who told unto the apostles these things ,
YLT	Luke	24	11	and their sayings appeared before them as idle talk , and they were not believing them .
YLT	Luke	24	12	And Peter having risen , did run to the tomb , and having stooped down he seeth the linen clothes lying alone , and he went away to his own home , wondering at that which was come to pass .
YLT	Luke	24	13	And , lo , two of them were going on during that day to a village , distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem , the name of which [ is ] Emmaus ,
YLT	Luke	24	14	and they were conversing with one another about all these things that have happened .
YLT	Luke	24	15	And it came to pass in their conversing and reasoning together , that Jesus himself , having come nigh , was going on with them ,
YLT	Luke	24	16	and their eyes were holden so as not to know him ,
YLT	Luke	24	17	and he said unto them , ` What [ are ] these words that ye exchange with one another , walking , and ye are sad ? '
YLT	Luke	24	18	And the one , whose name was Cleopas , answering , said unto him , ` Art thou alone such a stranger in Jerusalem , that thou hast not known the things that came to pass in it in these days ? '
YLT	Luke	24	19	And he said to them , ` What things ? ' And they said to him , ` The things about Jesus of Nazareth , who became a man -- a prophet -- powerful in deed and word , before God and all the people ,
YLT	Luke	24	20	how also the chief priests and our rulers did deliver him up to a judgment of death , and crucified him ;
YLT	Luke	24	21	and we were hoping that he it is who is about to redeem Israel , and also with all these things , this third day is passing to-day , since these things happened .
YLT	Luke	24	22	` And certain women of ours also astonished us , coming early to the tomb ,
YLT	Luke	24	23	and not having found his body , they came , saying also to have seen an apparition of messengers , who say he is alive ,
YLT	Luke	24	25	And he said unto them , ` O inconsiderate and slow in heart , to believe on all that the prophets spake !
YLT	Luke	24	26	Was it not behoving the Christ these things to suffer , and to enter into his glory ? '
YLT	Luke	24	27	and having begun from Moses , and from all the prophets , he was expounding to them in all the Writings the things about himself .
YLT	Luke	24	28	And they came nigh to the village whither they were going , and he made an appearance of going on further ,
YLT	Luke	24	29	and they constrained him , saying , ` Remain with us , for it is toward evening , ' and the day did decline , and he went in to remain with them .
YLT	Luke	24	30	And it came to pass , in his reclining ( at meat ) with them , having taken the bread , he blessed , and having broken , he was giving to them ,
YLT	Luke	24	31	and their eyes were opened , and they recognized him , and he became unseen by them .
YLT	Luke	24	32	And they said one to another , ` Was not our heart burning within us , as he was speaking to us in the way , and as he was opening up to us the Writings ? '
YLT	Luke	24	33	And they , having risen up the same hour , turned back to Jerusalem , and found gathered together the eleven , and those with them ,
YLT	Luke	24	34	saying -- ` The Lord was raised indeed , and was seen by Simon ; '
YLT	Luke	24	35	and they were telling the things in the way , and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread ,
YLT	Luke	24	36	and as they are speaking these things , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith to them , ` Peace -- to you ; '
YLT	Luke	24	37	and being amazed , and becoming affrighted , they were thinking themselves to see a spirit .
YLT	Luke	24	38	And he said to them , ` Why are ye troubled ? and wherefore do reasonings come up in your hearts ?
YLT	Luke	24	39	see my hands and my feet , that I am he ; handle me and see , because a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me having . '
YLT	Luke	24	40	And having said this , he shewed to them the hands and the feet ,
YLT	Luke	24	41	and while they are not believing from the joy , and wondering , he said to them , ` Have ye anything here to eat ? '
YLT	Luke	24	42	and they gave to him part of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb ,
YLT	Luke	24	43	and having taken , he did eat before them ,
YLT	Luke	24	44	and he said to them , ` These [ are ] the words that I spake unto you , being yet with you , that it behoveth to be fulfilled all the things that are written in the Law of Moses , and the Prophets , and the Psalms , about me . '
YLT	Luke	24	45	Then opened he up their understanding to understand the Writings ,
YLT	Luke	24	46	and he said to them -- ` Thus it hath been written , and thus it was behoving the Christ to suffer , and to rise out of the dead the third day ,
YLT	Luke	24	47	and reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem :
YLT	Luke	24	48	and ye -- ye are witnesses of these things .
YLT	Luke	24	49	` And , lo , I do send the promise of my Father upon you , but ye -- abide ye in the city of Jerusalem till ye be clothed with power from on high . '
YLT	Luke	24	50	And he led them forth without -- unto Bethany , and having lifted up his hands he did bless them ,
YLT	Luke	24	51	and it came to pass , in his blessing them , he was parted from them , and was borne up to the heaven ;
YLT	Luke	24	52	and they , having bowed before him , did turn back to Jerusalem with great joy ,
YLT	Luke	24	53	and were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen .
YLT	John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God ;
YLT	John	1	2	this one was in the beginning with God ;
YLT	John	1	3	all things through him did happen , and without him happened not even one thing that hath happened .
YLT	John	1	4	In him was life , and the life was the light of men ,
YLT	John	1	5	and the light in the darkness did shine , and the darkness did not perceive it .
YLT	John	1	6	There came a man -- having been sent from God -- whose name [ is ] John ,
YLT	John	1	7	this one came for testimony , that he might testify about the Light , that all might believe through him ;
YLT	John	1	8	that one was not the Light , but -- that he might testify about the Light .
YLT	John	1	9	He was the true Light , which doth enlighten every man , coming to the world ;
YLT	John	1	10	in the world he was , and the world through him was made , and the world did not know him :
YLT	John	1	11	to his own things he came , and his own people did not receive him ;
YLT	John	1	12	but as many as did receive him to them he gave authority to become sons of God -- to those believing in his name ,
YLT	John	1	13	who -- not of blood nor of a will of flesh , nor of a will of man but -- of God were begotten .
YLT	John	1	14	And the Word became flesh , and did tabernacle among us , and we beheld his glory , glory as of an only begotten of a father , full of grace and truth .
YLT	John	1	15	John doth testify concerning him , and hath cried , saying , ` This was he of whom I said , He who after me is coming , hath come before me , for he was before me ; '
YLT	John	1	16	and out of his fulness did we all receive , and grace over-against grace ;
YLT	John	1	17	for the law through Moses was given , the grace and the truth through Jesus Christ did come ;
YLT	John	1	18	God no one hath ever seen ; the only begotten Son , who is on the bosom of the Father -- he did declare .
YLT	John	1	19	And this is the testimony of John , when the Jews sent out of Jerusalem priests and Levites , that they might question him , ` Who art thou ? '
YLT	John	1	20	and he confessed and did not deny , and confessed -- ` I am not the Christ . '
YLT	John	1	21	And they questioned him , ` What then ? Elijah art thou ? ' and he saith , ` I am not . ' -- ` The prophet art thou ? ' and he answered , ` No . '
YLT	John	1	22	They said then to him , ` Who art thou , that we may give an answer to those sending us ? what dost thou say concerning thyself ? '
YLT	John	1	23	He said , ` I [ am ] a voice of one crying in the wilderness : Make straight the way of the Lord , as said Isaiah the prophet . '
YLT	John	1	24	And those sent were of the Pharisees ,
YLT	John	1	25	and they questioned him and said to him , ` Why , then , dost thou baptize , if thou art not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the prophet ? '
YLT	John	1	26	John answered them , saying , ` I baptize with water , but in midst of you he hath stood whom ye have not known , this one it is who is coming after me , who hath been before me ,
YLT	John	1	27	of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the cord of his sandal . '
YLT	John	1	28	These things came to pass in Bethabara , beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing ,
YLT	John	1	29	on the morrow John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , ` Lo , the Lamb of God , who is taking away the sin of the world ;
YLT	John	1	30	this is he concerning whom I said , After me doth come a man , who hath come before me , because he was before me :
YLT	John	1	31	and I knew him not , but , that he might be manifested to Israel , because of this I came with the water baptizing .
YLT	John	1	32	And John testified , saying -- ` I have seen the Spirit coming down , as a dove , out of heaven , and it remained on him ;
YLT	John	1	33	and I did not know him , but he who sent me to baptize with water , He said to me , On whomsoever thou mayst see the Spirit coming down , and remaining on him , this is he who is baptizing with the Holy Spirit ;
YLT	John	1	34	and I have seen , and have testified , that this is the Son of God . '
YLT	John	1	35	On the morrow , again , John was standing , and two of his disciples ,
YLT	John	1	36	and having looked on Jesus walking , he saith , ` Lo , the Lamb of God ; '
YLT	John	1	37	and the two disciples heard him speaking , and they followed Jesus .
YLT	John	1	38	And Jesus having turned , and having beheld them following , saith to them , ` What seek ye ? ' and they said to them , ` Rabbi , ( which is , being interpreted , Teacher , ) where remainest thou ? '
YLT	John	1	39	He saith to them , ` Come and see ; ' they came , and saw where he doth remain , and with him they remained that day and the hour was about the tenth .
YLT	John	1	40	Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two who heard from John , and followed him ;
YLT	John	1	41	this one doth first find his own brother Simon , and saith to him , ` We have found the Messiah , ' ( which is , being interpreted , The Anointed , )
YLT	John	1	42	and he brought him unto Jesus : and having looked upon him , Jesus saith , ` Thou art Simon , the son of Jonas , thou shalt be called Cephas , ' ( which is interpreted , A rock . )
YLT	John	1	43	On the morrow , he willed to go forth to Galilee , and he findeth Philip , and saith to him , ` Be following me . '
YLT	John	1	44	And Philip was from Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter ;
YLT	John	1	45	Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith to him , ` Him of whom Moses wrote in the Law , and the prophets , we have found , Jesus the son of Joseph , who [ is ] from Nazareth ; '
YLT	John	1	46	and Nathanael said to him , ` Out of Nazareth is any good thing able to be ? ' Philip said to him , ` Come and see . '
YLT	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto him , and he saith concerning him , ` Lo , truly an Israelite , in whom guile is not ; '
YLT	John	1	48	Nathanael saith to him , ` Whence me dost thou know ? ' Jesus answered and said to him , ` Before Philip 's calling thee -- thou being under the fig-tree -- I saw thee . '
YLT	John	1	49	Nathanael answered and saith to him , ` Rabbi , thou art the Son of God , thou art the king of Israel . '
YLT	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said to him , ` Because I said to thee , I saw thee under the fig-tree , thou dost believe ; greater things than these thou shalt see ; '
YLT	John	1	51	and he saith to him , ` Verily , verily , I say to you , henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened , and the messengers of God going up and coming down upon the Son of Man . '
YLT	John	2	2	and also Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage ;
YLT	John	2	3	and wine having failed , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , ` Wine they have not ; '
YLT	John	2	4	Jesus saith to her , ` What -- to me and to thee , woman ? not yet is mine hour come . '
YLT	John	2	5	His mother saith to the ministrants , ` Whatever he may say to you -- do . '
YLT	John	2	6	And there were there six water-jugs of stone , placed according to the purifying of the Jews , holding each two or three measures .
YLT	John	2	7	Jesus saith to them , ` Fill the water-jugs with water ; ' and they filled them -- unto the brim ;
YLT	John	2	8	and he saith to them , ` Draw out , now , and bear to the director of the apartment ; ' and they bare .
YLT	John	2	9	And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become wine , and knew not whence it is , ( but the ministrants knew , who have drawn the water , ) the director of the feast doth call the bridegroom ,
YLT	John	2	10	and saith to him , ` Every man , at first , the good wine doth set forth ; and when they may have drunk freely , then the inferior ; thou didst keep the good wine till now . '
YLT	John	2	11	This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested his glory , and his disciples believed in him ;
YLT	John	2	12	after this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples ; and there they remained not many days .
YLT	John	2	13	And the passover of the Jews was nigh , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem ,
YLT	John	2	14	and he found in the temple those selling oxen , and sheep , and doves , and the money-changers sitting ,
YLT	John	2	15	and having made a whip of small cords , he put all forth out of the temple , also the sheep , and the oxen ; and of the money-changers he poured out the coins , and the tables he overthrew ,
YLT	John	2	16	and to those selling the doves he said , ` Take these things hence ; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise . '
YLT	John	2	17	And his disciples remembered that it is written , ` The zeal of Thy house did eat me up ; '
YLT	John	2	18	the Jews then answered and said to him , ` What sign dost thou shew to us -- that thou dost these things ? '
YLT	John	2	19	Jesus answered and said to them , ` Destroy this sanctuary , and in three days I will raise it up . '
YLT	John	2	20	The Jews , therefore , said , ` Forty and six years was this sanctuary building , and wilt thou in three days raise it up ? '
YLT	John	2	21	but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body ;
YLT	John	2	22	when , then , he was raised out of the dead , his disciples remembered that he said this to them , and they believed the Writing , and the word that Jesus said .
YLT	John	2	23	And as he was in Jerusalem , in the passover , in the feast , many believed in his name , beholding his signs that he was doing ;
YLT	John	2	24	and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them , because of his knowing all [ men ] ,
YLT	John	2	25	and because he had no need that any should testify concerning man , for he himself was knowing what was in man .
YLT	John	3	3	Jesus answered and said to him , ` Verily , verily , I say to thee , If any one may not be born from above , he is not able to see the reign of God ; '
YLT	John	3	2	this one came unto him by night , and said to him , ` Rabbi , we have known that from God thou hast come -- a teacher , for no one these signs is able to do that thou dost , if God may not be with him . '
YLT	John	3	4	Nicodemus saith unto him , ` How is a man able to be born , being old ? is he able into the womb of his mother a second time to enter , and to be born ? '
YLT	John	3	5	Jesus answered , ` Verily , verily , I say to thee , If any one may not be born of water , and the Spirit , he is not able to enter into the reign of God ;
YLT	John	3	6	that which hath been born of the flesh is flesh , and that which hath been born of the Spirit is spirit .
YLT	John	3	7	` Thou mayest not wonder that I said to thee , It behoveth you to be born from above ;
YLT	John	3	8	the Spirit where he willeth doth blow , and his voice thou dost hear , but thou hast not known whence he cometh , and whither he goeth ; thus is every one who hath been born of the Spirit . '
YLT	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said to him , ` How are these things able to happen ? '
YLT	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said to him , ` Thou art the teacher of Israel -- and these things thou dost not know !
YLT	John	3	11	` Verily , verily , I say to thee -- What we have known we speak , and what we have seen we testify , and our testimony ye do not receive ;
YLT	John	3	12	if the earthly things I said to you , and ye do not believe , how , if I shall say to you the heavenly things , will ye believe ?
YLT	John	3	13	and no one hath gone up to the heaven , except he who out of the heaven came down -- the Son of Man who is in the heaven .
YLT	John	3	14	` And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness , so it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up ,
YLT	John	3	15	that every one who is believing in him may not perish , but may have life age-during ,
YLT	John	3	16	for God did so love the world , that His Son -- the only begotten -- He gave , that every one who is believing in him may not perish , but may have life age-during .
YLT	John	3	17	For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge the world , but that the world may be saved through him ;
YLT	John	3	18	he who is believing in him is not judged , but he who is not believing hath been judged already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
YLT	John	3	19	` And this is the judgment , that the light hath come to the world , and men did love the darkness rather than the light , for their works were evil ;
YLT	John	3	20	for every one who is doing wicked things hateth the light , and doth not come unto the light , that his works may not be detected ;
YLT	John	3	21	but he who is doing the truth doth come to the light , that his works may be manifested , that in God they are having been wrought . '
YLT	John	3	22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land of Judea , and there he did tarry with them , and was baptizing ;
YLT	John	3	23	and John was also baptizing in Aenon , nigh to Salem , because there were many waters there , and they were coming and were being baptized --
YLT	John	3	24	for John was not yet cast into the prison --
YLT	John	3	25	there arose then a question from the disciples of John with [ some ] Jews about purifying ,
YLT	John	3	26	and they came unto John , and said to him , ` Rabbi , he who was with thee beyond the Jordan , to whom thou didst testify , lo , this one is baptizing , and all are coming unto him . '
YLT	John	3	27	John answered and said , ` A man is not able to receive anything , if it may not have been given him from the heaven ;
YLT	John	3	28	ye yourselves do testify to me that I said , I am not the Christ , but , that I am having been sent before him ;
YLT	John	3	29	he who is having the bride is bridegroom , and the friend of the bridegroom , who is standing and hearing him , with joy doth rejoice because of the voice of the bridegroom ; this , then , my joy hath been fulfilled .
YLT	John	3	30	` Him it behoveth to increase , and me to become less ;
YLT	John	3	31	he who from above is coming is above all ; he who is from the earth , from the earth he is , and from the earth he speaketh ; he who from the heaven is coming is above all .
YLT	John	3	32	` And what he hath seen and heard this he doth testify , and his testimony none receiveth ;
YLT	John	3	33	he who is receiving his testimony did seal that God is true ;
YLT	John	3	34	for he whom God sent , the sayings of God he speaketh ; for not by measure doth God give the Spirit ;
YLT	John	3	35	the Father doth love the Son , and all things hath given into his hand ;
YLT	John	3	36	he who is believing in the Son , hath life age-during ; and he who is not believing the Son , shall not see life , but the wrath of God doth remain upon him . '
YLT	John	4	4	and it was behoving him to go through Samaria .
YLT	John	4	2	( though indeed Jesus himself was not baptizing , but his disciples , )
YLT	John	4	3	he left Judea and went away again to Galilee ,
YLT	John	4	5	He cometh , therefore , to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near to the place that Jacob gave to Joseph his son ;
YLT	John	4	6	and there was there a well of Jacob . Jesus therefore having been weary from the journeying , was sitting thus on the well ; it was as it were the sixth hour ;
YLT	John	4	7	there cometh a woman out of Samaria to draw water . Jesus saith to her , ` Give me to drink ; '
YLT	John	4	8	for his disciples were gone away to the city , that they may buy victuals ;
YLT	John	4	9	the Samaritan woman therefore saith to him , ` How dost thou , being a Jew , ask drink from me , being a Samaritan woman ? ' for Jews have no dealing with Samaritans .
YLT	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said to her , ` If thou hadst known the gift of God , and who it is who is saying to thee , Give me to drink , thou wouldest have asked him , and he would have given thee living water . '
YLT	John	4	11	The woman saith to him , ` Sir , thou hast not even a vessel to draw with , and the well is deep ; whence , then , hast thou the living water ?
YLT	John	4	12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob , who did give us the well , and himself out of it did drink , and his sons , and his cattle ? '
YLT	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her , ` Every one who is drinking of this water shall thirst again ;
YLT	John	4	14	but whoever may drink of the water that I will give him , may not thirst -- to the age ; and the water that I will give him shall become in him a well of water , springing up to life age-during . '
YLT	John	4	15	The woman saith unto him , ` Sir , give me this water , that I may not thirst , nor come hither to draw . '
YLT	John	4	16	Jesus saith to her , ` Go , call thy husband , and come hither ; '
YLT	John	4	17	the woman answered and said , ` I have not a husband . ' Jesus saith to her , ` Well didst thou say -- A husband I have not ;
YLT	John	4	18	for five husbands thou hast had , and , now , he whom thou hast is not thy husband ; this hast thou said truly . '
YLT	John	4	19	The woman saith to him , ` Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet ;
YLT	John	4	20	our fathers in this mountain did worship , and ye -- ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where it behoveth to worship . '
YLT	John	4	21	Jesus saith to her , ` Woman , believe me , that there doth come an hour , when neither in this mountain , nor in Jerusalem , shall ye worship the Father ;
YLT	John	4	22	ye worship what ye have not known ; we worship what we have known , because the salvation is of the Jews ;
YLT	John	4	23	but , there cometh an hour , and it now is , when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father also doth seek such to worship him ;
YLT	John	4	24	God [ is ] a Spirit , and those worshipping Him , in spirit and truth it doth behove to worship . '
YLT	John	4	25	The woman saith to him , ` I have known that Messiah doth come , who is called Christ , when that one may come , he will tell us all things ; '
YLT	John	4	26	Jesus saith to her , ` I am [ he ] , who am speaking to thee . '
YLT	John	4	27	And upon this came his disciples , and were wondering that with a woman he was speaking , no one , however , said , ` What seekest thou ? ' or ` Why speakest thou with her ? '
YLT	John	4	28	The woman then left her water-jug , and went away to the city , and saith to the men ,
YLT	John	4	29	` Come , see a man , who told me all things -- as many as I did ; is this the Christ ? '
YLT	John	4	30	They went forth therefore out of the city , and were coming unto him .
YLT	John	4	31	And in the meanwhile his disciples were asking him , saying , ` Rabbi , eat ; '
YLT	John	4	32	and he said to them , ` I have food to eat that ye have not known . '
YLT	John	4	33	The disciples then said one to another , ` Did any one bring him anything to eat ? '
YLT	John	4	34	Jesus saith to them , ` My food is , that I may do the will of Him who sent me , and may finish His work ;
YLT	John	4	35	do not say that it is yet four months , and the harvest cometh ; lo , I say to you , Lift up your eyes , and see the fields , that they are white unto harvest already .
YLT	John	4	36	` And he who is reaping doth receive a reward , and doth gather fruit to life age-during , that both he who is sowing and he who is reaping may rejoice together ;
YLT	John	4	37	for in this the saying is the true one , that one is the sower and another the reaper .
YLT	John	4	38	I sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured ; others laboured , and ye into their labour have entered .
YLT	John	4	39	And from that city many believed in him , of the Samaritans , because of the word of the woman testifying , -- ` He told me all things -- as many as I did . '
YLT	John	4	40	When , then , the Samaritans came unto him , they were asking him to remain with them , and he remained there two days ;
YLT	John	4	41	and many more did believe because of his word ,
YLT	John	4	42	and said to the woman -- ` No more because of thy speaking do we believe ; for we ourselves have heard and known that this is truly the Saviour of the world -- the Christ . '
YLT	John	4	43	And after the two days he went forth thence , and went away to Galilee ,
YLT	John	4	44	for Jesus himself testified that a prophet in his own country shall not have honour ;
YLT	John	4	45	when then , he came to Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all things that he did in Jerusalem in the feast -- for they also went to the feast .
YLT	John	4	46	Jesus came , therefore , again to Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine , and there was a certain courtier , whose son was ailing in Capernaum ,
YLT	John	4	47	he , having heard that Jesus is come out of Judea to Galilee , went away unto him , and was asking him that he may come down and may heal his son , for he was about to die .
YLT	John	4	48	Jesus then said unto him , ` If signs and wonders ye may not see , ye will not believe . '
YLT	John	4	49	The courtier saith unto him , ` Sir , come down before my child die ; '
YLT	John	4	50	Jesus saith to him , ` Be going on ; thy son doth live . ' And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him , and was going on ,
YLT	John	4	51	and he now going down , his servants met him , and told , saying -- ` Thy child doth live ; '
YLT	John	4	52	he inquired then of them the hour in which he became better , and they said to him -- ` Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him ; '
YLT	John	4	53	then the father knew that [ it was ] in that hour in which Jesus said to him -- ` Thy son doth live , ' and he himself believed , and his whole house ;
YLT	John	4	54	this again a second sign did Jesus , having come out of Judea to Galilee .
YLT	John	5	5	and there was a certain man there being in ailment thirty and eight years ,
YLT	John	5	2	and there is in Jerusalem by the sheep- [ gate ] a pool that is called in Hebrew Bethesda , having five porches ,
YLT	John	5	3	in these were lying a great multitude of the ailing , blind , lame , withered , waiting for the moving of the water ,
YLT	John	5	4	for a messenger at a set time was going down in the pool , and was troubling the water , the first then having gone in after the troubling of the water , became whole of whatever sickness he was held .
YLT	John	5	6	him Jesus having seen lying , and having known that he is already a long time , he saith to him , ` Dost thou wish to become whole ? '
YLT	John	5	7	The ailing man answered him , ` Sir , I have no man , that , when the water may be troubled , he may put me into the pool , and while I am coming , another doth go down before me . '
YLT	John	5	8	Jesus saith to him , ` Rise , take up thy couch , and be walking ; '
YLT	John	5	9	and immediately the man became whole , and he took up his couch , and was walking , and it was a sabbath on that day ,
YLT	John	5	10	the Jews then said to him that hath been healed , ` It is a sabbath ; it is not lawful to thee to take up the couch . '
YLT	John	5	11	He answered them , ` He who made me whole -- that one said to me , Take up thy couch , and be walking ; '
YLT	John	5	12	they questioned him , then , ` Who is the man who is saying to thee , Take up thy couch and be walking ? '
YLT	John	5	13	But he that was healed had not known who he is , for Jesus did move away , a multitude being in the place .
YLT	John	5	14	After these things , Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said to him , ` Lo , thou hast become whole ; sin no more , lest something worse may happen to thee . '
YLT	John	5	15	The man went away , and told the Jews that it is Jesus who made him whole ,
YLT	John	5	16	and because of this were the Jews persecuting Jesus , and seeking to kill him , because these things he was doing on a sabbath .
YLT	John	5	17	And Jesus answered them , ` My Father till now doth work , and I work ; '
YLT	John	5	18	because of this , then , were the Jews seeking the more to kill him , because not only was he breaking the sabbath , but he also called God his own Father , making himself equal to God .
YLT	John	5	19	Jesus therefore responded and said to them , ` Verily , verily , I say to you , The Son is not able to do anything of himself , if he may not see the Father doing anything ; for whatever things He may do , these also the Son in like manner doth ;
YLT	John	5	20	for the Father doth love the Son , and doth shew to him all things that He himself doth ; and greater works than these He will shew him , that ye may wonder .
YLT	John	5	21	` For , as the Father doth raise the dead , and doth make alive , so also the Son doth make alive whom he willeth ;
YLT	John	5	22	for neither doth the Father judge any one , but all the judgment He hath given to the Son ,
YLT	John	5	23	that all may honour the Son according as they honour the Father ; he who is not honouring the Son , doth not honour the Father who sent him .
YLT	John	5	24	` Verily , verily , I say to you -- He who is hearing my word , and is believing Him who sent me , hath life age-during , and to judgment he doth not come , but hath passed out of the death to the life .
YLT	John	5	25	` Verily , verily , I say to you -- There cometh an hour , and it now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God , and those having heard shall live ;
YLT	John	5	26	for , as the Father hath life in himself , so He gave also to the Son to have life in himself ,
YLT	John	5	27	and authority He gave him also to do judgment , because he is Son of Man .
YLT	John	5	28	` Wonder not at this , because there doth come an hour in which all those in the tombs shall hear his voice ,
YLT	John	5	29	and they shall come forth ; those who did the good things to a rising again of life , and those who practised the evil things to a rising again of judgment .
YLT	John	5	30	` I am not able of myself to do anything ; according as I hear I judge , and my judgment is righteous , because I seek not my own will , but the will of the Father who sent me .
YLT	John	5	31	` If I testify concerning myself , my testimony is not true ;
YLT	John	5	32	another there is who is testifying concerning me , and I have known that the testimony that he doth testify concerning me is true ;
YLT	John	5	33	ye have sent unto John , and he hath testified to the truth .
YLT	John	5	34	` But I do not receive testimony from man , but these things I say that ye may be saved ;
YLT	John	5	35	he was the burning and shining lamp , and ye did will to be glad , for an hour , in his light .
YLT	John	5	36	` But I have the testimony greater than John 's , for the works that the Father gave me , that I might finish them , the works themselves that I do , they testify concerning me , that the Father hath sent me .
YLT	John	5	37	` And the Father who sent me Himself hath testified concerning me ; ye have neither heard His voice at any time , nor His appearance have ye seen ;
YLT	John	5	38	and His word ye have not remaining in you , because whom He sent , him ye do not believe .
YLT	John	5	39	` Ye search the Writings , because ye think in them to have life age-during , and these are they that are testifying concerning me ;
YLT	John	5	40	and ye do not will to come unto me , that ye may have life ;
YLT	John	5	41	glory from man I do not receive ,
YLT	John	5	42	but I have known you , that the love of God ye have not in yourselves .
YLT	John	5	43	` I have come in the name of my Father , and ye do not receive me ; if another may come in his own name , him ye will receive ;
YLT	John	5	44	how are ye able -- ye -- to believe , glory from one another receiving , and the glory that [ is ] from God alone ye seek not ?
YLT	John	5	45	` Do not think that I will accuse you unto the Father ; there is who is accusing you , Moses -- in whom ye have hoped ;
YLT	John	5	46	for if ye were believing Moses , ye would have been believing me , for he wrote concerning me ;
YLT	John	5	47	but if his writings ye believe not , how shall ye believe my sayings ? '
YLT	John	6	6	and this he said , trying him , for he himself had known what he was about to do .
YLT	John	6	2	and there was following him a great multitude , because they were seeing his signs that he was doing on the ailing ;
YLT	John	6	3	and Jesus went up to the mount , and he was there sitting with his disciples ,
YLT	John	6	4	and the passover was nigh , the feast of the Jews .
YLT	John	6	5	Jesus then having lifted up [ his ] eyes and having seen that a great multitude doth come to him , saith unto Philip , ` Whence shall we buy loaves , that these may eat ? ' --
YLT	John	6	7	Philip answered him , ` Two hundred denaries ' worth of loaves are not sufficient to them , that each of them may receive some little ; '
YLT	John	6	8	one of his disciples -- Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter -- saith to him ,
YLT	John	6	9	` There is one little lad here who hath five barley loaves , and two fishes , but these -- what are they to so many ? '
YLT	John	6	10	And Jesus said , ` Make the men to sit down ; ' and there was much grass in the place , the men then sat down , in number , as it were , five thousand ,
YLT	John	6	11	and Jesus took the loaves , and having given thanks he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to those reclining , in like manner , also of the little fishes as much as they wished .
YLT	John	6	12	And when they were filled , he saith to his disciples , ` Gather together the broken pieces that are over , that nothing may be lost ; '
YLT	John	6	13	they gathered together , therefore , and filled twelve hand-baskets with broken pieces , from the five barley loaves that were over to those having eaten .
YLT	John	6	14	The men , then , having seen the sign that Jesus did , said -- ` This is truly the Prophet , who is coming to the world ; '
YLT	John	6	15	Jesus , therefore , having known that they are about to come , and to take him by force that they may make him king , retired again to the mountain himself alone .
YLT	John	6	16	And when evening came , his disciples went down to the sea ,
YLT	John	6	17	and having entered into the boat , they were going over the sea to Capernaum , and darkness had already come , and Jesus had not come unto them ,
YLT	John	6	18	the sea also -- a great wind blowing -- was being raised ,
YLT	John	6	19	having pushed onwards , therefore , about twenty-five or thirty furlongs , they behold Jesus walking on the sea , and coming nigh to the boat , and they were afraid ;
YLT	John	6	20	and he saith to them , ` I am [ he ] , be not afraid ; '
YLT	John	6	21	they were willing then to receive him into the boat , and immediately the boat came unto the land to which they were going .
YLT	John	6	22	On the morrow , the multitude that was standing on the other side of the sea , having seen that there was no other little boat there except one -- that into which his disciples entered -- and that Jesus went not in with his disciples into the little boat , but his disciples went away alone ,
YLT	John	6	23	( and other little boats came from Tiberias , nigh the place where they did eat the bread , the Lord having given thanks ) ,
YLT	John	6	24	when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there , nor his disciples , they also themselves did enter into the boats , and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus ;
YLT	John	6	25	and having found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him , ` Rabbi , when hast thou come hither ? '
YLT	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , ` Verily , verily , I say to you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw signs , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were satisfied ;
YLT	John	6	27	work not for the food that is perishing , but for the food that is remaining to life age-during , which the Son of Man will give to you , for him did the Father seal -- [ even ] God . '
YLT	John	6	28	They said therefore unto him , ` What may we do that we may work the works of God ? '
YLT	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them , ` This is the work of God , that ye may believe in him whom He did send . '
YLT	John	6	30	They said therefore to him , ` What sign , then , dost thou , that we may see and may believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
YLT	John	6	31	our fathers the manna did eat in the wilderness , according as it is having been written , Bread out of the heaven He gave them to eat . '
YLT	John	6	32	Jesus , therefore , said to them , ` Verily , verily , I say to you , Moses did not give you the bread out of the heaven ; but my Father doth give you the true bread out of the heaven ;
YLT	John	6	33	for the bread of God is that which is coming down out of the heaven , and giving life to the world . '
YLT	John	6	34	They said , therefore , unto him , ` Sir , always give us this bread . '
YLT	John	6	35	And Jesus said to them , ` I am the bread of the life ; he who is coming unto me may not hunger , and he who is believing in me may not thirst -- at any time ;
YLT	John	6	36	but I said to you , that ye also have seen me , and ye believe not ;
YLT	John	6	37	all that the Father doth give to me will come unto me ; and him who is coming unto me , I may in no wise cast without ,
YLT	John	6	38	because I have come down out of the heaven , not that I may do my will , but the will of Him who sent me .
YLT	John	6	39	` And this is the will of the Father who sent me , that all that He hath given to me I may not lose of it , but may raise it up in the last day ;
YLT	John	6	40	and this is the will of Him who sent me , that every one who is beholding the Son , and is believing in him , may have life age-during , and I will raise him up in the last day . '
YLT	John	6	41	The Jews , therefore , were murmuring at him , because he said , ` I am the bread that came down out of the heaven ; '
YLT	John	6	42	and they said , ` Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we have known ? how then saith this one -- Out of the heaven I have come down ? '
YLT	John	6	43	Jesus answered , therefore , and said to them , ` Murmur not one with another ;
YLT	John	6	44	no one is able to come unto me , if the Father who sent me may not draw him , and I will raise him up in the last day ;
YLT	John	6	45	it is having been written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God ; every one therefore who heard from the Father , and learned , cometh to me ;
YLT	John	6	46	not that any one hath seen the Father , except he who is from God , he hath seen the Father .
YLT	John	6	47	` Verily , verily , I say to you , He who is believing in me , hath life age-during ;
YLT	John	6	48	I am the bread of the life ;
YLT	John	6	49	your fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness , and they died ;
YLT	John	6	50	this is the bread that out of the heaven is coming down , that any one may eat of it , and not die .
YLT	John	6	51	` I am the living bread that came down out of the heaven ; if any one may eat of this bread he shall live -- to the age ; and the bread also that I will give is my flesh , that I will give for the life of the world . '
YLT	John	6	52	The Jews , therefore , were striving with one another , saying , ` How is this one able to give us [ his ] flesh to eat ? '
YLT	John	6	53	Jesus , therefore , said to them , ` Verily , verily , I say to you , If ye may not eat the flesh of the Son of Man , and may not drink his blood , ye have no life in yourselves ;
YLT	John	6	54	he who is eating my flesh , and is drinking my blood , hath life age-during , and I will raise him up in the last day ;
YLT	John	6	55	for my flesh truly is food , and my blood truly is drink ;
YLT	John	6	56	he who is eating my flesh , and is drinking my blood , doth remain in me , and I in him .
YLT	John	6	57	` According as the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , he also who is eating me , even that one shall live because of me ;
YLT	John	6	58	this is the bread that came down out of the heaven ; not as your fathers did eat the manna , and died ; he who is eating this bread shall live -- to the age . '
YLT	John	6	59	These things he said in a synagogue , teaching in Capernaum ;
YLT	John	6	60	many , therefore , of his disciples having heard , said , ` This word is hard ; who is able to hear it ? '
YLT	John	6	61	And Jesus having known in himself that his disciples are murmuring about this , said to them , ` Doth this stumble you ?
YLT	John	6	62	if then ye may behold the Son of Man going up where he was before ?
YLT	John	6	63	the spirit it is that is giving life ; the flesh doth not profit anything ; the sayings that I speak to you are spirit , and they are life ;
YLT	John	6	64	but there are certain of you who do not believe ; ' for Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who are not believing , and who is he who will deliver him up ,
YLT	John	6	65	and he said , ` Because of this I have said to you -- No one is able to come unto me , if it may not have been given him from my Father . '
YLT	John	6	66	From this [ time ] many of his disciples went away backward , and were no more walking with him ,
YLT	John	6	67	Jesus , therefore , said to the twelve , ` Do ye also wish to go away ? '
YLT	John	6	68	Simon Peter , therefore , answered him , ` Sir , unto whom shall we go ? thou hast sayings of life age-during ;
YLT	John	6	69	and we have believed , and we have known , that thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God . '
YLT	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , ` Did not I choose you -- the twelve ? and of you -- one is a devil .
YLT	John	6	71	And he spake of Judas , Simon 's [ son ] , Iscariot , for he was about to deliver him up , being one of the twelve .
YLT	John	7	7	the world is not able to hate you , but me it doth hate , because I testify concerning it that its works are evil .
YLT	John	7	2	and the feast of the Jews was nigh -- that of tabernacles --
YLT	John	7	3	his brethren , therefore , said unto him , ` Remove hence , and go away to Judea , that thy disciples also may behold thy works that thou dost ;
YLT	John	7	4	for no one in secret doth anything , and himself seeketh to be in public ; if thou dost these things -- manifest thyself to the world ; '
YLT	John	7	5	for not even were his brethren believing in him .
YLT	John	7	6	Jesus , therefore , saith to them , ` My time is not yet present , but your time is always ready ;
YLT	John	7	8	Ye -- go ye up to this feast ; I do not yet go up to this feast , because my time hath not yet been fulfilled ; '
YLT	John	7	9	and saying these things to them , he remained in Galilee .
YLT	John	7	10	And when his brethren went up , then also he himself went up to the feast , not manifestly , but as in secret ;
YLT	John	7	11	the Jews , therefore , were seeking him , in the feast , and said , ` Where is that one ? '
YLT	John	7	12	and there was much murmuring about him among the multitudes , some indeed said -- ` He is good ; ' and others said , ` No , but he leadeth astray the multitude ; '
YLT	John	7	13	no one , however , was speaking freely about him , through fear of the Jews .
YLT	John	7	14	And it being now the middle of the feast , Jesus went up to the temple , and he was teaching ,
YLT	John	7	15	and the Jews were wondering , saying , ` How hath this one known letters -- not having learned ? '
YLT	John	7	16	Jesus answered them and said , ` My teaching is not mine , but His who sent me ;
YLT	John	7	17	if any one may will to do His will , he shall know concerning the teaching , whether it is of God , or -- I do speak from myself .
YLT	John	7	18	` He who is speaking from himself his own glory doth seek , but he who is seeking the glory of him who sent him , this one is true , and unrighteousness is not in him ;
YLT	John	7	19	hath not Moses given you the law ? and none of you doth the law ; why me do ye seek to kill ? '
YLT	John	7	20	The multitude answered and said , ` Thou hast a demon , who doth seek to kill thee ? '
YLT	John	7	21	Jesus answered and said to them , ` One work I did , and ye all wonder ,
YLT	John	7	22	because of this , Moses hath given you the circumcision -- not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers -- and on a sabbath ye circumcise a man ;
YLT	John	7	23	if a man doth receive circumcision on a sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken , are ye wroth with me that I made a man all whole on a sabbath ?
YLT	John	7	24	judge not according to appearance , but the righteous judgment judge . '
YLT	John	7	25	Certain , therefore , of the Jerusalemites said , ` Is not this he whom they are seeking to kill ?
YLT	John	7	26	and , lo , he doth speak freely , and they say nothing to him ; did the rulers at all know truly that this is truly the Christ ?
YLT	John	7	27	but this one -- we have known whence he is ; and the Christ , when he doth come , no one doth know whence he is . '
YLT	John	7	28	Jesus cried , therefore , in the temple , teaching and saying , ` Ye have both known me , and ye have known whence I am ; and I have not come of myself , but He who sent me is true , whom ye have not known ;
YLT	John	7	29	and I have known Him , because I am from Him , and He did send me . '
YLT	John	7	30	They were seeking , therefore , to seize him , and no one laid the hand on him , because his hour had not yet come ,
YLT	John	7	31	and many out of the multitude did believe in him , and said -- ` The Christ -- when he may come -- will he do more signs than these that this one did ? '
YLT	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him , and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers that they may take him ;
YLT	John	7	33	Jesus , therefore , said to them , ` Yet a little time I am with you , and I go away unto Him who sent me ;
YLT	John	7	34	ye will seek me , and ye shall not find ; and where I am , ye are not able to come . '
YLT	John	7	35	The Jews , therefore , said among themselves , ` Whither is this one about to go that we shall not find him ? -- to the dispersion of the Greeks is he about to go ? and to teach the Greeks ;
YLT	John	7	36	what is this word that he said , Ye will seek me , and ye shall not find ? and , Where I am , ye are not able to come ? '
YLT	John	7	37	And in the last , the great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , ` If any one doth thirst , let him come unto me and drink ;
YLT	John	7	38	he who is believing in me , according as the Writing said , Rivers out of his belly shall flow of living water ; '
YLT	John	7	39	and this he said of the Spirit , which those believing in him were about to receive ; for not yet was the Holy Spirit , because Jesus was not yet glorified .
YLT	John	7	40	Many , therefore out of the multitude , having heard the word , said , ` This is truly the Prophet ; '
YLT	John	7	41	others said , ` This is the Christ ; ' and others said , ` Why , out of Galilee doth the Christ come ?
YLT	John	7	42	Did not the Writing say , that out of the seed of David , and from Bethlehem -- the village where David was -- the Christ doth come ? '
YLT	John	7	43	A division , therefore , arose among the multitude because of him .
YLT	John	7	44	And certain of them were willing to seize him , but no one laid hands on him ;
YLT	John	7	45	the officers came , therefore , unto the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , ` Wherefore did ye not bring him ? '
YLT	John	7	46	The officers answered , ` Never so spake man -- as this man . '
YLT	John	7	47	The Pharisees , therefore , answered them , ` Have ye also been led astray ?
YLT	John	7	48	did any one out of the rulers believe in him ? or out of the Pharisees ?
YLT	John	7	49	but this multitude , that is not knowing the law , is accursed . '
YLT	John	7	50	Nicodemus saith unto them -- he who came by night unto him -- being one of them ,
YLT	John	7	51	` Doth our law judge the man , if it may not hear from him first , and know what he doth ? '
YLT	John	7	52	They answered and said to him , ` Art thou also out of Galilee ? search and see , that a prophet out of Galilee hath not risen ; '
YLT	John	7	53	and each one went on to his house , but Jesus went on to the mount of the Olives .
YLT	John	8	8	and again having stooped down , he was writing on the ground ,
YLT	John	8	2	and all the people were coming unto him , and having sat down , he was teaching them ;
YLT	John	8	3	and the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman having been taken in adultery , and having set her in the midst ,
YLT	John	8	4	they say to him , ` Teacher , this woman was taken in the very crime -- committing adultery ,
YLT	John	8	5	and in the law , Moses did command us that such be stoned ; thou , therefore , what dost thou say ? '
YLT	John	8	6	and this they said , trying him , that they might have to accuse him . And Jesus , having stooped down , with the finger he was writing on the ground ,
YLT	John	8	7	and when they continued asking him , having bent himself back , he said unto them , ` The sinless of you -- let him first cast the stone at her ; '
YLT	John	8	9	and they having heard , and by the conscience being convicted , were going forth one by one , having begun from the elders -- unto the last ; and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
YLT	John	8	10	And Jesus having bent himself back , and having seen no one but the woman , said to her , ` Woman , where are those -- thine accusers ? did no one pass sentence upon thee ? '
YLT	John	8	11	and she said , ` No one , Sir ; ' and Jesus said to her , ` Neither do I pass sentence on thee ; be going on , and no more sin . '
YLT	John	8	12	Again , therefore , Jesus spake to them , saying , ` I am the light of the world ; he who is following me shall not walk in the darkness , but he shall have the light of the life . '
YLT	John	8	13	The Pharisees , therefore , said to him , ` Thou of thyself dost testify , thy testimony is not true ; '
YLT	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them , ` And if I testify of myself -- my testimony is true , because I have known whence I came , and whither I go , and ye -- ye have not known whence I come , or whither I go .
YLT	John	8	15	` Ye according to the flesh do judge ; I do not judge any one ,
YLT	John	8	16	and even if I do judge my judgment is true , because I am not alone , but I and the Father who sent me ;
YLT	John	8	17	and also in your law it hath been written , that the testimony of two men are true ;
YLT	John	8	18	I am [ one ] who is testifying of myself , and the Father who sent me doth testify of me . '
YLT	John	8	19	They said , therefore , to him , ` Where is thy father ? ' Jesus answered , ` Ye have neither known me nor my Father : if me ye had known , my Father also ye had known . '
YLT	John	8	20	These sayings spake Jesus in the treasury , teaching in the temple , and no one seized him , because his hour had not yet come ;
YLT	John	8	21	therefore said Jesus again to them , ` I go away , and ye will seek me , and in your sin ye shall die ; whither I go away , ye are not able to come . '
YLT	John	8	22	The Jews , therefore , said , ` Will he kill himself , because he saith , Whither I go away , ye are not able to come ? '
YLT	John	8	23	and he said to them , ` Ye are from beneath , I am from above ; ye are of this world , I am not of this world ;
YLT	John	8	24	I said , therefore , to you , that ye shall die in your sins , for if ye may not believe that I am [ he ] , ye shall die in your sins . '
YLT	John	8	25	They said , therefore , to him , ` Thou -- who art thou ? ' and Jesus said to them , ` Even what I did speak of to you at the beginning ;
YLT	John	8	26	many things I have to speak concerning you and to judge , but He who sent me is true , and I -- what things I heard from Him -- these I say to the world . '
YLT	John	8	27	They knew not that of the Father he spake to them ;
YLT	John	8	28	Jesus , therefore , said to them , ` When ye may lift up the Son of Man then ye will know that I am [ he ] ; and of myself I do nothing , but according as my Father did teach me , these things I speak ;
YLT	John	8	29	and He who sent me is with me ; the Father did not leave me alone , because I , the things pleasing to Him , do always . '
YLT	John	8	30	As he is speaking these things , many believed in him ;
YLT	John	8	31	Jesus , therefore , said unto the Jews who believed in him , ` If ye may remain in my word , truly my disciples ye are , and ye shall know the truth ,
YLT	John	8	32	and the truth shall make you free . '
YLT	John	8	33	They answered him , ` Seed of Abraham we are ; and to no one have we been servants at any time ; how dost thou say -- Ye shall become free ? '
YLT	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , ` Verily , verily , I say to you -- Every one who is committing sin , is a servant of the sin ,
YLT	John	8	35	and the servant doth not remain in the house -- to the age , the son doth remain -- to the age ;
YLT	John	8	36	if then the son may make you free , in reality ye shall be free .
YLT	John	8	37	` I have known that ye are seed of Abraham , but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you ;
YLT	John	8	38	I -- that which I have seen with my Father do speak , and ye , therefore , that which ye have seen with your father -- ye do . '
YLT	John	8	39	They answered and said to him , ` Our father is Abraham ; ' Jesus saith to them , ` If children of Abraham ye were , the works of Abraham ye were doing ;
YLT	John	8	40	and now , ye seek to kill me -- a man who hath spoken to you the truth I heard from God ; this Abraham did not ;
YLT	John	8	41	ye do the works of your father . ' They said , therefore , to him , ` We of whoredom have not been born ; one Father we have -- God ; '
YLT	John	8	42	Jesus then said to them , ` If God were your father , ye were loving me , for I came forth from God , and am come ; for neither have I come of myself , but He sent me ;
YLT	John	8	43	wherefore do ye not know my speech ? because ye are not able to hear my word .
YLT	John	8	44	` Ye are of a father -- the devil , and the desires of your father ye will to do ; he was a man-slayer from the beginning , and in the truth he hath not stood , because there is no truth in him ; when one may speak the falsehood , of his own he speaketh , because he is a liar -- also his father .
YLT	John	8	45	` And because I say the truth , ye do not believe me .
YLT	John	8	46	Who of you doth convict me of sin ? and if I speak truth , wherefore do ye not believe me ?
YLT	John	8	47	he who is of God , the sayings of God he doth hear ; because of this ye do not hear , because of God ye are not . '
YLT	John	8	48	The Jews , therefore , answered and said to him , ` Do we not say well , that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a demon ? '
YLT	John	8	49	Jesus answered , ` I have not a demon , but I honour my Father , and ye dishonour me ;
YLT	John	8	50	and I do not seek my own glory ; there is who is seeking and is judging ;
YLT	John	8	51	verily , verily , I say to you , If any one may keep my word , death he may not see -- to the age . '
YLT	John	8	52	The Jews , therefore , said to him , ` Now we have known that thou hast a demon ; Abraham did die , and the prophets , and thou dost say , If any one may keep my word , he shall not taste of death -- to the age !
YLT	John	8	53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham , who died ? and the prophets died ; whom dost thou make thyself ? '
YLT	John	8	54	Jesus answered , ` If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing ; it is my Father who is glorifying me , of whom ye say that He is your God ;
YLT	John	8	55	and ye have not known Him , and I have known Him , and if I say that I have not known Him , I shall be like you -- speaking falsely ; but I have known Him , and His word I keep ;
YLT	John	8	56	Abraham , your father , was glad that he might see my day ; and he saw , and did rejoice . '
YLT	John	8	57	The Jews , therefore , said unto him , ` Thou art not yet fifty years old , and Abraham hast thou seen ? '
YLT	John	8	58	Jesus said to them , ` Verily , verily , I say to you , Before Abraham 's coming -- I am ; '
YLT	John	8	59	they took up , therefore , stones that they may cast at him , but Jesus hid himself , and went forth out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
YLT	John	9	9	others said -- ` This is he ; ' and others -- ` He is like to him ; ' he himself said , -- ` I am [ he ] . '
YLT	John	9	2	and his disciples asked him , saying , ` Rabbi , who did sin , this one or his parents , that he should be born blind ? '
YLT	John	9	3	Jesus answered , ` Neither did this one sin nor his parents , but that the works of God may be manifested in him ;
YLT	John	9	4	it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me while it is day ; night doth come , when no one is able to work : --
YLT	John	9	5	when I am in the world , I am a light of the world . '
YLT	John	9	6	These things saying , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man , and said to him ,
YLT	John	9	7	` Go away , wash at the pool of Siloam , ' which is , interpreted , Sent . He went away , therefore , and did wash , and came seeing ;
YLT	John	9	8	the neighbours , therefore , and those seeing him before , that he was blind , said , ` Is not this he who is sitting and begging ? '
YLT	John	9	10	They said , therefore , to him , ` How were thine eyes opened ? '
YLT	John	9	11	he answered and said , ` A man called Jesus made clay , and rubbed my eyes , and said to me , Go away to the pool of Siloam , and wash ; and having gone away and having washed , I received sight ; '
YLT	John	9	12	they said , therefore , to him , ` Where is that one ? ' he saith , ` I have not known . '
YLT	John	9	13	They bring him to the Pharisees who once [ was ] blind ,
YLT	John	9	14	and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
YLT	John	9	15	Again , therefore , the Pharisees also were asking him how he received sight , and he said to them , ` Clay he did put upon my eyes , and I did wash -- and I see . '
YLT	John	9	16	Of the Pharisees , therefore , certain said , ` This man is not from God , because the sabbath he doth not keep ; ' others said , ` How is a man -- a sinful one -- able to do such signs ? ' and there was a division among them .
YLT	John	9	17	They said to the blind man again , ` Thou -- what dost thou say of him -- that he opened thine eyes ? '
YLT	John	9	18	and he said -- ` He is a prophet . ' The Jews , therefore , did not believe concerning him that he was blind and did receive sight , till that they called the parents of him who received sight ,
YLT	John	9	19	and they asked them , saying , ` Is your son , of whom ye say that he was born blind ? how then now doth he see ? '
YLT	John	9	20	His parents answered them and said , ` We have known that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
YLT	John	9	21	and how he now seeth , we have not known ; or who opened his eyes , we have not known ; himself is of age , ask him ; he himself shall speak concerning himself . '
YLT	John	9	22	These things said his parents , because they were afraid of the Jews , for already had the Jews agreed together , that if any one may confess him -- Christ , he may be put out of the synagogue ;
YLT	John	9	23	because of this his parents said -- ` He is of age , ask him . '
YLT	John	9	24	They called , therefore , a second time the man who was blind , and they said to him , ` Give glory to God , we have known that this man is a sinner ; '
YLT	John	9	25	he answered , therefore , and said , ` If he be a sinner -- I have not known , one thing I have known , that , being blind , now I see . '
YLT	John	9	26	And they said to him again , ` What did he to thee ? how did he open thine eyes ? '
YLT	John	9	27	He answered them , ` I told you already , and ye did not hear ; why again do ye wish to hear ? do ye also wish to become his disciples ? '
YLT	John	9	28	They reviled him , therefore , and said , ` Thou art his disciple , and we are Moses ' disciples ;
YLT	John	9	29	we have known that God hath spoken to Moses , but this one -- we have not known whence he is . '
YLT	John	9	30	The man answered and said to them , ` Why , in this is a wonderful thing , that ye have not known whence he is , and he opened my eyes !
YLT	John	9	31	and we have known that God doth not hear sinners , but , if any one may be a worshipper of God , and may do His will , him He doth hear ;
YLT	John	9	32	from the age it was not heard , that any one did open eyes of one who hath been born blind ;
YLT	John	9	33	if this one were not from God , he were not able to do anything . '
YLT	John	9	34	They answered and said to him , ` In sins thou wast born altogether , and thou dost teach us ! ' and they cast him forth without .
YLT	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they cast him forth without , and having found him , he said to him , ` Dost thou believe in the Son of God ? '
YLT	John	9	36	he answered and said , ` Who is he , sir , that I may believe in him ? '
YLT	John	9	37	And Jesus said to him , ` Thou hast both seen him , and he who is speaking with thee is he ; '
YLT	John	9	38	and he said , ` I believe , sir , ' and bowed before him .
YLT	John	9	39	And Jesus said , ` For judgment I to this world did come , that those not seeing may see , and those seeing may become blind . '
YLT	John	9	40	And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things , and they said to him , ` Are we also blind ? '
YLT	John	9	41	Jesus said to them , ` If ye were blind , ye were not having had sin , but now ye say -- We see , therefore doth your sin remain .
YLT	John	10	10	` The thief doth not come , except that he may steal , and kill , and destroy ; I came that they may have life , and may have [ it ] abundantly .
YLT	John	10	2	and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep ;
YLT	John	10	3	to this one the doorkeeper doth open , and the sheep hear his voice , and his own sheep he doth call by name , and doth lead them forth ;
YLT	John	10	4	and when his own sheep he may put forth , before them he goeth on , and the sheep follow him , because they have known his voice ;
YLT	John	10	5	and a stranger they will not follow , but will flee from him , because they have not known the voice of strangers . '
YLT	John	10	6	This similitude spake Jesus to them , and they knew not what the things were that he was speaking to them ;
YLT	John	10	7	Jesus said therefore again to them , ` Verily , verily , I say to you -- I am the door of the sheep ;
YLT	John	10	8	all , as many as came before me , are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them ;
YLT	John	10	9	I am the door , through me if any one may come in , he shall be saved , and he shall come in , and go out , and find pasture .
YLT	John	10	11	` I am the good shepherd ; the good shepherd his life layeth down for the sheep ;
YLT	John	10	12	and the hireling , and not being a shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , doth behold the wolf coming , and doth leave the sheep , and doth flee ; and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep ;
YLT	John	10	13	and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling , and is not caring for the sheep .
YLT	John	10	14	` I am the good shepherd , and I know my [ sheep ] , and am known by mine ,
YLT	John	10	15	according as the Father doth know me , and I know the Father , and my life I lay down for the sheep ,
YLT	John	10	16	and other sheep I have that are not of this fold , these also it behoveth me to bring , and my voice they will hear , and there shall become one flock -- one shepherd .
YLT	John	10	17	` Because of this doth the Father love me , because I lay down my life , that again I may take it ;
YLT	John	10	18	no one doth take it from me , but I lay it down of myself ; authority I have to lay it down , and authority I have again to take it ; this command I received from my Father . '
YLT	John	10	19	Therefore , again , there came a division among the Jews , because of these words ,
YLT	John	10	20	and many of them said , ` He hath a demon , and is mad , why do ye hear him ? '
YLT	John	10	21	others said , ` These sayings are not those of a demoniac ; is a demon able blind men 's eyes to open ? '
YLT	John	10	22	And the dedication in Jerusalem came , and it was winter ,
YLT	John	10	23	and Jesus was walking in the temple , in the porch of Solomon ,
YLT	John	10	24	the Jews , therefore , came round about him , and said to him , ` Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense ? if thou art the Christ , tell us freely . '
YLT	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , ` I told you , and ye do not believe ; the works that I do in the name of my Father , these testify concerning me ;
YLT	John	10	26	but ye do not believe , for ye are not of my sheep ,
YLT	John	10	27	according as I said to you : My sheep my voice do hear , and I know them , and they follow me ,
YLT	John	10	28	and life age-during I give to them , and they shall not perish -- to the age , and no one shall pluck them out of my hand ;
YLT	John	10	29	my Father , who hath given to me , is greater than all , and no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father ;
YLT	John	10	30	I and the Father are one . '
YLT	John	10	31	Therefore , again , did the Jews take up stones that they may stone him ;
YLT	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , ` Many good works did I shew you from my Father ; because of which work of them do ye stone me ? '
YLT	John	10	33	The Jews answered him , saying , ` For a good work we do not stone thee , but for evil speaking , and because thou , being a man , dost make thyself God . '
YLT	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , ` Is it not having been written in your law : I said , ye are gods ?
YLT	John	10	35	if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came , ( and the Writing is not able to be broken , )
YLT	John	10	36	of him whom the Father did sanctify , and send to the world , do ye say -- Thou speakest evil , because I said , Son of God I am ?
YLT	John	10	37	if I do not the works of my Father , do not believe me ;
YLT	John	10	38	and if I do , even if me ye may not believe , the works believe , that ye may know and may believe that in me [ is ] the Father , and I in Him . '
YLT	John	10	39	Therefore were they seeking again to seize him , and he went forth out of their hand ,
YLT	John	10	40	and went away again to the other side of the Jordan , to the place where John was at first baptizing , and remained there ,
YLT	John	10	41	and many came unto him , and said -- ` John , indeed , did no sign , and all things , as many as John said about this one were true ; '
YLT	John	10	42	and many did believe in him there .
YLT	John	11	11	These things he said , and after this he saith to them , ` Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep , but I go on that I may awake him ; '
YLT	John	11	2	and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment , and did wipe his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was ailing --
YLT	John	11	3	therefore sent the sisters unto him , saying , ` Sir , lo , he whom thou dost love is ailing ; '
YLT	John	11	4	and Jesus having heard , said , ` This ailment is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified through it . '
YLT	John	11	5	And Jesus was loving Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus ,
YLT	John	11	6	when , therefore , he heard that he is ailing , then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days ,
YLT	John	11	7	then after this , he saith to the disciples , ` We may go to Judea again ; '
YLT	John	11	8	the disciples say to him , ` Rabbi , now were the Jews seeking to stone thee , and again thou dost go thither ! '
YLT	John	11	9	Jesus answered , ` Are there not twelve hours in the day ? if any one may walk in the day , he doth not stumble , because the light of this world he doth see ;
YLT	John	11	10	and if any one may walk in the night , he stumbleth , because the light is not in him . '
YLT	John	11	12	therefore said his disciples , ` Sir , if he hath fallen asleep , he will be saved ; '
YLT	John	11	13	but Jesus had spoken about his death , but they thought that about the repose of sleep he speaketh .
YLT	John	11	14	Then , therefore , Jesus said to them freely , ` Lazarus hath died ;
YLT	John	11	15	and I rejoice , for your sake , ( that ye may believe , ) that I was not there ; but we may go to him ; '
YLT	John	11	16	therefore said Thomas , who is called Didymus , to the fellow-disciples , ` We may go -- we also , that we may die with him , '
YLT	John	11	17	Jesus , therefore , having come , found him having been four days already in the tomb .
YLT	John	11	18	And Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off ,
YLT	John	11	19	and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary , that they might comfort them concerning their brother ;
YLT	John	11	20	Martha , therefore , when she heard that Jesus doth come , met him , and Mary kept sitting in the house .
YLT	John	11	21	Martha , therefore , said unto Jesus , ` Sir , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died ;
YLT	John	11	22	but even now , I have known that whatever thou mayest ask of God , God will give to thee ; '
YLT	John	11	23	Jesus saith to her , ` Thy brother shall rise again . '
YLT	John	11	24	Martha saith to him , ` I have known that he will rise again , in the rising again in the last day ; '
YLT	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , ` I am the rising again , and the life ; he who is believing in me , even if he may die , shall live ;
YLT	John	11	26	and every one who is living and believing in me shall not die -- to the age ;
YLT	John	11	27	believest thou this ? ' she saith to him , ` Yes , sir , I have believed that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , who is coming to the world . '
YLT	John	11	28	And these things having said , she went away , and called Mary her sister privately , saying , ` The Teacher is present , and doth call thee ; '
YLT	John	11	29	she , when she heard , riseth up quickly , and doth come to him ;
YLT	John	11	30	and Jesus had not yet come to the village , but was in the place where Martha met him ;
YLT	John	11	31	the Jews , therefore , who were with her in the house , and were comforting her , having seen Mary that she rose up quickly and went forth , followed her , saying -- ` She doth go away to the tomb , that she may weep there . '
YLT	John	11	32	Mary , therefore , when she came where Jesus was , having seen him , fell at his feet , saying to him , ` Sir , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died ; '
YLT	John	11	33	Jesus , therefore , when he saw her weeping , and the Jews who came with her weeping , did groan in the spirit , and troubled himself , and he said ,
YLT	John	11	34	` Where have ye laid him ? ' they say to him , ` Sir , come and see ; '
YLT	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
YLT	John	11	36	The Jews , therefore , said , ` Lo , how he was loving him ! '
YLT	John	11	37	and certain of them said , ` Was not this one , who did open the eyes of the blind man , able to cause that also this one might not have died ? '
YLT	John	11	38	Jesus , therefore , again groaning in himself , cometh to the tomb , and it was a cave , and a stone was lying upon it ,
YLT	John	11	39	Jesus saith , ` Take ye away the stone ; ' the sister of him who hath died -- Martha -- saith to him , ` Sir , already he stinketh , for he is four days dead ; '
YLT	John	11	40	Jesus saith to her , ` Said I not to thee , that if thou mayest believe , thou shalt see the glory of God ? '
YLT	John	11	41	They took away , therefore , the stone where the dead was laid , and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards , and said , ` Father , I thank Thee , that Thou didst hear me ;
YLT	John	11	42	and I knew that Thou always dost hear me , but , because of the multitude that is standing by , I said [ it ] , that they may believe that Thou didst send me . '
YLT	John	11	43	And these things saying , with a loud voice he cried out , ` Lazarus , come forth ; '
YLT	John	11	44	and he who died came forth , being bound feet and hands with grave-clothes , and his visage with a napkin was bound about ; Jesus saith to them , ` Loose him , and suffer to go . '
YLT	John	11	45	Many , therefore , of the Jews who came unto Mary , and beheld what Jesus did , believed in him ;
YLT	John	11	46	but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees , and told them what Jesus did ;
YLT	John	11	47	the chief priests , therefore , and the Pharisees , gathered together a sanhedrim , and said , ` What may we do ? because this man doth many signs ?
YLT	John	11	48	if we may let him alone thus , all will believe in him ; and the Romans will come , and will take away both our place and nation . '
YLT	John	11	49	and a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being chief priest of that year , said to them , ` Ye have not known anything ,
YLT	John	11	50	nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people , and not the whole nation perish . '
YLT	John	11	51	And this he said not of himself , but being chief priest of that year , he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the nation ,
YLT	John	11	52	and not for the nation only , but that also the children of God , who have been scattered abroad , he may gather together into one .
YLT	John	11	53	From that day , therefore , they took counsel together that they may kill him ;
YLT	John	11	54	Jesus , therefore , was no more freely walking among the Jews , but went away thence to the region nigh the wilderness , to a city called Ephraim , and there he tarried with his disciples .
YLT	John	11	55	And the passover of the Jews was nigh , and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover , that they might purify themselves ;
YLT	John	11	56	they were seeking , therefore , Jesus , and said one with another , standing in the temple , ` What doth appear to you -- that he may not come to the feast ? '
YLT	John	11	57	and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command , that if any one may know where he is , he may shew [ it ] , so that they may seize him .
YLT	John	12	12	On the morrow , a great multitude that came to the feast , having heard that Jesus doth come to Jerusalem ,
YLT	John	12	2	they made , therefore , to him a supper there , and Martha was ministering , and Lazarus was one of those reclining together ( at meat ) with him ;
YLT	John	12	3	Mary , therefore , having taken a pound of ointment of spikenard , of great price , anointed the feet of Jesus and did wipe with her hair his feet , and the house was filled from the fragrance of the ointment .
YLT	John	12	4	Therefore saith one of his disciples -- Judas Iscariot , of Simon , who is about to deliver him up --
YLT	John	12	5	` Wherefore was not this ointment sold for three hundred denaries , and given to the poor ? '
YLT	John	12	6	and he said this , not because he was caring for the poor , but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and what things were put in he was carrying .
YLT	John	12	7	Jesus , therefore , said , ` Suffer her ; for the day of my embalming she hath kept it ,
YLT	John	12	8	for the poor ye have always with yourselves , and me ye have not always . '
YLT	John	12	9	A great multitude , therefore , of the Jews knew that he is there , and they came , not because of Jesus only , but that Lazarus also they may see , whom he raised out of the dead ;
YLT	John	12	10	and the chief priests took counsel , that also Lazarus they may kill ,
YLT	John	12	11	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away , and were believing in Jesus .
YLT	John	12	13	took the branches of the palms , and went forth to meet him , and were crying , ` Hosanna , blessed [ is ] he who is coming in the name of the Lord -- the king of Israel ; '
YLT	John	12	14	and Jesus having found a young ass did sit upon it , according as it is written ,
YLT	John	12	15	` Fear not , daughter of Sion , lo , thy king doth come , sitting on an ass ' colt . '
YLT	John	12	16	And these things his disciples did not know at the first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were having been written about him , and these things they did to him .
YLT	John	12	17	The multitude , therefore , who are with him , were testifying that he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and did raise him out of the dead ;
YLT	John	12	18	because of this also did the multitude meet him , because they heard of his having done this sign ,
YLT	John	12	19	the Pharisees , therefore , said among themselves , ` Ye see that ye do not gain anything , lo , the world did go after him . '
YLT	John	12	20	And there were certain Greeks out of those coming up that they may worship in the feast ,
YLT	John	12	21	these then came near to Philip , who [ is ] from Bethsaida of Galilee , and were asking him , saying , ` Sir , we wish to see Jesus ; '
YLT	John	12	22	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew , and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus .
YLT	John	12	23	And Jesus responded to them , saying , ` The hour hath come that the Son of Man may be glorified ;
YLT	John	12	24	verily , verily , I say to you , if the grain of the wheat , having fallen to the earth , may not die , itself remaineth alone ; and if it may die , it doth bear much fruit ;
YLT	John	12	25	he who is loving his life shall lose it , and he who is hating his life in this world -- to life age-during shall keep it ;
YLT	John	12	26	if any one may minister to me , let him follow me , and where I am , there also my ministrant shall be ; and if any one may minister to me -- honour him will the Father .
YLT	John	12	27	` Now hath my soul been troubled , and what ? shall I say -- Father , save me from this hour ? -- but because of this I came to this hour ;
YLT	John	12	28	Father , glorify Thy name . ' There came , therefore , a voice out of the heaven , ` I both glorified , and again I will glorify [ it ] ; '
YLT	John	12	29	the multitude , therefore , having stood and heard , were saying that there hath been thunder ; others said , ` A messenger hath spoken to him . '
YLT	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , ` Not because of me hath this voice come , but because of you ;
YLT	John	12	31	now is a judgment of this world , now shall the ruler of this world be cast forth ;
YLT	John	12	32	and I , if I may be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto myself . '
YLT	John	12	33	And this he said signifying by what death he was about to die ;
YLT	John	12	34	the multitude answered him , ` We heard out of the law that the Christ doth remain -- to the age ; and how dost thou say , That it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up ? who is this -- the Son of Man ? '
YLT	John	12	35	Jesus , therefore , said to them , ` Yet a little time is the light with you ; walk while ye have the light , that darkness may not overtake you ; and he who is walking in the darkness hath not known where he goeth ;
YLT	John	12	36	while ye have the light , believe in the light , that sons of light ye may become . ' These things spake Jesus , and having gone away , he was hid from them ,
YLT	John	12	37	yet he having done so many signs before them , they were not believing in him ,
YLT	John	12	38	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he said , ` Lord , who gave credence to our report ? and the arm of the Lord -- to whom was it revealed ? '
YLT	John	12	39	Because of this they were not able to believe , that again Isaiah said ,
YLT	John	12	40	` He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart , that they might not see with the eyes , and understand with the heart , and turn back , and I might heal them ; '
YLT	John	12	41	these things said Isaiah , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
YLT	John	12	42	Still , however , also out of the rulers did many believe in him , but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing , that they might not be put out of the synagogue ,
YLT	John	12	43	for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God .
YLT	John	12	44	And Jesus cried and said , ` He who is believing in me , doth not believe in me , but in Him who sent me ;
YLT	John	12	45	and he who is beholding me , doth behold Him who sent me ;
YLT	John	12	46	I a light to the world have come , that every one who is believing in me -- in the darkness may not remain ;
YLT	John	12	47	and if any one may hear my sayings , and not believe , I -- I do not judge him , for I came not that I might judge the world , but that I might save the world .
YLT	John	12	48	` He who is rejecting me , and not receiving my sayings , hath one who is judging him , the word that I spake , that will judge him in the last day ,
YLT	John	12	49	because I spake not from myself , but the Father who sent me , He did give me a command , what I may say , and what I may speak ,
YLT	John	12	50	and I have known that His command is life age-during ; what , therefore , I speak , according as the Father hath said to me , so I speak . '
YLT	John	13	13	ye call me , The Teacher and The Lord , and ye say well , for I am ;
YLT	John	13	2	And supper being come , the devil already having put [ it ] into the heart of Judas of Simon , Iscariot , that he may deliver him up ,
YLT	John	13	3	Jesus knowing that all things the Father hath given to him -- into [ his ] hands , and that from God he came forth , and unto God he goeth ,
YLT	John	13	4	doth rise from the supper , and doth lay down his garments , and having taken a towel , he girded himself ;
YLT	John	13	5	afterward he putteth water into the basin , and began to wash the feet of his disciples , and to wipe with the towel with which he was being girded .
YLT	John	13	6	He cometh , therefore , unto Simon Peter , and that one saith to him , ` Sir , thou -- dost thou wash my feet ? '
YLT	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him , ` That which I do thou hast not known now , but thou shalt know after these things ; '
YLT	John	13	8	Peter saith to him , ` Thou mayest not wash my feet -- to the age . ' Jesus answered him , ` If I may not wash thee , thou hast no part with me ; '
YLT	John	13	9	Simon Peter saith to him , ` Sir , not my feet only , but also the hands and the head . '
YLT	John	13	10	Jesus saith to him , ` He who hath been bathed hath no need save to wash his feet , but he is clean altogether ; and ye are clean , but not all ; '
YLT	John	13	11	for he knew him who is delivering him up ; because of this he said , ` Ye are not all clean . '
YLT	John	13	12	When , therefore , he washed their feet , and took his garments , having reclined ( at meat ) again , he said to them , ` Do ye know what I have done to you ?
YLT	John	13	14	if then I did wash your feet -- the Lord and the Teacher -- ye also ought to wash one another 's feet .
YLT	John	13	15	` For an example I gave to you , that , according as I did to you , ye also may do ;
YLT	John	13	16	verily , verily , I say to you , a servant is not greater than his lord , nor an apostle greater than he who sent him ;
YLT	John	13	17	if these things ye have known , happy are ye , if ye may do them ;
YLT	John	13	18	not concerning you all do I speak ; I have known whom I chose for myself ; but that the Writing may be fulfilled : He who is eating the bread with me , did lift up against me his heel .
YLT	John	13	19	` From this time I tell you , before its coming to pass , that , when it may come to pass , ye may believe that I am [ he ] ;
YLT	John	13	20	verily , verily , I say to you , he who is receiving whomsoever I may send , doth receive me ; and he who is receiving me , doth receive Him who sent me . '
YLT	John	13	21	These things having said , Jesus was troubled in the spirit , and did testify , and said , ` Verily , verily , I say to you , that one of you will deliver me up ; '
YLT	John	13	22	the disciples were looking , therefore , one at another , doubting concerning whom he speaketh .
YLT	John	13	23	And there was one of his disciples reclining ( at meat ) in the bosom of Jesus , whom Jesus was loving ;
YLT	John	13	24	Simon Peter , then , doth beckon to this one , to inquire who he may be concerning whom he speaketh ,
YLT	John	13	25	and that one having leant back on the breast of Jesus , respondeth to him , ` Sir , who is it ? '
YLT	John	13	26	Jesus answereth , ` That one it is to whom I , having dipped the morsel , shall give it ; ' and having dipped the morsel , he giveth [ it ] to Judas of Simon , Iscariot .
YLT	John	13	27	And after the morsel , then the Adversary entered into that one , Jesus , therefore , saith to him , ` What thou dost -- do quickly ; '
YLT	John	13	28	and none of those reclining at meat knew for what intent he said this to him ,
YLT	John	13	29	for certain were thinking , since Judas had the bag , that Jesus saith to him , ` Buy what we have need of for the feast ; ' or that he may give something to the poor ;
YLT	John	13	30	having received , therefore , the morsel , that one immediately went forth , and it was night .
YLT	John	13	31	When , therefore , he went forth , Jesus saith , ` Now was the Son of Man glorified , and God was glorified in him ;
YLT	John	13	32	if God was glorified in him , God also will glorify him in Himself ; yea , immediately He will glorify him .
YLT	John	13	33	` Little children , yet a little am I with you ; ye will seek me , and , according as I said to the Jews -- Whither I go away , ye are not able to come , to you also I do say [ it ] now .
YLT	John	13	34	` A new commandment I give to you , that ye love one another ; according as I did love you , that ye also love one another ;
YLT	John	13	35	in this shall all know that ye are my disciples , if ye may have love one to another . '
YLT	John	13	36	Simon Peter saith to him , ` Sir , whither dost thou go away ? ' Jesus answered him , ` Whither I go away , thou art not able now to follow me , but afterward thou shalt follow me . '
YLT	John	13	37	Peter saith to him , ` Sir , wherefore am I not able to follow thee now ? my life for thee I will lay down ; '
YLT	John	13	38	Jesus answered him , ` Thy life for me thou wilt lay down ! verily , verily , I say to thee , a cock will not crow till thou mayest deny me thrice . '
YLT	John	14	14	if ye ask anything in my name I will do [ it ] .
YLT	John	14	2	in the house of my Father are many mansions ; and if not , I would have told you ; I go on to prepare a place for you ;
YLT	John	14	3	and if I go on and prepare for you a place , again do I come , and will receive you unto myself , that where I am ye also may be ;
YLT	John	14	4	and whither I go away ye have known , and the way ye have known . '
YLT	John	14	5	Thomas saith to him , ` Sir , we have not known whither thou goest away , and how are we able to know the way ? '
YLT	John	14	6	Jesus saith to him , ` I am the way , and the truth , and the life , no one doth come unto the Father , if not through me ;
YLT	John	14	7	if ye had known me , my Father also ye would have known , and from this time ye have known Him , and have seen Him . '
YLT	John	14	8	Philip saith to him , ` Sir , shew to us the Father , and it is enough for us ; '
YLT	John	14	9	Jesus saith to him , ` So long time am I with you , and thou hast not known me , Philip ? he who hath seen me hath seen the Father ; and how dost thou say , Shew to us the Father ?
YLT	John	14	10	Believest thou not that I [ am ] in the Father , and the Father is in me ? the sayings that I speak to you , from myself I speak not , and the Father who is abiding in me , Himself doth the works ;
YLT	John	14	11	believe me , that I [ am ] in the Father , and the Father in me ; and if not , because of the works themselves , believe me .
YLT	John	14	12	` Verily , verily , I say to you , he who is believing in me , the works that I do -- that one also shall do , and greater than these he shall do , because I go on to my Father ;
YLT	John	14	13	and whatever ye may ask in my name , I will do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son ;
YLT	John	14	15	` If ye love me , my commands keep ,
YLT	John	14	16	and I will ask the Father , and another Comforter He will give to you , that he may remain with you -- to the age ;
YLT	John	14	17	the Spirit of truth , whom the world is not able to receive , because it doth not behold him , nor know him , and ye know him , because he doth remain with you , and shall be in you .
YLT	John	14	18	` I will not leave you bereaved , I come unto you ;
YLT	John	14	19	yet a little , and the world doth no more behold me , and ye behold me , because I live , and ye shall live ;
YLT	John	14	20	in that day ye shall know that I [ am ] in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you ;
YLT	John	14	21	he who is having my commands , and is keeping them , that one it is who is loving me , and he who is loving me shall be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him . '
YLT	John	14	22	Judas saith to him , ( not the Iscariot ) , ` Sir , what hath come to pass , that to us thou are about to manifest thyself , and not to the world ? '
YLT	John	14	23	Jesus answered and said to him , ` If any one may love me , my word he will keep , and my Father will love him , and unto him we will come , and abode with him we will make ;
YLT	John	14	24	he who is not loving me , my words doth not keep ; and the word that ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's who sent me .
YLT	John	14	25	` These things I have spoken to you , remaining with you ,
YLT	John	14	26	and the Comforter , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and remind you of all things that I said to you .
YLT	John	14	27	` Peace I leave to you ; my peace I give to you , not according as the world doth give do I give to you ; let not your heart be troubled , nor let it be afraid ;
YLT	John	14	28	ye heard that I said to you -- I go away , and I come unto you ; if ye did love me , ye would have rejoiced that I said -- I go on to the Father , because my Father is greater than I .
YLT	John	14	29	` And now I have said [ it ] to you before it come to pass , that when it may come to pass , ye may believe ;
YLT	John	14	30	I will no more talk much with you , for the ruler of this world doth come , and in me he hath nothing ;
YLT	John	14	31	but that the world may know that I love the Father , and according as the Father gave me command so I do ; arise , we may go hence .
YLT	John	15	15	no more do I call you servants , because the servant hath not known what his lord doth , and you I have called friends , because all things that I heard from my Father , I did make known to you .
YLT	John	15	2	every branch in me not bearing fruit , He doth take it away , and every one bearing fruit , He doth cleanse by pruning it , that it may bear more fruit ;
YLT	John	15	3	already ye are clean , because of the word that I have spoken to you ;
YLT	John	15	4	remain in me , and I in you , as the branch is not able to bear fruit of itself , if it may not remain in the vine , so neither ye , if ye may not remain in me .
YLT	John	15	5	` I am the vine , ye the branches ; he who is remaining in me , and I in him , this one doth bear much fruit , because apart from me ye are not able to do anything ;
YLT	John	15	6	if any one may not remain in me , he was cast forth without as the branch , and was withered , and they gather them , and cast to fire , and they are burned ;
YLT	John	15	7	if ye may remain in me , and my sayings in you may remain , whatever ye may wish ye shall ask , and it shall be done to you .
YLT	John	15	8	` In this was my Father glorified , that ye may bear much fruit , and ye shall become my disciples .
YLT	John	15	9	According as the Father did love me , I also loved you , remain in my love ;
YLT	John	15	10	if my commandments ye may keep , ye shall remain in my love , according as I the commands of my Father have kept , and do remain in His love ;
YLT	John	15	11	these things I have spoken to you , that my joy in you may remain , and your joy may be full .
YLT	John	15	12	` This is my command , that ye love one another , according as I did love you ;
YLT	John	15	13	greater love than this hath no one , that any one his life may lay down for his friends ;
YLT	John	15	14	ye are my friends , if ye may do whatever I command you ;
YLT	John	15	16	` Ye did not choose out me , but I chose out you , and did appoint you , that ye might go away , and might bear fruit , and your fruit might remain , that whatever ye may ask of the Father in my name , He may give you .
YLT	John	15	17	` These things I command you , that ye love one another ;
YLT	John	15	18	if the world doth hate you , ye know that it hath hated me before you ;
YLT	John	15	19	if of the world ye were , the world its own would have been loving , and because of the world ye are not -- but I chose out of the world -- because of this the world hateth you .
YLT	John	15	20	` Remember the word that I said to you , A servant is not greater than his lord ; if me they did persecute , you also they will persecute ; if my word they did keep , yours also they will keep ;
YLT	John	15	21	but all these things will they do to you , because of my name , because they have not known Him who sent me ;
YLT	John	15	22	if I had not come and spoken to them , they were not having sin ; but now pretext they have not for their sin .
YLT	John	15	23	` He who is hating me , doth hate also my Father ;
YLT	John	15	24	if I did not do among them the works that no other hath done , they were not having sin , and now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father ;
YLT	John	15	25	but -- that the word may be fulfilled that was written in their law -- They hated me without a cause .
YLT	John	15	26	` And when the Comforter may come , whom I will send to you from the Father -- the Spirit of truth , who from the Father doth come forth , he will testify of me ;
YLT	John	15	27	and ye also do testify , because from the beginning ye are with me .
YLT	John	16	16	a little while , and ye do not behold me , and again a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go away unto the Father . '
YLT	John	16	2	out of the synagogues they will put you ; but an hour doth come , that every one who hath killed you , may think to offer service unto God ;
YLT	John	16	3	and these things they will do to you , because they did not know the Father , nor me .
YLT	John	16	4	` But these things I have spoken to you , that when the hour may come , ye may remember them , that I said [ them ] to you , and these things to you from the beginning I did not say , because I was with you ;
YLT	John	16	5	and now I go away to Him who sent me , and none of you doth ask me , Whither dost thou go ?
YLT	John	16	6	but because these things I have said to you , the sorrow hath filled your heart .
YLT	John	16	7	` But I tell you the truth ; it is better for you that I go away , for if I may not go away , the Comforter will not come unto you , and if I go on , I will send Him unto you ;
YLT	John	16	8	and having come , He will convict the world concerning sin , and concerning righteousness , and concerning judgment ;
YLT	John	16	9	concerning sin indeed , because they do not believe in me ;
YLT	John	16	10	and concerning righteousness , because unto my Father I go away , and no more do ye behold me ;
YLT	John	16	11	and concerning judgment , because the ruler of this world hath been judged .
YLT	John	16	12	` I have yet many things to say to you , but ye are not able to bear [ them ] now ;
YLT	John	16	13	and when He may come -- the Spirit of truth -- He will guide you to all the truth , for He will not speak from Himself , but as many things as He will hear He will speak , and the coming things He will tell you ;
YLT	John	16	14	He will glorify me , because of mine He will take , and will tell to you .
YLT	John	16	15	` All things , as many as the Father hath , are mine ; because of this I said , That of mine He will take , and will tell to you ;
YLT	John	16	17	Therefore said [ some ] of his disciples one to another , ` What is this that he saith to us , A little while , and ye do not behold me , and again a little while , and ye shall see me , and , Because I go away unto the Father ? '
YLT	John	16	18	they said then , ` What is this he saith -- the little while ? we have not known what he saith . '
YLT	John	16	19	Jesus , therefore , knew that they were wishing to ask him , and he said to them , ` Concerning this do ye seek one with another , because I said , A little while , and you do not behold me , and again a little while , and ye shall see me ?
YLT	John	16	20	verily , verily , I say to you , that ye shall weep and lament , and the world will rejoice ; and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow joy will become .
YLT	John	16	21	` The woman , when she may bear , hath sorrow , because her hour did come , and when she may bear the child , no more doth she remember the anguish , because of the joy that a man was born to the world .
YLT	John	16	22	` And ye , therefore , now , indeed , have sorrow ; and again I will see you , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no one doth take from you ,
YLT	John	16	23	and in that day ye will question me nothing ; verily , verily , I say to you , as many things as ye may ask of the Father in my name , He will give you ;
YLT	John	16	24	till now ye did ask nothing in my name ; ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
YLT	John	16	25	` These things in similitudes I have spoken to you , but there cometh an hour when no more in similitudes will I speak to you , but freely of the Father , will tell you .
YLT	John	16	26	` In that day , in my name ye will make request , and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father for you ,
YLT	John	16	27	for the Father himself doth love you , because me ye have loved , and ye have believed that I from God came forth ;
YLT	John	16	28	I came forth from the Father , and have come to the world ; again I leave the world , and go on unto the Father . '
YLT	John	16	29	His disciples say to him , ` Lo , now freely thou dost speak , and no similitude speakest thou ;
YLT	John	16	30	now we have known that thou hast known all things , and hast no need that any one do question thee ; in this we believe that from God thou didst come forth . '
YLT	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , ` Now do ye believe ? lo , there doth come an hour ,
YLT	John	16	32	and now it hath come , that ye may be scattered , each to his own things , and me ye may leave alone , and I am not alone , because the Father is with me ;
YLT	John	16	33	these things I have spoken to you , that in me ye may have peace , in the world ye shall have tribulation , but take courage -- I have overcome the world . '
YLT	John	17	17	sanctify them in Thy truth , Thy word is truth ;
YLT	John	17	2	according as Thou didst give to him authority over all flesh , that -- all that Thou hast given to him -- he may give to them life age-during ;
YLT	John	17	3	and this is the life age-during , that they may know Thee , the only true God , and him whom Thou didst send -- Jesus Christ ;
YLT	John	17	4	I did glorify Thee on the earth , the work I did finish that Thou hast given me , that I may do [ it ] .
YLT	John	17	5	` And now , glorify me , Thou Father , with Thyself , with the glory that I had before the world was , with Thee ;
YLT	John	17	6	I did manifest Thy name to the men whom Thou hast given to me out of the world ; Thine they were , and to me Thou hast given them , and Thy word they have kept ;
YLT	John	17	7	now they have known that all things , as many as Thou hast given to me , are from Thee ,
YLT	John	17	8	because the sayings that Thou hast given to me , I have given to them , and they themselves received , and have known truly , that from Thee I came forth , and they did believe that Thou didst send me .
YLT	John	17	9	` I ask in regard to them ; not in regard to the world do I ask , but in regard to those whom Thou hast given to me , because Thine they are ,
YLT	John	17	10	and all mine are Thine , and Thine [ are ] mine , and I have been glorified in them ;
YLT	John	17	11	and no more am I in the world , and these are in the world , and I come unto Thee . Holy Father , keep them in Thy name , whom Thou hast given to me , that they may be one as we ;
YLT	John	17	12	when I was with them in the world , I was keeping them in Thy name ; those whom Thou hast given to me I did guard , and none of them was destroyed , except the son of the destruction , that the Writing may be fulfilled .
YLT	John	17	13	` And now unto Thee I come , and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves ;
YLT	John	17	14	I have given to them Thy word , and the world did hate them , because they are not of the world , as I am not of the world ;
YLT	John	17	15	I do not ask that Thou mayest take them out of the world , but that Thou mayest keep them out of the evil .
YLT	John	17	16	` Of the world they are not , as I of the world am not ;
YLT	John	17	18	as Thou didst send me to the world , I also did send them to the world ;
YLT	John	17	19	and for them do I sanctify myself , that they also themselves may be sanctified in truth .
YLT	John	17	20	` And not in regard to these alone do I ask , but also in regard to those who shall be believing , through their word , in me ;
YLT	John	17	21	that they all may be one , as Thou Father [ art ] in me , and I in Thee ; that they also in us may be one , that the world may believe that Thou didst send me .
YLT	John	17	22	` And I , the glory that thou hast given to me , have given to them , that they may be one as we are one ;
YLT	John	17	23	I in them , and Thou in me , that they may be perfected into one , and that the world may know that Thou didst send me , and didst love them as Thou didst love me .
YLT	John	17	24	` Father , those whom Thou hast given to me , I will that where I am they also may be with me , that they may behold my glory that Thou didst give to me , because Thou didst love me before the foundation of the world .
YLT	John	17	25	` Righteous Father , also the world did not know Thee , and I knew Thee , and these have known that Thou didst send me ,
YLT	John	17	26	and I made known to them Thy name , and will make known , that the love with which Thou lovedst me in them may be , and I in them . '
YLT	John	18	18	and the servants and the officers were standing , having made a fire of coals , because it was cold , and they were warming themselves , and Peter was standing with them , and warming himself .
YLT	John	18	2	and Judas also , who delivered him up , had known the place , because many times did Jesus assemble there with his disciples .
YLT	John	18	3	Judas , therefore , having taken the band and officers out of the chief priests and Pharisees , doth come thither with torches and lamps , and weapons ;
YLT	John	18	4	Jesus , therefore , knowing all things that are coming upon him , having gone forth , said to them , ` Whom do ye seek ? '
YLT	John	18	5	they answered him , ` Jesus the Nazarene ; ' Jesus saith to them , ` I am [ he ] ; ' -- and Judas who delivered him up was standing with them ; --
YLT	John	18	6	when , therefore , he said to them -- ` I am [ he ] , ' they went away backward , and fell to the ground .
YLT	John	18	7	Again , therefore , he questioned them , ` Whom do ye seek ? ' and they said , ` Jesus the Nazarene ; '
YLT	John	18	8	Jesus answered , ` I said to you that I am [ he ] ; if , then , me ye seek , suffer these to go away ; '
YLT	John	18	9	that the word might be fulfilled that he said -- ` Those whom Thou hast given to me , I did not lose of them even one . '
YLT	John	18	10	Simon Peter , therefore , having a sword , drew it , and struck the chief priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear -- and the name of the servant was Malchus --
YLT	John	18	11	Jesus , therefore , said to Peter , ` Put the sword into the sheath ; the cup that the Father hath given to me , may I not drink it ? '
YLT	John	18	12	The band , therefore , and the captain , and the officers of the Jews , took hold on Jesus , and bound him ,
YLT	John	18	13	and they led him away to Annas first , for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was chief priest of that year ,
YLT	John	18	14	and Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews , that it is good for one man to perish for the people .
YLT	John	18	15	And following Jesus was Simon Peter , and the other disciple , and that disciple was known to the chief priest , and he entered with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest ,
YLT	John	18	16	and Peter was standing at the door without , therefore went forth the other disciple who was known to the chief priest , and he spake to the female keeping the door , and he brought in Peter .
YLT	John	18	17	Then said the maid keeping the door to Peter , ` Art thou also of the disciples of this man ? ' he saith , ` I am not ; '
YLT	John	18	19	The chief priests , therefore , questioned Jesus concerning his disciples , and concerning his teaching ;
YLT	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , ` I spake freely to the world , I did always teach in a synagogue , and in the temple , where the Jews do always come together ; and in secret I spake nothing ;
YLT	John	18	21	why me dost thou question ? question those having heard what I spake to them ; lo , these have known what I said . '
YLT	John	18	22	And he having said these things , one of the officers standing by did give Jesus a slap , saying , ` Thus dost thou answer the chief priest ? '
YLT	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , ` If I spake ill , testify concerning the ill ; and if well , why me dost thou smite ? '
YLT	John	18	24	Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest .
YLT	John	18	25	And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself , they said then to him , ` Art thou also of his disciples ? ' he denied , and said , ` I am not . '
YLT	John	18	26	One of the servants of the chief priest , being kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off , saith , ` Did not I see thee in the garden with him ? '
YLT	John	18	27	again , therefore , Peter denied , and immediately a cock crew .
YLT	John	18	28	They led , therefore , Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium , and it was early , and they themselves did not enter into the praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but that they might eat the passover ;
YLT	John	18	29	Pilate , therefore , went forth unto them , and said , ` What accusation do ye bring against this man ? '
YLT	John	18	30	they answered and said to him , ` If he were not an evil doer , we had not delivered him to thee . '
YLT	John	18	31	Pilate , therefore , said to them , ` Take ye him -- ye -- and according to your law judge him ; ' the Jews , therefore , said to him , ` It is not lawful to us to put any one to death ; '
YLT	John	18	32	that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said , signifying by what death he was about to die .
YLT	John	18	33	Pilate , therefore , entered into the praetorium again , and called Jesus , and said to him , ` Thou art the King of the Jews ? '
YLT	John	18	34	Jesus answered him , ` From thyself dost thou say this ? or did others say it to thee about me ? '
YLT	John	18	35	Pilate answered , ` Am I a Jew ? thy nation , and the chief priests did deliver thee up to me ; what didst thou ? '
YLT	John	18	36	Jesus answered , ` My kingdom is not of this world ; if my kingdom were of this world , my officers had struggled that I might not be delivered up to Jews ; but now my kingdom is not from hence . '
YLT	John	18	37	Pilate , therefore , said to him , ` Art thou then a king ? ' Jesus answered , ` Thou dost say [ it ] ; because a king I am , I for this have been born , and for this I have come to the world , that I may testify to the truth ; every one who is of the truth , doth hear my voice . '
YLT	John	18	38	Pilate saith to him , ` What is truth ? ' and this having said , again he went forth unto the Jews , and saith to them , ` I do find no fault in him ;
YLT	John	18	39	and ye have a custom that I shall release to you one in the passover ; will ye , therefore , [ that ] I shall release to you the king of the Jews ? '
YLT	John	18	40	therefore they all cried out again , saying , ` Not this one -- but Barabbas ; ' and Barabbas was a robber .
YLT	John	19	19	And Pilate also wrote a title , and put [ it ] on the cross , and it was written , ` Jesus the Nazarene , the king of the Jews ; '
YLT	John	19	2	and the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns , did place [ it ] on his head , and a purple garment they put around him ,
YLT	John	19	3	and said , ` Hail ! the king of the Jews ; ' and they were giving him slaps .
YLT	John	19	4	Pilate , therefore , again went forth without , and saith to them , ` Lo , I do bring him to you without , that ye may know that in him I find no fault ; '
YLT	John	19	5	Jesus , therefore , came forth without , bearing the thorny crown and the purple garment ; and he saith to them , ` Lo , the man ! '
YLT	John	19	6	When , therefore , the chief priests and the officers did see him , they cried out , saying , ` Crucify , crucify ; ' Pilate saith to them , ` Take ye him -- ye , and crucify ; for I find no fault in him ; '
YLT	John	19	7	the Jews answered him , ` We have a law , and according to our law he ought to die , for he made himself Son of God . '
YLT	John	19	8	When , therefore , Pilate heard this word , he was the more afraid ,
YLT	John	19	9	and entered again to the praetorium , and saith to Jesus , ` Whence art thou ? ' and Jesus gave him no answer .
YLT	John	19	10	Pilate , therefore , saith to him , ` To me dost thou not speak ? hast thou not known that I have authority to crucify thee , and I have authority to release thee ? '
YLT	John	19	11	Jesus answered , ` Thou wouldst have no authority against me , if it were not having been given thee from above ; because of this , he who is delivering me up to thee hath greater sin . '
YLT	John	19	12	From this [ time ] was Pilate seeking to release him , and the Jews were crying out , saying , ` If this one thou mayest release , thou art not a friend of Caesar ; every one making himself a king , doth speak against Caesar . '
YLT	John	19	13	Pilate , therefore , having heard this word , brought Jesus without -- and he sat down upon the tribunal -- to a place called , ` Pavement , ' and in Hebrew , Gabbatha ;
YLT	John	19	14	and it was the preparation of the passover , and as it were the sixth hour , and he saith to the Jews , ` Lo , your king ! '
YLT	John	19	15	and they cried out , ` Take away , take away , crucify him ; ' Pilate saith to them , ` Your king shall I crucify ? ' the chief priests answered , ` We have no king except Caesar . '
YLT	John	19	16	Then , therefore , he delivered him up to them , that he may be crucified , and they took Jesus and led [ him ] away ,
YLT	John	19	17	and bearing his cross , he went forth to the place called [ Place ] of a Skull , which is called in Hebrew Golgotha ;
YLT	John	19	18	where they crucified him , and with him two others , on this side , and on that side , and Jesus in the midst .
YLT	John	19	20	this title , therefore , read many of the Jews , because the place was nigh to the city where Jesus was crucified , and it was having been written in Hebrew , in Greek , in Roman .
YLT	John	19	21	The chief priests of the Jews said , therefore , to Pilate , ` Write not -- The king of the Jews , but that one said , I am king of the Jews ; '
YLT	John	19	22	Pilate answered , ` What I have written , I have written . '
YLT	John	19	23	The soldiers , therefore , when they did crucify Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to each soldier a part , also the coat , and the coat was seamless , from the top woven throughout ,
YLT	John	19	24	they said , therefore , to one another , ` We may not rend it , but cast a lot for it , whose it shall be ; ' that the Writing might be fulfilled , that is saying , ` They divided my garments to themselves , and upon my raiment they did cast a lot ; ' the soldiers , therefore , indeed , did these things .
YLT	John	19	25	And there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary of Cleopas , and Mary the Magdalene ;
YLT	John	19	26	Jesus , therefore , having seen [ his ] mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he was loving , he saith to his mother , ` Woman , lo , thy son ; '
YLT	John	19	27	afterward he saith to the disciple , ` Lo , thy mother ; ' and from that hour the disciple took her to his own [ home ] .
YLT	John	19	28	After this , Jesus knowing that all things now have been finished , that the Writing may be fulfilled , saith , ` I thirst ; '
YLT	John	19	29	a vessel , therefore , was placed full of vinegar , and they having filled a sponge with vinegar , and having put [ it ] around a hyssop stalk , did put [ it ] to his mouth ;
YLT	John	19	30	when , therefore , Jesus received the vinegar , he said , ` It hath been finished ; ' and having bowed the head , gave up the spirit .
YLT	John	19	31	The Jews , therefore , that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath , since it was the preparation , ( for that sabbath day was a great one , ) asked of Pilate that their legs may be broken , and they taken away .
YLT	John	19	32	The soldiers , therefore , came , and of the first indeed they did break the legs , and of the other who was crucified with him ,
YLT	John	19	33	and having come to Jesus , when they saw him already having been dead , they did not break his legs ;
YLT	John	19	34	but one of the soldiers with a spear did pierce his side , and immediately there came forth blood and water ;
YLT	John	19	35	and he who hath seen hath testified , and his testimony is true , and that one hath known that true things he speaketh , that ye also may believe .
YLT	John	19	36	For these things came to pass , that the Writing may be fulfilled , ` A bone of him shall not be broken ; '
YLT	John	19	37	and again another Writing saith , ` They shall look to him whom they did pierce . '
YLT	John	19	38	And after these things did Joseph of Arimathea -- being a disciple of Jesus , but concealed , through the fear of the Jews -- ask of Pilate , that he may take away the body of Jesus , and Pilate gave leave ; he came , therefore , and took away the body of Jesus ,
YLT	John	19	39	and Nicodemus also came -- who came unto Jesus by night at the first -- bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , as it were , a hundred pounds .
YLT	John	19	40	They took , therefore , the body of Jesus , and bound it with linen clothes with the spices , according as it was the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial ;
YLT	John	19	41	and there was in the place where he was crucified a garden , and in the garden a new tomb , in which no one was yet laid ;
YLT	John	19	42	there , therefore , because of the preparation of the Jews , because the tomb was nigh , they laid Jesus .
YLT	John	20	20	and this having said , he shewed them his hands and side ; the disciples , therefore , rejoiced , having seen the Lord .
YLT	John	20	2	she runneth , therefore , and cometh unto Simon Peter , and unto the other disciple whom Jesus was loving , and saith to them , ` They took away the Lord out of the tomb , and we have not known where they laid him . '
YLT	John	20	3	Peter , therefore , went forth , and the other disciple , and they were coming to the tomb ,
YLT	John	20	4	and the two were running together , and the other disciple did run forward more quickly than Peter , and came first to the tomb ,
YLT	John	20	5	and having stooped down , seeth the linen clothes lying , yet , indeed , he entered not .
YLT	John	20	6	Simon Peter , therefore , cometh , following him , and he entered into the tomb , and beholdeth the linen clothes lying ,
YLT	John	20	7	and the napkin that was upon his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but apart , having been folded up , in one place ;
YLT	John	20	8	then , therefore , entered also the other disciple who came first unto the tomb , and he saw , and did believe ;
YLT	John	20	9	for not yet did they know the Writing , that it behoveth him out of the dead to rise again .
YLT	John	20	10	The disciples therefore went away again unto their own friends ,
YLT	John	20	11	and Mary was standing near the tomb , weeping without ; as she was weeping , then , she stooped down to the tomb , and beholdeth two messengers in white , sitting ,
YLT	John	20	12	one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had been laid .
YLT	John	20	13	And they say to her , ` Woman , why dost thou weep ? ' she saith to them , ` Because they took away my Lord , and I have not known where they laid him ; '
YLT	John	20	14	and these things having said , she turned backward , and seeth Jesus standing , and she had not known that it is Jesus .
YLT	John	20	15	Jesus saith to her , ` Woman , why dost thou weep ? whom dost thou seek ; ' she , supposing that he is the gardener , saith to him , ` Sir , if thou didst carry him away , tell me where thou didst lay him , and I will take him away ; '
YLT	John	20	16	Jesus saith to her , ` Mary ! ' having turned , she saith to him , ` Rabbouni ; ' that is to say , ` Teacher . '
YLT	John	20	17	Jesus saith to her , ` Be not touching me , for I have not yet ascended unto my Father ; and be going on to my brethren , and say to them , I ascend unto my Father , and your Father , and to my God , and to your God . '
YLT	John	20	18	Mary the Magdalene cometh , telling to the disciples that she hath seen the Lord , and [ that ] these things he said to her .
YLT	John	20	19	It being , therefore , evening , on that day , the first of the sabbaths , and the doors having been shut where the disciples were assembled , through fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and saith to them , ` Peace to you ; '
YLT	John	20	21	Jesus , therefore , said to them again , ` Peace to you ; according as the Father hath sent me , I also send you ; '
YLT	John	20	22	and this having said , he breathed on [ them ] , and saith to them , ` Receive the Holy Spirit ;
YLT	John	20	23	if of any ye may loose the sins , they are loosed to them ; if of any ye may retain , they have been retained . '
YLT	John	20	24	And Thomas , one of the twelve , who is called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came ;
YLT	John	20	25	the other disciples , therefore , said to him , ` We have seen the Lord ; ' and he said to them , ` If I may not see in his hands the mark of the nails , and may put my finger to the mark of the nails , and may put my hand to his side , I will not believe . '
YLT	John	20	26	And after eight days , again were his disciples within , and Thomas with them ; Jesus cometh , the doors having been shut , and he stood in the midst , and said , ` Peace to you ! '
YLT	John	20	27	then he saith to Thomas , ` Bring thy finger hither , and see my hands , and bring thy hand , and put [ it ] to my side , and become not unbelieving , but believing . '
YLT	John	20	28	And Thomas answered and said to him , ` My Lord and my God ; '
YLT	John	20	29	Jesus saith to him , ` Because thou hast seen me , Thomas , thou hast believed ; happy those not having seen , and having believed . '
YLT	John	20	30	Many indeed , therefore , other signs also did Jesus before his disciples , that are not written in this book ;
YLT	John	20	31	and these have been written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing ye may have life in his name . '
YLT	John	21	21	Peter having seen this one , saith to Jesus , ` Lord , and what of this one ? '
YLT	John	21	2	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas who is called Didymus , and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee , and the [ sons ] of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples .
YLT	John	21	3	Simon Peter saith to them , ` I go away to fish ; ' they say to him , ` We go -- we also -- with thee ; ' they went forth and entered into the boat immediately , and on that night they caught nothing .
YLT	John	21	4	And morning being now come , Jesus stood at the shore , yet indeed the disciples did not know that it is Jesus ;
YLT	John	21	5	Jesus , therefore , saith to them , ` Lads , have ye any meat ? '
YLT	John	21	6	they answered him , ` No ; ' and he said to them , ` Cast the net at the right side of the boat , and ye shall find ; ' they cast , therefore , and no longer were they able to draw it , from the multitude of the fishes .
YLT	John	21	7	That disciple , therefore , whom Jesus was loving saith to Peter , ` The Lord it is ! ' Simon Peter , therefore , having heard that it is the Lord , did gird on the outer coat , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea ;
YLT	John	21	8	and the other disciples came by the little boat , for they were not far from the land , but as it were about two hundred cubits off , dragging the net of the fishes ;
YLT	John	21	9	when , therefore , they came to the land , they behold a fire of coals lying , and a fish lying on it , and bread .
YLT	John	21	10	Jesus saith to them , ` Bring ye from the fishes that ye caught now ; '
YLT	John	21	11	Simon Peter went up , and drew the net up on the land , full of great fishes , an hundred fifty and three , and though they were so many , the net was not rent .
YLT	John	21	12	Jesus saith to them , ` Come ye , dine ; ' and none of the disciples was venturing to inquire of him , ` Who art thou ? ' knowing that it is the Lord ;
YLT	John	21	13	Jesus , therefore , doth come and take the bread and give to them , and the fish in like manner ;
YLT	John	21	14	this [ is ] now a third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples , having been raised from the dead .
YLT	John	21	15	When , therefore , they dined , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , ` Simon , [ son ] of Jonas , dost thou love me more than these ? ' he saith to him , ` Yes , Lord ; thou hast known that I dearly love thee ; ' he saith to him , ` Feed my lambs . '
YLT	John	21	16	He saith to him again , a second time , ` Simon , [ son ] of Jonas , dost thou love me ? ' he saith to him , ` Yes , Lord ; thou hast known that I dearly love thee ; ' he saith to him , ` Tend my sheep . '
YLT	John	21	17	He saith to him the third time , ` Simon , [ son ] of Jonas , dost thou dearly love me ? ' Peter was grieved that he said to him the third time , ` Dost thou dearly love me ? ' and he said to him , ` Lord , thou hast known all things ; thou dost know that I dearly love thee . ' Jesus saith to him , ` Feed my sheep ;
YLT	John	21	18	verily , verily , I say to thee , When thou wast younger , thou wast girding thyself and wast walking whither thou didst will , but when thou mayest be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another will gird thee , and shall carry [ thee ] whither thou dost not will ; '
YLT	John	21	19	and this he said , signifying by what death he shall glorify God ; and having said this , he saith to him , ` Be following me . '
YLT	John	21	20	And Peter having turned about doth see the disciple whom Jesus was loving following , ( who also reclined in the supper on his breast , and said , ` Sir , who is he who is delivering thee up ? ' )
YLT	John	21	22	Jesus saith to him , ` If him I will to remain till I come , what -- to thee ? be thou following me . ' This word , therefore , went forth to the brethren that that disciple doth not die ,
YLT	John	21	23	yet Jesus did not say to him , that he doth not die , but , ` If him I will to remain till I come , what -- to thee ? '
YLT	John	21	24	this is the disciple who is testifying concerning these things , and he wrote these things , and we have known that his testimony is true .
YLT	John	21	25	And there are also many other things -- as many as Jesus did -- which , if they may be written one by one , not even the world itself I think to have place for the books written . Amen .
YLT	Romans	1	1	Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , a called apostle , having been separated to the good news of God --
YLT	Romans	1	2	which He announced before through His prophets in holy writings --
YLT	Romans	1	3	concerning His Son , ( who is come of the seed of David according to the flesh ,
YLT	Romans	1	4	who is marked out Son of God in power , according to the Spirit of sanctification , by the rising again from the dead , ) Jesus Christ our Lord ;
YLT	Romans	1	5	through whom we did receive grace and apostleship , for obedience of faith among all the nations , in behalf of his name ;
YLT	Romans	1	6	among whom are also ye , the called of Jesus Christ ;
YLT	Romans	1	7	to all who are in Rome , beloved of God , called saints ; Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father , and [ from ] the Lord Jesus Christ !
YLT	Romans	1	8	first , indeed , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world ;
YLT	Romans	1	9	for God is my witness , whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of His Son , how unceasingly I make mention of you ,
YLT	Romans	1	10	always in my prayers beseeching , if by any means now at length I shall have a prosperous journey , by the will of God , to come unto you ,
YLT	Romans	1	11	for I long to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift , that ye may be established ;
YLT	Romans	1	12	and that is , that I may be comforted together among you , through the faith in one another , both yours and mine .
YLT	Romans	1	13	And I do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , that many times I did purpose to come unto you -- and was hindered till the present time -- that some fruit I might have also among you , even as also among the other nations .
YLT	Romans	1	14	Both to Greeks and to foreigners , both to wise and to thoughtless , I am a debtor ,
YLT	Romans	1	15	so , as much as in me is , I am ready also to you who [ are ] in Rome to proclaim good news ,
YLT	Romans	1	16	for I am not ashamed of the good news of the Christ , for it is the power of God to salvation to every one who is believing , both to Jew first , and to Greek .
YLT	Romans	1	17	For the righteousness of God in it is revealed from faith to faith , according as it hath been written , ` And the righteous one by faith shall live , '
YLT	Romans	1	18	for revealed is the wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety and unrighteousness of men , holding down the truth in unrighteousness .
YLT	Romans	1	19	Because that which is known of God is manifest among them , for God did manifest [ it ] to them ,
YLT	Romans	1	20	for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world , by the things made being understood , are plainly seen , both His eternal power and Godhead -- to their being inexcusable ;
YLT	Romans	1	21	because , having known God they did not glorify [ Him ] as God , nor gave thanks , but were made vain in their reasonings , and their unintelligent heart was darkened ,
YLT	Romans	1	22	professing to be wise , they were made fools ,
YLT	Romans	1	23	and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man , and of fowls , and of quadrupeds , and of reptiles .
YLT	Romans	1	24	Wherefore also God did give them up , in the desires of their hearts , to uncleanness , to dishonour their bodies among themselves ;
YLT	Romans	1	25	who did change the truth of God into a falsehood , and did honour and serve the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed to the ages . Amen .
YLT	Romans	1	26	Because of this did God give them up to dishonourable affections , for even their females did change the natural use into that against nature ;
YLT	Romans	1	27	and in like manner also the males having left the natural use of the female , did burn in their longing toward one another ; males with males working shame , and the recompense of their error that was fit , in themselves receiving .
YLT	Romans	1	28	And , according as they did not approve of having God in knowledge , God gave them up to a disapproved mind , to do the things not seemly ;
YLT	Romans	1	29	having been filled with all unrighteousness , whoredom , wickedness , covetousness , malice ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , evil dispositions ; whisperers ,
YLT	Romans	1	30	evil-speakers , God-haters , insulting , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
YLT	Romans	1	31	unintelligent , faithless , without natural affection , implacable , unmerciful ;
YLT	Romans	1	32	who the righteous judgment of God having known -- that those practising such things are worthy of death -- not only do them , but also have delight with those practising them .
YLT	Romans	2	2	and we have known that the judgment of God is according to truth , upon those practising such things .
YLT	Romans	2	3	And dost thou think this , O man , who art judging those who such things are practising , and art doing them , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
YLT	Romans	2	4	or the riches of His goodness , and forbearance , and long-suffering , dost thou despise ? -- not knowing that the goodness of God doth lead thee to reformation !
YLT	Romans	2	5	but , according to thy hardness and impenitent heart , thou dost treasure up to thyself wrath , in a day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God ,
YLT	Romans	2	6	who shall render to each according to his works ;
YLT	Romans	2	7	to those , indeed , who in continuance of a good work , do seek glory , and honour , and incorruptibility -- life age-during ;
YLT	Romans	2	8	and to those contentious , and disobedient , indeed , to the truth , and obeying the unrighteousness -- indignation and wrath ,
YLT	Romans	2	9	tribulation and distress , upon every soul of man that is working the evil , both of Jew first , and of Greek ;
YLT	Romans	2	10	and glory , and honour , and peace , to every one who is working the good , both to Jew first , and to Greek .
YLT	Romans	2	11	For there is no acceptance of faces with God ,
YLT	Romans	2	12	for as many as without law did sin , without law also shall perish , and as many as did sin in law , through law shall be judged ,
YLT	Romans	2	13	for not the hearers of the law [ are ] righteous before God , but the doers of the law shall be declared righteous : --
YLT	Romans	2	14	For , when nations that have not a law , by nature may do the things of the law , these not having a law -- to themselves are a law ;
YLT	Romans	2	15	who do shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also witnessing with them , and between one another the thoughts accusing or else defending ,
YLT	Romans	2	16	in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men , according to my good news , through Jesus Christ .
YLT	Romans	2	17	Lo , thou art named a Jew , and dost rest upon the law , and dost boast in God ,
YLT	Romans	2	18	and dost know the will , and dost approve the distinctions , being instructed out of the law ,
YLT	Romans	2	19	and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of blind ones , a light of those in darkness ,
YLT	Romans	2	20	an instructor of foolish ones , a teacher of babes , having the form of the knowledge and of the truth in the law .
YLT	Romans	2	21	Thou , then , who art teaching another , thyself dost thou not teach ?
YLT	Romans	2	22	thou who art preaching not to steal , dost thou steal ? thou who art saying not to commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou who art abhorring the idols , dost thou rob temples ?
YLT	Romans	2	23	thou who in the law dost boast , through the transgression of the law God dost thou dishonour ?
YLT	Romans	2	24	for the name of God because of you is evil spoken of among the nations , according as it hath been written .
YLT	Romans	2	25	For circumcision , indeed , doth profit , if law thou mayest practise , but if a transgressor of law thou mayest be , thy circumcision hath become uncircumcision .
YLT	Romans	2	26	If , therefore the uncircumcision the righteousness of the law may keep , shall not his uncircumcision for circumcision be reckoned ?
YLT	Romans	2	27	and the uncircumcision , by nature , fulfilling the law , shall judge thee who , through letter and circumcision , [ art ] a transgressor of law .
YLT	Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew who is [ so ] outwardly , neither [ is ] circumcision that which is outward in flesh ;
YLT	Romans	2	29	but a Jew [ is ] he who is [ so ] inwardly , and circumcision [ is ] of the heart , in spirit , not in letter , of which the praise is not of men , but of God .
YLT	Romans	3	3	for what , if certain were faithless ? shall their faithlessness the faithfulness of god make useless ?
YLT	Romans	3	2	much in every way ; for first , indeed , that they were intrusted with the oracles of God ;
YLT	Romans	3	4	let it not be ! and let God become true , and every man false , according as it hath been written , ` That Thou mayest be declared righteous in Thy words , and mayest overcome in Thy being judged . '
YLT	Romans	3	5	And , if our unrighteousness God 's righteousness doth establish , what shall we say ? is God unrighteous who is inflicting the wrath ? ( after the manner of a man I speak )
YLT	Romans	3	6	let it not be ! since how shall God judge the world ?
YLT	Romans	3	7	for if the truth of God in my falsehood did more abound to His glory , why yet am I also as a sinner judged ?
YLT	Romans	3	8	and not , as we are evil spoken of , and as certain affirm us to say -- ` We may do the evil things , that the good ones may come ? ' whose judgment is righteous .
YLT	Romans	3	9	What , then ? are we better ? not at all ! for we did before charge both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin ,
YLT	Romans	3	10	according as it hath been written -- ` There is none righteous , not even one ;
YLT	Romans	3	11	There is none who is understanding , there is none who is seeking after God .
YLT	Romans	3	12	All did go out of the way , together they became unprofitable , there is none doing good , there is not even one .
YLT	Romans	3	13	A sepulchre opened [ is ] their throat ; with their tongues they used deceit ; poison of asps [ is ] under their lips .
YLT	Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness .
YLT	Romans	3	15	Swift [ are ] their feet to shed blood .
YLT	Romans	3	16	Ruin and misery [ are ] in their ways .
YLT	Romans	3	17	And a way of peace they did not know .
YLT	Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes . '
YLT	Romans	3	19	And we have known that as many things as the law saith , to those in the law it doth speak , that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may come under judgment to God ;
YLT	Romans	3	20	wherefore by works of law shall no flesh be declared righteous before Him , for through law is a knowledge of sin .
YLT	Romans	3	21	And now apart from law hath the righteousness of God been manifested , testified to by the law and the prophets ,
YLT	Romans	3	22	and the righteousness of God [ is ] through the faith of Jesus Christ to all , and upon all those believing , -- for there is no difference ,
YLT	Romans	3	23	for all did sin , and are come short of the glory of God --
YLT	Romans	3	24	being declared righteous freely by His grace through the redemption that [ is ] in Christ Jesus ,
YLT	Romans	3	25	whom God did set forth a mercy seat , through the faith in his blood , for the shewing forth of His righteousness , because of the passing over of the bygone sins in the forbearance of God --
YLT	Romans	3	26	for the shewing forth of His righteousness in the present time , for His being righteous , and declaring him righteous who [ is ] of the faith of Jesus .
YLT	Romans	3	27	Where then [ is ] the boasting ? it was excluded ; by what law ? of works ? no , but by a law of faith :
YLT	Romans	3	28	therefore do we reckon a man to be declared righteous by faith , apart from works of law .
YLT	Romans	3	29	The God of Jews only [ is He ] , and not also of nations ?
YLT	Romans	3	30	yes , also of nations ; since one [ is ] God who shall declare righteous the circumcision by faith , and the uncircumcision through the faith .
YLT	Romans	3	31	Law then do we make useless through the faith ? let it not be ! yea , we do establish law .
YLT	Romans	4	4	and to him who is working , the reward is not reckoned of grace , but of debt ;
YLT	Romans	4	2	for if Abraham by works was declared righteous , he hath to boast -- but not before god ;
YLT	Romans	4	3	for what doth the writing say ? ` And Abraham did believe God , and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness ; '
YLT	Romans	4	5	and to him who is not working , and is believing upon Him who is declaring righteous the impious , his faith is reckoned -- to righteousness :
YLT	Romans	4	6	even as David also doth speak of the happiness of the man to whom God doth reckon righteousness apart from works :
YLT	Romans	4	7	` Happy they whose lawless acts were forgiven , and whose sins were covered ;
YLT	Romans	4	8	happy the man to whom the Lord may not reckon sin . '
YLT	Romans	4	9	[ Is ] this happiness , then , upon the circumcision , or also upon the uncircumcision -- for we say that the faith was reckoned to Abraham -- to righteousness ?
YLT	Romans	4	10	how then was it reckoned ? he being in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision ;
YLT	Romans	4	11	and a sign he did receive of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith in the uncircumcision , for his being father of all those believing through uncircumcision , for the righteousness also being reckoned to them ,
YLT	Romans	4	12	and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of the faith , that [ is ] in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham .
YLT	Romans	4	13	For not through law [ is ] the promise to Abraham , or to his seed , of his being heir of the world , but through the righteousness of faith ;
YLT	Romans	4	14	for if they who are of law [ are ] heirs , the faith hath been made void , and the promise hath been made useless ;
YLT	Romans	4	15	for the law doth work wrath ; for where law is not , neither [ is ] transgression .
YLT	Romans	4	16	Because of this [ it is ] of faith , that [ it may be ] according to grace , for the promise being sure to all the seed , not to that which [ is ] of the law only , but also to that which [ is ] of the faith of Abraham ,
YLT	Romans	4	17	who is father of us all ( according as it hath been written -- ` A father of many nations I have set thee , ' ) before Him whom he did believe -- God , who is quickening the dead , and is calling the things that be not as being .
YLT	Romans	4	18	Who , against hope in hope did believe , for his becoming father of many nations according to that spoken : ` So shall thy seed be ; '
YLT	Romans	4	19	and not having been weak in the faith , he did not consider his own body , already become dead , ( being about a hundred years old , ) and the deadness of Sarah 's womb ,
YLT	Romans	4	20	and at the promise of God did not stagger in unbelief , but was strengthened in faith , having given glory to God ,
YLT	Romans	4	21	and having been fully persuaded that what He hath promised He is able also to do :
YLT	Romans	4	22	wherefore also it was reckoned to him to righteousness .
YLT	Romans	4	23	And it was not written on his account alone , that it was reckoned to him ,
YLT	Romans	4	24	but also on ours , to whom it is about to be reckoned -- to us believing on Him who did raise up Jesus our Lord out of the dead ,
YLT	Romans	4	25	who was delivered up because of our offences , and was raised up because of our being declared righteous .
YLT	Romans	5	5	and the hope doth not make ashamed , because the love of God hath been poured forth in our hearts through the Holy Spirit that hath been given to us .
YLT	Romans	5	2	through whom also we have the access by the faith into this grace in which we have stood , and we boast on the hope of the glory of God .
YLT	Romans	5	3	And not only [ so ] , but we also boast in the tribulations , knowing that the tribulation doth work endurance ;
YLT	Romans	5	4	and the endurance , experience ; and the experience , hope ;
YLT	Romans	5	6	For in our being still ailing , Christ in due time did die for the impious ;
YLT	Romans	5	7	for scarcely for a righteous man will any one die , for for the good man perhaps some one also doth dare to die ;
YLT	Romans	5	8	and God doth commend His own love to us , that , in our being still sinners , Christ did die for us ;
YLT	Romans	5	9	much more , then , having been declared righteous now in his blood , we shall be saved through him from the wrath ;
YLT	Romans	5	10	for if , being enemies , we have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son , much more , having been reconciled , we shall be saved in his life .
YLT	Romans	5	11	And not only [ so ] , but we are also boasting in God , through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom now we did receive the reconciliation ;
YLT	Romans	5	12	because of this , even as through one man the sin did enter into the world , and through the sin the death ; and thus to all men the death did pass through , for that all did sin ;
YLT	Romans	5	13	for till law sin was in the world : and sin is not reckoned when there is not law ;
YLT	Romans	5	14	but the death did reign from Adam till Moses , even upon those not having sinned in the likeness of Adam 's transgression , who is a type of him who is coming .
YLT	Romans	5	15	But , not as the offence so also [ is ] the free gift ; for if by the offence of the one the many did die , much more did the grace of God , and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ , abound to the many ;
YLT	Romans	5	16	and not as through one who did sin [ is ] the free gift , for the judgment indeed [ is ] of one to condemnation , but the gift [ is ] of many offences to a declaration of ` Righteous , '
YLT	Romans	5	17	for if by the offence of the one the death did reign through the one , much more those , who the abundance of the grace and of the free gift of the righteousness are receiving , in life shall reign through the one -- Jesus Christ .
YLT	Romans	5	18	So , then , as through one offence to all men [ it is ] to condemnation , so also through one declaration of ` Righteous ' [ it is ] to all men to justification of life ;
YLT	Romans	5	19	for as through the disobedience of the one man , the many were constituted sinners : so also through the obedience of the one , shall the many be constituted righteous .
YLT	Romans	5	20	And law came in , that the offence might abound , and where the sin did abound , the grace did overabound ,
YLT	Romans	5	21	that even as the sin did reign in the death , so also the grace may reign , through righteousness , to life age-during , through Jesus Christ our Lord .
YLT	Romans	6	6	this knowing , that our old man was crucified with [ him ] , that the body of the sin may be made useless , for our no longer serving the sin ;
YLT	Romans	6	2	let it not be ! we who died to the sin -- how shall we still live in it ?
YLT	Romans	6	3	are ye ignorant that we , as many as were baptized to Christ Jesus , to his death were baptized ?
YLT	Romans	6	4	we were buried together , then , with him through the baptism to the death , that even as Christ was raised up out of the dead through the glory of the Father , so also we in newness of life might walk .
YLT	Romans	6	5	For , if we have become planted together to the likeness of his death , [ so ] also we shall be of the rising again ;
YLT	Romans	6	7	for he who hath died hath been set free from the sin .
YLT	Romans	6	8	And if we died with Christ , we believe that we also shall live with him ,
YLT	Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ , having been raised up out of the dead , doth no more die , death over him hath no more lordship ;
YLT	Romans	6	10	for in that he died , to the sin he died once , and in that he liveth , he liveth to God ;
YLT	Romans	6	11	so also ye , reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to the sin , and living to God in Jesus Christ our Lord .
YLT	Romans	6	12	Let not then the sin reign in your mortal body , to obey it in its desires ;
YLT	Romans	6	13	neither present ye your members instruments of unrighteousness to the sin , but present yourselves to God as living out of the dead , and your members instruments of righteousness to God ;
YLT	Romans	6	14	for sin over you shall not have lordship , for ye are not under law , but under grace .
YLT	Romans	6	15	What then ? shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace ? let it not be !
YLT	Romans	6	16	have ye not known that to whom ye present yourselves servants for obedience , servants ye are to him to whom ye obey , whether of sin to death , or of obedience to righteousness ?
YLT	Romans	6	17	and thanks to God , that ye were servants of the sin , and -- were obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which ye were delivered up ;
YLT	Romans	6	18	and having been freed from the sin , ye became servants to the righteousness .
YLT	Romans	6	19	In the manner of men I speak , because of the weakness of your flesh , for even as ye did present your members servants to the uncleanness and to the lawlessness -- to the lawlessness , so now present your members servants to the righteousness -- to sanctification ,
YLT	Romans	6	20	for when ye were servants of the sin , ye were free from the righteousness ,
YLT	Romans	6	21	what fruit , therefore , were ye having then , in the things of which ye are now ashamed ? for the end of those [ is ] death .
YLT	Romans	6	22	And now , having been freed from the sin , and having become servants to God , ye have your fruit -- to sanctification , and the end life age-during ;
YLT	Romans	6	23	for the wages of the sin [ is ] death , and the gift of God [ is ] life age-during in Christ Jesus our Lord .
YLT	Romans	7	7	What , then , shall we say ? the law [ is ] sin ? let it not be ! but the sin I did not know except through law , for also the covetousness I had not known if the law had not said :
YLT	Romans	7	2	for the married woman to the living husband hath been bound by law , and if the husband may die , she hath been free from the law of the husband ;
YLT	Romans	7	3	so , then , the husband being alive , an adulteress she shall be called if she may become another man 's ; and if the husband may die , she is free from the law , so as not to be an adulteress , having become another man 's .
YLT	Romans	7	4	So that , my brethren , ye also were made dead to the law through the body of the Christ , for your becoming another 's , who out of the dead was raised up , that we might bear fruit to God ;
YLT	Romans	7	5	for when we were in the flesh , the passions of the sins , that [ are ] through the law , were working in our members , to bear fruit to the death ;
YLT	Romans	7	6	and now we have ceased from the law , that being dead in which we were held , so that we may serve in newness of spirit , and not in oldness of letter .
YLT	Romans	7	8	` Thou shalt not covet ; ' and the sin having received an opportunity , through the command , did work in me all covetousness -- for apart from law sin is dead .
YLT	Romans	7	9	And I was alive apart from law once , and the command having come , the sin revived , and I died ;
YLT	Romans	7	10	and the command that [ is ] for life , this was found by me for death ;
YLT	Romans	7	11	for the sin , having received an opportunity , through the command , did deceive me , and through it did slay [ me ] ;
YLT	Romans	7	12	so that the law , indeed , [ is ] holy , and the command holy , and righteous , and good .
YLT	Romans	7	13	That which is good then , to me hath it become death ? let it not be ! but the sin , that it might appear sin , through the good , working death to me , that the sin might become exceeding sinful through the command ,
YLT	Romans	7	14	for we have known that the law is spiritual , and I am fleshly , sold by the sin ;
YLT	Romans	7	15	for that which I work , I do not acknowledge ; for not what I will , this I practise , but what I hate , this I do .
YLT	Romans	7	16	And if what I do not will , this I do , I consent to the law that [ it is ] good ,
YLT	Romans	7	17	and now it is no longer I that work it , but the sin dwelling in me ,
YLT	Romans	7	18	for I have known that there doth not dwell in me , that is , in my flesh , good : for to will is present with me , and to work that which is right I do not find ,
YLT	Romans	7	19	for the good that I will , I do not ; but the evil that I do not will , this I practise .
YLT	Romans	7	20	And if what I do not will , this I do , it is no longer I that work it , but the sin that is dwelling in me .
YLT	Romans	7	21	I find , then , the law , that when I desire to do what is right , with me the evil is present ,
YLT	Romans	7	22	for I delight in the law of God according to the inward man ,
YLT	Romans	7	23	and I behold another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of the sin that [ is ] in my members .
YLT	Romans	7	24	A wretched man I [ am ] ! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death ?
YLT	Romans	7	25	I thank God -- through Jesus Christ our Lord ; so then , I myself indeed with the mind do serve the law of God , and with the flesh , the law of sin .
YLT	Romans	8	8	for neither is it able ; and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God .
YLT	Romans	8	2	for the law of the Spirit of the life in Christ Jesus did set me free from the law of the sin and of the death ;
YLT	Romans	8	3	for what the law was not able to do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God , His own Son having sent in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , did condemn the sin in the flesh ,
YLT	Romans	8	4	that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us , who do not walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
YLT	Romans	8	5	For those who are according to the flesh , the things of the flesh do mind ; and those according to the Spirit , the things of the Spirit ;
YLT	Romans	8	6	for the mind of the flesh [ is ] death , and the mind of the Spirit -- life and peace ;
YLT	Romans	8	7	because the mind of the flesh [ is ] enmity to God , for to the law of God it doth not subject itself ,
YLT	Romans	8	9	And ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God doth dwell in you ; and if any one hath not the Spirit of Christ -- this one is not His ;
YLT	Romans	8	10	and if Christ [ is ] in you , the body , indeed , [ is ] dead because of sin , and the Spirit [ is ] life because of righteousness ,
YLT	Romans	8	11	and if the Spirit of Him who did raise up Jesus out of the dead doth dwell in you , He who did raise up the Christ out of the dead shall quicken also your dying bodies , through His Spirit dwelling in you .
YLT	Romans	8	12	So , then , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh ;
YLT	Romans	8	13	for if according to the flesh ye do live , ye are about to die ; and if , by the Spirit , the deeds of the body ye put to death , ye shall live ;
YLT	Romans	8	14	for as many as are led by the Spirit of God , these are the sons of God ;
YLT	Romans	8	15	for ye did not receive a spirit of bondage again for fear , but ye did receive a spirit of adoption in which we cry , ` Abba -- Father . '
YLT	Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself doth testify with our spirit , that we are children of God ;
YLT	Romans	8	17	and if children , also heirs , heirs , indeed , of God , and heirs together of Christ -- if , indeed , we suffer together , that we may also be glorified together .
YLT	Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time [ are ] not worthy [ to be compared ] with the glory about to be revealed in us ;
YLT	Romans	8	19	for the earnest looking out of the creation doth expect the revelation of the sons of God ;
YLT	Romans	8	20	for to vanity was the creation made subject -- not of its will , but because of Him who did subject [ it ] -- in hope ,
YLT	Romans	8	21	that also the creation itself shall be set free from the servitude of the corruption to the liberty of the glory of the children of God ;
YLT	Romans	8	22	for we have known that all the creation doth groan together , and doth travail in pain together till now .
YLT	Romans	8	23	And not only [ so ] , but also we ourselves , having the first-fruit of the Spirit , we also ourselves in ourselves do groan , adoption expecting -- the redemption of our body ;
YLT	Romans	8	24	for in hope we were saved , and hope beheld is not hope ; for what any one doth behold , why also doth he hope for [ it ] ?
YLT	Romans	8	25	and if what we do not behold we hope for , through continuance we expect [ it ] .
YLT	Romans	8	26	And , in like manner also , the Spirit doth help our weaknesses ; for , what we may pray for , as it behoveth [ us ] , we have not known , but the Spirit himself doth make intercession for us with groanings unutterable ,
YLT	Romans	8	27	and He who is searching the hearts hath known what [ is ] the mind of the Spirit , because according to God he doth intercede for saints .
YLT	Romans	8	28	And we have known that to those loving God all things do work together for good , to those who are called according to purpose ;
YLT	Romans	8	29	because whom He did foreknow , He also did fore-appoint , conformed to the image of His Son , that he might be first-born among many brethren ;
YLT	Romans	8	30	and whom He did fore-appoint , these also He did call ; and whom He did call , these also He declared righteous ; and whom He declared righteous , these also He did glorify .
YLT	Romans	8	31	What , then , shall we say unto these things ? if God [ is ] for us , who [ is ] against us ?
YLT	Romans	8	32	He who indeed His own Son did not spare , but for us all did deliver him up , how shall He not also with him the all things grant to us ?
YLT	Romans	8	33	Who shall lay a charge against the choice ones of God ? God [ is ] He that is declaring righteous ,
YLT	Romans	8	34	who [ is ] he that is condemning ? Christ [ is ] He that died , yea , rather also , was raised up ; who is also on the right hand of God -- who also doth intercede for us .
YLT	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ ? tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
YLT	Romans	8	36	( according as it hath been written -- ` For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long , we were reckoned as sheep of slaughter , ' )
YLT	Romans	8	37	but in all these we more than conquer , through him who loved us ;
YLT	Romans	8	38	for I am persuaded that neither death , nor life , nor messengers , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present ,
YLT	Romans	8	39	nor things about to be , nor height , nor depth , nor any other created thing , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , that [ is ] in Christ Jesus our Lord .
YLT	Romans	9	9	for the word of promise [ is ] this ; ` According to this time I will come , and there shall be to Sarah a son . '
YLT	Romans	9	2	that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart --
YLT	Romans	9	3	for I was wishing , I myself , to be anathema from the Christ -- for my brethren , my kindred , according to the flesh ,
YLT	Romans	9	4	who are Israelites , whose [ is ] the adoption , and the glory , and the covenants , and the lawgiving , and the service , and the promises ,
YLT	Romans	9	5	whose [ are ] the fathers , and of whom [ is ] the Christ , according to the flesh , who is over all , God blessed to the ages . Amen .
YLT	Romans	9	6	And it is not possible that the word of God hath failed ; for not all who [ are ] of Israel are these Israel ;
YLT	Romans	9	7	nor because they are seed of Abraham [ are ] all children , but -- ` in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee ; '
YLT	Romans	9	8	that is , the children of the flesh -- these [ are ] not children of God ; but the children of the promise are reckoned for seed ;
YLT	Romans	9	10	And not only [ so ] , but also Rebecca , having conceived by one -- Isaac our father --
YLT	Romans	9	11	( for they being not yet born , neither having done anything good or evil , that the purpose of God , according to choice , might remain ; not of works , but of Him who is calling , ) it was said to her --
YLT	Romans	9	12	` The greater shall serve the less ; '
YLT	Romans	9	13	according as it hath been written , ` Jacob I did love , and Esau I did hate . '
YLT	Romans	9	14	What , then , shall we say ? unrighteousness [ is ] with God ? let it not be !
YLT	Romans	9	15	for to Moses He saith , ` I will do kindness to whom I do kindness , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion ; '
YLT	Romans	9	16	so , then -- not of him who is willing , nor of him who is running , but of God who is doing kindness :
YLT	Romans	9	17	for the Writing saith to Pharaoh -- ` For this very thing I did raise thee up , that I might shew in thee My power , and that My name might be declared in all the land ; '
YLT	Romans	9	18	so , then , to whom He willeth , He doth kindness , and to whom He willeth , He doth harden .
YLT	Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say , then , to me , ` Why yet doth He find fault ? for His counsel who hath resisted ? '
YLT	Romans	9	20	nay , but , O man , who art thou that art answering again to God ? shall the thing formed say to Him who did form [ it ] , Why me didst thou make thus ?
YLT	Romans	9	21	hath not the potter authority over the clay , out of the same lump to make the one vessel to honour , and the one to dishonour ?
YLT	Romans	9	22	And if God , willing to shew the wrath and to make known His power , did endure , in much long suffering , vessels of wrath fitted for destruction ,
YLT	Romans	9	23	and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of kindness , that He before prepared for glory , whom also He did call -- us --
YLT	Romans	9	24	not only out of Jews , but also out of nations ,
YLT	Romans	9	25	as also in Hosea He saith , ` I will call what [ is ] not My people -- My people ; and her not beloved -- Beloved ,
YLT	Romans	9	26	and it shall be -- in the place where it was said to them , Ye [ are ] not My people ; there they shall be called sons of the living God . '
YLT	Romans	9	27	And Isaiah doth cry concerning Israel , ` If the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea , the remnant shall be saved ;
YLT	Romans	9	28	for a matter He is finishing , and is cutting short in righteousness , because a matter cut short will the Lord do upon the land .
YLT	Romans	9	29	and according as Isaiah saith before , ` Except the Lord of Sabaoth did leave to us a seed , as Sodom we had become , and as Gomorrah we had been made like . '
YLT	Romans	9	30	What , then , shall we say ? that nations who are not pursuing righteousness did attain to righteousness , and righteousness that [ is ] of faith ,
YLT	Romans	9	31	and Israel , pursuing a law of righteousness , at a law of righteousness did not arrive ;
YLT	Romans	9	32	wherefore ? because -- not by faith , but as by works of law ; for they did stumble at the stone of stumbling ,
YLT	Romans	9	33	according as it hath been written , ` Lo , I place in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence ; and every one who is believing thereon shall not be ashamed . '
YLT	Romans	10	10	for with the heart doth [ one ] believe to righteousness , and with the mouth is confession made to salvation ;
YLT	Romans	10	2	for I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God , but not according to knowledge ,
YLT	Romans	10	3	for not knowing the righteousness of God , and their own righteousness seeking to establish , to the righteousness of God they did not submit .
YLT	Romans	10	4	For Christ is an end of law for righteousness to every one who is believing ,
YLT	Romans	10	5	for Moses doth describe the righteousness that [ is ] of the law , that , ` The man who did them shall live in them , '
YLT	Romans	10	6	and the righteousness of faith doth thus speak : ` Thou mayest not say in thine heart , Who shall go up to the heaven , ' that is , Christ to bring down ?
YLT	Romans	10	7	or , ` Who shall go down to the abyss , ' that is , Christ out of the dead to bring up .
YLT	Romans	10	8	But what doth it say ? ` Nigh thee is the saying -- in thy mouth , and in thy heart : ' that is , the saying of the faith , that we preach ;
YLT	Romans	10	9	that if thou mayest confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and mayest believe in thy heart that God did raise him out of the dead , thou shalt be saved ,
YLT	Romans	10	11	for the Writing saith , ` Every one who is believing on him shall not be ashamed , '
YLT	Romans	10	12	for there is no difference between Jew and Greek , for the same Lord of all [ is ] rich to all those calling upon Him ,
YLT	Romans	10	13	for every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord , he shall be saved . '
YLT	Romans	10	14	How then shall they call upon [ him ] in whom they did not believe ? and how shall they believe [ on him ] of whom they did not hear ? and how shall they hear apart from one preaching ?
YLT	Romans	10	15	and how shall they preach , if they may not be sent ? according as it hath been written , ` How beautiful the feet of those proclaiming good tidings of peace , of those proclaiming good tidings of the good things ! '
YLT	Romans	10	16	But they were not all obedient to the good tidings , for Isaiah saith , ` Lord , who did give credence to our report ? '
YLT	Romans	10	17	so then the faith [ is ] by a report , and the report through a saying of God ,
YLT	Romans	10	18	but I say , Did they not hear ? yes , indeed -- ` to all the earth their voice went forth , and to the ends of the habitable world their sayings . '
YLT	Romans	10	19	But I say , Did not Israel know ? first Moses saith , ` I will provoke you to jealousy by [ that which is ] not a nation ; by an unintelligent nation I will anger you , '
YLT	Romans	10	20	and Isaiah is very bold , and saith , ` I was found by those not seeking Me ; I became manifest to those not inquiring after Me ; '
YLT	Romans	10	21	and unto Israel He saith , ` All the day I did stretch out My hands unto a people unbelieving and gainsaying . '
YLT	Romans	11	11	I say , then , Did they stumble that they might fall ? let it not be ! but by their fall the salvation [ is ] to the nations , to arouse them to jealousy ;
YLT	Romans	11	2	God did not cast away His people whom He knew before ; have ye not known -- in Elijah -- what the Writing saith ? how he doth plead with God concerning Israel , saying ,
YLT	Romans	11	3	` Lord , Thy prophets they did kill , and Thy altars they dug down , and I was left alone , and they seek my life ; '
YLT	Romans	11	4	but what saith the divine answer to him ? ` I left to Myself seven thousand men , who did not bow a knee to Baal . '
YLT	Romans	11	5	So then also in the present time a remnant according to the choice of grace there hath been ;
YLT	Romans	11	6	and if by grace , no more of works , otherwise the grace becometh no more grace ; and if of works , it is no more grace , otherwise the work is no more work .
YLT	Romans	11	7	What then ? What Israel doth seek after , this it did not obtain , and the chosen did obtain , and the rest were hardened ,
YLT	Romans	11	8	according as it hath been written , ` God gave to them a spirit of deep sleep , eyes not to see , and ears not to hear , ' -- unto this very day ,
YLT	Romans	11	9	and David saith , ` Let their table become for a snare , and for a trap , and for a stumbling-block , and for a recompense to them ;
YLT	Romans	11	10	let their eyes be darkened -- not to behold , and their back do Thou always bow down . '
YLT	Romans	11	12	and if the fall of them [ is ] the riches of a world , and the diminution of them the riches of nations , how much more the fulness of them ?
YLT	Romans	11	13	For to you I speak -- to the nations -- inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle of nations , my ministration I do glorify ;
YLT	Romans	11	14	if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh , and shall save some of them ,
YLT	Romans	11	15	for if the casting away of them [ is ] a reconciliation of the world , what the reception -- if not life out of the dead ?
YLT	Romans	11	16	and if the first-fruit [ is ] holy , the lump also ; and if the root [ is ] holy , the branches also .
YLT	Romans	11	17	And if certain of the branches were broken off , and thou , being a wild olive tree , wast graffed in among them , and a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree didst become --
YLT	Romans	11	18	do not boast against the branches ; and if thou dost boast , thou dost not bear the root , but the root thee !
YLT	Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say , then , ` The branches were broken off , that I might be graffed in ; ' right !
YLT	Romans	11	20	by unbelief they were broken off , and thou hast stood by faith ; be not high-minded , but be fearing ;
YLT	Romans	11	21	for if God the natural branches did not spare -- lest perhaps He also shall not spare thee .
YLT	Romans	11	22	Lo , then , goodness and severity of God -- upon those indeed who fell , severity ; and upon thee , goodness , if thou mayest remain in the goodness , otherwise , thou also shalt be cut off .
YLT	Romans	11	23	And those also , if they may not remain in unbelief , shall be graffed in , for God is able again to graff them in ;
YLT	Romans	11	24	for if thou , out of the olive tree , wild by nature , wast cut out , and , contrary to nature , wast graffed into a good olive tree , how much rather shall they , who [ are ] according to nature , be graffed into their own olive tree ?
YLT	Romans	11	25	For I do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , of this secret -- that ye may not be wise in your own conceits -- that hardness in part to Israel hath happened till the fulness of the nations may come in ;
YLT	Romans	11	26	and so all Israel shall be saved , according as it hath been written , ` There shall come forth out of Sion he who is delivering , and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob ,
YLT	Romans	11	27	and this to them [ is ] the covenant from Me , when I may take away their sins . '
YLT	Romans	11	28	As regards , indeed , the good tidings , [ they are ] enemies on your account ; and as regards the choice -- beloved on account of the fathers ;
YLT	Romans	11	29	for unrepented of [ are ] the gifts and the calling of God ;
YLT	Romans	11	30	for as ye also once did not believe in God , and now did find kindness by the unbelief of these :
YLT	Romans	11	31	so also these now did not believe , that in your kindness they also may find kindness ;
YLT	Romans	11	32	for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief , that to the whole He might do kindness .
YLT	Romans	11	33	O depth of riches , and wisdom and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable His judgments , and untraceable His ways !
YLT	Romans	11	34	for who did know the mind of the Lord ? or who did become His counsellor ?
YLT	Romans	11	35	or who did first give to Him , and it shall be given back to him again ?
YLT	Romans	11	36	because of Him , and through Him , and to Him [ are ] the all things ; to Him [ is ] the glory -- to the ages . Amen .
YLT	Romans	12	12	in the hope rejoicing ; in the tribulation enduring ; in the prayer persevering ;
YLT	Romans	12	2	and be not conformed to this age , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , for your proving what [ is ] the will of God -- the good , and acceptable , and perfect .
YLT	Romans	12	3	For I say , through the grace that was given to me , to every one who is among you , not to think above what it behoveth to think ; but to think so as to think wisely , as to each God did deal a measure of faith ,
YLT	Romans	12	4	for as in one body we have many members , and all the members have not the same office ,
YLT	Romans	12	5	so we , the many , one body are in Christ , and members each one of one another .
YLT	Romans	12	6	And having gifts , different according to the grace that was given to us ; whether prophecy -- ` According to the proportion of faith ! '
YLT	Romans	12	7	or ministration -- ` In the ministration ! ' or he who is teaching -- ` In the teaching ! '
YLT	Romans	12	8	or he who is exhorting -- ` In the exhortation ! ' he who is sharing -- ` In simplicity ! ' he who is leading -- ` In diligence ? ' he who is doing kindness -- ` In cheerfulness . '
YLT	Romans	12	9	The love unfeigned : abhorring the evil ; cleaving to the good ;
YLT	Romans	12	10	in the love of brethren , to one another kindly affectioned : in the honour going before one another ;
YLT	Romans	12	11	in the diligence not slothful ; in the spirit fervent ; the Lord serving ;
YLT	Romans	12	13	to the necessities of the saints communicating ; the hospitality pursuing .
YLT	Romans	12	14	Bless those persecuting you ; bless , and curse not ;
YLT	Romans	12	15	to rejoice with the rejoicing , and to weep with the weeping ,
YLT	Romans	12	16	of the same mind one toward another , not minding the high things , but with the lowly going along ; become not wise in your own conceit ;
YLT	Romans	12	17	giving back to no one evil for evil ; providing right things before all men .
YLT	Romans	12	18	If possible -- so far as in you -- with all men being in peace ;
YLT	Romans	12	19	not avenging yourselves , beloved , but give place to the wrath , for it hath been written , ` Vengeance [ is ] Mine ,
YLT	Romans	12	20	I will recompense again , saith the Lord ; ' if , then , thine enemy doth hunger , feed him ; if he doth thirst , give him drink ; for this doing , coals of fire thou shalt heap upon his head ;
YLT	Romans	12	21	Be not overcome by the evil , but overcome , in the good , the evil .
YLT	Romans	13	13	as in day-time , let us walk becomingly ; not in revellings and drunkennesses , not in chamberings and lasciviousnesses , not in strife and emulation ;
YLT	Romans	13	2	so that he who is setting himself against the authority , against God 's ordinance hath resisted ; and those resisting , to themselves shall receive judgment .
YLT	Romans	13	3	For those ruling are not a terror to the good works , but to the evil ; and dost thou wish not to be afraid of the authority ? that which is good be doing , and thou shalt have praise from it ,
YLT	Romans	13	4	for of God it is a ministrant to thee for good ; and if that which is evil thou mayest do , be fearing , for not in vain doth it bear the sword ; for of God it is a ministrant , an avenger for wrath to him who is doing that which is evil .
YLT	Romans	13	5	Wherefore it is necessary to be subject , not only because of the wrath , but also because of the conscience ,
YLT	Romans	13	6	for because of this also pay ye tribute ; for servants of God they are , on this very thing attending continually ;
YLT	Romans	13	7	render , therefore , to all [ their ] dues ; to whom tribute , the tribute ; to whom custom , the custom ; to whom fear , the fear ; to whom honour , the honour .
YLT	Romans	13	8	To no one owe anything , except to love one another ; for he who is loving the other -- law he hath fulfilled ,
YLT	Romans	13	9	for , ` Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt do no murder , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false testimony , Thou shalt not covet ; ' and if there is any other command , in this word it is summed up , in this : ` Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ; '
YLT	Romans	13	10	the love to the neighbor doth work no ill ; the love , therefore , [ is ] the fulness of law .
YLT	Romans	13	11	And this , knowing the time , that for us , the hour already [ is ] to be aroused out of sleep , for now nearer [ is ] our salvation than when we did believe ;
YLT	Romans	13	12	the night did advance , and the day came nigh ; let us lay aside , therefore , the works of the darkness , and let us put on the armour of the light ;
YLT	Romans	13	14	but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and for the flesh take no forethought -- for desires .
YLT	Romans	14	14	I have known , and am persuaded , in the Lord Jesus , that nothing [ is ] unclean of itself , except to him who is reckoning anything to be unclean -- to that one [ it is ] unclean ;
YLT	Romans	14	2	one doth believe that he may eat all things -- and he who is weak doth eat herbs ;
YLT	Romans	14	3	let not him who is eating despise him who is not eating : and let not him who is not eating judge him who is eating , for God did receive him .
YLT	Romans	14	4	Thou -- who art thou that art judging another 's domestic ? to his own master he doth stand or fall ; and he shall be made to stand , for God is able to make him stand .
YLT	Romans	14	5	One doth judge one day above another , and another doth judge every day [ alike ] ; let each in his own mind be fully assured .
YLT	Romans	14	6	He who is regarding the day , to the Lord he doth regard [ it ] , and he who is not regarding the day , to the Lord he doth not regard [ it ] . He who is eating , to the Lord he doth eat , for he doth give thanks to God ; and he who is not eating , to the Lord he doth not eat , and doth give thanks to God .
YLT	Romans	14	7	For none of us to himself doth live , and none to himself doth die ;
YLT	Romans	14	8	for both , if we may live , to the Lord we live ; if also we may die , to the Lord we die ; both then if we may live , also if we may die , we are the Lord 's ;
YLT	Romans	14	9	for because of this Christ both died and rose again , and lived again , that both of dead and of living he may be Lord .
YLT	Romans	14	10	And thou , why dost thou judge thy brother ? or again , thou , why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand at the tribunal of the Christ ;
YLT	Romans	14	11	for it hath been written , ` I live ! saith the Lord -- to Me bow shall every knee , and every tongue shall confess to God ; '
YLT	Romans	14	12	so , then , each of us concerning himself shall give reckoning to God ;
YLT	Romans	14	13	no longer , therefore , may we judge one another , but this judge ye rather , not to put a stumbling-stone before the brother , or an offence .
YLT	Romans	14	15	and if through victuals thy brother is grieved , no more dost thou walk according to love ; do not with thy victuals destroy that one for whom Christ died .
YLT	Romans	14	16	Let not , then , your good be evil spoken of ,
YLT	Romans	14	17	for the reign of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit ;
YLT	Romans	14	18	for he who in these things is serving the Christ , [ is ] acceptable to God and approved of men .
YLT	Romans	14	19	So , then , the things of peace may we pursue , and the things of building up one another ;
YLT	Romans	14	20	for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God ; all things , indeed , [ are ] pure , but evil [ is ] to the man who is eating through stumbling .
YLT	Romans	14	21	Right [ it is ] not to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor to [ do anything ] in which thy brother doth stumble , or is made to fall , or is weak .
YLT	Romans	14	22	Thou hast faith ! to thyself have [ it ] before God ; happy is he who is not judging himself in what he doth approve ,
YLT	Romans	14	23	and he who is making a difference , if he may eat , hath been condemned , because [ it is ] not of faith ; and all that [ is ] not of faith is sin .
YLT	Romans	15	15	and the more boldly I did write to you , brethren , in part , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me by God ,
YLT	Romans	15	2	for let each one of us please the neighbor for good , unto edification ,
YLT	Romans	15	3	for even the Christ did not please himself , but , according as it hath been written , ` The reproaches of those reproaching Thee fell upon me ; '
YLT	Romans	15	4	for , as many things as were written before , for our instruction were written before , that through the endurance , and the exhortation of the Writings , we might have the hope .
YLT	Romans	15	5	And may the God of the endurance , and of the exhortation , give to you to have the same mind toward one another , according to Christ Jesus ;
YLT	Romans	15	6	that with one accord -- with one mouth -- ye may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
YLT	Romans	15	7	wherefore receive ye one another , according as also the Christ did receive us , to the glory of God .
YLT	Romans	15	8	And I say Jesus Christ to have become a ministrant of circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises to the fathers ,
YLT	Romans	15	9	and the nations for kindness to glorify God , according as it hath been written , ` Because of this I will confess to Thee among nations , and to Thy name I will sing praise , '
YLT	Romans	15	10	and again it saith , ` Rejoice ye nations , with His people ; '
YLT	Romans	15	11	and again , ` Praise the Lord , all ye nations ; and laud Him , all ye peoples ; '
YLT	Romans	15	12	and again , Isaiah saith , ` There shall be the root of Jesse , and he who is rising to rule nations -- upon him shall nations hope ; '
YLT	Romans	15	13	and the God of the hope shall fill you with all joy and peace in the believing , for your abounding in the hope in power of the Holy Spirit .
YLT	Romans	15	14	And I am persuaded , my brethren -- I myself also -- concerning you , that ye yourselves also are full of goodness , having been filled with all knowledge , able also one another to admonish ;
YLT	Romans	15	16	for my being a servant of Jesus Christ to the nations , acting as priest in the good news of God , that the offering up of the nations may become acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
YLT	Romans	15	17	I have , then , a boasting in Christ Jesus , in the things pertaining to God ,
YLT	Romans	15	18	for I will not dare to speak anything of the things that Christ did not work through me , to obedience of nations , by word and deed ,
YLT	Romans	15	19	in power of signs and wonders , in power of the Spirit of God ; so that I , from Jerusalem , and in a circle as far as Illyricum , have fully preached the good news of the Christ ;
YLT	Romans	15	20	and so counting it honour to proclaim good news , not where Christ was named -- that upon another 's foundation I might not build --
YLT	Romans	15	21	but according as it hath been written , ` To whom it was not told concerning him , they shall see ; and they who have not heard , shall understand . '
YLT	Romans	15	22	Wherefore , also , I was hindered many times from coming unto you ,
YLT	Romans	15	23	and now , no longer having place in these parts , and having a longing to come unto you for many years ,
YLT	Romans	15	24	when I may go on to Spain I will come unto you , for I hope in going through , to see you , and by you to be set forward thither , if of you first , in part , I shall be filled .
YLT	Romans	15	25	And , now , I go on to Jerusalem , ministering to the saints ;
YLT	Romans	15	26	for it pleased Macedonia and Achaia well to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who [ are ] in Jerusalem ;
YLT	Romans	15	27	for it pleased well , and their debtors they are , for if in their spiritual things the nations did participate , they ought also , in the fleshly things , to minister to them .
YLT	Romans	15	28	This , then , having finished , and having sealed to them this fruit , I will return through you , to Spain ;
YLT	Romans	15	29	and I have known that coming unto you -- in the fulness of the blessing of the good news of Christ I shall come .
YLT	Romans	15	30	And I call upon you , brethren , through our Lord Jesus Christ , and through the love of the Spirit , to strive together with me in the prayers for me unto God ,
YLT	Romans	15	31	that I may be delivered from those not believing in Judea , and that my ministration , that [ is ] for Jerusalem , may become acceptable to the saints ;
YLT	Romans	15	32	that in joy I may come unto you , through the will of God , and may be refreshed with you ,
YLT	Romans	15	33	and the God of the peace [ be ] with you all . Amen .
YLT	Romans	16	16	salute one another in a holy kiss ; the assemblies of Christ do salute you .
YLT	Romans	16	2	that ye may receive her in the Lord , as doth become saints , and may assist her in whatever matter she may have need of you -- for she also became a leader of many , and of myself .
YLT	Romans	16	3	Salute Priscilla and Aquilas , my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus --
YLT	Romans	16	4	who for my life their own neck did lay down , to whom not only I give thanks , but also all the assemblies of the nations --
YLT	Romans	16	5	and the assembly at their house ; salute Epaenetus , my beloved , who is first-fruit of Achaia to Christ .
YLT	Romans	16	6	Salute Mary , who did labour much for us ;
YLT	Romans	16	7	salute Andronicus and Junias , my kindred , and my fellow-captives , who are of note among the apostles , who also have been in Christ before me .
YLT	Romans	16	8	Salute Amplias , my beloved in the Lord ;
YLT	Romans	16	9	salute Arbanus , our fellow-workman in Christ , and Stachys , my beloved ;
YLT	Romans	16	10	salute Apelles , the approved in Christ ; salute those of the [ household ] of Aristobulus ;
YLT	Romans	16	11	salute Herodion , my kinsman ; salute those of the [ household ] of Narcissus , who are in the Lord ;
YLT	Romans	16	12	salute Tryphaena , and Tryphosa , who are labouring in the Lord ; salute Persis , the beloved , who did labour much in the Lord .
YLT	Romans	16	13	Salute Rufus , the choice one in the Lord , and his mother and mine ,
YLT	Romans	16	14	salute Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermas , Patrobas , Hermes , and the brethren with them ;
YLT	Romans	16	15	salute Philologus , and Julias , Nereus , and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints with them ;
YLT	Romans	16	17	And I call upon you , brethren , to mark those who the divisions and the stumbling-blocks , contrary to the teaching that ye did learn , are causing , and turn ye away from them ;
YLT	Romans	16	18	for such our Lord Jesus Christ do not serve , but their own belly ; and through the good word and fair speech they deceive the hearts of the harmless ,
YLT	Romans	16	19	for your obedience did reach to all ; I rejoice , therefore , as regards you , and I wish you to be wise , indeed , as to the good , and harmless as to the evil ;
YLT	Romans	16	20	and the God of the peace shall bruise the Adversary under your feet quickly ; the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with you . Amen !
YLT	Romans	16	21	Salute you do Timotheus , my fellow-workman , and Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my kindred ;
YLT	Romans	16	22	I Tertius salute you ( who wrote the letter ) in the Lord ;
YLT	Romans	16	23	salute you doth Gaius , my host , and of the whole assembly ; salute you doth Erastus , the steward of the city , and Quartus the brother ,
YLT	Romans	16	24	the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ be ] with you all . Amen .
YLT	Romans	16	25	And to Him who is able to establish you , according to my good news , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the secret , in the times of the ages having been kept silent ,
YLT	Romans	16	26	and now having been made manifest , also , through prophetic writings , according to a command of the age-during God , having been made known to all the nations for obedience of faith --
YLT	Romans	16	27	to the only wise God , through Jesus Christ , to him [ be ] glory to the ages . Amen .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , a called apostle of Jesus Christ , through the will of God , and Sosthenes the brother ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	2	to the assembly of God that is in Corinth , to those sanctified in Christ Jesus , called saints , with all those calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place -- both theirs and ours :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	5	that in every thing ye were enriched in him , in all discourse and all knowledge ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	6	according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in you ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that ye are not behind in any gift , waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	8	who also shall confirm you unto the end -- unblamable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	9	faithful [ is ] God , through whom ye were called to the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	10	And I call upon you , brethren , through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that the same thing ye may all say , and there may not be divisions among you , and ye may be perfected in the same mind , and in the same judgment ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	11	for it was signified to me concerning you , my brethren , by those of Chloe , that contentions are among you ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	12	and I say this , that each one of you saith , ` I , indeed , am of Paul ' -- ` and I of Apollos , ' -- ` and I of Cephas , ' -- ` and I of Christ . '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Hath the Christ been divided ? was Paul crucified for you ? or to the name of Paul were ye baptized ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I give thanks to God that no one of you did I baptize , except Crispus and Gaius --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	15	that no one may say that to my own name I did baptize ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	16	and I did baptize also Stephanas ' household -- further , I have not known if I did baptize any other .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ did not send me to baptize , but -- to proclaim good news ; not in wisdom of discourse , that the cross of the Christ may not be made of none effect ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	18	for the word of the cross to those indeed perishing is foolishness , and to us -- those being saved -- it is the power of God ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	19	for it hath been written , ` I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nought ; '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	20	where [ is ] the wise ? where the scribe ? where a disputer of this age ? did not God make foolish the wisdom of this world ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	21	for , seeing in the wisdom of God the world through the wisdom knew not God , it did please God through the foolishness of the preaching to save those believing .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	22	Since also Jews ask a sign , and Greeks seek wisdom ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	23	also we -- we preach Christ crucified , to Jews , indeed , a stumbling-block , and to Greeks foolishness ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	24	and to those called -- both Jews and Greeks -- Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	25	because the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	26	for see your calling , brethren , that not many [ are ] wise according to the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	27	but the foolish things of the world did God choose , that the wise He may put to shame ; and the weak things of the world did God choose that He may put to shame the strong ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	28	and the base things of the world , and the things despised did God choose , and the things that are not , that the things that are He may make useless --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	29	that no flesh may glory before Him ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	30	and of Him ye -- ye are in Christ Jesus , who became to us from God wisdom , righteousness also , and sanctification , and redemption ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	1	31	that , according as it hath been written , ` He who is glorying -- in the Lord let him glory . '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	2	for I decided not to know any thing among you , except Jesus Christ , and him crucified ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	3	and I , in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling , was with you ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	4	and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	5	that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	6	And wisdom we speak among the perfect , and wisdom not of this age , nor of the rulers of this age -- of those becoming useless ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	7	but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret , that God foreordained before the ages to our glory ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	8	which no one of the rulers of this age did know , for if they had known , the Lord of the glory they would not have crucified ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	9	but , according as it hath been written , ` What eye did not see , and ear did not hear , and upon the heart of man came not up , what God did prepare for those loving Him -- '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	10	but to us did God reveal [ them ] through His Spirit , for the Spirit all things doth search , even the depths of God ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	11	for who of men hath known the things of the man , except the spirit of the man that [ is ] in him ? so also the things of God no one hath known , except the Spirit of God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	12	And we the spirit of the world did not receive , but the Spirit that [ is ] of God , that we may know the things conferred by God on us ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	13	which things also we speak , not in words taught by human wisdom , but in those taught by the Holy Spirit , with spiritual things spiritual things comparing ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	14	and the natural man doth not receive the things of the Spirit of God , for to him they are foolishness , and he is not able to know [ them ] , because spiritually they are discerned ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	15	and he who is spiritual , doth discern indeed all things , and he himself is by no one discerned ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	2	16	for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall instruct Him ? and we -- we have the mind of Christ .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for yet ye are fleshly , for where [ there is ] among you envying , and strife , and divisions , are ye not fleshly , and in the manner of men do walk ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	2	with milk I fed you , and not with meat , for ye were not yet able , but not even yet are ye now able ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	4	for when one may say , ` I , indeed , am of Paul ; ' and another , ` I -- of Apollos ; ' are ye not fleshly ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Who , then , is Paul , and who Apollos , but ministrants through whom ye did believe , and to each as the Lord gave ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted , Apollos watered , but God was giving growth ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	7	so that neither is he who is planting anything , nor he who is watering , but He who is giving growth -- God ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	8	and he who is planting and he who is watering are one , and each his own reward shall receive , according to his own labour ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	9	for of God we are fellow-workmen ; God 's tillage , God 's building ye are .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God that was given to me , as a wise master-builder , a foundation I have laid , and another doth build on [ it ] ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	11	for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid , which is Jesus the Christ ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	12	and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	13	of each the work shall become manifest , for the day shall declare [ it ] , because in fire it is revealed , and the work of each , what kind it is , the fire shall prove ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	14	if of any one the work doth remain that he built on [ it ] , a wage he shall receive ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	15	if of any the work is burned up , he shall suffer loss ; and himself shall be saved , but so as through fire .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	16	have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God , and the Spirit of God doth dwell in you ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	17	if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste , him shall God waste ; for the sanctuary of God is holy , the which ye are .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no one deceive himself ; if any one doth seem to be wise among you in this age -- let him become a fool , that he may become wise ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	19	for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God , for it hath been written , ` Who is taking the wise in their craftiness ; '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , ` The Lord doth know the reasonings of the wise , that they are vain . '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So then , let no one glory in men , for all things are yours ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things about to be -- all are yours ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	3	23	and ye [ are ] Christ 's , and Christ [ is ] God 's .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	4	for of nothing to myself have I been conscious , but not in this have I been declared right -- and he who is discerning me is the Lord :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	2	and as to the rest , it is required in the stewards that one may be found faithful ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	3	and to me it is for a very little thing that by you I may be judged , or by man 's day , but not even myself do I judge ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	5	so , then , nothing before the time judge ye , till the Lord may come , who will both bring to light the hidden things of the darkness , and will manifest the counsels of the hearts , and then the praise shall come to each from God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	6	And these things , brethren , I did transfer to myself and to Apollos because of you , that in us ye may learn not to think above that which hath been written , that ye may not be puffed up one for one against the other ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	7	for who doth make thee to differ ? and what hast thou , that thou didst not receive ? and if thou didst also receive , why dost thou glory as not having received ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	8	Already ye are having been filled , already ye were rich , apart from us ye did reign , and I would also ye did reign , that we also with you may reign together ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	9	for I think that God did set forth us the apostles last -- as appointed to death , because a spectacle we became to the world , and messengers , and men ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	10	we [ are ] fools because of Christ , and ye wise in Christ ; we [ are ] ailing , and ye strong ; ye glorious , and we dishonoured ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	11	unto the present hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and wander about ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	12	and labour , working with [ our ] own hands ; being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	13	being spoken evil of , we entreat ; as filth of the world we did become -- of all things an offscouring -- till now .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	14	Not [ as ] putting you to shame do I write these things , but as my beloved children I do admonish ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	15	for if a myriad of child-conductors ye may have in Christ , yet not many fathers ; for in Christ Jesus , through the good news , I -- I did beget you ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	16	I call upon you , therefore , become ye followers of me ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	17	because of this I sent to you Timotheus , who is my child , beloved and faithful in the Lord , who shall remind you of my ways in Christ , according as everywhere in every assembly I teach .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	18	And as if I were not coming unto you certain were puffed up ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	19	but I will come quickly unto you , if the Lord may will , and I will know not the word of those puffed up , but the power ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	20	for not in word is the reign of God , but in power ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	4	21	what do ye wish ? with a rod shall I come unto you , or in love , with a spirit also of meekness ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	5	to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	2	and ye are having been puffed up , and did not rather mourn , that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	3	for I indeed , as being absent as to the body , and present as to the spirit , have already judged , as being present , him who so wrought this thing :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	4	in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ -- ye being gathered together , also my spirit -- with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Not good [ is ] your glorying ; have ye not known that a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	7	cleanse out , therefore , the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , according as ye are unleavened , for also our passover for us was sacrificed -- Christ ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	8	so that we may keep the feast , not with old leaven , nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness , but with unleavened food of sincerity and truth .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I did write to you in the epistle , not to keep company with whoremongers --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	10	and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or idolaters , seeing ye ought then to go forth out of the world --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	11	and now , I did write to you not to keep company with [ him ] , if any one , being named a brother , may be a whoremonger , or covetous , or an idolater , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner -- with such a one not even to eat together ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	12	for what have I also those without to judge ? those within do ye not judge ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	5	13	and those without God doth judge ; and put ye away the evil from among yourselves .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	6	but brother with brother doth go to be judged , and this before unbelievers !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	2	have ye not known that the saints shall judge the world ? and if by you the world is judged , are ye unworthy of the smaller judgments ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	3	have ye not known that we shall judge messengers ? why not then the things of life ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	4	of the things of life , indeed , then , if ye may have judgment , those despised in the assembly -- these cause ye to sit ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	5	unto your shame I speak : so there is not among you one wise man , not even one , who shall be able to discern in the midst of his brethren !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Already , indeed , then , there is altogether a fault among you , that ye have judgments with one another ; wherefore do ye not rather suffer injustice ? wherefore be ye not rather defrauded ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	8	but ye -- ye do injustice , and ye defraud , and these -- brethren !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	9	have ye not known that the unrighteous the reign of God shall not inherit ? be not led astray ; neither whoremongers , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor sodomites ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortioners , the reign of God shall inherit .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And certain of you were these ! but ye were washed , but ye were sanctified , but ye were declared righteous , in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful to me , but all things are not profitable ; all things are lawful to me , but I -- I will not be under authority by any ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	13	the meats [ are ] for the belly , and the belly for the meats . And God both this and these shall make useless ; and the body [ is ] not for whoredom , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	14	and God both the Lord did raise , and us will raise up through His power .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Have ye not known that your bodies are members of Christ ? having taken , then , the members of the Christ , shall I make [ them ] members of an harlot ? let it be not !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	16	have ye not known that he who is joined to the harlot is one body ? ` for they shall be -- saith He -- the two for one flesh . '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	17	And he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	18	flee the whoredom ; every sin -- whatever a man may commit -- is without the body , and he who is committing whoredom , against his own body doth sin .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Have ye not known that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you , which ye have from God ? and ye are not your own ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	6	20	for ye were bought with a price ; glorify , then , God in your body and in your spirit , which are God 's .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	7	for I wish all men to be even as I myself [ am ] ; but each his own gift hath of God , one indeed thus , and one thus .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	2	and because of the whoredom let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her proper husband ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	3	to the wife let the husband the due benevolence render , and in like manner also the wife to the husband ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	4	the wife over her own body hath not authority , but the husband ; and , in like manner also , the husband over his own body hath not authority , but the wife .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Defraud not one another , except by consent for a time , that ye may be free for fasting and prayer , and again may come together , that the Adversary may not tempt you because of your incontinence ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	6	and this I say by way of concurrence -- not of command ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	8	And I say to the unmarried and to the widows : it is good for them if they may remain even as I [ am ] ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	9	and if they have not continence -- let them marry , for it is better to marry than to burn ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	10	and to the married I announce -- not I , but the Lord -- let not a wife separate from a husband :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	11	but and if she may separate , let her remain unmarried , or to the husband let her be reconciled , and let not a husband send away a wife .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	12	And to the rest I speak -- not the Lord -- if any brother hath a wife unbelieving , and she is pleased to dwell with him , let him not send her away ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	13	and a woman who hath a husband unbelieving , and he is pleased to dwell with her , let her not send him away ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	14	for the unbelieving husband hath been sanctified in the wife , and the unbelieving wife hath been sanctified in the husband ; otherwise your children are unclean , but now they are holy .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	15	And , if the unbelieving doth separate himself -- let him separate himself : the brother or the sister is not under servitude in such [ cases ] , and in peace hath God called us ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	16	for what , hast thou known , O wife , whether the husband thou shalt save ? or what , hast thou known , O husband , whether the wife thou shalt save ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	17	if not , as God did distribute to each , as the Lord hath called each -- so let him walk ; and thus in all the assemblies do I direct :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	18	being circumcised -- was any one called ? let him not become uncircumcised ; in uncircumcision was any one called ? let him not be circumcised ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	19	the circumcision is nothing , and the uncircumcision is nothing -- but a keeping of the commands of God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each in the calling in which he was called -- in this let him remain ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	21	a servant -- wast thou called ? be not anxious ; but if also thou art able to become free -- use [ it ] rather ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	22	for he who [ is ] in the Lord -- having been called a servant -- is the Lord 's freedman : in like manner also he the freeman , having been called , is servant of Christ :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	23	with a price ye were bought , become not servants of men ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	24	each , in that in which he was called , brethren , in this let him remain with God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	25	And concerning the virgins , a command of the Lord I have not ; and I give judgment as having obtained kindness from the Lord to be faithful :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I suppose , therefore , this to be good because of the present necessity , that [ it is ] good for a man that the matter be thus : --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Hast thou been bound to a wife ? seek not to be loosed ; hast thou been loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But and if thou mayest marry , thou didst not sin ; and if the virgin may marry , she did not sin ; and such shall have tribulation in the flesh : and I spare you .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	29	And this I say , brethren , the time henceforth is having been shortened -- that both those having wives may be as not having ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those weeping , as not weeping ; and those rejoicing , as not rejoicing ; and those buying , as not possessing ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those using this world , as not using [ it ] up ; for passing away is the fashion of this world .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	32	And I wish you to be without anxiety ; the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord , how he shall please the Lord ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	33	and the married is anxious for the things of the world , how he shall please the wife .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	34	The wife and the virgin have been distinguished : the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit , and the married is anxious for the things of the world , how she shall please the husband .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	35	And this for your own profit I say : not that I may cast a noose upon you , but for the seemliness and devotedness to the Lord , undistractedly ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	36	and if any one doth think [ it ] to be unseemly to his virgin , if she may be beyond the bloom of age , and it ought so to be , what he willeth let him do ; he doth not sin -- let him marry .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	37	And he who hath stood stedfast in the heart -- not having necessity -- and hath authority over his own will , and this he hath determined in his heart -- to keep his own virgin -- doth well ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	38	so that both he who is giving in marriage doth well , and he who is not giving in marriage doth better .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife hath been bound by law as long time as her husband may live , and if her husband may sleep , she is free to be married to whom she will -- only in the Lord ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	7	40	and she is happier if she may so remain -- according to my judgment ; and I think I also have the Spirit of God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But victuals do not commend us to God , for neither if we may eat are we in advance ; nor if we may not eat , are we behind ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	2	and if any one doth think to know anything , he hath not yet known anything according as it behoveth [ him ] to know ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	3	and if any one doth love God , this one hath been known by Him .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	4	Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols , we have known that an idol [ is ] nothing in the world , and that there is no other God except one ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	5	for even if there are those called gods , whether in heaven , whether upon earth -- as there are gods many and lords many --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet to us [ is ] one God , the Father , of whom [ are ] the all things , and we to Him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom [ are ] the all things , and we through Him ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	7	but not in all men [ is ] the knowledge , and certain with conscience of the idol , till now , as a thing sacrificed to an idol do eat [ it ] , and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	9	but see , lest this privilege of yours may become a stumbling-block to the infirm ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	10	for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an idol 's temple reclining at meat -- shall not his conscience -- he being infirm -- be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	11	and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy knowledge , because of whom Christ died ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	12	and thus sinning in regard to the brethren , and smiting their weak conscience -- in regard to Christ ye sin ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	8	13	wherefore , if victuals cause my brother to stumble , I may eat no flesh -- to the age -- that my brother I may not cause to stumble .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	9	for in the law of Moses it hath been written , ` thou shalt not muzzle an ox treading out corn ; ' for the oxen doth God care ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	2	if to others I am not an apostle -- yet doubtless to you I am ; for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	3	My defence to those who examine me in this ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	4	have we not authority to eat and to drink ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	5	have we not authority a sister -- a wife -- to lead about , as also the other apostles , and the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	6	or only I and Barnabas , have we not authority -- not to work ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	7	who doth serve as a soldier at his own charges at any time ? who doth plant a vineyard , and of its fruit doth not eat ? or who doth feed a flock , and of the milk of the flock doth not eat ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	8	According to man do I speak these things ? or doth not also the law say these things ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	10	or because of us by all means doth He say [ it ] ? yes , because of us it was written , because in hope ought the plower to plow , and he who is treading [ ought ] of his hope to partake in hope .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we to you the spiritual things did sow -- great [ is it ] if we your fleshly things do reap ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	12	if others do partake of the authority over you -- not we more ? but we did not use this authority , but all things we bear , that we may give no hindrance to the good news of the Christ .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Have ye not known that those working about the things of the temple -- of the temple do eat , and those waiting at the altar -- with the altar are partakers ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	14	so also did the Lord direct to those proclaiming the good news : of the good news to live .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	15	And I have used none of these things ; neither did I write these things that it may be so done in my case , for [ it is ] good for me rather to die , than that any one may make my glorying void ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	16	for if I may proclaim good news , it is no glorying for me , for necessity is laid upon me , and wo is to me if I may not proclaim good news ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	17	for if willing I do this , I have a reward ; and if unwillingly -- with a stewardship I have been entrusted !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What , then , is my reward ? -- that proclaiming good news , without charge I shall make the good news of the Christ , not to abuse my authority in the good news ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	19	for being free from all men , to all men I made myself servant , that the more I might gain ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	20	and I became to the Jews as a Jew , that Jews I might gain ; to those under law as under law , that those under law I might gain ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	21	to those without law , as without law -- ( not being without law to God , but within law to Christ ) -- that I might gain those without law ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	22	I became to the infirm as infirm , that the infirm I might gain ; to all men I have become all things , that by all means I may save some .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	23	And this I do because of the good news , that a fellow-partaker of it I may become ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	24	have ye not known that those running in a race -- all indeed run , but one doth receive the prize ? so run ye , that ye may obtain ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	25	and every one who is striving , is in all things temperate ; these , indeed , then , that a corruptible crown they may receive , but we an incorruptible ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	26	I , therefore , thus run , not as uncertainly , thus I fight , as not beating air ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	9	27	but I chastise my body , and bring [ it ] into servitude , lest by any means , having preached to others -- I myself may become disapproved .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	10	neither murmur ye , as also some of them did murmur , and did perish by the destroyer .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	2	and all to Moses were baptized in the cloud , and in the sea ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	3	and all the same spiritual food did eat ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and all the same spiritual drink did drink , for they were drinking of a spiritual rock following them , and the rock was the Christ ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	5	but in the most of them God was not well pleased , for they were strewn in the wilderness ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	6	and those things became types of us , for our not passionately desiring evil things , as also these did desire .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Neither become ye idolaters , as certain of them , as it hath been written , ` The people sat down to eat and to drink , and stood up to play ; '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	8	neither may we commit whoredom , as certain of them did commit whoredom , and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	9	neither may we tempt the Christ , as also certain of them did tempt , and by the serpents did perish ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	11	And all these things as types did happen to those persons , and they were written for our admonition , to whom the end of the ages did come ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	12	so that he who is thinking to stand -- let him observe , lest he fall .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation hath taken you -- except human ; and God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able , but He will make , with the temptation , also the outlet , for your being able to bear [ it ] .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore , my beloved , flee from the idolatry ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	15	as to wise men I speak -- judge ye what I say :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of the blessing that we bless -- is it not the fellowship of the blood of the Christ ? the bread that we break -- is it not the fellowship of the body of the Christ ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	17	because one bread , one body , are we the many -- for we all of the one bread do partake .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	18	See Israel according to the flesh ! are not those eating the sacrifices in the fellowship of the altar ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	19	what then do I say ? that an idol is anything ? or that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything ? --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	20	[ no , ] but that the things that the nations sacrifice -- they sacrifice to demons and not to God ; and I do not wish you to come into the fellowship of the demons .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	21	Ye are not able the cup of the Lord to drink , and the cup of demons ; ye are not able of the table of the Lord to partake , and of the table of demons ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	22	do we arouse the Lord to jealousy ? are we stronger than He ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things to me are lawful , but all things are not profitable ; all things to me are lawful , but all things do not build up ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	24	let no one seek his own -- but each another 's .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Whatever in the meat-market is sold eat ye , not inquiring , because of the conscience ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	26	for the Lord 's [ is ] the earth , and its fulness ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	27	and if any one of the unbelieving do call you , and ye wish to go , all that is set before you eat , nothing inquiring , because of the conscience ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	28	and if any one may say to you , ` This is a thing sacrificed to an idol , ' -- do not eat , because of that one who shewed [ it ] , and of the conscience , for the Lord 's [ is ] the earth and its fulness :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	29	and conscience , I say , not of thyself , but of the other , for why [ is it ] that my liberty is judged by another 's conscience ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	30	and if I thankfully do partake , why am I evil spoken of , for that for which I give thanks ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	31	Whether , then , ye eat , or drink , or do anything , do all to the glory of God ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	32	become offenceless , both to Jews and Greeks , and to the assembly of God ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	10	33	as I also in all things do please all , not seeking my own profit , but that of many -- that they may be saved .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	11	but neither [ is ] a man apart from a woman , nor a woman apart from a man , in the Lord ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	2	And I praise you , brethren , that in all things ye remember me , and according as I did deliver to you , the deliverances ye keep ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	3	and I wish you to know that of every man the head is the Christ , and the head of a woman is the husband , and the head of Christ is God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying , having the head covered , doth dishonour his head ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	5	and every woman praying or prophesying with the head uncovered , doth dishonour her own head , for it is one and the same thing with her being shaven ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	6	for if a woman is not covered -- then let her be shorn , and if [ it is ] a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven -- let her be covered ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	7	for a man , indeed , ought not to cover the head , being the image and glory of God , and a woman is the glory of a man ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	8	for a man is not of a woman , but a woman [ is ] of a man ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	9	for a man also was not created because of the woman , but a woman because of the man ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	10	because of this the woman ought to have [ a token of ] authority upon the head , because of the messengers ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	12	for as the woman [ is ] of the man , so also the man [ is ] through the woman , and the all things [ are ] of God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	13	In your own selves judge ye ; is it seemly for a woman uncovered to pray to God ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	14	doth not even nature itself teach you , that if a man indeed have long hair , a dishonour it is to him ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	15	and a woman , if she have long hair , a glory it is to her , because the hair instead of a covering hath been given to her ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	16	and if any one doth think to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the assemblies of God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	17	And this declaring , I give no praise , because not for the better , but for the worse ye come together ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	18	for first , indeed , ye coming together in an assembly , I hear of divisions being among you , and partly I believe [ it ] ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	19	for it behoveth sects also to be among you , that those approved may become manifest among you ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	20	ye , then , coming together at the same place -- it is not to eat the Lord 's supper ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	21	for each his own supper doth take before in the eating , and one is hungry , and another is drunk ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	22	why , have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? or the assembly of God do ye despise , and shame those not having ? what may I say to you ? shall I praise you in this ? I do not praise !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For I -- I received from the Lord that which also I did deliver to you , that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up , took bread ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and having given thanks , he brake , and said , ` Take ye , eat ye , this is my body , that for you is being broken ; this do ye -- to the remembrance of me . '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In like manner also the cup after the supping , saying , ` This cup is the new covenant in my blood ; this do ye , as often as ye may drink [ it ] -- to the remembrance of me ; '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	26	for as often as ye may eat this bread , and this cup may drink , the death of the Lord ye do shew forth -- till he may come ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	27	so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily , guilty he shall be of the body and blood of the Lord :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	28	and let a man be proving himself , and so of the bread let him eat , and of the cup let him drink ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	29	for he who is eating and drinking unworthily , judgment to himself he doth eat and drink -- not discerning the body of the Lord .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	30	Because of this , among you many [ are ] weak and sickly , and sleep do many ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	31	for if ourselves we were discerning , we would not be being judged ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	32	and being judged by the Lord , we are chastened , that with the world we may not be condemned ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	33	so then , my brethren , coming together to eat , for one another wait ye ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	11	34	and if any one is hungry , at home let him eat , that to judgment ye may not come together ; and the rest , whenever I may come , I shall arrange .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For , even as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of the one body , being many , are one body , so also [ is ] the Christ ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	2	ye have known that ye were nations , unto the dumb idols -- as ye were led -- being carried away ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	3	wherefore , I give you to understand that no one , in the Spirit of God speaking , saith Jesus [ is ] anathema , and no one is able to say Jesus [ is ] Lord , except in the Holy Spirit .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	4	And there are diversities of gifts , and the same Spirit ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	5	and there are diversities of ministrations , and the same Lord ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	6	and there are diversities of workings , and it is the same God -- who is working the all in all .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	7	And to each hath been given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	8	for to one through the Spirit hath been given a word of wisdom , and to another a word of knowledge , according to the same Spirit ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	9	and to another faith in the same Spirit , and to another gifts of healings in the same Spirit ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	10	and to another in-workings of mighty deeds ; and to another prophecy ; and to another discernings of spirits ; and to another [ divers ] kinds of tongues ; and to another interpretation of tongues :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	11	and all these doth work the one and the same Spirit , dividing to each severally as he intendeth .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	13	for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized , whether Jews or Greeks , whether servants or freemen , and all into one Spirit were made to drink ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	14	for also the body is not one member , but many ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	15	if the foot may say , ` Because I am not a hand , I am not of the body ; ' it is not , because of this , not of the body ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	16	and if the ear may say , ` Because I am not an eye , I am not of the body ; ' it is not , because of this , not of the body ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body [ were ] an eye , where the hearing ? if the whole hearing , where the smelling ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	18	and now , God did set the members each one of them in the body , according as He willed ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	19	and if all were one member , where the body ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	20	and now , indeed , [ are ] many members , and one body ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	21	and an eye is not able to say to the hand , ` I have no need of thee ; ' nor again the head to the feet , ` I have no need of you . '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	22	But much more the members of the body which seem to be more infirm are necessary ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and those that we think to be less honourable of the body , around these we put more abundant honour , and our unseemly things have seemliness more abundant ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	24	and our seemly things have no need ; but God did temper the body together , to the lacking part having given more abundant honour ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	25	that there may be no division in the body , but that the members may have the same anxiety for one another ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	26	and whether one member doth suffer , suffer with [ it ] do all the members , or one member is glorified , rejoice with [ it ] do all the members ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	27	and ye are the body of Christ , and members in particular .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And some , indeed , did God set in the assembly , first apostles , secondly prophets , thirdly teachers , afterwards powers , afterwards gifts of healings , helpings , governings , divers kinds of tongues ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	29	[ are ] all apostles ? [ are ] all prophets ? [ are ] all teachers ? [ are ] all powers ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	30	have all gifts of healings ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	12	31	and desire earnestly the better gifts ; and yet a far excelling way do I shew to you :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	13	and now there doth remain faith , hope , love -- these three ; and the greatest of these [ is ] love .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	2	and if I have prophecy , and know all the secrets , and all the knowledge , and if I have all the faith , so as to remove mountains , and have not love , I am nothing ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	3	and if I give away to feed others all my goods , and if I give up my body that I may be burned , and have not love , I am profited nothing .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	4	The love is long-suffering , it is kind , the love doth not envy , the love doth not vaunt itself , is not puffed up ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	5	doth not act unseemly , doth not seek its own things , is not provoked , doth not impute evil ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	6	rejoiceth not over the unrighteousness , and rejoiceth with the truth ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	7	all things it beareth , all it believeth , all it hopeth , all it endureth .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	8	The love doth never fail ; and whether [ there be ] prophecies , they shall become useless ; whether tongues , they shall cease ; whether knowledge , it shall become useless ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	9	for in part we know , and in part we prophecy ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	10	and when that which is perfect may come , then that which [ is ] in part shall become useless .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a babe , as a babe I was speaking , as a babe I was thinking , as a babe I was reasoning , and when I have become a man , I have made useless the things of the babe ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	13	12	for we see now through a mirror obscurely , and then face to face ; now I know in part , and then I shall fully know , as also I was known ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	14	for if I pray in an [ unknown ] tongue , my spirit doth pray , and my understanding is unfruitful .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	2	for he who is speaking in an [ unknown ] tongue -- to men he doth not speak , but to God , for no one doth hearken , and in spirit he doth speak secrets ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	3	and he who is prophesying to men doth speak edification , and exhortation , and comfort ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	4	he who is speaking in an [ unknown ] tongue , himself doth edify , and he who is prophesying , an assembly doth edify ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	5	and I wish you all to speak with tongues , and more that ye may prophecy , for greater is he who is prophesying than he who is speaking with tongues , except one may interpret , that the assembly may receive edification .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	6	And now , brethren , if I may come unto you speaking tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either in revelation , or in knowledge , or in prophesying , or in teaching ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	7	yet the things without life giving sound -- whether pipe or harp -- if a difference in the sounds they may not give , how shall be known that which is piped or that which is harped ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	8	for if also an uncertain sound a trumpet may give , who shall prepare himself for battle ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	9	so also ye , if through the tongue , speech easily understood ye may not give -- how shall that which is spoken be known ? for ye shall be speaking to air .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is unmeaning ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	11	if , then , I do not know the power of the voice , I shall be to him who is speaking a foreigner , and he who is speaking , is to me a foreigner ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	12	so also ye , since ye are earnestly desirous of spiritual gifts , for the building up of the assembly seek that ye may abound ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	13	wherefore he who is speaking in an [ unknown ] tongue -- let him pray that he may interpret ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What then is it ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray also with the understanding ; I will sing psalms with the spirit , and I will sing psalms also with the understanding ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	16	since , if thou mayest bless with the spirit , he who is filling the place of the unlearned , how shall he say the Amen at thy giving of thanks , since what thou dost say he hath not known ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	17	for thou , indeed , dost give thanks well , but the other is not built up !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I give thanks to my God -- more than you all with tongues speaking --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	19	but in an assembly I wish to speak five words through my understanding , that others also I may instruct , rather than myriads of words in an [ unknown ] tongue .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brethren , become not children in the understanding , but in the evil be ye babes , and in the understanding become ye perfect ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	21	in the law it hath been written , that , ` With other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people , and not even so will they hear Me , saith the Lord ; '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	22	so that the tongues are for a sign , not to the believing , but to the unbelieving ; and the prophesy [ is ] not for the unbelieving , but for the believing ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	23	If , therefore , the whole assembly may come together , to the same place , and all may speak with tongues , and there may come in unlearned or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	24	and if all may prophecy , and any one may come in , an unbeliever or unlearned , he is convicted by all , he is discerned by all ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	25	and so the secrets of his heart become manifest , and so having fallen upon [ his ] face , he will bow before God , declaring that God really is among you .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	26	What then is it , brethren ? whenever ye may come together , each of you hath a psalm , hath a teaching , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation ? let all things be for building up ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	27	if an [ unknown ] tongue any one do speak , by two , or at the most , by three , and in turn , and let one interpret ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	28	and if there may be no interpreter , let him be silent in an assembly , and to himself let him speak , and to God .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	29	And prophets -- let two or three speak , and let the others discern ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	30	and if to another sitting [ anything ] may be revealed , let the first be silent ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	31	for ye are able , one by one , all to prophesy , that all may learn , and all may be exhorted ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	32	and the spiritual gift of prophets to prophets are subject ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	33	for God is not [ a God ] of tumult , but of peace , as in all the assemblies of the saints .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	34	Your women in the assemblies let them be silent , for it hath not been permitted to them to speak , but to be subject , as also the law saith ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	35	and if they wish to learn anything , at home their own husbands let them question , for it is a shame to women to speak in an assembly .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	36	From you did the word of God come forth ? or to you alone did it come ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	37	if any one doth think to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge the things that I write to you -- that of the Lord they are commands ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	38	and if any one is ignorant -- let him be ignorant ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	39	so that , brethren , earnestly desire to prophesy , and to speak with tongues do not forbid ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	14	40	let all things be done decently and in order .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	15	and we also are found false witnesses of God , because we did testify of God that He raised up the Christ , whom He did not raise if then dead persons do not rise ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	2	through which also ye are being saved , in what words I proclaimed good news to you , if ye hold fast , except ye did believe in vain ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	3	for I delivered to you first , what also I did receive , that Christ died for our sins , according to the Writings ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	4	and that he was buried , and that he hath risen on the third day , according to the Writings ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	6	afterwards he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once , of whom the greater part remain till now , and certain also did fall asleep ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	7	afterwards he appeared to James , then to all the apostles .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	8	And last of all -- as to the untimely birth -- he appeared also to me ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	9	for I am the least of the apostles , who am not worthy to be called an apostle , because I did persecute the assembly of God ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	10	and by the grace of God I am what I am , and His grace that [ is ] towards me came not in vain , but more abundantly than they all did I labour , yet not I , but the grace of God that [ is ] with me ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	11	whether , then , I or they , so we preach , and so ye did believe .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	12	And if Christ is preached , that out of the dead he hath risen , how say certain among you , that there is no rising again of dead persons ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	13	and if there be no rising again of dead persons , neither hath Christ risen ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	14	and if Christ hath not risen , then void [ is ] our preaching , and void also your faith ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	16	for if dead persons do not rise , neither hath Christ risen ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	17	and if Christ hath not risen , vain is your faith , ye are yet in your sins ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	18	then , also , those having fallen asleep in Christ did perish ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	19	if in this life we have hope in Christ only , of all men we are most to be pitied .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	20	And now , Christ hath risen out of the dead -- the first-fruits of those sleeping he became ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	21	for since through man [ is ] the death , also through man [ is ] a rising again of the dead ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	22	for even as in Adam all die , so also in the Christ all shall be made alive ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	23	and each in his proper order , a first-fruit Christ , afterwards those who are the Christ 's , in his presence ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	24	then -- the end , when he may deliver up the reign to God , even the Father , when he may have made useless all rule , and all authority and power --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	25	for it behoveth him to reign till he may have put all the enemies under his feet --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	26	the last enemy is done away -- death ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	27	for all things He did put under his feet , and , when one may say that all things have been subjected , [ it is ] evident that He is excepted who did subject the all things to him ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	28	and when the all things may be subjected to him , then the Son also himself shall be subject to Him , who did subject to him the all things , that God may be the all in all .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Seeing what shall they do who are baptized for the dead , if the dead do not rise at all ? why also are they baptized for the dead ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	30	why also do we stand in peril every hour ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	31	Every day do I die , by the glorying of you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	32	if after the manner of a man with wild beasts I fought in Ephesus , what the advantage to me if the dead do not rise ? let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Be not led astray ; evil communications corrupt good manners ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	34	awake up , as is right , and sin not ; for certain have an ignorance of God ; for shame to you I say [ it ] .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But some one will say , ` How do the dead rise ?
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	36	unwise ! thou -- what thou dost sow is not quickened except it may die ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	37	and that which thou dost sow , not the body that shall be dost thou sow , but bare grain , it may be of wheat , or of some one of the others ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	38	and God doth give to it a body according as He willed , and to each of the seeds its proper body .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh [ is ] not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of men , and another flesh of beasts , and another of fishes , and another of birds ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	40	and [ there are ] heavenly bodies , and earthly bodies ; but one [ is ] the glory of the heavenly , and another that of the earthly ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	41	one glory of sun , and another glory of moon , and another glory of stars , for star from star doth differ in glory .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So also [ is ] the rising again of the dead : it is sown in corruption , it is raised in incorruption ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	43	it is sown in dishonour , it is raised in glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	44	it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body ; there is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	45	so also it hath been written , ` The first man Adam became a living creature , ' the last Adam [ is ] for a life-giving spirit ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	46	but that which is spiritual [ is ] not first , but that which [ was ] natural , afterwards that which [ is ] spiritual .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man [ is ] out of the earth , earthy ; the second man [ is ] the Lord out of heaven ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	48	as [ is ] the earthy , such [ are ] also the earthy ; and as [ is ] the heavenly , such [ are ] also the heavenly ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	49	and , according as we did bear the image of the earthy , we shall bear also the image of the heavenly .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	50	And this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood the reign of God is not able to inherit , nor doth the corruption inherit the incorruption ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	51	lo , I tell you a secret ; we indeed shall not all sleep , and we all shall be changed ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , in the last trumpet , for it shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we -- we shall be changed :
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	53	for it behoveth this corruptible to put on incorruption , and this mortal to put on immortality ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	54	and when this corruptible may have put on incorruption , and this mortal may have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the word that hath been written , ` The Death was swallowed up -- to victory ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	55	where , O Death , thy sting ? where , O Hades , thy victory ? '
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	56	and the sting of the death [ is ] the sin , and the power of the sin the law ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	57	and to God -- thanks , to Him who is giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	15	58	so that , my brethren beloved , become ye stedfast , unmovable , abounding in the work of the Lord at all times , knowing that your labour is not vain in the Lord .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	1	Corinthians
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	16	that ye also be subject to such , and to every one who is working with [ us ] and labouring ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	2	on every first [ day ] of the week , let each one of you lay by him , treasuring up whatever he may have prospered , that when I may come then collections may not be made ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	3	and whenever I may come , whomsoever ye may approve , through letters , these I will send to carry your favour to Jerusalem ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	4	and if it be meet for me also to go , with me they shall go .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	5	And I will come unto you , when I pass through Macedonia -- for Macedonia I do pass through --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	6	and with you , it may be , I will abide , or even winter , that ye may send me forward whithersoever I go ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	7	for I do not wish to see you now in the passing , but I hope to remain a certain time with you , if the Lord may permit ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	8	and I will remain in Ephesus till the Pentecost ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	9	for a door to me hath been opened -- great and effectual -- and withstanders [ are ] many .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	10	And if Timotheus may come , see that he may become without fear with you , for the work of the Lord he doth work , even as I ,
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	11	no one , then , may despise him ; and send ye him forward in peace , that he may come to me , for I expect him with the brethren ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	12	and concerning Apollos our brother , much I did entreat him that he may come unto you with the brethren , and it was not at all [ his ] will that he may come now , and he will come when he may find convenient .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye , stand in the faith ; be men , be strong ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	14	let all your things be done in love .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	15	And I entreat you , brethren , ye have known the household of Stephanas , that it is the first-fruit of Achaia , and to the ministration to the saints they did set themselves --
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	17	and I rejoice over the presence of Stephanas , and Fortunatus , and Achaicus , because the lack of you did these fill up ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	18	for they did refresh my spirit and yours ; acknowledge ye , therefore , those who [ are ] such .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	19	Salute you do the assemblies of Asia ; salute you much in the Lord do Aquilas and Priscilla , with the assembly in their house ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	20	salute you do all the brethren ; salute ye one another in an holy kiss .
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	21	The salutation of [ me ] Paul with my hand ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	22	if any one doth not love the Lord Jesus Christ -- let him be anathema ! The Lord hath come !
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [ is ] with you ;
YLT	1%20Corinthians	16	24	my love [ is ] with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ !
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ , through the will of God , and Timotheus the brother , to the assembly of God that is in Corinth , with all the saints who are in all Achaia :
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Blessed [ is ] God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of the mercies , and God of all comfort ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who is comforting us in all our tribulation , for our being able to comfort those in any tribulation through the comfort with which we are comforted ourselves by God ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	5	because , as the sufferings of the Christ do abound to us , so through the Christ doth abound also our comfort ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	6	and whether we be in tribulation , [ it is ] for your comfort and salvation , that is wrought in the enduring of the same sufferings that we also suffer ; whether we are comforted , [ it is ] for your comfort and salvation ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	7	and our hope [ is ] stedfast for you , knowing that even as ye are partakers of the sufferings -- so also of the comfort .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , of our tribulation that happened to us in Asia , that we were exceedingly burdened above [ our ] power , so that we despaired even of life ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	9	but we ourselves in ourselves the sentence of the death have had , that we may not be trusting on ourselves , but on God , who is raising the dead ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	10	who out of so great a death did deliver us , and doth deliver , in whom we have hoped that even yet He will deliver ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	11	ye working together also for us by your supplication , that the gift through many persons to us , through many may be thankfully acknowledged for us .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our glorying is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom , but in the grace of God , we did conduct ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	13	for no other things do we write to you , but what ye either do read or also acknowledge , and I hope that also unto the end ye shall acknowledge ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	14	according as also ye did acknowledge us in part , that your glory we are , even as also ye [ are ] ours , in the day of the Lord Jesus ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	15	and in this confidence I was purposing to come unto you before , that a second favour ye might have ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	16	and through you to pass to Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come unto you , and by you to be sent forward to Judea .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	17	This , therefore , counselling , did I then use the lightness ; or the things that I counsel , according to the flesh do I counsel , that it may be with me Yes , yes , and No , no ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	18	and God [ is ] faithful , that our word unto you became not Yes and No ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	19	for the Son of God , Jesus Christ , among you through us having been preached -- through me and Silvanus and Timotheus -- did not become Yes and No , but in him it hath become Yes ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	20	for as many as [ are ] promises of God , in him [ are ] the Yes , and in him the Amen , for glory to God through us ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	21	and He who is confirming you with us into Christ , and did anoint us , [ is ] God ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	22	who also sealed us , and gave the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	23	And I for a witness on God do call upon my soul , that sparing you , I came not yet to Corinth ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	1	24	not that we are lords over your faith , but we are workers together with your joy , for by the faith ye stand .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	2	for if I make you sorry , then who is he who is making me glad , except he who is made sorry by me ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	3	and I wrote to you this same thing , that having come , I may not have sorrow from them of whom it behoved me to have joy , having confidence in you all , that my joy is of you all ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	4	for out of much tribulation and pressure of heart I wrote to you through many tears , not that ye might be made sorry , but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly toward you .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	5	And if any one hath caused sorrow , he hath not caused sorrow to me , but in part , that I may not burden you all ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	6	sufficient to such a one is this punishment , that [ is ] by the more part ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	7	so that , on the contrary , [ it is ] rather for you to forgive and to comfort , lest by over abundant sorrow such a one may be swallowed up ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	8	wherefore , I call upon you to confirm love to him ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	9	for , for this also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether in regard to all things ye are obedient .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	10	And to whom ye forgive anything -- I also ; for I also , if I have forgiven anything , to whom I have forgiven [ it ] , because of you -- in the person of Christ -- [ I forgive it , ]
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	11	that we may not be over-reached by the Adversary , for of his devices we are not ignorant .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	12	And having come to Troas for the good news of the Christ , and a door to me having been opened in the Lord ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I have not had rest to my spirit , on my not finding Titus my brother , but having taken leave of them , I went forth to Macedonia ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	14	and to God [ are ] thanks , who at all times is leading us in triumph in the Christ , and the fragrance of His knowledge He is manifesting through us in every place ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	15	because of Christ a sweet fragrance we are to God , in those being saved , and in those being lost ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	16	to the one , indeed , a fragrance of death to death , and to the other , a fragrance of life to life ; and for these things who is sufficient ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	2	17	for we are not as the many , adulterating the word of God , but as of sincerity -- but as of God ; in the presence of God , in Christ we do speak .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	2	our letter ye are , having been written in our hearts , known and read by all men ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	3	manifested that ye are a letter of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God , not in the tablets of stone , but in fleshy tablets of the heart ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	4	and such trust we have through the Christ toward God ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	5	not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything , as of ourselves , but our sufficiency [ is ] of God ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	6	who also made us sufficient [ to be ] ministrants of a new covenant , not of letter , but of spirit ; for the letter doth kill , and the spirit doth make alive .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	7	and if the ministration of the death , in letters , engraved in stones , came in glory , so that the sons of Israel were not able to look stedfastly to the face of Moses , because of the glory of his face -- which was being made useless ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	8	how shall the ministration of the Spirit not be more in glory ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	9	for if the ministration of the condemnation [ is ] glory , much more doth the ministration of the righteousness abound in glory ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	10	for also even that which hath been glorious , hath not been glorious -- in this respect , because of the superior glory ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	11	for if that which is being made useless [ is ] through glory , much more that which is remaining [ is ] in glory .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Having , then , such hope , we use much freedom of speech ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	13	and [ are ] not as Moses , who was putting a vail upon his own face , for the sons of Israel not stedfastly to look to the end of that which is being made useless ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	14	but their minds were hardened , for unto this day the same vail at the reading of the Old Covenant doth remain unwithdrawn -- which in Christ is being made useless --
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	15	but till to-day , when Moses is read , a vail upon their heart doth lie ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	16	and whenever they may turn unto the Lord , the vail is taken away .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	17	And the Lord is the Spirit ; and where the Spirit of the Lord [ is ] , there [ is ] liberty ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	3	18	and we all , with unvailed face , the glory of the Lord beholding in a mirror , to the same image are being transformed , from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	2	but did renounce for ourselves the hidden things of shame , not walking in craftiness , nor deceitfully using the word of God , but by the manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves unto every conscience of men , before God ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	4	in whom the god of this age did blind the minds of the unbelieving , that there doth not shine forth to them the enlightening of the good news of the glory of the Christ , who is the image of God ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	3	and if also our good news is vailed , in those perishing it is vailed ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	5	for not ourselves do we preach , but Christ Jesus -- Lord , and ourselves your servants because of Jesus ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	6	because [ it is ] God who said , Out of darkness light [ is ] to shine , who did shine in our hearts , for the enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	7	And we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	8	on every side being in tribulation , but not straitened ; perplexed , but not in despair ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	9	persecuted , but not forsaken ; cast down , but not destroyed ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	10	at all times the dying of the Lord Jesus bearing about in the body , that the life also of Jesus in our body may be manifested ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	11	for always are we who are living delivered up to death because of Jesus , that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our dying flesh ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	12	so that , the death indeed in us doth work , and the life in you .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	13	And having the same spirit of the faith , according to that which hath been written , ` I believed , therefore I did speak ; ' we also do believe , therefore also do we speak ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	14	knowing that He who did raise up the Lord Jesus , us also through Jesus shall raise up , and shall present with you ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	15	for the all things [ are ] because of you , that the grace having been multiplied , because of the thanksgiving of the more , may abound to the glory of God ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	16	wherefore , we faint not , but if also our outward man doth decay , yet the inward is renewed day by day ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	17	for the momentary light matter of our tribulation , more and more exceedingly an age-during weight of glory doth work out for us --
YLT	2%20Corinthians	4	18	we not looking to the things seen , but to the things not seen ; for the things seen [ are ] temporary , but the things not seen [ are ] age-during .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	2	for also in this we groan , with our dwelling that is from heaven earnestly desiring to clothe ourselves ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	5	And He who did work us to this self-same thing [ is ] God , who also did give to us the earnest of the Spirit ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	3	if so be that , having clothed ourselves , we shall not be found naked ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	4	for we also who are in the tabernacle do groan , being burdened , seeing we wish not to unclothe ourselves , but to clothe ourselves , that the mortal may be swallowed up of the life .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	6	having courage , then , at all times , and knowing that being at home in the body , we are away from home from the Lord , --
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	7	for through faith we walk , not through sight --
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	8	we have courage , and are well pleased rather to be away from the home of the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Wherefore also we are ambitious , whether at home or away from home , to be well pleasing to him ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	10	for all of us it behoveth to be manifested before the tribunal of the Christ , that each one may receive the things [ done ] through the body , in reference to the things that he did , whether good or evil ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	11	having known , therefore , the fear of the Lord , we persuade men , and to God we are manifested , and I hope also in your consciences to have been manifested ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	12	for not again ourselves do we recommend to you , but we are giving occasion to you of glorifying in our behalf , that ye may have [ something ] in reference to those glorifying in face and not in heart ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	13	for whether we were beside ourselves , [ it was ] to God ; whether we be of sound mind -- [ it is ] to you ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	14	for the love of the Christ doth constrain us , having judged thus : that if one for all died , then the whole died ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and for all he died , that those living , no more to themselves may live , but to him who died for them , and was raised again .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	16	So that we henceforth have known no one according to the flesh , and even if we have known Christ according to the flesh , yet now we know him no more ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	17	so that if any one [ is ] in Christ -- [ he is ] a new creature ; the old things did pass away , lo , become new have the all things .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	18	And the all things [ are ] of God , who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ , and did give to us the ministration of the reconciliation ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	19	how that God was in Christ -- a world reconciling to Himself , not reckoning to them their trespasses ; and having put in us the word of the reconciliation ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	20	in behalf of Christ , then , we are ambassadors , as if God were calling through us , we beseech , in behalf of Christ , ` Be ye reconciled to God ; '
YLT	2%20Corinthians	5	21	for him who did not know sin , in our behalf He did make sin , that we may become the righteousness of God in him .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	2	for He saith , ` In an acceptable time I did hear thee , and in a day of salvation I did help thee , lo , now [ is ] a well-accepted time ; lo , now , a day of salvation , ' --
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	6	in pureness , in knowledge , in long-suffering , in kindness , in the Holy Spirit , in love unfeigned ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	3	in nothing giving any cause of offence , that the ministration may be not blamed ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	4	but in everything recommending ourselves as God 's ministrants ; in much patience , in tribulations , in necessities , in distresses ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	5	in stripes , in imprisonments , in insurrections , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	7	in the word of truth , in the power of God , through the armour of the righteousness , on the right and on the left ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	8	through glory and dishonour , through evil report and good report , as leading astray , and true ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	9	as unknown , and recognized ; as dying , and lo , we live ; as chastened , and not put to death ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	10	as sorrowful , and always rejoicing ; as poor , and making many rich ; as having nothing , and possessing all things .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth hath been open unto you , O Corinthians , our heart hath been enlarged !
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	12	ye are not straitened in us , and ye are straitened in your [ own ] bowels ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	13	and [ as ] a recompense of the same kind , ( as to children I say [ it ] , ) be ye enlarged -- also ye !
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Become not yoked with others -- unbelievers , for what partaking [ is there ] to righteousness and lawlessness ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	15	and what fellowship to light with darkness ? and what concord to Christ with Belial ? or what part to a believer with an unbeliever ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	16	and what agreement to the sanctuary of God with idols ? for ye are a sanctuary of the living God , according as God said -- ` I will dwell in them , and will walk among [ them ] , and I will be their God , and they shall be My people ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	17	wherefore , come ye forth out of the midst of them , and be separated , saith the Lord , and an unclean thing do not touch , and I -- I will receive you ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	6	18	and I will be to you for a Father , and ye -- ye shall be to Me for sons and daughters , saith the Lord Almighty . '
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	2	receive us ; no one did we wrong ; no one did we waste ; no one did we defraud ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	7	and not only in his presence , but also in the comfort with which he was comforted over you , declaring to us your longing desire , your lamentation , your zeal for me , so that the more I did rejoice ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	3	not to condemn you do I say [ it ] , for I have said before that in our hearts ye are to die with and to live with ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	4	great [ is ] my freedom of speech unto you , great my glory on your behalf ; I have been filled with the comfort , I overabound with the joy on all our tribulation ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	5	for also we , having come to Macedonia , no relaxation hath our flesh had , but on every side we are in tribulation , without [ are ] fightings , within -- fears ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	6	but He who is comforting the cast-down -- God -- He did comfort us in the presence of Titus ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	8	because even if I made you sorry in the letter , I do not repent -- if even I did repent -- for I perceive that the letter , even if for an hour , did make you sorry .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	9	I now do rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye were made sorry to reformation , for ye were made sorry toward God , that in nothing ye might receive damage from us ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	10	for the sorrow toward God reformation to salvation not to be repented of doth work , and the sorrow of the world doth work death ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	11	for , lo , this same thing -- your being made sorry toward God -- how much diligence it doth work in you ! but defence , but displeasure , but fear , but longing desire , but zeal , but revenge ; in every thing ye did approve yourselves to be pure in the matter .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	12	If , then , I also wrote to you -- not for his cause who did wrong , nor for his cause who did suffer wrong , but for our diligence in your behalf being manifested unto you before God --
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	13	because of this we have been comforted in your comfort , and more abundantly the more did we rejoice in the joy of Titus , that his spirit hath been refreshed from you all ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	14	because if anything to him in your behalf I have boasted , I was not put to shame ; but as all things in truth we did speak to you , so also our boasting before Titus became truth ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	15	and his tender affection is more abundantly toward you , remembering the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye did receive him ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice , therefore , that in everything I have courage in you .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	2	because in much trial of tribulation the abundance of their joy , and their deep poverty , did abound to the riches of their liberality ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	8	not according to command do I speak , but because of the diligence of others , and of your love proving the genuineness ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	3	because , according to [ their ] power , I testify , and above [ their ] power , they were willing of themselves ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	4	with much entreaty calling on us to receive the favour and the fellowship of the ministration to the saints ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	5	and not according as we expected , but themselves they did give first to the Lord , and to us , through the will of God ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	6	so that we exhorted Titus , that , according as he did begin before , so also he may finish to you also this favour ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	7	but even as in every thing ye do abound , in faith , and word , and knowledge , and all diligence , and in your love to us , that also in this grace ye may abound ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	9	for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that because of you he became poor -- being rich , that ye by that poverty may become rich .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	10	and an opinion in this do I give : for this to you [ is ] expedient , who not only to do , but also to will , did begin before -- a year ago ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	11	and now also finish doing [ it ] , that even as [ there is ] the readiness of the will , so also the finishing , out of that which ye have ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	12	for if the willing mind is present , according to that which any one may have it is well-accepted , not according to that which he hath not ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	13	for not that for others release , and ye pressured , [ do I speak , ]
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	14	but by equality , at the present time your abundance -- for their want , that also their abundance may be for your want , that there may be equality ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	15	according as it hath been written , ` He who [ did gather ] much , had nothing over ; and he who [ did gather ] little , had no lack . '
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	16	And thanks to God , who is putting the same diligence for you in the heart of Titus ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	17	because indeed the exhortation he accepted , and being more diligent , of his own accord he went forth unto you ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	18	and we sent with him the brother , whose praise in the good news [ is ] through all the assemblies ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	19	and not only so , but who was also appointed by vote by the assemblies , our fellow-traveller , with this favour that is ministered by us , unto the glory of the same Lord , and your willing mind ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	20	avoiding this , lest any one may blame us in this abundance that is ministered by us ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	21	providing right things , not only before the Lord , but also before men ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	22	and we sent with them our brother , whom we proved in many things many times being diligent , and now much more diligent , by the great confidence that is toward you ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	23	whether -- about Titus -- my partner and towards you fellow-worker , whether -- our brethren , apostles of assemblies -- glory of Christ ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	8	24	the shewing therefore of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf , to them shew ye , even in the face of the assemblies .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	2	for I have known your readiness of mind , which in your behalf I boast of to Macedonians , that Achaia hath been prepared a year ago , and the zeal of you did stir up the more part ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	9	( according as it hath been written , ` He dispersed abroad , he gave to the poor , his righteousness doth remain to the age , ' )
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	3	and I sent the brethren , that our boasting on your behalf may not be made vain in this respect ; that , according as I said , ye may be ready ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	4	lest if Macedonians may come with me , and find you unprepared , we -- we may be put to shame ( that we say not -- ye ) in this same confidence of boasting .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	5	Necessary , therefore , I thought [ it ] to exhort the brethren , that they may go before to you , and may make up before your formerly announced blessing , that this be ready , as a blessing , and not as covetousness .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	6	And this : He who is sowing sparingly , sparingly also shall reap ; and he who is sowing in blessings , in blessings also shall reap ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	7	each one , according as he doth purpose in heart , not out of sorrow or out of necessity , for a cheerful giver doth God love ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	8	and God [ is ] able all grace to cause to abound to you , that in every thing always all sufficiency having , ye may abound to every good work ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	10	and may He who is supplying seed to the sower , and bread for food , supply and multiply your seed sown , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	11	in every thing being enriched to all liberality , which doth work through us thanksgiving to God ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	12	because the ministration of this service not only is supplying the wants of the saints , but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	13	through the proof of this ministration glorifying God for the subjection of your confession to the good news of the Christ , and [ for ] the liberality of the fellowship to them and to all ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	14	and by their supplication in your behalf , longing after you because of the exceeding grace of God upon you ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	9	15	thanks also to God for His unspeakable gift !
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	2	and I beseech [ you ] , that , being present , I may not have courage , with the confidence with which I reckon to be bold against certain reckoning us as walking according to the flesh ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	10	` because the letters indeed -- saith one -- [ are ] weighty and strong , and the bodily presence weak , and the speech despicable . '
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	3	for walking in the flesh , not according to the flesh do we war ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	4	for the weapons of our warfare [ are ] not fleshly , but powerful to God for bringing down of strongholds ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	5	reasonings bringing down , and every high thing lifted up against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of the Christ ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	6	and being in readiness to avenge every disobedience , whenever your obedience may be fulfilled .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	7	The things in presence do ye see ? if any one hath trusted in himself to be Christ 's , this let him reckon again from himself , that according as he is Christ 's , so also we [ are ] Christ 's ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	8	for even if also anything more abundantly I shall boast concerning our authority , that the Lord gave us for building up , and not for casting you down , I shall not be ashamed ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	9	that I may not seem as if I would terrify you through the letters ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	11	This one -- let him reckon thus : that such as we are in word , through letters , being absent , such also , being present , [ we are ] in deed .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we do not make bold to rank or to compare ourselves with certain of those commending themselves , but they , among themselves measuring themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are not wise ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	13	and we in regard to the unmeasured things will not boast ourselves , but after the measure of the line that the God of measure did appoint to us -- to reach even unto you ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	14	for not as not reaching to you do we stretch ourselves overmuch , for even unto you did we come in the good news of the Christ ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	15	not boasting of the things not measured , in other men 's labours , and having hope -- your faith increasing -- in you to be enlarged , according to our line -- into abundance ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	16	in the [ places ] beyond you to proclaim good news , not in another 's line in regard to the things made ready , to boast ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	17	and he who is boasting -- in the Lord let him boast ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	10	18	for not he who is commending himself is approved , but he whom the Lord doth commend .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	2	for I am zealous for you with zeal of God , for I did betroth you to one husband , a pure virgin , to present to Christ ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	11	wherefore ? because I do not love you ? God hath known !
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	3	and I fear , lest , as the serpent did beguile Eve in his subtilty , so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that [ is ] in the Christ ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	4	for if , indeed , he who is coming doth preach another Jesus whom we did not preach , or another Spirit ye receive which ye did not receive , or other good news which ye did not accept -- well were ye bearing [ it ] ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	5	for I reckon that I have been nothing behind the very chiefest apostles ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	6	and even if unlearned in word -- yet not in knowledge , but in every thing we were made manifest in all things to you .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	7	The sin did I do -- myself humbling that ye might be exalted , because freely the good news of God I did proclaim to you ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	8	other assemblies I did rob , having taken wages , for your ministration ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	9	and being present with you , and having been in want , I was chargeable to no one , for my lack did the brethren supply -- having come from Macedonia -- and in everything burdenless to you I did keep myself , and will keep .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	10	The truth of Christ is in me , because this boasting shall not be stopped in regard to me in the regions of Achaia ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	12	and what I do , I also will do , that I may cut off the occasion of those wishing an occasion , that in that which they boast they may be found according as we also ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	13	for those such [ are ] false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into apostles of Christ ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	14	and no wonder -- for even the Adversary doth transform himself into a messenger of light ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	15	no great thing , then , if also his ministrants do transform themselves as ministrants of righteousness -- whose end shall be according to their works .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	16	Again I say , may no one think me to be a fool ; and if otherwise , even as a fool receive me , that I also a little may boast .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak , I speak not according to the Lord , but as in foolishness , in this the confidence of boasting ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	18	since many boast according to the flesh , I also will boast :
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	19	for gladly do ye bear with the fools -- being wise ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	20	for ye bear , if any one is bringing you under bondage , if any one doth devour , if any one doth take away , if any one doth exalt himself , if any one on the face doth smite you ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	21	in reference to dishonour I speak , how that we were weak , and in whatever any one is bold -- in foolishness I say [ it ] -- I also am bold .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Hebrews are they ? I also ! Israelites are they ? I also ! seed of Abraham are they ? I also !
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	23	ministrants of Christ are they ? -- as beside myself I speak -- I more ; in labours more abundantly , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequently , in deaths many times ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	24	from Jews five times forty [ stripes ] save one I did receive ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	25	thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice was I shipwrecked , a night and a day in the deep I have passed ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	26	journeyings many times , perils of rivers , perils of robbers , perils from kindred , perils from nations , perils in city , perils in wilderness , perils in sea , perils among false brethren ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	27	in laboriousness and painfulness , in watchings many times , in hunger and thirst , in fastings many times , in cold and nakedness ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	28	apart from the things without -- the crowding upon me that is daily -- the care of all the assemblies .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is infirm , and I am not infirm ? who is stumbled , and I am not fired ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	30	if to boast it behoveth [ me ] , of the things of my infirmity I will boast ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	31	the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ -- who is blessed to the ages -- hath known that I do not lie ! --
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king was watching the city of the Damascenes , wishing to seize me ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	11	33	and through a window in a rope basket I was let down , through the wall , and fled out of his hands .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I have known a man in Christ , fourteen years ago -- whether in the body I have not known , whether out of the body I have not known , God hath known -- such an one being caught away unto the third heaven ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	12	The signs , indeed , of the apostle were wrought among you in all patience , in signs , and wonders , and mighty deeds ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	3	and I have known such a man -- whether in the body , whether out of the body , I have not known , God hath known , --
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	4	that he was caught away to the paradise , and heard unutterable sayings , that it is not possible for man to speak .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	5	Of such an one I will boast , and of myself I will not boast , except in my infirmities ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	6	for if I may wish to boast , I shall not be a fool , for truth I will say ; but I forebear , lest any one in regard to me may think anything above what he doth see me , or doth hear anything of me ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	7	and that by the exceeding greatness of the revelations I might not be exalted overmuch , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , a messenger of the Adversary , that he might buffet me , that I might not be exalted overmuch .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Concerning this thing thrice the Lord did I call upon , that it might depart from me ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	9	and He said to me , ` Sufficient for thee is My grace , for My power in infirmity is perfected ; ' most gladly , therefore , will I rather boast in my infirmities , that the power of the Christ may rest on me :
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	10	wherefore I am well pleased in infirmities , in damages , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses -- for Christ ; for whenever I am infirm , then I am powerful ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have become a fool -- boasting ; ye -- ye did compel me ; for I ought by you to have been commended , for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles -- even if I am nothing .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	13	for what is there in which ye were inferior to the rest of the assemblies , except that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this injustice !
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Lo , a third time I am ready to come unto you , and I will not be a burden to you , for I seek not yours , but you , for the children ought not for the parents to lay up , but the parents for the children ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	15	and I most gladly will spend and be entirely spent for your souls , even if , more abundantly loving you , less I am loved .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	16	And be it [ so ] , I -- I did not burden you , but being crafty , with guile I did take you ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	17	any one of those whom I have sent unto you -- by him did I take advantage of you ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I entreated Titus , and did send with [ him ] the brother ; did Titus take advantage of you ? in the same spirit did we not walk ? -- did we not in the same steps ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Again , think ye that to you we are making defence ? before God in Christ do we speak ; and the all things , beloved , [ are ] for your up-building ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	20	for I fear lest , having come , not such as I wish I may find you , and I -- I may be found by you such as ye do not wish , lest there be strifes , envyings , wraths , revelries , evil-speakings , whisperings , puffings up , insurrections ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	12	21	lest again having come , my God may humble me in regard to you , and I may bewail many of those having sinned before , and not having reformed concerning the uncleanness , and whoredom , and lasciviousness , that they did practise .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	2	I have said before , and I say [ it ] before , as being present , the second time , and being absent , now , do I write to those having sinned before , and to all the rest , that if I come again , I will not spare ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	13	salute you do all the saints ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	3	since a proof ye seek of the Christ speaking in me , who to you is not infirm , but is powerful in you ,
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	4	for even if he was crucified from infirmity , yet he doth live from the power of God ; for we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him from the power of God toward you .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Your ownselves try ye , if ye are in the faith ; your ownselves prove ye ; do ye not know your ownselves , that Jesus Christ is in you , if ye be not in some respect disapproved of ?
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	6	and I hope that ye shall know that we -- we are not disapproved of ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	7	and I pray before God that ye do no evil , not that we may appear approved , but that ye may do that which is right , and we may be as disapproved ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	8	for we are not able to do anything against the truth , but for the truth ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	9	for we rejoice when we may be infirm , and ye may be powerful ; and this also we pray for -- your perfection !
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	10	because of this , these things -- being absent -- I write , that being present , I may not treat [ any ] sharply , according to the authority that the Lord did give me for building up , and not for casting down .
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	11	Henceforth , brethren , rejoice ; be made perfect , be comforted , be of the same mind , be at peace , and the God of the love and peace shall be with you ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	12	salute one another in an holy kiss ;
YLT	2%20Corinthians	13	14	the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit , [ is ] with you all ! Amen .
YLT	Galatians	1	1	Paul , an apostle -- not from men , nor through man , but through Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who did raise him out of the dead --
YLT	Galatians	1	2	and all the brethren with me , to the assemblies of Galatia :
YLT	Galatians	1	3	Grace to you , and peace from God the Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ ,
YLT	Galatians	1	4	who did give himself for our sins , that he might deliver us out of the present evil age , according to the will of God even our Father ,
YLT	Galatians	1	5	to whom [ is ] the glory to the ages of the ages . Amen .
YLT	Galatians	1	6	I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news ;
YLT	Galatians	1	7	that is not another , except there be certain who are troubling you , and wishing to pervert the good news of the Christ ;
YLT	Galatians	1	8	but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you -- anathema let him be !
YLT	Galatians	1	9	as we have said before , and now say again , If any one to you may proclaim good news different from what ye did receive -- anathema let him be !
YLT	Galatians	1	10	for now men do I persuade , or God ? or do I seek to please men ? for if yet men I did please -- Christ 's servant I should not be .
YLT	Galatians	1	11	And I make known to you , brethren , the good news that were proclaimed by me , that it is not according to man ,
YLT	Galatians	1	12	for neither did I from man receive it , nor was I taught [ it ] , but through a revelation of Jesus Christ ,
YLT	Galatians	1	13	for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism , that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God , and wasting it ,
YLT	Galatians	1	14	and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race , being more abundantly zealous of my fathers ' deliverances ,
YLT	Galatians	1	15	and when God was well pleased -- having separated me from the womb of my mother , and having called [ me ] through His grace --
YLT	Galatians	1	16	to reveal His Son in me , that I might proclaim him good news among the nations , immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood ,
YLT	Galatians	1	17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me , but I went away to Arabia , and again returned to Damascus ,
YLT	Galatians	1	18	then , after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter , and remained with him fifteen days ,
YLT	Galatians	1	19	and other of the apostles I did not see , except James , the brother of the Lord .
YLT	Galatians	1	20	And the things that I write to you , lo , before God -- I lie not ;
YLT	Galatians	1	21	then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia ,
YLT	Galatians	1	22	and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea , that [ are ] in Christ ,
YLT	Galatians	1	23	and only they were hearing , that ` he who is persecuting us then , doth now proclaim good news -- the faith that then he was wasting ; '
YLT	Galatians	1	24	and they were glorifying God in me .
YLT	Galatians	2	2	and I went up by revelation , and did submit to them the good news that I preach among the nations , and privately to those esteemed , lest in vain I might run or did run ;
YLT	Galatians	2	3	but not even Titus , who [ is ] with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised --
YLT	Galatians	2	4	and [ that ] because of the false brethren brought in unawares , who did come in privily to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus , that us they might bring under bondage ,
YLT	Galatians	2	5	to whom not even for an hour we gave place by subjection , that the truth of the good news might remain to you .
YLT	Galatians	2	6	And from those who were esteemed to be something -- whatever they were then , it maketh no difference to me -- the face of man God accepteth not , for -- to me those esteemed did add nothing ,
YLT	Galatians	2	7	but , on the contrary , having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of the uncircumcision , as Peter with [ that ] of the circumcision ,
YLT	Galatians	2	8	for He who did work with Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , did work also in me in regard to the nations ,
YLT	Galatians	2	9	and having known the grace that was given to me , James , and Cephas , and John , who were esteemed to be pillars , a right hand of fellowship they did give to me , and to Barnabas , that we to the nations , and they to the circumcision [ may go ] ,
YLT	Galatians	2	10	only , of the poor that we should be mindful , which also I was diligent -- this very thing -- to do .
YLT	Galatians	2	11	And when Peter came to Antioch , to the face I stood up against him , because he was blameworthy ,
YLT	Galatians	2	12	for before the coming of certain from James , with the nations he was eating , and when they came , he was withdrawing and separating himself , fearing those of the circumcision ,
YLT	Galatians	2	13	and dissemble with him also did the other Jews , so that also Barnabas was carried away by their dissimulation .
YLT	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly to the truth of the good news , I said to Peter before all , ` If thou , being a Jew , in the manner of the nations dost live , and not in the manner of the Jews , how the nations dost thou compel to Judaize ?
YLT	Galatians	2	15	we by nature Jews , and not sinners of the nations ,
YLT	Galatians	2	16	having known also that a man is not declared righteous by works of law , if not through the faith of Jesus Christ , also we in Christ Jesus did believe , that we might be declared righteous by the faith of Christ , and not by works of law , wherefore declared righteous by works of law shall be no flesh . '
YLT	Galatians	2	17	And if , seeking to be declared righteous in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , [ is ] then Christ a ministrant of sin ? let it not be !
YLT	Galatians	2	18	for if the things I threw down , these again I build up , a transgressor I set myself forth ;
YLT	Galatians	2	19	for I through law , did die , that to God I may live ;
YLT	Galatians	2	20	with Christ I have been crucified , and live no more do I , and Christ doth live in me ; and that which I now live in the flesh -- in the faith I live of the Son of God , who did love me and did give himself for me ;
YLT	Galatians	2	21	I do not make void the grace of God , for if righteousness [ be ] through law -- then Christ died in vain .
YLT	Galatians	3	3	so thoughtless are ye ! having begun in the Spirit , now in the flesh do ye end ?
YLT	Galatians	3	2	this only do I wish to learn from you -- by works of law the Spirit did ye receive , or by the hearing of faith ?
YLT	Galatians	3	4	so many things did ye suffer in vain ! if , indeed , even in vain .
YLT	Galatians	3	5	He , therefore , who is supplying to you the Spirit , and working mighty acts among you -- by works of law or by the hearing of faith [ is it ] ?
YLT	Galatians	3	6	according as Abraham did believe God , and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness ;
YLT	Galatians	3	7	know ye , then , that those of faith -- these are sons of Abraham ,
YLT	Galatians	3	8	and the Writing having foreseen that by faith God doth declare righteous the nations did proclaim before the good news to Abraham --
YLT	Galatians	3	9	` Blessed in thee shall be all the nations ; ' so that those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham ,
YLT	Galatians	3	10	for as many as are of works of law are under a curse , for it hath been written , ` Cursed [ is ] every one who is not remaining in all things that have been written in the Book of the Law -- to do them , '
YLT	Galatians	3	11	and that in law no one is declared righteous with God , is evident , because ` The righteous by faith shall live ; '
YLT	Galatians	3	12	and the law is not by faith , but -- ` The man who did them shall live in them . '
YLT	Galatians	3	13	Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law , having become for us a curse , for it hath been written , ` Cursed is every one who is hanging on a tree , '
YLT	Galatians	3	14	that to the nations the blessing of Abraham may come in Christ Jesus , that the promise of the Spirit we may receive through the faith .
YLT	Galatians	3	15	Brethren , as a man I say [ it ] , even of man a confirmed covenant no one doth make void or doth add to ,
YLT	Galatians	3	16	and to Abraham were the promises spoken , and to his seed ; He doth not say , ` And to seeds , ' as of many , but as of one , ` And to thy seed , ' which is Christ ;
YLT	Galatians	3	17	and this I say , A covenant confirmed before by God to Christ , the law , that came four hundred and thirty years after , doth not set aside , to make void the promise ,
YLT	Galatians	3	18	for if by law [ be ] the inheritance , [ it is ] no more by promise , but to Abraham through promise did God grant [ it ] .
YLT	Galatians	3	19	Why , then , the law ? on account of the transgressions it was added , till the seed might come to which the promise hath been made , having been set in order through messengers in the hand of a mediator --
YLT	Galatians	3	20	and the mediator is not of one , and God is one --
YLT	Galatians	3	21	the law , then , [ is ] against the promises of God ? -- let it not be ! for if a law was given that was able to make alive , truly by law there would have been the righteousness ,
YLT	Galatians	3	22	but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those believing .
YLT	Galatians	3	23	And before the coming of the faith , under law we were being kept , shut up to the faith about to be revealed ,
YLT	Galatians	3	24	so that the law became our child-conductor -- to Christ , that by faith we may be declared righteous ,
YLT	Galatians	3	25	and the faith having come , no more under a child-conductor are we ,
YLT	Galatians	3	26	for ye are all sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus ,
YLT	Galatians	3	27	for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ ;
YLT	Galatians	3	28	there is not here Jew or Greek , there is not here servant nor freeman , there is not here male and female , for all ye are one in Christ Jesus ;
YLT	Galatians	3	29	and if ye [ are ] of Christ then of Abraham ye are seed , and according to promise -- heirs .
YLT	Galatians	4	4	and when the fulness of time did come , God sent forth His Son , come of a woman , come under law ,
YLT	Galatians	4	2	but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father ,
YLT	Galatians	4	3	so also we , when we were babes , under the elements of the world were in servitude ,
YLT	Galatians	4	5	that those under law he may redeem , that the adoption of sons we may receive ;
YLT	Galatians	4	6	and because ye are sons , God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts , crying , ` Abba , Father ! '
YLT	Galatians	4	7	so that thou art no more a servant , but a son , and if a son , also an heir of God through Christ .
YLT	Galatians	4	8	But then , indeed , not having known God , ye were in servitude to those not by nature gods ,
YLT	Galatians	4	9	and now , having known God -- and rather being known by God -- how turn ye again unto the weak and poor elements to which anew ye desire to be in servitude ?
YLT	Galatians	4	10	days ye observe , and months , and times , and years !
YLT	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you , lest in vain I did labour toward you .
YLT	Galatians	4	12	Become as I [ am ] -- because I also [ am ] as ye brethren , I beseech you ; to me ye did no hurt ,
YLT	Galatians	4	13	and ye have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did proclaim good news to you at the first ,
YLT	Galatians	4	14	and my trial that [ is ] in my flesh ye did not despise nor reject , but as a messenger of God ye did receive me -- as Christ Jesus ;
YLT	Galatians	4	15	what then was your happiness ? for I testify to you , that if possible , your eyes having plucked out , ye would have given to me ;
YLT	Galatians	4	16	so that your enemy have I become , being true to you ?
YLT	Galatians	4	17	they are zealous for you -- [ yet ] not well , but they wish to shut us out , that for them ye may be zealous ;
YLT	Galatians	4	18	and [ it is ] good to be zealously regarded , in what is good , at all times , and not only in my being present with you ;
YLT	Galatians	4	19	my little children , of whom again I travail in birth , till Christ may be formed in you ,
YLT	Galatians	4	20	and I was wishing to be present with you now , and to change my voice , because I am in doubt about you .
YLT	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , ye who are willing to be under law , the law do ye not hear ?
YLT	Galatians	4	22	for it hath been written , that Abraham had two sons , one by the maid-servant , and one by the free-woman ,
YLT	Galatians	4	23	but he who [ is ] of the maid-servant , according to flesh hath been , and he who [ is ] of the free-woman , through the promise ;
YLT	Galatians	4	24	which things are allegorized , for these are the two covenants : one , indeed , from mount Sinai , to servitude bringing forth , which is Hagar ;
YLT	Galatians	4	25	for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia , and doth correspond to the Jerusalem that now [ is ] , and is in servitude with her children ,
YLT	Galatians	4	26	and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman , which is mother of us all ,
YLT	Galatians	4	27	for it hath been written , ` Rejoice , O barren , who art not bearing ; break forth and cry , thou who art not travailing , because many [ are ] the children of the desolate -- more than of her having the husband . '
YLT	Galatians	4	28	And we , brethren , as Isaac , are children of promise ,
YLT	Galatians	4	29	but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit , so also now ;
YLT	Galatians	4	30	but what saith the Writing ? ` Cast forth the maid-servant and her son , for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman ; '
YLT	Galatians	4	31	then , brethren , we are not a maid-servant 's children , but the free-woman 's .
YLT	Galatians	5	5	for we by the Spirit , by faith , a hope of righteousness do wait for ,
YLT	Galatians	5	2	lo , I Paul do say to you , that if ye be circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing ;
YLT	Galatians	5	3	and I testify again to every man circumcised , that he is a debtor to do the whole law ;
YLT	Galatians	5	4	ye were freed from the Christ , ye who in law are declared righteous ; from the grace ye fell away ;
YLT	Galatians	5	6	for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision , but faith through love working .
YLT	Galatians	5	7	Ye were running well ; who did hinder you -- not to obey the truth ?
YLT	Galatians	5	8	the obedience [ is ] not of him who is calling you !
YLT	Galatians	5	9	a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven ;
YLT	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded ; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment , whoever he may be .
YLT	Galatians	5	11	And I , brethren , if uncircumcision I yet preach , why yet am I persecuted ? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away ;
YLT	Galatians	5	12	O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you !
YLT	Galatians	5	13	For ye -- to freedom ye were called , brethren , only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh , but through the love serve ye one another ,
YLT	Galatians	5	14	for all the law in one word is fulfilled -- in this : ` Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ; '
YLT	Galatians	5	15	and if one another ye do bite and devour , see -- that ye may not by one another be consumed .
YLT	Galatians	5	16	And I say : In the Spirit walk ye , and the desire of the flesh ye may not complete ;
YLT	Galatians	5	17	for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit , and the Spirit contrary to the flesh , and these are opposed one to another , that the things that ye may will -- these ye may not do ;
YLT	Galatians	5	18	and if by the Spirit ye are led , ye are not under law .
YLT	Galatians	5	19	And manifest also are the works of the flesh , which are : Adultery , whoredom , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
YLT	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , strifes , emulations , wraths , rivalries , dissensions , sects ,
YLT	Galatians	5	21	envyings , murders , drunkennesses , revellings , and such like , of which I tell you before , as I also said before , that those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit .
YLT	Galatians	5	22	And the fruit of the Spirit is : Love , joy , peace , long-suffering , kindness , goodness , faith ,
YLT	Galatians	5	23	meekness , temperance : against such there is no law ;
YLT	Galatians	5	24	and those who are Christ 's , the flesh did crucify with the affections , and the desires ;
YLT	Galatians	5	25	if we may live in the Spirit , in the Spirit also we may walk ;
YLT	Galatians	5	26	let us not become vain-glorious -- one another provoking , one another envying !
YLT	Galatians	6	6	And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing -- in all good things .
YLT	Galatians	6	2	of one another the burdens bear ye , and so fill up the law of the Christ ,
YLT	Galatians	6	3	for if any one doth think [ himself ] to be something -- being nothing -- himself he doth deceive ;
YLT	Galatians	6	4	and his own work let each one prove , and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have , and not in regard to the other ,
YLT	Galatians	6	5	for each one his own burden shall bear .
YLT	Galatians	6	7	Be not led astray ; God is not mocked ; for what a man may sow -- that also he shall reap ,
YLT	Galatians	6	8	because he who is sowing to his own flesh , of the flesh shall reap corruption ; and he who is sowing to the Spirit , of the Spirit shall reap life age-during ;
YLT	Galatians	6	9	and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted , for at the proper time we shall reap -- not desponding ;
YLT	Galatians	6	10	therefore , then , as we have opportunity , may we work the good to all , and especially unto those of the household of the faith .
YLT	Galatians	6	11	Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand ;
YLT	Galatians	6	12	as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh , these constrain you to be circumcised -- only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted ,
YLT	Galatians	6	13	for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law , but they wish you to be circumcised , that in your flesh they may glory .
YLT	Galatians	6	14	And for me , let it not be -- to glory , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which to me the world hath been crucified , and I to the world ;
YLT	Galatians	6	15	for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creation ;
YLT	Galatians	6	16	and as many as by this rule do walk -- peace upon them , and kindness , and on the Israel of God !
YLT	Galatians	6	17	Henceforth , let no one give me trouble , for I the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body do bear .
YLT	Galatians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ is ] with your spirit , brethren ! Amen .
YLT	Ephesians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , to the saints who are in Ephesus , and to the faithful in Christ Jesus :
YLT	Ephesians	1	2	Grace to you , and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ !
YLT	Ephesians	1	3	Blessed [ is ] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who did bless us in every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	4	according as He did choose us in him before the foundation of the world , for our being holy and unblemished before Him , in love ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	5	having foreordained us to the adoption of sons through Jesus Christ to Himself , according to the good pleasure of His will ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	6	to the praise of the glory of His grace , in which He did make us accepted in the beloved ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	7	in whom we have the redemption through his blood , the remission of the trespasses , according to the riches of His grace ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	8	in which He did abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	9	having made known to us the secret of His will , according to His good pleasure , that He purposed in Himself ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	10	in regard to the dispensation of the fulness of the times , to bring into one the whole in the Christ , both the things in the heavens , and the things upon the earth -- in him ;
YLT	Ephesians	1	11	in whom also we did obtain an inheritance , being foreordained according to the purpose of Him who the all things is working according to the counsel of His will ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	12	for our being to the praise of His glory , [ even ] those who did first hope in the Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	13	in whom ye also , having heard the word of the truth -- the good news of your salvation -- in whom also having believed , ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	14	which is an earnest of our inheritance , to the redemption of the acquired possession , to the praise of His glory .
YLT	Ephesians	1	15	Because of this I also , having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus , and the love to all the saints ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	16	do not cease giving thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of the glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the recognition of him ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	18	the eyes of your understanding being enlightened , for your knowing what is the hope of His calling , and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	19	and what the exceeding greatness of His power to us who are believing , according to the working of the power of His might ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	20	which He wrought in the Christ , having raised him out of the dead , and did set [ him ] at His right hand in the heavenly [ places ] ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	21	far above all principality , and authority , and might , and lordship , and every name named , not only in this age , but also in the coming one ;
YLT	Ephesians	1	22	and all things He did put under his feet , and did give him -- head over all things to the assembly ,
YLT	Ephesians	1	23	which is his body , the fulness of Him who is filling the all in all ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	2	in which once ye did walk according to the age of this world , according to the ruler of the authority of the air , of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	3	among whom also we all did walk once in the desires of our flesh , doing the wishes of the flesh and of the thoughts , and were by nature children of wrath -- as also the others ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	4	and God , being rich in kindness , because of His great love with which He loved us ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	5	even being dead in the trespasses , did make us to live together with the Christ , ( by grace ye are having been saved , )
YLT	Ephesians	2	6	and did raise [ us ] up together , and did seat [ us ] together in the heavenly [ places ] in Christ Jesus ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	7	that He might show , in the ages that are coming , the exceeding riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	8	for by grace ye are having been saved , through faith , and this not of you -- of God the gift ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	9	not of works , that no one may boast ;
YLT	Ephesians	2	10	for of Him we are workmanship , created in Christ Jesus to good works , which God did before prepare , that in them we may walk .
YLT	Ephesians	2	11	Wherefore , remember , that ye [ were ] once the nations in the flesh , who are called Uncircumcision by that called Circumcision in the flesh made by hands ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	12	that ye were at that time apart from Christ , having been alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers to the covenants of the promise , having no hope , and without God , in the world ;
YLT	Ephesians	2	13	and now , in Christ Jesus , ye being once afar off became nigh in the blood of the Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	14	for he is our peace , who did make both one , and the middle wall of the enclosure did break down ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	15	the enmity in his flesh , the law of the commands in ordinances having done away , that the two he might create in himself into one new man , making peace ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	16	and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross , having slain the enmity in it ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	17	and having come , he did proclaim good news -- peace to you -- the far-off and the nigh ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	18	because through him we have the access -- we both -- in one Spirit unto the Father .
YLT	Ephesians	2	19	Then , therefore , ye are no more strangers and foreigners , but fellow-citizens of the saints , and of the household of God ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	20	being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being chief corner- [ stone ] ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	21	in whom all the building fitly framed together doth increase to an holy sanctuary in the Lord ,
YLT	Ephesians	2	22	in whom also ye are builded together , for a habitation of God in the Spirit .
YLT	Ephesians	3	3	that by revelation He made known to me the secret , according as I wrote before in few [ words ] --
YLT	Ephesians	3	2	if , indeed , ye did hear of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given to me in regard to you ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	4	in regard to which ye are able , reading [ it ] , to understand my knowledge in the secret of the Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	5	which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men , as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit --
YLT	Ephesians	3	6	that the nations be fellow-heirs , and of the same body , and partakers of His promise in the Christ , through the good news ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	7	of which I became a ministrant , according to the gift of the grace of God that was given to me , according to the working of His power ;
YLT	Ephesians	3	8	to me -- the less than the least of all the saints -- was given this grace , among the nations to proclaim good news -- the untraceable riches of the Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	9	and to cause all to see what [ is ] the fellowship of the secret that hath been hid from the ages in God , who the all things did create by Jesus Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	10	that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly [ places ] , through the assembly , the manifold wisdom of God ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	11	according to a purpose of the ages , which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	13	wherefore , I ask [ you ] not to faint in my tribulations for you , which is your glory .
YLT	Ephesians	3	14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	15	of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	16	that He may give to you , according to the riches of His glory , with might to be strengthened through His Spirit , in regard to the inner man ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	17	that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts , in love having been rooted and founded ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	18	that ye may be in strength to comprehend , with all the saints , what [ is ] the breadth , and length , and depth , and height ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	19	to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding the knowledge , that ye may be filled -- to all the fulness of God ;
YLT	Ephesians	3	20	and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly what we ask or think , according to the power that is working in us ,
YLT	Ephesians	3	21	to Him [ is ] the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus , to all the generations of the age of the ages . Amen .
YLT	Ephesians	4	4	one body and one Spirit , according as also ye were called in one hope of your calling ;
YLT	Ephesians	4	2	with all lowliness and meekness , with long-suffering , forbearing one another in love ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	3	being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of the peace ;
YLT	Ephesians	4	5	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all , who [ is ] over all , and through all , and in you all ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	7	and to each one of you was given the grace , according to the measure of the gift of Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	8	wherefore , he saith , ` Having gone up on high he led captive captivity , and gave gifts to men , ' --
YLT	Ephesians	4	9	and that , he went up , what is it except that he also went down first to the lower parts of the earth ?
YLT	Ephesians	4	10	he who went down is the same also who went up far above all the heavens , that He may fill all things --
YLT	Ephesians	4	11	and He gave some [ as ] apostles , and some [ as ] prophets , and some [ as ] proclaimers of good news , and some [ as ] shepherds and teachers ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	12	unto the perfecting of the saints , for a work of ministration , for a building up of the body of the Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	13	till we may all come to the unity of the faith and of the recognition of the Son of God , to a perfect man , to a measure of stature of the fulness of the Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	14	that we may no more be babes , tossed and borne about by every wind of the teaching , in the sleight of men , in craftiness , unto the artifice of leading astray ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	15	and , being true in love , we may increase to Him [ in ] all things , who is the head -- the Christ ;
YLT	Ephesians	4	16	from whom the whole body , being fitly joined together and united , through the supply of every joint , according to the working in the measure of each single part , the increase of the body doth make for the building up of itself in love .
YLT	Ephesians	4	17	This , then , I say , and I testify in the Lord ; ye are no more to walk , as also the other nations walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	18	being darkened in the understanding , being alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardness of their heart ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	19	who , having ceased to feel , themselves did give up to the lasciviousness , for the working of all uncleanness in greediness ;
YLT	Ephesians	4	20	and ye did not so learn the Christ ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	21	if so be ye did hear him , and in him were taught , as truth is in Jesus ;
YLT	Ephesians	4	22	ye are to put off concerning the former behaviour the old man , that is corrupt according to the desires of the deceit ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	23	and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	24	and to put on the new man , which , according to God , was created in righteousness and kindness of the truth .
YLT	Ephesians	4	25	Wherefore , putting away the lying , speak truth each with his neighbour , because we are members one of another ;
YLT	Ephesians	4	26	be angry and do not sin ; let not the sun go down upon your wrath ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	27	neither give place to the devil ;
YLT	Ephesians	4	28	whoso is stealing let him no more steal , but rather let him labour , working the thing that is good with the hands , that he may have to impart to him having need .
YLT	Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt word out of your mouth go forth , but what is good unto the needful building up , that it may give grace to the hearers ;
YLT	Ephesians	4	30	and make not sorrowful the Holy Spirit of God , in which ye were sealed to a day of redemption .
YLT	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and evil-speaking , be put away from you , with all malice ,
YLT	Ephesians	4	32	and become one to another kind , tender-hearted , forgiving one another , according as also God in Christ did forgive you .
YLT	Ephesians	5	5	for this ye know , that every whoremonger , or unclean , or covetous person , who is an idolater , hath no inheritance in the reign of the Christ and God .
YLT	Ephesians	5	2	and walk in love , as also the Christ did love us , and did give himself for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour of a sweet smell ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	3	and whoredom , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not even be named among you , as becometh saints ;
YLT	Ephesians	5	4	also filthiness , and foolish talking , or jesting , -- the things not fit -- but rather thanksgiving ;
YLT	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with vain words , for because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	7	become not , then , partakers with them ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	8	for ye were once darkness , and now light in the Lord ; as children of light walk ye ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	9	for the fruit of the Spirit [ is ] in all goodness , and righteousness , and truth ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	10	proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	11	and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness and rather even convict ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	12	for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to speak of ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	13	and all the things reproved by the light are manifested , for everything that is manifested is light ;
YLT	Ephesians	5	14	wherefore he saith , ` Arouse thyself , thou who art sleeping , and arise out of the dead , and the Christ shall shine upon thee . '
YLT	Ephesians	5	15	See , then , how exactly ye walk , not as unwise , but as wise ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	16	redeeming the time , because the days are evil ;
YLT	Ephesians	5	17	because of this become not fools , but -- understanding what [ is ] the will of the Lord ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	18	and be not drunk with wine , in which is dissoluteness , but be filled in the Spirit ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	19	speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	20	giving thanks always for all things , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to the God and Father ;
YLT	Ephesians	5	21	subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God .
YLT	Ephesians	5	22	The wives ! to your own husbands subject yourselves , as to the Lord ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	23	because the husband is head of the wife , as also the Christ [ is ] head of the assembly , and he is saviour of the body ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	24	but even as the assembly is subject to Christ , so also [ are ] the wives to their own husbands in everything .
YLT	Ephesians	5	25	The husbands ! love your own wives , as also the Christ did love the assembly , and did give himself for it ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	26	that he might sanctify it , having cleansed [ it ] with the bathing of the water in the saying ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	27	that he might present it to himself the assembly in glory , not having spot or wrinkle , or any of such things , but that it may be holy and unblemished ;
YLT	Ephesians	5	28	so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies : he who is loving his own wife -- himself he doth love ;
YLT	Ephesians	5	29	for no one ever his own flesh did hate , but doth nourish and cherish it , as also the Lord -- the assembly ,
YLT	Ephesians	5	30	because members we are of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones ;
YLT	Ephesians	5	31	` for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined to his wife , and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh ; '
YLT	Ephesians	5	32	this secret is great , and I speak in regard to Christ and to the assembly ;
YLT	Ephesians	5	33	but ye also , every one in particular -- let each his own wife so love as himself , and the wife -- that she may reverence the husband .
YLT	Ephesians	6	6	not with eye-service as men-pleasers , but as servants of the Christ , doing the will of God out of soul ,
YLT	Ephesians	6	2	honour thy father and mother ,
YLT	Ephesians	6	3	which is the first command with a promise , ` That it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live a long time upon the land . '
YLT	Ephesians	6	4	And the fathers ! provoke not your children , but nourish them in the instruction and admonition of the Lord .
YLT	Ephesians	6	5	The servants ! obey the masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling , in the simplicity of your heart , as to the Christ ;
YLT	Ephesians	6	7	with good-will serving , as to the Lord , and not to men ,
YLT	Ephesians	6	8	having known that whatever good thing each one may do , this he shall receive from the Lord , whether servant or freeman .
YLT	Ephesians	6	9	And the masters ! the same things do ye unto them , letting threatening alone , having known that also your Master is in the heavens , and acceptance of persons is not with him .
YLT	Ephesians	6	10	As to the rest , my brethren , be strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might ;
YLT	Ephesians	6	11	put on the whole armour of God , for your being able to stand against the wiles of the devil ,
YLT	Ephesians	6	12	because we have not the wrestling with blood and flesh , but with the principalities , with the authorities , with the world-rulers of the darkness of this age , with the spiritual things of the evil in the heavenly places ;
YLT	Ephesians	6	13	because of this take ye up the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to resist in the day of the evil , and all things having done -- to stand .
YLT	Ephesians	6	14	Stand , therefore , having your loins girt about in truth , and having put on the breastplate of the righteousness ,
YLT	Ephesians	6	15	and having the feet shod in the preparation of the good-news of the peace ;
YLT	Ephesians	6	16	above all , having taken up the shield of the faith , in which ye shall be able all the fiery darts of the evil one to quench ,
YLT	Ephesians	6	17	and the helmet of the salvation receive , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the saying of God ,
YLT	Ephesians	6	18	through all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the Spirit , and in regard to this same , watching in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints --
YLT	Ephesians	6	19	and in behalf of me , that to me may be given a word in the opening of my mouth , in freedom , to make known the secret of the good news ,
YLT	Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in a chain , that in it I may speak freely -- as it behoveth me to speak .
YLT	Ephesians	6	21	And that ye may know -- ye also -- the things concerning me -- what I do , all things make known to you shall Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful ministrant in the Lord ,
YLT	Ephesians	6	22	whom I did send unto you for this very thing , that ye might know the things concerning us , and that he might comfort your hearts .
YLT	Ephesians	6	23	Peace to the brethren , and love , with faith , from God the Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ !
YLT	Ephesians	6	24	The grace with all those loving our Lord Jesus Christ -- undecayingly ! Amen .
YLT	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timotheus , servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi , with overseers and ministrants ;
YLT	Philippians	1	2	Grace to you , and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
YLT	Philippians	1	3	I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you ,
YLT	Philippians	1	4	always , in every supplication of mine for you all , with joy making the supplication ,
YLT	Philippians	1	5	for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now ,
YLT	Philippians	1	6	having been confident of this very thing , that He who did begin in you a good work , will perform [ it ] till a day of Jesus Christ ,
YLT	Philippians	1	7	according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all , because of my having you in the heart , both in my bonds , and [ in ] the defence and confirmation of the good news , all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace .
YLT	Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness , how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ ,
YLT	Philippians	1	9	and this I pray , that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge , and all judgment ,
YLT	Philippians	1	10	for your proving the things that differ , that ye may be pure and offenceless -- to a day of Christ ,
YLT	Philippians	1	11	being filled with the fruit of righteousness , that [ is ] through Jesus Christ , to the glory and praise of God .
YLT	Philippians	1	12	And I wish you to know , brethren , that the things concerning me , rather to an advancement of the good news have come ,
YLT	Philippians	1	13	so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium , and to the other places -- all ,
YLT	Philippians	1	14	and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord , having confidence by my bonds , are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly to speak the word .
YLT	Philippians	1	15	Certain , indeed , even through envy and contention , and certain also through good-will , do preach the Christ ;
YLT	Philippians	1	16	the one , indeed , of rivalry the Christ do proclaim , not purely , supposing to add affliction to my bonds ,
YLT	Philippians	1	17	and the other out of love , having known that for defence of the good news I am set :
YLT	Philippians	1	18	what then ? in every way , whether in pretence or in truth , Christ is proclaimed -- and in this I rejoice , yea , and shall rejoice .
YLT	Philippians	1	19	For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation , through your supplication , and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus ,
YLT	Philippians	1	20	according to my earnest expectation and hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , and in all freedom , as always , also now Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether through life or through death ,
YLT	Philippians	1	21	for to me to live [ is ] Christ , and to die gain .
YLT	Philippians	1	22	And if to live in the flesh [ is ] to me a fruit of work , then what shall I choose ? I know not ;
YLT	Philippians	1	23	for I am pressed by the two , having the desire to depart , and to be with Christ , for it is far better ,
YLT	Philippians	1	24	and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account ,
YLT	Philippians	1	25	and of this being persuaded , I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all , to your advancement and joy of the faith ,
YLT	Philippians	1	26	that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you .
YLT	Philippians	1	27	Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye yourselves , that , whether having come and seen you , whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one soul , striving together for the faith of the good news ,
YLT	Philippians	1	28	and not terrified in anything by those opposing , which to them indeed is a token of destruction , and to you of salvation , and that from God ;
YLT	Philippians	1	29	because to you it was granted , on behalf of Christ , not only to believe in him , but also on behalf of him to suffer ;
YLT	Philippians	1	30	the same conflict having , such as ye saw in me , and now hear of in me .
YLT	Philippians	2	2	fulfil ye my joy , that ye may mind the same thing -- having the same love -- of one soul -- minding the one thing ,
YLT	Philippians	2	3	nothing in rivalry or vain-glory , but in humility of mind one another counting more excellent than yourselves --
YLT	Philippians	2	4	each not to your own look ye , but each also to the things of others .
YLT	Philippians	2	5	For , let this mind be in you that [ is ] also in Christ Jesus ,
YLT	Philippians	2	6	who , being in the form of God , thought [ it ] not robbery to be equal to God ,
YLT	Philippians	2	7	but did empty himself , the form of a servant having taken , in the likeness of men having been made ,
YLT	Philippians	2	8	and in fashion having been found as a man , he humbled himself , having become obedient unto death -- death even of a cross ,
YLT	Philippians	2	9	wherefore , also , God did highly exalt him , and gave to him a name that [ is ] above every name ,
YLT	Philippians	2	10	that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow -- of heavenlies , and earthlies , and what are under the earth --
YLT	Philippians	2	11	and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ [ is ] Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
YLT	Philippians	2	12	So that , my beloved , as ye always obey , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , with fear and trembling your own salvation work out ,
YLT	Philippians	2	13	for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure .
YLT	Philippians	2	14	All things do without murmurings and reasonings ,
YLT	Philippians	2	15	that ye may become blameless and harmless , children of God , unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse , among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world ,
YLT	Philippians	2	16	the word of life holding forth , for rejoicing to me in regard to a day of Christ , that not in vain did I run , nor in vain did I labour ;
YLT	Philippians	2	17	but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice and joy with you all ,
YLT	Philippians	2	18	because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me .
YLT	Philippians	2	19	And I hope , in the Lord Jesus , Timotheus to send quickly to you , that I also may be of good spirit , having known the things concerning you ,
YLT	Philippians	2	20	for I have no one like-minded , who sincerely for the things concerning you will care ,
YLT	Philippians	2	21	for the whole seek their own things , not the things of the Christ Jesus ,
YLT	Philippians	2	22	and the proof of him ye know , that as a child [ serveth ] a father , with me he did serve in regard to the good news ;
YLT	Philippians	2	23	him , indeed , therefore , I hope to send , when I may see through the things concerning me -- immediately ;
YLT	Philippians	2	24	and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come .
YLT	Philippians	2	25	And I thought [ it ] necessary Epaphroditus -- my brother , and fellow-workman , and fellow-soldier , and your apostle and servant to my need -- to send unto you ,
YLT	Philippians	2	26	seeing he was longing after you all , and in heaviness , because ye heard that he ailed ,
YLT	Philippians	2	27	for he also ailed nigh to death , but God did deal kindly with him , and not with him only , but also with me , that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have .
YLT	Philippians	2	28	The more eagerly , therefore , I did send him , that having seen him again ye may rejoice , and I may be the less sorrowful ;
YLT	Philippians	2	29	receive him , therefore , in the Lord , with all joy , and hold such in honour ,
YLT	Philippians	2	30	because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death , having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me .
YLT	Philippians	3	3	for we are the circumcision , who by the Spirit are serving God , and glorying in Christ Jesus , and in flesh having no trust ,
YLT	Philippians	3	2	look to the dogs , look to the evil-workers , look to the concision ;
YLT	Philippians	3	4	though I also have [ cause of ] trust in flesh . If any other one doth think to have trust in flesh , I more ;
YLT	Philippians	3	5	circumcision on the eighth day ! of the race of Israel ! of the tribe of Benjamin ! a Hebrew of Hebrews ! according to law a Pharisee !
YLT	Philippians	3	6	according to zeal persecuting the assembly ! according to righteousness that is in law becoming blameless !
YLT	Philippians	3	7	But what things were to me gains , these I have counted , because of the Christ , loss ;
YLT	Philippians	3	8	yes , indeed , and I count all things to be loss , because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord , because of whom of the all things I suffered loss , and do count them to be refuse , that Christ I may gain , and be found in him ,
YLT	Philippians	3	9	not having my righteousness , which [ is ] of law , but that which [ is ] through faith of Christ -- the righteousness that is of God by the faith ,
YLT	Philippians	3	10	to know him , and the power of his rising again , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being conformed to his death ,
YLT	Philippians	3	11	if anyhow I may attain to the rising again of the dead .
YLT	Philippians	3	12	Not that I did already obtain , or have been already perfected ; but I pursue , if also I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by the Christ Jesus ;
YLT	Philippians	3	13	brethren , I do not reckon myself to have laid hold ; and one thing -- the things behind indeed forgetting , and to the things before stretching forth --
YLT	Philippians	3	14	to the mark I pursue for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus .
YLT	Philippians	3	15	As many , therefore , as [ are ] perfect -- let us think this , and if [ in ] anything ye think otherwise , this also shall God reveal to you ,
YLT	Philippians	3	16	but to what we have come -- by the same rule walk , the same thing think ;
YLT	Philippians	3	17	become followers together of me , brethren , and observe those thus walking , according as ye have us -- a pattern ;
YLT	Philippians	3	18	for many walk of whom many times I told you -- and now also weeping tell -- the enemies of the cross of the Christ !
YLT	Philippians	3	19	whose end [ is ] destruction , whose god [ is ] the belly , and whose glory [ is ] in their shame , who the things on earth are minding .
YLT	Philippians	3	20	For our citizenship is in the heavens , whence also a Saviour we await -- the Lord Jesus Christ --
YLT	Philippians	3	21	who shall transform the body of our humiliation to its becoming conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working of his power , even to subject to himself the all things .
YLT	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always ; again I will say , rejoice ;
YLT	Philippians	4	2	Euodia I exhort , and Syntyche I exhort , to be of the same mind in the Lord ;
YLT	Philippians	4	3	and I ask also thee , genuine yoke-fellow , be assisting those women who in the good news did strive along with me , with Clement also , and the others , my fellow-workers , whose names [ are ] in the book of life .
YLT	Philippians	4	5	let your forbearance be known to all men ; the Lord [ is ] near ;
YLT	Philippians	4	6	for nothing be anxious , but in everything by prayer , and by supplication , with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known unto God ;
YLT	Philippians	4	7	and the peace of God , that is surpassing all understanding , shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus .
YLT	Philippians	4	8	As to the rest , brethren , as many things as are true , as many as [ are ] grave , as many as [ are ] righteous , as many as [ are ] pure , as many as [ are ] lovely , as many as [ are ] of good report , if any worthiness , and if any praise , these things think upon ;
YLT	Philippians	4	9	the things that also ye did learn , and receive , and hear , and saw in me , those do , and the God of the peace shall be with you .
YLT	Philippians	4	10	And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at length ye flourished again in caring for me , for which also ye were caring , and lacked opportunity ;
YLT	Philippians	4	11	not that in respect of want I say [ it ] , for I did learn in the things in which I am -- to be content ;
YLT	Philippians	4	12	I have known both to be abased , and I have known to abound ; in everything and in all things I have been initiated , both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to be in want .
YLT	Philippians	4	13	For all things I have strength , in Christ 's strengthening me ;
YLT	Philippians	4	14	but ye did well , having communicated with my tribulation ;
YLT	Philippians	4	15	and ye have known , even ye Philippians , that in the beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia , no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and receiving except ye only ;
YLT	Philippians	4	16	because also in Thessalonica , both once and again to my need ye sent ;
YLT	Philippians	4	17	not that I seek after the gift , but I seek after the fruit that is overflowing to your account ;
YLT	Philippians	4	18	and I have all things , and abound ; I am filled , having received from Epaphroditus the things from you -- an odour of a sweet smell -- a sacrifice acceptable , well-pleasing to God :
YLT	Philippians	4	19	and my God shall supply all your need , according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus ;
YLT	Philippians	4	20	and to God , even our Father , [ is ] the glory -- to the ages of the ages . Amen .
YLT	Philippians	4	21	Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus ; there salute you the brethren with me ;
YLT	Philippians	4	22	there salute you all the saints , and specially those of Caesar 's house ;
YLT	Philippians	4	23	the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ is ] with you all . Amen .
YLT	Colossians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , and Timotheus the brother ,
YLT	Colossians	1	2	to the saints in Colossae , and to the faithful brethren in Christ : Grace to you , and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ !
YLT	Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , always praying for you ,
YLT	Colossians	1	4	having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love that [ is ] to all the saints ,
YLT	Colossians	1	5	because of the hope that is laid up for you in the heavens , which ye heard of before in the word of the truth of the good news ,
YLT	Colossians	1	6	which is present to you , as also in all the world , and is bearing fruit , as also in you , from the day in which ye heard , and knew the grace of God in truth ;
YLT	Colossians	1	7	as ye also learned from Epaphras , our beloved fellow-servant , who is for you a faithful ministrant of the Christ ,
YLT	Colossians	1	8	who also did declare to us your love in the Spirit .
YLT	Colossians	1	9	Because of this , we also , from the day in which we heard , do not cease praying for you , and asking that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ,
YLT	Colossians	1	10	to your walking worthily of the Lord to all pleasing , in every good work being fruitful , and increasing to the knowledge of God ,
YLT	Colossians	1	11	in all might being made mighty according to the power of His glory , to all endurance and long-suffering with joy .
YLT	Colossians	1	12	Giving thanks to the Father who did make us meet for the participation of the inheritance of the saints in the light ,
YLT	Colossians	1	13	who did rescue us out of the authority of the darkness , and did translate [ us ] into the reign of the Son of His love ,
YLT	Colossians	1	14	in whom we have the redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of the sins ,
YLT	Colossians	1	15	who is the image of the invisible God , first-born of all creation ,
YLT	Colossians	1	16	because in him were the all things created , those in the heavens , and those upon the earth , those visible , and those invisible , whether thrones , whether lordships , whether principalities , whether authorities ; all things through him , and for him , have been created ,
YLT	Colossians	1	17	and himself is before all , and the all things in him have consisted .
YLT	Colossians	1	18	And himself is the head of the body -- the assembly -- who is a beginning , a first-born out of the dead , that he might become in all [ things ] -- himself -- first ,
YLT	Colossians	1	19	because in him it did please all the fulness to tabernacle ,
YLT	Colossians	1	20	and through him to reconcile the all things to himself -- having made peace through the blood of his cross -- through him , whether the things upon the earth , whether the things in the heavens .
YLT	Colossians	1	21	And you -- once being alienated , and enemies in the mind , in the evil works , yet now did he reconcile ,
YLT	Colossians	1	22	in the body of his flesh through the death , to present you holy , and unblemished , and unblameable before himself ,
YLT	Colossians	1	23	if also ye remain in the faith , being founded and settled , and not moved away from the hope of the good news , which ye heard , which was preached in all the creation that [ is ] under the heaven , of which I became -- I Paul -- a ministrant .
YLT	Colossians	1	24	I now rejoice in my sufferings for you , and do fill up the things lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh for his body , which is the assembly ,
YLT	Colossians	1	25	of which I -- I did become a ministrant according to the dispensation of God , that was given to me for you , to fulfil the word of God ,
YLT	Colossians	1	26	the secret that hath been hid from the ages and from the generations , but now was manifested to his saints ,
YLT	Colossians	1	27	to whom God did will to make known what [ is ] the riches of the glory of this secret among the nations -- which is Christ in you , the hope of the glory ,
YLT	Colossians	1	28	whom we proclaim , warning every man , and teaching every man , in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus ,
YLT	Colossians	1	29	for which also I labour , striving according to his working that is working in me in power .
YLT	Colossians	2	2	that their hearts may be comforted , being united in love , and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding , to the full knowledge of the secret of the God and Father , and of the Christ ,
YLT	Colossians	2	3	in whom are all the treasures of the wisdom and the knowledge hid ,
YLT	Colossians	2	4	and this I say , that no one may beguile you in enticing words ,
YLT	Colossians	2	5	for if even in the flesh I am absent -- yet in the spirit I am with you , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in regard to Christ ;
YLT	Colossians	2	6	as , then , ye did receive Christ Jesus the Lord , in him walk ye ,
YLT	Colossians	2	7	being rooted and built up in him , and confirmed in the faith , as ye were taught -- abounding in it in thanksgiving .
YLT	Colossians	2	8	See that no one shall be carrying you away as spoil through the philosophy and vain deceit , according to the deliverance of men , according to the rudiments of the world , and not according to Christ ,
YLT	Colossians	2	9	because in him doth tabernacle all the fulness of the Godhead bodily ,
YLT	Colossians	2	10	and ye are in him made full , who is the head of all principality and authority ,
YLT	Colossians	2	11	in whom also ye were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of the Christ ,
YLT	Colossians	2	12	being buried with him in the baptism , in which also ye rose with [ him ] through the faith of the working of God , who did raise him out of the dead .
YLT	Colossians	2	13	And you -- being dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh -- He made alive together with him , having forgiven you all the trespasses ,
YLT	Colossians	2	14	having blotted out the handwriting in the ordinances that is against us , that was contrary to us , and he hath taken it out of the way , having nailed it to the cross ;
YLT	Colossians	2	15	having stripped the principalities and the authorities , he made a shew of them openly -- having triumphed over them in it .
YLT	Colossians	2	16	Let no one , then , judge you in eating or in drinking , or in respect of a feast , or of a new moon , or of sabbaths ,
YLT	Colossians	2	17	which are a shadow of the coming things , and the body [ is ] of the Christ ;
YLT	Colossians	2	18	let no one beguile you of your prize , delighting in humble-mindedness and [ in ] worship of the messengers , intruding into the things he hath not seen , being vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh ,
YLT	Colossians	2	19	and not holding the head , from which all the body -- through the joints and bands gathering supply , and being knit together -- may increase with the increase of God .
YLT	Colossians	2	20	If , then , ye did die with the Christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as living in the world , are ye subject to ordinances ?
YLT	Colossians	2	21	-- thou mayest not touch , nor taste , nor handle --
YLT	Colossians	2	22	which are all for destruction with the using , after the commands and teachings of men ,
YLT	Colossians	2	23	which are , indeed , having a matter of wisdom in will-worship , and humble-mindedness , and neglecting of body -- not in any honour , unto a satisfying of the flesh .
YLT	Colossians	3	3	for ye did die , and your life hath been hid with the Christ in God ;
YLT	Colossians	3	2	the things above mind ye , not the things upon the earth ,
YLT	Colossians	3	4	when the Christ -- our life -- may be manifested , then also we with him shall be manifested in glory .
YLT	Colossians	3	5	Put to death , then , your members that [ are ] upon the earth -- whoredom , uncleanness , passion , evil desire , and the covetousness , which is idolatry --
YLT	Colossians	3	6	because of which things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience ,
YLT	Colossians	3	7	in which also ye -- ye did walk once , when ye lived in them ;
YLT	Colossians	3	8	but now put off , even ye , the whole -- anger , wrath , malice , evil-speaking , filthy talking -- out of your mouth .
YLT	Colossians	3	9	Lie not one to another , having put off the old man with his practices ,
YLT	Colossians	3	10	and having put on the new , which is renewed in regard to knowledge , after the image of Him who did create him ;
YLT	Colossians	3	11	where there is not Greek and Jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , foreigner , Scythian , servant , freeman -- but the all and in all -- Christ .
YLT	Colossians	3	12	Put on , therefore , as choice ones of God , holy and beloved , bowels of mercies , kindness , humble-mindedness , meekness , long-suffering ,
YLT	Colossians	3	13	forbearing one another , and forgiving each other , if any one with any one may have a quarrel , as also the Christ did forgive you -- so also ye ;
YLT	Colossians	3	14	and above all these things , [ have ] love , which is a bond of the perfection ,
YLT	Colossians	3	15	and let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to which also ye were called in one body , and become thankful .
YLT	Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly , in all wisdom , teaching and admonishing each other , in psalms , and hymns , and spiritual songs , in grace singing in your hearts to the Lord ;
YLT	Colossians	3	17	and all , whatever ye may do in word or in work , [ do ] all things in the name of the Lord Jesus -- giving thanks to the God and Father , through him .
YLT	Colossians	3	18	The wives ! be subject to your own husbands , as is fit in the Lord ;
YLT	Colossians	3	19	the husbands ! love your wives , and be not bitter with them ;
YLT	Colossians	3	20	the children ! obey the parents in all things , for this is well-pleasing to the Lord ;
YLT	Colossians	3	21	the fathers ! vex not your children , lest they be discouraged .
YLT	Colossians	3	22	The servants ! obey in all things those who are masters according to the flesh , not in eye-service as men-pleasers , but in simplicity of heart , fearing God ;
YLT	Colossians	3	23	and all , whatever ye may do -- out of soul work -- as to the Lord , and not to men ,
YLT	Colossians	3	24	having known that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance -- for the Lord Christ ye serve ;
YLT	Colossians	3	25	and he who is doing unrighteously shall receive what he did unrighteously , and there is no acceptance of persons .
YLT	Colossians	4	4	that I may manifest it , as it behoveth me to speak ;
YLT	Colossians	4	2	In the prayer continue ye , watching in it in thanksgiving ;
YLT	Colossians	4	3	praying at the same time also for us , that God may open to us a door for the word , to speak the secret of the Christ , because of which also I have been bound ,
YLT	Colossians	4	5	in wisdom walk ye toward those without , the time forestalling ;
YLT	Colossians	4	6	your word always in grace -- with salt being seasoned -- to know how it behoveth you to answer each one .
YLT	Colossians	4	7	All the things concerning me make known to you shall Tychicus -- the beloved brother , and faithful ministrant , and fellow-servant in the Lord --
YLT	Colossians	4	8	whom I did send unto you for this very thing , that he might know the things concerning you , and might comfort your hearts ,
YLT	Colossians	4	9	with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother , who is of you ; all things to you shall they make known that [ are ] here .
YLT	Colossians	4	10	Salute you doth Aristarchus , my fellow-captive , and Marcus , the nephew of Barnabas , ( concerning whom ye did receive commands -- if he may come unto you receive him , )
YLT	Colossians	4	11	and Jesus who is called Justus , who are of the circumcision : these only [ are ] fellow-workers for the reign of God who did become a comfort to me .
YLT	Colossians	4	12	Salute you doth Epaphras , who [ is ] of you , a servant of Christ , always striving for you in the prayers , that ye may stand perfect and made full in all the will of God ,
YLT	Colossians	4	13	for I do testify to him , that he hath much zeal for you , and those in Laodicea , and those in Hierapolis .
YLT	Colossians	4	14	Salute you doth Lukas , the beloved physician , and Demas ;
YLT	Colossians	4	15	salute ye those in Laodicea -- brethren , and Nymphas , and the assembly in his house ;
YLT	Colossians	4	16	and when the epistle may be read with you , cause that also in the assembly of the Laodiceans it may be read , and the [ epistle ] from Laodicea that ye also may read ;
YLT	Colossians	4	17	and say to Archippus , ` See to the ministration that thou didst receive in the Lord , that thou mayest fulfil it . '
YLT	Colossians	4	18	The salutation by the hand of me , Paul ; remember my bonds ; the grace [ is ] with you . Amen .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ !
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	2	We give thanks to God always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	3	unceasingly remembering of you the work of the faith , and the labour of the love , and the endurance of the hope , of our Lord Jesus Christ , in the presence of our God and Father ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	having known , brethren beloved , by God , your election ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	because our good news did not come to you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spirit , and in much assurance , even as ye have known of what sort we became among you because of you ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	and ye -- ye did become imitators of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much tribulation , with joy of the Holy Spirit ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	so that ye became patterns to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	for from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith toward God did go forth , so that we have no need to say anything ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	for they themselves concerning us do declare what entrance we had unto you , and how ye did turn unto God from the idols , to serve a living and true God ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	1	10	and to wait for His Son from the heavens , whom He did raise out of the dead -- Jesus , who is rescuing us from the anger that is coming .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	1	Thessalonians
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	but having both suffered before , and having been injuriously treated ( as ye have known ) in Philippi , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the good news of God in much conflict ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	for our exhortation [ is ] not out of deceit , nor out of uncleanness , nor in guile ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news , so we speak , not as pleasing men , but God , who is proving our hearts ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	for at no time did we come with speech of flattery , ( as ye have known , ) nor in a pretext for covetousness , ( God [ is ] witness ! )
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	nor seeking of men glory , neither from you nor from others , being able to be burdensome , as Christ 's apostles .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	But we became gentle in your midst , as a nurse may cherish her own children ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	so being desirous of you , we are well-pleased to impart to you not only the good news of God , but also our own souls , because beloved ye have become to us ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	for ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail , for , night and day working not to be a burden upon any of you , we did preach to you the good news of God ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	ye [ are ] witnesses -- God also -- how kindly and righteously , and blamelessly to you who believe we became ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	even as ye have known , how each one of you , as a father his own children , we are exhorting you , and comforting , and testifying ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	for your walking worthily of God , who is calling you to His own reign and glory .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	Because of this also , we -- we do give thanks to God continually , that , having received the word of hearing from us of God , ye accepted , not the word of man , but as it is truly , the word of God , who also doth work in you who believe ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	for ye became imitators , brethren , of the assemblies of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus , because such things ye suffered , even ye , from your own countrymen , as also they from the Jews ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	who did both put to death the Lord Jesus and their own prophets , and did persecute us , and God they are not pleasing , and to all men [ are ] contrary ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved , to fill up their sins always , but the anger did come upon them -- to the end !
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	And we , brethren , having been taken from you for the space of an hour -- in presence , not in heart -- did hasten the more abundantly to see your face in much desire ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	wherefore we wished to come unto you , ( I indeed Paul , ) both once and again , and the Adversary did hinder us ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	for what [ is ] our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? are not even ye before our Lord Jesus Christ in his presence ?
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	for ye are our glory and joy .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	1	Thessalonians
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	that no one be moved in these tribulations , for yourselves have known that for this we are set ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	and did send Timotheus -- our brother , and a ministrant of God , and our fellow-workman in the good news of the Christ -- to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	for even when we were with you , we said to you beforehand , that we are about to suffer tribulation , as also it did come to pass , and ye have known [ it ] ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	because of this also , I , no longer forbearing , did send to know your faith , lest he who is tempting did tempt you , and in vain might be our labour .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	And now Timotheus having come unto us from you , and having declared good news to us of your faith and love , and that ye have a good remembrance of us always , desiring much to see us , as we also [ to see ] you ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	because of this we were comforted , brethren , over you , in all our tribulation and necessity , through your faith ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	because now we live , if ye may stand fast in the Lord ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	for what thanks are we able to recompense to God for you , for all the joy with which we do joy because of you in the presence of our God ?
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	night and day exceedingly beseeching , that we might see your face , and perfect the things lacking in your faith .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	And our God and Father Himself , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way unto you ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	and you the Lord cause to increase and to abound in the love to one another , and to all , even as we also to you ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	3	13	to the establishing your hearts blameless in sanctification before our God and Father , in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	1	Thessalonians
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	4	that each of you know his own vessel to possess in sanctification and honour ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	for ye have known what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	for this is the will of God -- your sanctification ; that ye abstain from the whoredom ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	not in the affection of desire , as also the nations that were not knowing God ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	that no one go beyond and defraud in the matter his brother , because an avenger [ is ] the Lord of all these , as also we spake before to you and testified ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	for God did not call us on uncleanness , but in sanctification ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	he , therefore , who is despising -- doth not despise man , but God , who also did give His Holy Spirit to us .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	And concerning the brotherly love , ye have no need of [ my ] writing to you , for ye yourselves are God-taught to love one another ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	for ye do it also to all the brethren who [ are ] in all Macedonia ; and we call upon you , brethren , to abound still more ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	and to study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we did command you ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	that ye may walk becomingly unto those without , and may have lack of nothing .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	And I do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning those who have fallen asleep , that ye may not sorrow , as also the rest who have not hope ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , so also God those asleep through Jesus he will bring with him ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	for this to you we say in the word of the Lord , that we who are living -- who do remain over to the presence of the Lord -- may not precede those asleep ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	because the Lord himself , in a shout , in the voice of a chief-messenger , and in the trump of God , shall come down from heaven , and the dead in Christ shall rise first ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	then we who are living , who are remaining over , together with them shall be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in air , and so always with the Lord we shall be ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	so , then , comfort ye one another in these words .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	1	Thessalonians
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	5	all ye are sons of light , and sons of day ; we are not of night , nor of darkness ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	for when they may say , Peace and surety , then sudden destruction doth stand by them , as the travail [ doth ] her who is with child , and they shall not escape ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	and ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that the day may catch you as a thief ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	so , then , we may not sleep as also the others , but watch and be sober ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	for those sleeping , by night do sleep , and those making themselves drunk , by night are drunken ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	and we , being of the day -- let us be sober , putting on a breastplate of faith and love , and an helmet -- a hope of salvation ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	because God did not appoint us to anger , but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	who did die for us , that whether we wake -- whether we sleep -- together with him we may live ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	11	wherefore , comfort ye one another , and build ye up , one the one , as also ye do .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	And we ask you , brethren , to know those labouring among you , and leading you in the Lord , and admonishing you ,
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	13	and to esteem them very abundantly in love , because of their work ; be at peace among yourselves ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	14	and we exhort you , brethren , admonish the disorderly , comfort the feeble-minded , support the infirm , be patient unto all ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	15	see no one evil for evil may render to any one , but always that which is good pursue ye , both to one another and to all ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	16	always rejoice ye ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	17	continually pray ye ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	18	in every thing give thanks , for this [ is ] the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	19	The Spirit quench not ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	20	prophesyings despise not ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	21	all things prove ; that which is good hold fast ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	22	from all appearance of evil abstain ye ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	23	and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly , and may your whole spirit , and soul , and body , be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	24	stedfast is He who is calling you , who also will do [ it ] .
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren , pray for us ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	26	salute all the brethren in an holy kiss ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	27	I charge you [ by ] the Lord , that the letter be read to all the holy brethren ;
YLT	1%20Thessalonians	5	28	the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ is ] with you ! Amen .
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	2	Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ !
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ :
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We ought to give thanks to God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because increase greatly doth your faith , and abound doth the love of each one of you all , to one another ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	so that we ourselves do glory in you in the assemblies of God , for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye bear ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	a token of the righteous judgment of God , for your being counted worthy of the reign of God , for which also ye suffer ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	since [ it is ] a righteous thing with God to give back to those troubling you -- trouble ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and to you who are troubled -- rest with us in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven , with messengers of his power ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	in flaming fire , giving vengeance to those not knowing God , and to those not obeying the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	who shall suffer justice -- destruction age-during -- from the face of the Lord , and from the glory of his strength ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	when He may come to be glorified in his saints , and to be wondered at in all those believing -- because our testimony was believed among you -- in that day ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	for which also we do pray always for you , that our God may count you worthy of the calling , and may fulfil all the good pleasure of goodness , and the work of the faith in power ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you , and ye in him , according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ .
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	2	that ye be not quickly shaken in mind , nor be troubled , neither through spirit , neither through word , neither through letters as through us , as that the day of Christ hath arrived ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	let not any one deceive you in any manner , because -- if the falling away may not come first , and the man of sin be revealed -- the son of the destruction ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	who is opposing and is raising himself up above all called God or worshipped , so that he in the sanctuary of God as God hath sat down , shewing himself off that he is God -- [ the day doth not come ] .
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Do ye not remember that , being yet with you , these things I said to you ?
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	and now , what is keeping down ye have known , for his being revealed in his own time ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	for the secret of the lawlessness doth already work , only he who is keeping down now [ will hinder ] -- till he may be out of the way ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	and then shall be revealed the Lawless One , whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth , and shall destroy with the manifestation of his presence ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	[ him , ] whose presence is according to the working of the Adversary , in all power , and signs , and lying wonders ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	and in all deceitfulness of the unrighteousness in those perishing , because the love of the truth they did not receive for their being saved ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	and because of this shall God send to them a working of delusion , for their believing the lie ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	that they may be judged -- all who did not believe the truth , but were well pleased in the unrighteousness .
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	And we -- we ought to give thanks to God always for you , brethren , beloved by the Lord , that God did choose you from the beginning to salvation , in sanctification of the Spirit , and belief of the truth ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	to which He did call you through our good news , to the acquiring of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	so , then , brethren , stand ye fast , and hold the deliverances that ye were taught , whether through word , whether through our letter ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	and may our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and our God and Father , who did love us , and did give comfort age-during , and good hope in grace ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	2	17	comfort your hearts , and establish you in every good word and work .
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	2	and that we may be delivered from the unreasonable and evil men , for the faith [ is ] not of all ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	and stedfast is the Lord , who shall establish you , and shall guard [ you ] from the evil ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	and we have confidence in the Lord touching you , that the things that we command you ye both do and will do ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	and the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God , and to the endurance of the Christ .
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	And we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to withdraw yourselves from every brother disorderly walking , and not after the deliverance that ye received from us ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	for yourselves have known how it behoveth [ you ] to imitate us , because we did not act disorderly among you ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	nor for nought did we eat bread of any one , but in labour and in travail , night and day working , not to be chargeable to any of you ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	not because we have not authority , but that ourselves a pattern we might give to you , to imitate us ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	for even when we were with you , this we did command you , that if any one is not willing to work , neither let him eat ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	for we hear of certain walking among you disorderly , nothing working , but over working ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	and such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness working , their own bread they may eat ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	and ye , brethren , may ye not be weary doing well ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	and if any one do not obey our word through the letter , this one note ye , and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed ,
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	and as an enemy count [ him ] not , but admonish ye [ him ] as a brother ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	and may the Lord of the peace Himself give to you the peace always in every way ; the Lord [ is ] with you all !
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	17	The salutation by the hand of me , Paul , which is a sign in every letter ; thus I write ;
YLT	2%20Thessalonians	3	18	the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ is ] with you all ! Amen .
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to a command of God our Saviour , and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	2	to Timotheus -- genuine child in faith : Grace , kindness , peace , from God our Father , and Christ Jesus our Lord ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	3	according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus -- I going on to Macedonia -- that thou mightest charge certain not to teach any other thing ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	4	nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies , that cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in faith : --
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	5	And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart , and of a good conscience , and of faith unfeigned ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	6	from which certain , having swerved , did turn aside to vain discourse ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	7	willing to be teachers of law , not understanding either the things they say , nor concerning what they asseverate ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	8	and we have known that the law [ is ] good , if any one may use it lawfully ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	9	having known this , that for a righteous man law is not set , but for lawless and insubordinate persons , ungodly and sinners , impious and profane , parricides and matricides , men-slayers ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	10	whoremongers , sodomites , men-stealers , liars , perjured persons , and if there be any other thing that to sound doctrine is adverse ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	11	according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God , with which I was entrusted .
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	12	And I give thanks to him who enabled me -- Christ Jesus our Lord -- that he did reckon me stedfast , having put [ me ] to the ministration ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	13	who before was speaking evil , and persecuting , and insulting , but I found kindness , because , being ignorant , I did [ it ] in unbelief ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	14	and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord , with faith and love that [ is ] in Christ Jesus :
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	15	stedfast [ is ] the word , and of all acceptation worthy , that Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners -- first of whom I am ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	16	but because of this I found kindness , that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering , for a pattern of those about to believe on him to life age-during :
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	17	and to the King of the ages , the incorruptible , invisible , only wise God , [ is ] honour and glory -- to the ages of the ages ! Amen .
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit to thee , child Timotheus , according to the prophesies that went before upon thee , that thou mayest war in them the good warfare ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	19	having faith and a good conscience , which certain having thrust away , concerning the faith did make shipwreck ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	1	20	of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I did deliver to the Adversary , that they might be instructed not to speak evil .
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	2	for kings , and all who are in authority , that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	3	for this [ is ] right and acceptable before God our Saviour ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	4	who doth will all men to be saved , and to come to the full knowledge of the truth ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	5	for one [ is ] God , one also [ is ] mediator of God and of men , the man Christ Jesus ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	6	who did give himself a ransom for all -- the testimony in its own times --
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	7	in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle -- truth I say in Christ , I do not lie -- a teacher of nations , in faith and truth .
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	8	I wish , therefore , that men pray in every place , lifting up kind hands , apart from anger and reasoning ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	9	in like manner also the women , in becoming apparel , with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves , not in braided hair , or gold , or pearls , or garments of great price ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	10	but -- which becometh women professing godly piety -- through good works .
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	12	and a woman I do not suffer to teach , nor to rule a husband , but to be in quietness ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	13	for Adam was first formed , then Eve ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	14	and Adam was not deceived , but the woman , having been deceived , into transgression came ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	2	15	and she shall be saved through the child-bearing , if they remain in faith , and love , and sanctification , with sobriety .
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	1	Timothy
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	3	not given to wine , not a striker , not given to filthy lucre , but gentle , not contentious , not a lover of money ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	2	it behoveth , therefore , the overseer to be blameless , of one wife a husband , vigilant , sober , decent , a friend of strangers , apt to teach ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	4	his own house leading well , having children in subjection with all gravity ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	5	( and if any one his own house [ how ] to lead hath not known , how an assembly of God shall he take care of ? )
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	6	not a new convert , lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	7	and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without , that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil .
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	8	Ministrants -- in like manner grave , not double-tongued , not given to much wine , not given to filthy lucre ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	9	having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	10	and let these also first be proved , then let them minister , being unblameable .
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	11	Women -- in like manner grave , not false accusers , vigilant , faithful in all things .
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	12	Ministrants -- let them be of one wife husbands ; the children leading well , and their own houses ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	13	for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire , and much boldness in faith that [ is ] in Christ Jesus .
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	14	These things I write to thee , hoping to come unto thee soon ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	15	and if I delay , that thou mayest know how it behoveth [ thee ] to conduct thyself in the house of God , which is an assembly of the living God -- a pillar and foundation of the truth ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	3	16	and , confessedly , great is the secret of piety -- God was manifested in flesh , declared righteous in spirit , seen by messengers , preached among nations , believed on in the world , taken up in glory !
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	4	because every creature of God [ is ] good , and nothing [ is ] to be rejected , with thanksgiving being received ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	2	in hypocrisy speaking lies , being seared in their own conscience ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	3	forbidding to marry -- to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	5	for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession .
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	6	These things placing before the brethren , thou shalt be a good ministrant of Jesus Christ , being nourished by the words of the faith , and of the good teaching , which thou didst follow after ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	7	and the profane and old women 's fables reject thou , and exercise thyself unto piety ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	8	for the bodily exercise is unto little profit , and the piety is to all things profitable , a promise having of the life that now is , and of that which is coming ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	9	stedfast [ is ] the word , and of all acceptation worthy ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	10	for for this we both labour and are reproached , because we hope on the living God , who is Saviour of all men -- especially of those believing .
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	11	Charge these things , and teach ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	12	let no one despise thy youth , but a pattern become thou of those believing in word , in behaviour , in love , in spirit , in faith , in purity ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	13	till I come , give heed to the reading , to the exhortation , to the teaching ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	14	be not careless of the gift in thee , that was given thee through prophecy , with laying on of the hands of the eldership ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	15	of these things be careful ; in these things be , that thy advancement may be manifest in all things ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	4	16	take heed to thyself , and to the teaching ; remain in them , for this thing doing , both thyself thou shalt save , and those hearing thee .
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	5	And she who is really a widow and desolate , hath hoped upon God , and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	2	aged women as mothers , younger ones as sisters -- in all purity ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	3	honour widows who are really widows ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	4	and if any widow have children or grandchildren , let them learn first to their own house to show piety , and to give back a recompense to the parents , for this is right and acceptable before God .
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	6	and she who is given to luxury , living -- hath died ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	7	and these things charge , that they may be blameless ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	8	and if any one for his own -- and especially for those of the household -- doth not provide , the faith he hath denied , and than an unbeliever he is worse .
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	9	A widow -- let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age , having been a wife of one husband ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	10	in good works being testified to : if she brought up children , if she entertained strangers , if saints ' feet she washed , if those in tribulation she relieved , if every good work she followed after ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	11	and younger widows be refusing , for when they may revel against the Christ , they wish to marry ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	12	having judgment , because the first faith they did cast away ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	13	and at the same time also , they learn [ to be ] idle , going about the houses ; and not only idle , but also tattlers and busybodies , speaking the things they ought not ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	14	I wish , therefore , younger ones to marry , to bear children , to be mistress of the house , to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	15	for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary .
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any believing man or believing woman have widows , let them relieve them , and let not the assembly be burdened , that those really widows it may relieve .
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	17	The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy , especially those labouring in word and teaching ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	18	for the Writing saith , ` An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle , ' and ` Worthy [ is ] the workman of his reward . '
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	19	Against an elder an accusation receive not , except upon two or three witnesses .
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	20	Those sinning , reprove before all , that the others also may have fear ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	21	I testify fully , before God and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the choice messengers , that these things thou mayest keep , without forejudging , doing nothing by partiality .
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	22	Be laying hands quickly on no one , nor be having fellowship with sins of others ; be keeping thyself pure ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	23	no longer be drinking water , but a little wine be using , because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	24	of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand , leading before to judgment , and certain also they follow after ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	5	25	in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand , and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid .
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	6	but it is great gain -- the piety with contentment ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	2	and those having believing masters , let them not slight [ them ] , because they are brethren , but rather let them serve , because they are stedfast and beloved , who of the benefit are partaking . These things be teaching and exhorting ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	3	if any one be teaching otherwise , and do not consent to sound words -- those of our Lord Jesus Christ -- and to the teaching according to piety ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	4	he is proud , knowing nothing , but doting about questions and word-striving , out of which doth come envy , strife , evil-speakings , evil-surmisings ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	5	wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind , and destitute of the truth , supposing the piety to be gain ; depart from such ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	7	for nothing did we bring into the world -- [ it is ] manifest that we are able to carry nothing out ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	8	but having food and raiment -- with these we shall suffice ourselves ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	9	and those wishing to be rich , do fall into temptation and a snare , and many desires , foolish and hurtful , that sink men into ruin and destruction ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	10	for a root of all the evils is the love of money , which certain longing for did go astray from the faith , and themselves did pierce through with many sorrows ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	11	and thou , O man of God , these things flee , and pursue righteousness , piety , faith , love , endurance , meekness ;
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	12	be striving the good strife of the faith , be laying hold on the life age-during , to which also thou wast called , and didst profess the right profession before many witnesses .
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	13	I charge thee , before God , who is making all things alive , and of Christ Jesus , who did testify before Pontius Pilate the right profession ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	14	that thou keep the command unspotted , unblameable , till the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	15	which in His own times He shall shew -- the blessed and only potentate , the King of the kings and Lord of the lords ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	16	who only is having immortality , dwelling in light unapproachable , whom no one of men did see , nor is able to see , to whom [ is ] honour and might age-during ! Amen .
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	17	Those rich in the present age charge thou not to be high-minded , nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches , but in the living God , who is giving to us all things richly for enjoyment ; --
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	18	to do good , to be rich in good works , to be ready to impart , willing to communicate ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	19	treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come , that they may lay hold on the life age-during .
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	20	O Timotheus , the thing entrusted guard thou , avoiding the profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named knowledge ,
YLT	1%20Timothy	6	21	which certain professing -- concerning the faith did swerve ; the grace [ is ] with you . Amen .
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	2	to Timotheus , beloved child : Grace , kindness , peace , from God the Father , and Christ Jesus our Lord !
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ , through the will of God , according to a promise of life that [ is ] in Christ Jesus ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	3	I am thankful to God , whom I serve from progenitors in a pure conscience , that unceasingly I have remembrance concerning thee in my supplications night and day ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	4	desiring greatly to see thee , being mindful of thy tears , that with joy I may be filled ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	5	taking remembrance of the unfeigned faith that is in thee , that dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice , and I am persuaded that also in thee .
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	6	For which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God that is in thee through the putting on of my hands ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	7	for God did not give us a spirit of fear , but of power , and of love , and of a sound mind ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	8	therefore thou mayest not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner , but do thou suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	9	who did save us , and did call with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to His own purpose and grace , that was given to us in Christ Jesus , before the times of the ages ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	10	and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ , who indeed did abolish death , and did enlighten life and immortality through the good news ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	11	to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle , and a teacher of nations ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	12	for which cause also these things I suffer , but I am not ashamed , for I have known in whom I have believed , and have been persuaded that he is able that which I have committed to him to guard -- to that day .
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	13	The pattern hold thou of sound words , which from me thou didst hear , in faith and love that [ is ] in Christ Jesus ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	14	the good thing committed guard thou through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	15	thou hast known this , that they did turn from me -- all those in Asia , of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	16	may the Lord give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus , because many times he did refresh me , and of my chain was not ashamed ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	17	but being in Rome , very diligently he sought me , and found ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	1	18	may the Lord give to him to find kindness from the Lord in that day ; and how many things in Ephesus he did minister thou dost very well know .
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	2	and the things that thou didst hear from me through many witnesses , these things be committing to stedfast men , who shall be sufficient also others to teach ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	3	thou , therefore , suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	4	no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the affairs of life , that him who did enlist him he may please ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	5	and if also any one may strive , he is not crowned , except he may strive lawfully ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	6	the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to partake ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	7	be considering what things I say , for the Lord give to thee understanding in all things .
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ , raised out of the dead , of the seed of David , according to my good news ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	9	in which I suffer evil -- unto bonds , as an evil-doer , but the word of God hath not been bound ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	10	because of this all things do I endure , because of the choice ones , that they also salvation may obtain that [ is ] in Christ Jesus , with glory age-during .
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	11	Stedfast [ is ] the word : For if we died together -- we also shall live together ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	12	if we do endure together -- we shall also reign together ; if we deny [ him ] , he also shall deny us ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	13	if we are not stedfast , he remaineth stedfast ; to deny himself he is not able .
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	14	These things remind [ them ] of , testifying fully before the Lord -- not to strive about words to nothing profitable , but to the subversion of those hearing ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	15	be diligent to present thyself approved to God -- a workman irreproachable , rightly dividing the word of the truth ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	16	and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from , for to more impiety they will advance ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	17	and their word as a gangrene will have pasture , of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	18	who concerning the truth did swerve , saying the rising again to have already been , and do overthrow the faith of some ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	19	sure , nevertheless , hath the foundation of God stood , having this seal , ` The Lord hath known those who are His , ' and ` Let him depart from unrighteousness -- every one who is naming the name of Christ . '
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	20	And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of earth , and some to honour , and some to dishonour :
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	21	if , then , any one may cleanse himself from these , he shall be a vessel to honour , sanctified and profitable to the master -- to every good work having been prepared ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	22	and the youthful lusts flee thou , and pursue righteousness , faith , love , peace , with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	23	and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding , having known that they beget strife ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	24	and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive , but to be gentle unto all , apt to teach , patient under evil ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	25	in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	2	26	and they may awake out of the devil 's snare , having been caught by him at his will .
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	2	for men shall be lovers of themselves , lovers of money , boasters , proud , evil-speakers , to parents disobedient , unthankful , unkind ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	3	without natural affection , implacable , false accusers , incontinent , fierce , not lovers of those who are good ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	4	traitors , heady , lofty , lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	5	having a form of piety , and its power having denied ; and from these be turning away ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	6	for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women , laden with sins , led away with desires manifold ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	7	always learning , and never to a knowledge of truth able to come ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	8	and , even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses , so also these do stand against the truth , men corrupted in mind , disapproved concerning the faith ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	9	but they shall not advance any further , for their folly shall be manifest to all , as theirs also did become .
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	10	And thou -- thou hast followed after my teaching , manner of life , purpose , faith , long-suffering , love , endurance ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	11	the persecutions , the afflictions , that befel me in Antioch , in Iconium , in Lystra ; what persecutions I endured , and out of all the Lord did deliver me ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	12	and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	13	and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse , leading astray and being led astray .
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	14	And thou -- be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with , having known from whom thou didst learn ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	15	and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known , which are able to make thee wise -- to salvation , through faith that [ is ] in Christ Jesus ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	16	every Writing [ is ] God-breathed , and profitable for teaching , for conviction , for setting aright , for instruction that [ is ] in righteousness ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	3	17	that the man of God may be fitted -- for every good work having been completed .
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	2	preach the word ; be earnest in season , out of season , convict , rebuke , exhort , in all long-suffering and teaching ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	4	and indeed , from the truth the hearing they shall turn away , and to the fables they shall be turned aside .
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	3	for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer , but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers -- itching in the hearing ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	5	And thou -- watch in all things ; suffer evil ; do the work of one proclaiming good news ; of thy ministration make full assurance ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	6	for I am already being poured out , and the time of my release hath arrived ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	7	the good strife I have striven , the course I have finished , the faith I have kept ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	8	henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord -- the Righteous Judge -- shall give to me in that day , and not only to me , but also to all those loving his manifestation .
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	9	Be diligent to come unto me quickly ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	10	for Demas forsook me , having loved the present age , and went on to Thessalonica , Crescens to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	11	Lukas only is with me ; Markus having taken , bring with thyself , for he is profitable to me for ministration ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	12	and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	13	the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus , coming , bring thou and the books -- especially the parchments .
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil ; may the Lord repay to him according to his works ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	15	of whom also do thou beware , for greatly hath he stood against our words ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	16	in my first defence no one stood with me , but all forsook me , ( may it not be reckoned to them ! )
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	17	and the Lord stood by me , and did strengthen me , that through me the preaching might be fully assured , and all the nations might hear , and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion ,
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	18	and the Lord shall free me from every evil work , and shall save [ me ] -- to his heavenly kingdom ; to whom [ is ] the glory to the ages of the ages ! Amen .
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	19	Salute Prisca and Aquilas , and Onesiphorus ' household ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	20	Erastus did remain in Corinth , and Trophimus I left in Miletus infirm ;
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	21	be diligent to come before winter . Salute thee doth Eubulus , and Pudens , and Linus , and Claudia , and all the brethren .
YLT	2%20Timothy	4	22	The Lord Jesus Christ [ is ] with thy spirit ; the grace [ is ] with you ! Amen .
YLT	Titus	1	1	Paul , a servant of God , and an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the faith of the choice ones of God , and an acknowledging of truth that [ is ] according to piety ,
YLT	Titus	1	2	upon hope of life age-during , which God , who doth not lie , did promise before times of ages ,
YLT	Titus	1	3	( and He manifested in proper times His word , ) in preaching , which I was entrusted with , according to a charge of God our Saviour ,
YLT	Titus	1	4	to Titus -- true child according to a common faith : Grace , kindness , peace , from God the Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour !
YLT	Titus	1	5	For this cause left I thee in Crete , that the things lacking thou mayest arrange , and mayest set down in every city elders , as I did appoint to thee ;
YLT	Titus	1	6	if any one is blameless , of one wife a husband , having children stedfast , not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate --
YLT	Titus	1	7	for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless , as God 's steward , not self-pleased , nor irascible , not given to wine , not a striker , not given to filthy lucre ;
YLT	Titus	1	8	but a lover of strangers , a lover of good men , sober-minded , righteous , kind , self-controlled ,
YLT	Titus	1	9	holding -- according to the teaching -- to the stedfast word , that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching , and the gainsayers to convict ;
YLT	Titus	1	10	for there are many both insubordinate , vain-talkers , and mind-deceivers -- especially they of the circumcision --
YLT	Titus	1	11	whose mouth it behoveth to stop , who whole households do overturn , teaching what things it behoveth not , for filthy lucre 's sake .
YLT	Titus	1	12	A certain one of them , a prophet of their own , said -- ` Cretans ! always liars , evil beasts , lazy bellies ! '
YLT	Titus	1	13	this testimony is true ; for which cause convict them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ,
YLT	Titus	1	14	not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men , turning themselves away from the truth ;
YLT	Titus	1	15	all things , indeed , [ are ] pure to the pure , and to the defiled and unstedfast [ is ] nothing pure , but of them defiled [ are ] even the mind and the conscience ;
YLT	Titus	1	16	God they profess to know , and in the works they deny [ Him ] , being abominable , and disobedient , and unto every good work disapproved .
YLT	Titus	2	2	aged men to be temperate , grave , sober , sound in the faith , in the love , in the endurance ;
YLT	Titus	2	3	aged women , in like manner , in deportment as doth become sacred persons , not false accusers , to much wine not enslaved , of good things teachers ,
YLT	Titus	2	4	that they may make the young women sober-minded , to be lovers of [ their ] husbands , lovers of [ their ] children ,
YLT	Titus	2	5	sober , pure , keepers of [ their own ] houses , good , subject to their own husbands , that the word of God may not be evil spoken of .
YLT	Titus	2	6	The younger men , in like manner , be exhorting to be sober-minded ;
YLT	Titus	2	7	concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works ; in the teaching uncorruptedness , gravity , incorruptibility ,
YLT	Titus	2	8	discourse sound , irreprehensible , that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed , having nothing evil to say concerning you .
YLT	Titus	2	9	Servants -- to their own masters [ are ] to be subject , in all things to be well-pleasing , not gainsaying ,
YLT	Titus	2	10	not purloining , but showing all good stedfastness , that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things .
YLT	Titus	2	11	For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men ,
YLT	Titus	2	12	teaching us , that denying the impiety and the worldly desires , soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age ,
YLT	Titus	2	13	waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ ,
YLT	Titus	2	14	who did give himself for us , that he might ransom us from all lawlessness , and might purify to himself a peculiar people , zealous of good works ;
YLT	Titus	2	15	these things be speaking , and exhorting , and convicting , with all charge ; let no one despise thee !
YLT	Titus	3	3	for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless , disobedient , led astray , serving desires and pleasures manifold , in malice and envy living , odious -- hating one another ;
YLT	Titus	3	2	of no one to speak evil , not to be quarrelsome -- gentle , showing all meekness to all men ,
YLT	Titus	3	4	and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear
YLT	Titus	3	5	( not by works that [ are ] in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness , ) He did save us , through a bathing of regeneration , and a renewing of the Holy Spirit ,
YLT	Titus	3	6	which He poured upon us richly , through Jesus Christ our Saviour ,
YLT	Titus	3	7	that having been declared righteous by His grace , heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during .
YLT	Titus	3	8	Stedfast [ is ] the word ; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully , that they may be thoughtful , to be leading in good works -- who have believed God ; these are the good and profitable things to men ,
YLT	Titus	3	9	and foolish questions , and genealogies , and contentions , and strivings about law , stand away from -- for they are unprofitable and vain .
YLT	Titus	3	10	A sectarian man , after a first and second admonition be rejecting ,
YLT	Titus	3	11	having known that he hath been subverted who [ is ] such , and doth sin , being self-condemned .
YLT	Titus	3	12	When I shall send Artemas unto thee , or Tychicus , be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis , for there to winter I have determined .
YLT	Titus	3	13	Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way , that nothing to them may be lacking ,
YLT	Titus	3	14	and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good works to the necessary uses , that they may not be unfruitful .
YLT	Titus	3	15	Salute thee do all those with me ; salute those loving us in faith ; the grace [ is ] with you all !
YLT	Philemon	1	1	Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timotheus the brother , to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker ,
YLT	Philemon	1	2	and Apphia the beloved , and Archippus our fellow-soldier , and the assembly in thy house :
YLT	Philemon	1	3	Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ !
YLT	Philemon	1	4	I give thanks to my God , always making mention of thee in my prayers ,
YLT	Philemon	1	5	hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints ,
YLT	Philemon	1	6	that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that [ is ] in you toward Christ Jesus ;
YLT	Philemon	1	7	for we have much joy and comfort in thy love , because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee , brother .
YLT	Philemon	1	8	Wherefore , having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit --
YLT	Philemon	1	9	because of the love I rather entreat , being such an one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ ;
YLT	Philemon	1	10	I entreat thee concerning my child -- whom I did beget in my bonds -- Onesimus ,
YLT	Philemon	1	11	who once was to thee unprofitable , and now is profitable to me and to thee ,
YLT	Philemon	1	12	whom I did send again , and thou him ( that is , my own bowels ) receive ,
YLT	Philemon	1	13	whom I did wish to retain to myself , that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news ,
YLT	Philemon	1	14	and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing , that as of necessity thy good deed may not be , but of willingness ,
YLT	Philemon	1	15	for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour , that age-duringly thou mayest have him ,
YLT	Philemon	1	16	no more as a servant , but above a servant -- a brother beloved , especially to me , and how much more to thee , both in the flesh and in the Lord !
YLT	Philemon	1	17	If , then , with me thou hast fellowship , receive him as me ,
YLT	Philemon	1	18	and if he did hurt to thee , or doth owe anything , this to me be reckoning ;
YLT	Philemon	1	19	I , Paul did write with my hand , I -- I will repay ; that I may not say that also thyself , besides , to me thou dost owe .
YLT	Philemon	1	20	Yes , brother , may I have profit of thee in the Lord ; refresh my bowels in the Lord ;
YLT	Philemon	1	21	having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee , having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do ;
YLT	Philemon	1	22	and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging , for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you .
YLT	Philemon	1	23	Salute thee doth Epaphras , ( my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus , )
YLT	Philemon	1	24	Markus , Aristarchus , Demas , Lukas , my fellow-workmen !
YLT	Philemon	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ is ] with your spirit ! Amen .
YLT	Hebrews	1	1	In many parts , and many ways , God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets ,
YLT	Hebrews	1	2	in these last days did speak to us in a Son , whom He appointed heir of all things , through whom also He did make the ages ;
YLT	Hebrews	1	3	who being the brightness of the glory , and the impress of His subsistence , bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our sins , sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest ,
YLT	Hebrews	1	4	having become so much better than the messengers , as he did inherit a more excellent name than they .
YLT	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the messengers said He ever , ` My Son thou art -- I to-day have begotten thee ? ' and again , ` I will be to him for a father , and he shall be to Me for a son ? '
YLT	Hebrews	1	6	and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world , He saith , ` And let them bow before him -- all messengers of God ; '
YLT	Hebrews	1	7	and unto the messengers , indeed , He saith , ` Who is making His messengers spirits , and His ministers a flame of fire ; '
YLT	Hebrews	1	8	and unto the Son : ` Thy throne , O God , [ is ] to the age of the age ; a scepter of righteousness [ is ] the scepter of thy reign ;
YLT	Hebrews	1	9	thou didst love righteousness , and didst hate lawlessness ; because of this did He anoint thee -- God , thy God -- with oil of gladness above thy partners ; '
YLT	Hebrews	1	10	and , ` Thou , at the beginning , Lord , the earth didst found , and a work of thy hands are the heavens ;
YLT	Hebrews	1	11	these shall perish , and Thou dost remain , and all , as a garment , shall become old ,
YLT	Hebrews	1	12	and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together , and they shall be changed , and Thou art the same , and Thy years shall not fail . '
YLT	Hebrews	1	13	And unto which of the messengers said He ever , ` Sit at My right hand , till I may make thine enemies thy footstool ? '
YLT	Hebrews	1	14	are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation ?
YLT	Hebrews	2	2	for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast , and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	3	how shall we escape , having neglected so great salvation ? which a beginning receiving -- to be spoken through the Lord -- by those having heard was confirmed to us ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	4	God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders , and manifold powers , and distributions of the Holy Spirit , according to His will .
YLT	Hebrews	2	5	For not to messengers did He subject the coming world , concerning which we speak ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	6	and one in a certain place did testify fully , saying , ` What is man , that Thou art mindful of him , or a son of man , that Thou dost look after him ?
YLT	Hebrews	2	7	Thou didst make him some little less than messengers , with glory and honour Thou didst crown him , and didst set him over the works of Thy hands ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	8	all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet , ' for in the subjecting to him the all things , nothing did He leave to him unsubjected , and now not yet do we see the all things subjected to him ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	9	and him who was made some little less than messengers we see -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death , with glory and honour having been crowned , that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death .
YLT	Hebrews	2	10	For it was becoming to Him , because of whom [ are ] the all things , and through whom [ are ] the all things , many sons to glory bringing , the author of their salvation through sufferings to make perfect ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	11	for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified [ are ] all of one , for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	12	saying , ` I will declare Thy name to my brethren , in the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to Thee ; ' and again , ` I will be trusting on Him ; '
YLT	Hebrews	2	13	and again , ` Behold I and the children that God did give to me . '
YLT	Hebrews	2	14	Seeing , then , the children have partaken of flesh and blood , he himself also in like manner did take part of the same , that through death he might destroy him having the power of death -- that is , the devil --
YLT	Hebrews	2	15	and might deliver those , whoever , with fear of death , throughout all their life , were subjects of bondage ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	16	for , doubtless , of messengers it doth not lay hold , but of seed of Abraham it layeth hold ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	17	wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like to the brethren , that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God , to make propitiation for the sins of the people ,
YLT	Hebrews	2	18	for in that he suffered , himself being tempted , he is able to help those who are tempted .
YLT	Hebrews	3	3	for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy , inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it ,
YLT	Hebrews	3	2	being stedfast to Him who did appoint him , as also Moses in all his house ,
YLT	Hebrews	3	4	for every house is builded by some one , and He who the all things did build [ is ] God ,
YLT	Hebrews	3	5	and Moses indeed [ was ] stedfast in all his house , as an attendant , for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken ,
YLT	Hebrews	3	6	and Christ , as a Son over his house , whose house are we , if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast .
YLT	Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore , ( as the Holy Spirit saith , ` To-day , if His voice ye may hear --
YLT	Hebrews	3	8	ye may not harden your hearts , as in the provocation , in the day of the temptation in the wilderness ,
YLT	Hebrews	3	9	in which tempt Me did your fathers , they did prove Me , and saw My works forty years ;
YLT	Hebrews	3	10	wherefore I was grieved with that generation , and said , Always do they go astray in heart , and these have not known My ways ;
YLT	Hebrews	3	11	so I sware in My anger , If they shall enter into My rest -- ! ' )
YLT	Hebrews	3	12	See , brethren , lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God ,
YLT	Hebrews	3	13	but exhort ye one another every day , while the To-day is called , that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin ,
YLT	Hebrews	3	14	for partakers we have become of the Christ , if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast ,
YLT	Hebrews	3	15	in its being said , ` To-day , if His voice ye may hear , ye may not harden your hearts , as in the provocation , '
YLT	Hebrews	3	16	for certain having heard did provoke , but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses ;
YLT	Hebrews	3	17	but with whom was He grieved forty years ? was it not with those who did sin , whose carcasses fell in the wilderness ?
YLT	Hebrews	3	18	and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest , except to those who did not believe ? --
YLT	Hebrews	3	19	and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief .
YLT	Hebrews	4	4	for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh [ day ] thus : ` And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works ; '
YLT	Hebrews	4	2	for we also are having good news proclaimed , even as they , but the word heard did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in those who heard ,
YLT	Hebrews	4	3	for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe , as He said , ` So I sware in My anger , If they shall enter into My rest -- ; ' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world ,
YLT	Hebrews	4	5	and in this [ place ] again , ` If they shall enter into My rest -- ; '
YLT	Hebrews	4	6	since then , it remaineth for certain to enter into it , and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --
YLT	Hebrews	4	7	again He doth limit a certain day , ` To-day , ' ( in David saying , after so long a time , ) as it hath been said , ` To-day , if His voice ye may hear , ye may not harden your hearts , '
YLT	Hebrews	4	8	for if Joshua had given them rest , He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things ;
YLT	Hebrews	4	9	there doth remain , then , a sabbatic rest to the people of God ,
YLT	Hebrews	4	10	for he who did enter into his rest , he also rested from his works , as God from His own .
YLT	Hebrews	4	11	May we be diligent , then , to enter into that rest , that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall ,
YLT	Hebrews	4	12	for the reckoning of God is living , and working , and sharp above every two-edged sword , and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit , of joints also and marrow , and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart ;
YLT	Hebrews	4	13	and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him , but all things [ are ] naked and open to His eyes -- with whom is our reckoning .
YLT	Hebrews	4	14	Having , then , a great chief priest passed through the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the profession ,
YLT	Hebrews	4	15	for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities , but [ one ] tempted in all things in like manner -- apart from sin ;
YLT	Hebrews	4	16	we may come near , then , with freedom , to the throne of the grace , that we may receive kindness , and find grace -- for seasonable help .
YLT	Hebrews	5	5	so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest , but He who spake unto him : ` My Son thou art , I to-day have begotten thee ; '
YLT	Hebrews	5	2	able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray , since himself also is compassed with infirmity ;
YLT	Hebrews	5	3	and because of this infirmity he ought , as for the people , so also for himself to offer for sins ;
YLT	Hebrews	5	4	and no one to himself doth take the honour , but he who is called by God , as also Aaron :
YLT	Hebrews	5	6	as also in another [ place ] He saith , ` Thou [ art ] a priest -- to the age , according to the order of Melchisedek ; '
YLT	Hebrews	5	7	who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong crying and tears -- having offered up , and having been heard in respect to that which he feared ,
YLT	Hebrews	5	8	through being a Son , did learn by the things which he suffered -- the obedience ,
YLT	Hebrews	5	9	and having been made perfect , he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during ,
YLT	Hebrews	5	10	having been addressed by God a chief priest , according to the order of Melchisedek ,
YLT	Hebrews	5	11	concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say , since ye have become dull of hearing ,
YLT	Hebrews	5	12	for even owing to be teachers , because of the time , again ye have need that one teach you what [ are ] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God , and ye have become having need of milk , and not of strong food ,
YLT	Hebrews	5	13	for every one who is partaking of milk [ is ] unskilled in the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant ,
YLT	Hebrews	5	14	and of perfect men is the strong food , who because of the use are having the senses exercised , unto the discernment both of good and of evil .
YLT	Hebrews	6	6	and having fallen away , again to renew [ them ] to reformation , having crucified again to themselves the Son of God , and exposed to public shame .
YLT	Hebrews	6	2	of the teaching of baptisms , of laying on also of hands , of rising again also of the dead , and of judgment age-during ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	3	and this we will do , if God may permit ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	4	for [ it is ] impossible for those once enlightened , having tasted also of the heavenly gift , and partakers having became of the Holy Spirit ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	5	and did taste the good saying of God , the powers also of the coming age ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	7	For earth , that is drinking in the rain many times coming upon it , and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom also it is dressed , doth partake of blessing from God ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	8	and that which is bearing thorns and briers [ is ] disapproved of , and nigh to cursing , whose end [ is ] for burning ;
YLT	Hebrews	6	9	and we are persuaded , concerning you , beloved , the things that are better , and accompanying salvation , though even thus we speak ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	10	for God is not unrighteous to forget your work , and the labour of the love , that ye shewed to His name , having ministered to the saints and ministering ;
YLT	Hebrews	6	11	and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew , unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	12	that ye may not become slothful , but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises .
YLT	Hebrews	6	13	For to Abraham God , having made promise , seeing He was able to swear by no greater , did swear by Himself ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	14	saying , ` Blessing indeed I will bless thee , and multiplying I will multiply thee ; '
YLT	Hebrews	6	15	and so , having patiently endured , he did obtain the promise ;
YLT	Hebrews	6	16	for men indeed do swear by the greater , and an end of all controversy to them for confirmation [ is ] the oath ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	17	in which God , more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , did interpose by an oath ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	18	that through two immutable things , in which [ it is ] impossible for God to lie , a strong comfort we may have who did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before [ us ] ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	19	which we have , as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and entering into that within the vail ,
YLT	Hebrews	6	20	whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus , after the order of Melchisedek chief priest having become -- to the age .
YLT	Hebrews	7	7	and apart from all controversy , the less by the better is blessed --
YLT	Hebrews	7	2	to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide , ( first , indeed , being interpreted , ` King of righteousness , ' and then also , King of Salem , which is , King of Peace , )
YLT	Hebrews	7	3	without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , and being made like to the Son of God , doth remain a priest continually .
YLT	Hebrews	7	4	And see how great this one [ is ] , to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	5	and those , indeed , out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood , a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law , that is , their brethren , even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham ;
YLT	Hebrews	7	6	and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them , received tithes from Abraham , and him having the promises he hath blessed ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	8	and here , indeed , men who die do receive tithes , and there [ he ] , who is testified to that he was living ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	9	and so to speak , through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes , hath paid tithes ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	10	for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him .
YLT	Hebrews	7	11	If indeed , then , perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need , according to the order of Melchisedek , for another priest to arise , and not to be called according to the order of Aaron ?
YLT	Hebrews	7	12	for the priesthood being changed , of necessity also , of the law a change doth come ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	13	for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part , of whom no one gave attendance at the altar ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	14	for [ it is ] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord , in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood .
YLT	Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet more abundantly most evident , if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	16	who came not according to the law of a fleshly command , but according to the power of an endless life ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	17	for He doth testify -- ` Thou [ art ] a priest -- to the age , according to the order of Melchisedek ; '
YLT	Hebrews	7	18	for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness , and unprofitableness ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	19	( for nothing did the law perfect ) and the bringing in of a better hope , through which we draw nigh to God .
YLT	Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as [ it is ] not apart from oath , ( for those indeed apart from oath are become priests ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	21	and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him , ` The Lord sware , and will not repent , Thou [ art ] a priest -- to the age , according to the order of Melchisedek ; ' )
YLT	Hebrews	7	22	by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	23	and those indeed are many who have become priests , because by death they are hindered from remaining ;
YLT	Hebrews	7	24	and he , because of his remaining -- to the age , hath the priesthood not transient ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	25	whence also he is able to save to the very end , those coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession for them .
YLT	Hebrews	7	26	For such a chief priest did become us -- kind , harmless , undefiled , separate from the sinners , and become higher than the heavens ,
YLT	Hebrews	7	27	who hath no necessity daily , as the chief priests , first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice , then for those of the people ; for this he did once , having offered up himself ;
YLT	Hebrews	7	28	for the law doth appoint men chief priests , having infirmity , but the word of the oath that [ is ] after the law [ appointeth ] the Son -- to the age having been perfected .
YLT	Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault , He saith to them , ` Lo , days come , saith the Lord , and I will complete with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah , a new covenant ,
YLT	Hebrews	8	2	of the holy places a servant , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord did set up , and not man ,
YLT	Hebrews	8	3	for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed , whence [ it is ] necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer ;
YLT	Hebrews	8	4	for if , indeed , he were upon earth , he would not be a priest -- ( there being the priests who are offering according to the law , the gifts ,
YLT	Hebrews	8	5	who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things , as Moses hath been divinely warned , being about to construct the tabernacle , for ` See ( saith He ) thou mayest make all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in the mount ; ' ) --
YLT	Hebrews	8	6	and now he hath obtained a more excellent service , how much also of a better covenant is he mediator , which on better promises hath been sanctioned ,
YLT	Hebrews	8	7	for if that first were faultless , a place would not have been sought for a second .
YLT	Hebrews	8	9	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers , in the day of My taking [ them ] by their hand , to bring them out of the land of Egypt -- because they did not remain in My covenant , and I did not regard them , saith the Lord , --
YLT	Hebrews	8	10	because this [ is ] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel , after those days , saith the Lord , giving My laws into their mind , and upon their hearts I will write them , and I will be to them for a God , and they shall be to Me for a people ;
YLT	Hebrews	8	11	and they shall not teach each his neighbour , and each his brother , saying , Know thou the Lord , because they shall all know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them ,
YLT	Hebrews	8	12	because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more ; ' --
YLT	Hebrews	8	13	in the saying ` new , ' He hath made the first old , and what doth become obsolete and is old [ is ] nigh disappearing .
YLT	Hebrews	9	9	which [ is ] a simile in regard to the present time , in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered , which are not able , in regard to conscience , to make perfect him who is serving ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	2	for a tabernacle was prepared , the first , in which was both the lamp-stand , and the table , and the bread of the presence -- which is called ` Holy ; '
YLT	Hebrews	9	3	and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called ` Holy of holies , '
YLT	Hebrews	9	4	having a golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid all round about with gold , in which [ is ] the golden pot having the manna , and the rod of Aaron that budded , and the tables of the covenant ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	5	and over it cherubim of the glory , overshadowing the mercy-seat , concerning which we are not now to speak particularly .
YLT	Hebrews	9	6	And these things having been thus prepared , into the first tabernacle , indeed , at all times the priests do go in , performing the services ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	7	and into the second , once in the year , only the chief priest , not apart from blood , which he doth offer for himself and the errors of the people ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	8	the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been manifested the way of the holy [ places ] , the first tabernacle having yet a standing ;
YLT	Hebrews	9	10	only in victuals , and drinks , and different baptisms , and fleshly ordinances -- till the time of reformation imposed upon [ them ] .
YLT	Hebrews	9	11	And Christ being come , chief priest of the coming good things , through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands -- that is , not of this creation --
YLT	Hebrews	9	12	neither through blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , did enter in once into the holy places , age-during redemption having obtained ;
YLT	Hebrews	9	13	for if the blood of bulls , and goats , and ashes of an heifer , sprinkling those defiled , doth sanctify to the purifying of the flesh ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	14	how much more shall the blood of the Christ ( who through the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God ) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
YLT	Hebrews	9	15	And because of this , of a new covenant he is mediator , that , death having come , for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant , those called may receive the promise of the age-during inheritance ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	16	for where a covenant [ is ] , the death of the covenant-victim to come in is necessary ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	17	for a covenant over dead victims [ is ] stedfast , since it is no force at all when the covenant-victim liveth ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	18	whence not even the first apart from blood hath been initiated ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	19	for every command having been spoken , according to law , by Moses , to all the people , having taken the blood of the calves and goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , he both the book itself and all the people did sprinkle ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	20	saying , ` This [ is ] the blood of the covenant that God enjoined unto you , '
YLT	Hebrews	9	21	and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner he did sprinkle ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	22	and with blood almost all things are purified according to the law , and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness doth not come .
YLT	Hebrews	9	23	[ It is ] necessary , therefore , the pattern indeed of the things in the heavens to be purified with these , and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these ;
YLT	Hebrews	9	24	for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ enter -- figures of the true -- but into the heaven itself , now to be manifested in the presence of God for us ;
YLT	Hebrews	9	25	nor that he may many times offer himself , even as the chief priest doth enter into the holy places every year with blood of others ;
YLT	Hebrews	9	26	since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the foundation of the world , but now once , at the full end of the ages , for putting away of sin through his sacrifice , he hath been manifested ;
YLT	Hebrews	9	27	and as it is laid up to men once to die , and after this -- judgment ,
YLT	Hebrews	9	28	so also the Christ , once having been offered to bear the sins of many , a second time , apart from a sin-offering , shall appear , to those waiting for him -- to salvation !
YLT	Hebrews	10	10	in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	2	since , would they not have ceased to be offered , because of those serving having no more conscience of sins , having once been purified ?
YLT	Hebrews	10	3	but in those [ sacrifices ] is a remembrance of sins every year ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	4	for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
YLT	Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore , coming into the world , he saith , ` Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will , and a body Thou didst prepare for me ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	6	in burnt-offerings , and concerning sin-offerings , Thou didst not delight ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	7	then I said , Lo , I come , ( in a volume of the book it hath been written concerning me , ) to do , O God , Thy will ; '
YLT	Hebrews	10	8	saying above -- ` Sacrifice , and offering , and burnt-offerings , and concerning sin-offering Thou didst not will , nor delight in , ' -- which according to the law are offered --
YLT	Hebrews	10	9	then he said , ` Lo , I come to do , O God , Thy will ; ' he doth take away the first that the second he may establish ;
YLT	Hebrews	10	11	and every priest , indeed , hath stood daily serving , and the same sacrifices many times offering , that are never able to take away sins .
YLT	Hebrews	10	12	And He , for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the end , did sit down on the right hand of God , --
YLT	Hebrews	10	13	as to the rest , expecting till He may place his enemies [ as ] his footstool ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	14	for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified ;
YLT	Hebrews	10	15	and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit , for after that He hath said before ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	16	` This [ is ] the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , giving My laws on their hearts , and upon their minds I will write them , '
YLT	Hebrews	10	17	and ` their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more ; '
YLT	Hebrews	10	18	and where forgiveness of these [ is ] , there is no more offering for sin .
YLT	Hebrews	10	19	Having , therefore , brethren , boldness for the entrance into the holy places , in the blood of Jesus ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	20	which way he did initiate for us -- new and living , through the vail , that is , his flesh --
YLT	Hebrews	10	21	and a high priest over the house of God ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	22	may we draw near with a true heart , in full assurance of faith , having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and having the body bathed with pure water ;
YLT	Hebrews	10	23	may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope , ( for faithful [ is ] He who did promise ) ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	24	and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as a custom of certain [ is ] , but exhorting , and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh .
YLT	Hebrews	10	26	For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	27	but a certain fearful looking for of judgment , and fiery zeal , about to devour the opposers ;
YLT	Hebrews	10	28	any one who did set at nought a law of Moses , apart from mercies , by two or three witnesses , doth die ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	29	of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on , and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing , in which he was sanctified , and to the Spirit of the grace did despite ?
YLT	Hebrews	10	30	for we have known Him who is saying , ` Vengeance [ is ] Mine , I will recompense , saith the Lord ; ' and again , ` The Lord shall judge His people ; ' --
YLT	Hebrews	10	31	fearful [ is ] the falling into the hands of a living God .
YLT	Hebrews	10	32	And call to your remembrance the former days , in which , having been enlightened , ye did endure much conflict of sufferings ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	33	partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles , and partly having become partners of those so living ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	34	for also with my bonds ye sympathised , and the robbery of your goods with joy ye did receive , knowing that ye have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens , and an enduring one .
YLT	Hebrews	10	35	Ye may not cast away , then , your boldness , which hath great recompense of reward ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	36	for of patience ye have need , that the will of God having done , ye may receive the promise ,
YLT	Hebrews	10	37	for yet a very very little , He who is coming will come , and will not tarry ;
YLT	Hebrews	10	38	and ` the righteous by faith shall live , ' and ` if he may draw back , My soul hath no pleasure in him , '
YLT	Hebrews	10	39	and we are not of those drawing back to destruction , but of those believing to a preserving of soul .
YLT	Hebrews	11	11	By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive seed , and she bare after the time of life , seeing she did judge Him faithful who did promise ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	2	for in this were the elders testified of ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	3	by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God , in regard to the things seen not having come out of things appearing ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	4	by faith a better sacrifice did Abel offer to God than Cain , through which he was testified to be righteous , God testifying of his gifts , and through it , he being dead , doth yet speak .
YLT	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was translated -- not to see death , and was not found , because God did translate him ; for before his translation he had been testified to -- that he had pleased God well ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	6	and apart from faith it is impossible to please well , for it behoveth him who is coming to God to believe that He is , and to those seeking Him He becometh a rewarder .
YLT	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah , having been divinely warned concerning the things not yet seen , having feared , did prepare an ark to the salvation of his house , through which he did condemn the world , and of the righteousness according to faith he became heir .
YLT	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham , being called , did obey , to go forth to the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance , and he went forth , not knowing whither he doth go ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	9	by faith he did sojourn in the land of the promise as a strange country , in tabernacles having dwelt with Isaac and Jacob , fellow-heirs of the same promise ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	10	for he was looking for the city having the foundations , whose artificer and constructor [ is ] God .
YLT	Hebrews	11	12	wherefore , also from one were begotten -- and that of one who had become dead -- as the stars of the heaven in multitude , and as sand that [ is ] by the sea-shore -- the innumerable .
YLT	Hebrews	11	13	In faith died all these , not having received the promises , but from afar having seen them , and having been persuaded , and having saluted [ them ] , and having confessed that strangers and sojourners they are upon the earth ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	14	for those saying such things make manifest that they seek a country ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	15	and if , indeed , they had been mindful of that from which they came forth , they might have had an opportunity to return ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	16	but now they long for a better , that is , an heavenly , wherefore God is not ashamed of them , to be called their God , for He did prepare for them a city .
YLT	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham hath offered up Isaac , being tried , and the only begotten he did offer up who did receive the promises ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	18	of whom it was said -- ` In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee ; '
YLT	Hebrews	11	19	reckoning that even out of the dead God is able to raise up , whence also in a figure he did receive [ him ] .
YLT	Hebrews	11	20	By faith , concerning coming things , Isaac did bless Jacob and Esau ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	21	by faith Jacob dying -- each of the sons of Joseph did bless , and did bow down upon the top of his staff ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	22	by faith , Joseph dying , concerning the outgoing of the sons of Israel did make mention , and concerning his bones did give command .
YLT	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses , having been born , was hid three months by his parents , because they saw the child comely , and were not afraid of the decree of the king ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	24	by faith Moses , having become great , did refuse to be called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	25	having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of God , than to have sin 's pleasure for a season ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	26	greater wealth having reckoned the reproach of the Christ than the treasures in Egypt , for he did look to the recompense of reward ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	27	by faith he left Egypt behind , not having been afraid of the wrath of the king , for , as seeing the Invisible One -- he endured ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	28	by faith he kept the passover , and the sprinkling of the blood , that He who is destroying the first-born might not touch them .
YLT	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they did pass through the Red Sea as through dry land , which the Egyptians having received a trial of , were swallowed up ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	30	by faith the walls of Jericho did fall , having been surrounded for seven days ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	31	by faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who disbelieved , having received the spies with peace .
YLT	Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I yet say ? for the time will fail me recounting about Gideon , Barak also , and Samson , and Jephthah , David also , and Samuel , and the prophets ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	33	who through faith did subdue kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped mouths of lions ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	34	quenched the power of fire , escaped the mouth of the sword , were made powerful out of infirmities , became strong in battle , caused to give way camps of the aliens .
YLT	Hebrews	11	35	Women received by a rising again their dead , and others were tortured , not accepting the redemption , that a better rising again they might receive ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	36	and others of mockings and scourgings did receive trial , and yet of bonds and imprisonment ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	37	they were stoned , they were sawn asunder , they were tried ; in the killing of the sword they died ; they went about in sheepskins , in goatskins -- being destitute , afflicted , injuriously treated ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	38	of whom the world was not worthy ; in deserts wandering , and [ in ] mountains , and [ in ] caves , and [ in ] the holes of the earth ;
YLT	Hebrews	11	39	and these all , having been testified to through the faith , did not receive the promise ,
YLT	Hebrews	11	40	God for us something better having provided , that apart from us they might not be made perfect .
YLT	Hebrews	12	12	Wherefore , the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees set ye up ;
YLT	Hebrews	12	2	looking to the author and perfecter of faith -- Jesus , who , over-against the joy set before him -- did endure a cross , shame having despised , on the right hand also of the throne of God did sit down ;
YLT	Hebrews	12	3	for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the sinners to himself , that ye may not be wearied in your souls -- being faint .
YLT	Hebrews	12	4	Not yet unto blood did ye resist -- with the sin striving ;
YLT	Hebrews	12	5	and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully with you as with sons , ` My son , be not despising chastening of the Lord , nor be faint , being reproved by Him ,
YLT	Hebrews	12	6	for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten , and He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth ; '
YLT	Hebrews	12	7	if chastening ye endure , as to sons God beareth Himself to you , for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten ?
YLT	Hebrews	12	8	and if ye are apart from chastening , of which all have become partakers , then bastards are ye , and not sons .
YLT	Hebrews	12	9	Then , indeed , fathers of our flesh we have had , chastising [ us ] , and we were reverencing [ them ] ; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits , and live ?
YLT	Hebrews	12	10	for they , indeed , for a few days , according to what seemed good to them , were chastening , but He for profit , to be partakers of His separation ;
YLT	Hebrews	12	11	and all chastening for the present , indeed , doth not seem to be of joy , but of sorrow , yet afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it -- it doth yield .
YLT	Hebrews	12	13	and straight paths make for your feet , that that which is lame may not be turned aside , but rather be healed ;
YLT	Hebrews	12	14	peace pursue with all , and the separation , apart from which no one shall see the Lord ,
YLT	Hebrews	12	15	looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God , lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble , and through this many may be defiled ;
YLT	Hebrews	12	16	lest any one be a fornicator , or a profane person , as Esau , who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright ,
YLT	Hebrews	12	17	for ye know that also afterwards , wishing to inherit the blessing , he was disapproved of , for a place of reformation he found not , though with tears having sought it .
YLT	Hebrews	12	18	For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire , and to blackness , and darkness , and tempest ,
YLT	Hebrews	12	19	and a sound of a trumpet , and a voice of sayings , which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them ,
YLT	Hebrews	12	20	for they were not bearing that which is commanded , ` And if a beast may touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or with an arrow shot through , '
YLT	Hebrews	12	21	and , ( so terrible was the sight , ) Moses said , ` I am fearful exceedingly , and trembling . '
YLT	Hebrews	12	22	But , ye came to Mount Zion , and to a city of the living God , to the heavenly Jerusalem , and to myriads of messengers ,
YLT	Hebrews	12	23	to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled , and to God the judge of all , and to spirits of righteous men made perfect ,
YLT	Hebrews	12	24	and to a mediator of a new covenant -- Jesus , and to blood of sprinkling , speaking better things than that of Abel !
YLT	Hebrews	12	25	See , may ye not refuse him who is speaking , for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who [ speaketh ] from heaven ,
YLT	Hebrews	12	26	whose voice the earth shook then , and now hath he promised , saying , ` Yet once -- I shake not only the earth , but also the heaven ; '
YLT	Hebrews	12	27	and this -- ` Yet once ' -- doth make evident the removal of the things shaken , as of things having been made , that the things not shaken may remain ;
YLT	Hebrews	12	28	wherefore , a kingdom that can not be shaken receiving , may we have grace , through which we may serve God well-pleasingly , with reverence and religious fear ;
YLT	Hebrews	12	29	for also our God [ is ] a consuming fire .
YLT	Hebrews	13	13	now , then , may we go forth unto him without the camp , his reproach bearing ;
YLT	Hebrews	13	2	of the hospitality be not forgetful , for through this unawares certain did entertain messengers ;
YLT	Hebrews	13	3	be mindful of those in bonds , as having been bound with them , of those maltreated , as also yourselves being in the body ;
YLT	Hebrews	13	4	honourable [ is ] the marriage in all , and the bed undefiled , and whoremongers and adulterers God shall judge .
YLT	Hebrews	13	5	Without covetousness the behaviour , being content with the things present , for He hath said , ` No , I will not leave , no , nor forsake thee , '
YLT	Hebrews	13	6	so that we do boldly say , ` The Lord [ is ] to me a helper , and I will not fear what man shall do to me . '
YLT	Hebrews	13	7	Be mindful of those leading you , who did speak to you the word of God , whose faith -- considering the issue of the behaviour -- be imitating ,
YLT	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same , and to the ages ;
YLT	Hebrews	13	9	with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about , for [ it is ] good that by grace the heart be confirmed , not with meats , in which they who were occupied were not profited ;
YLT	Hebrews	13	10	we have an altar , of which to eat they have no authority who the tabernacle are serving ,
YLT	Hebrews	13	11	for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest -- of these the bodies are burned without the camp .
YLT	Hebrews	13	12	Wherefore , also Jesus -- that he might sanctify through [ his ] own blood the people -- without the gate did suffer ;
YLT	Hebrews	13	14	for we have not here an abiding city , but the coming one we seek ;
YLT	Hebrews	13	15	through him , then , we may offer up a sacrifice of praise always to God , that is , the fruit of lips , giving thanks to His name ;
YLT	Hebrews	13	16	and of doing good , and of fellowship , be not forgetful , for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased .
YLT	Hebrews	13	17	Be obedient to those leading you , and be subject , for these do watch for your souls , as about to give account , that with joy they may do this , and not sighing , for this [ is ] unprofitable to you .
YLT	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us , for we trust that we have a good conscience , in all things willing to behave well ,
YLT	Hebrews	13	19	and more abundantly do I call upon [ you ] to do this , that more quickly I may be restored to you .
YLT	Hebrews	13	20	And the God of the peace , who did bring up out of the dead the great shepherd of the sheep -- in the blood of an age-during covenant -- our Lord Jesus ,
YLT	Hebrews	13	21	make you perfect in every good work to do His will , doing in you that which is well-pleasing before Him , through Jesus Christ , to whom [ is ] the glory -- to the ages of the ages ! Amen .
YLT	Hebrews	13	22	And I entreat you , brethren , suffer the word of the exhortation , for also through few words I have written to you .
YLT	Hebrews	13	23	Know ye that the brother Timotheus is released , with whom , if he may come more shortly , I will see you .
YLT	Hebrews	13	24	Salute all those leading you , and all the saints ; salute you doth those from Italy :
YLT	Hebrews	13	25	the grace [ is ] with you all ! Amen .
YLT	James	1	1	James , of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ a servant , to the Twelve Tribes who are in the dispersion : Hail !
YLT	James	1	2	All joy count [ it ] , my brethren , when ye may fall into temptations manifold ;
YLT	James	1	3	knowing that the proof of your faith doth work endurance ,
YLT	James	1	4	and let the endurance have a perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire -- in nothing lacking ;
YLT	James	1	5	and if any of you do lack wisdom , let him ask from God , who is giving to all liberally , and not reproaching , and it shall be given to him ;
YLT	James	1	6	and let him ask in faith , nothing doubting , for he who is doubting hath been like a wave of the sea , driven by wind and tossed ,
YLT	James	1	7	for let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord --
YLT	James	1	8	a two-souled man [ is ] unstable in all his ways .
YLT	James	1	9	And let the brother who is low rejoice in his exaltation ,
YLT	James	1	10	and the rich in his becoming low , because as a flower of grass he shall pass away ;
YLT	James	1	11	for the sun did rise with the burning heat , and did wither the grass , and the flower of it fell , and the grace of its appearance did perish , so also the rich in his way shall fade away !
YLT	James	1	12	Happy the man who doth endure temptation , because , becoming approved , he shall receive the crown of the life , which the Lord did promise to those loving Him .
YLT	James	1	13	Let no one say , being tempted -- ` From God I am tempted , ' for God is not tempted of evil , and Himself doth tempt no one ,
YLT	James	1	14	and each one is tempted , by his own desires being led away and enticed ,
YLT	James	1	15	afterward the desire having conceived , doth give birth to sin , and the sin having been perfected , doth bring forth death .
YLT	James	1	16	Be not led astray , my brethren beloved ;
YLT	James	1	17	every good giving , and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of the lights , with whom is no variation , or shadow of turning ;
YLT	James	1	18	having counselled , He did beget us with a word of truth , for our being a certain first-fruit of His creatures .
YLT	James	1	19	So then , my brethren beloved , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to anger ,
YLT	James	1	20	for the wrath of a man the righteousness of God doth not work ;
YLT	James	1	21	wherefore having put aside all filthiness and superabundance of evil , in meekness be receiving the engrafted word , that is able to save your souls ;
YLT	James	1	22	and become ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving yourselves ,
YLT	James	1	23	because , if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer , this one hath been like to a man viewing his natural face in a mirror ,
YLT	James	1	24	for he did view himself , and hath gone away , and immediately he did forget of what kind he was ;
YLT	James	1	25	and he who did look into the perfect law -- that of liberty , and did continue there , this one -- not a forgetful hearer becoming , but a doer of work -- this one shall be happy in his doing .
YLT	James	1	26	If any one doth think to be religious among you , not bridling his tongue , but deceiving his heart , of this one vain [ is ] the religion ;
YLT	James	1	27	religion pure and undefiled with the God and Father is this , to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation -- unspotted to keep himself from the world .
YLT	James	2	2	for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold ring , in gay raiment , and there may come in also a poor man in vile raiment ,
YLT	James	2	3	and ye may look upon him bearing the gay raiment , and may say to him , ` Thou -- sit thou here well , ' and to the poor man may say , ` Thou -- stand thou there , or , Sit thou here under my footstool , ' --
YLT	James	2	4	ye did not judge fully in yourselves , and did become ill-reasoning judges .
YLT	James	2	5	Hearken , my brethren beloved , did not God choose the poor of this world , rich in faith , and heirs of the reign that He promised to those loving Him ?
YLT	James	2	6	and ye did dishonour the poor one ; do not the rich oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats ;
YLT	James	2	7	do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was called upon you ?
YLT	James	2	8	If , indeed , royal law ye complete , according to the Writing , ` Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself , ' -- ye do well ;
YLT	James	2	9	and if ye accept persons , sin ye do work , being convicted by the law as transgressors ;
YLT	James	2	10	for whoever the whole law shall keep , and shall stumble in one [ point ] , he hath become guilty of all ;
YLT	James	2	11	for He who is saying , ` Thou mayest not commit adultery , ' said also , ` Thou mayest do no murder ; ' and if thou shalt not commit adultery , and shalt commit murder , thou hast become a transgressor of law ;
YLT	James	2	12	so speak ye and so do , as about by a law of liberty to be judged ,
YLT	James	2	13	for the judgment without kindness [ is ] to him not having done kindness , and exult doth kindness over judgment .
YLT	James	2	14	What [ is ] the profit , my brethren , if faith , any one may speak of having , and works he may not have ? is that faith able to save him ?
YLT	James	2	15	and if a brother or sister may be naked , and may be destitute of the daily food ,
YLT	James	2	16	and any one of you may say to them , ` Depart ye in peace , be warmed , and be filled , ' and may not give to them the things needful for the body , what [ is ] the profit ?
YLT	James	2	17	so also the faith , if it may not have works , is dead by itself .
YLT	James	2	18	But say may some one , Thou hast faith , and I have works , shew me thy faith out of thy works , and I will shew thee out of my works my faith :
YLT	James	2	19	thou -- thou dost believe that God is one ; thou dost well , and the demons believe , and they shudder !
YLT	James	2	20	And dost thou wish to know , O vain man , that the faith apart from the works is dead ?
YLT	James	2	21	Abraham our father -- was not he declared righteous out of works , having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar ?
YLT	James	2	22	dost thou see that the faith was working with his works , and out of the works the faith was perfected ?
YLT	James	2	23	and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying , ` And Abraham did believe God , and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness ; ' and , ` Friend of God ' he was called .
YLT	James	2	24	Ye see , then , that out of works is man declared righteous , and not out of faith only ;
YLT	James	2	25	and in like manner also Rahab the harlot -- was she not out of works declared righteous , having received the messengers , and by another way having sent forth ?
YLT	James	2	26	for as the body apart from the spirit is dead , so also the faith apart from the works is dead .
YLT	James	3	3	lo , the bits we put into the mouths of the horses for their obeying us , and their whole body we turn about ;
YLT	James	3	2	for we all make many stumbles ; if any one in word doth not stumble , this one [ is ] a perfect man , able to bridle also the whole body ;
YLT	James	3	4	lo , also the ships , being so great , and by fierce winds being driven , are led about by a very small helm , whithersoever the impulse of the helmsman doth counsel ,
YLT	James	3	5	so also the tongue is a little member , and doth boast greatly ; lo , a little fire how much wood it doth kindle !
YLT	James	3	6	and the tongue [ is ] a fire , the world of the unrighteousness , so the tongue is set in our members , which is spotting our whole body , and is setting on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by the gehenna .
YLT	James	3	7	For every nature , both of beasts and of fowls , both of creeping things and things of the sea , is subdued , and hath been subdued , by the human nature ,
YLT	James	3	8	and the tongue no one of men is able to subdue , [ it is ] an unruly evil , full of deadly poison ,
YLT	James	3	9	with it we do bless the God and Father , and with it we do curse the men made according to the similitude of God ;
YLT	James	3	10	out of the same mouth doth come forth blessing and cursing ; it doth not need , my brethren , these things so to happen ;
YLT	James	3	11	doth the fountain out of the same opening pour forth the sweet and the bitter ?
YLT	James	3	12	is a fig-tree able , my brethren , olives to make ? or a vine figs ? so no fountain salt and sweet water [ is able ] to make .
YLT	James	3	13	Who [ is ] wise and intelligent among you ? let him shew out of the good behaviour his works in meekness of wisdom ,
YLT	James	3	14	and if bitter zeal ye have , and rivalry in your heart , glory not , nor lie against the truth ;
YLT	James	3	15	this wisdom is not descending from above , but earthly , physical , demon-like ,
YLT	James	3	16	for where zeal and rivalry [ are ] , there is insurrection and every evil matter ;
YLT	James	3	17	and the wisdom from above , first , indeed , is pure , then peaceable , gentle , easily entreated , full of kindness and good fruits , uncontentious , and unhypocritical : --
YLT	James	3	18	and the fruit of the righteousness in peace is sown to those making peace .
YLT	James	4	4	Adulterers and adulteresses ! have ye not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whoever , then , may counsel to be a friend of the world , an enemy of God he is set .
YLT	James	4	2	ye desire , and ye have not ; ye murder , and are zealous , and are not able to attain ; ye fight and war , and ye have not , because of your not asking ;
YLT	James	4	3	ye ask , and ye receive not , because evilly ye ask , that in your pleasures ye may spend [ it ] .
YLT	James	4	5	Do ye think that emptily the Writing saith , ` To envy earnestly desireth the spirit that did dwell in us , '
YLT	James	4	6	and greater grace he doth give , wherefore he saith , ` God against proud ones doth set Himself up , and to lowly ones He doth give grace ? '
YLT	James	4	7	be subject , then , to God ; stand up against the devil , and he will flee from you ;
YLT	James	4	8	draw nigh to God , and He will draw nigh to you ; cleanse hands , ye sinners ! and purify hearts , ye two-souled !
YLT	James	4	9	be exceeding afflicted , and mourn , and weep , let your laughter to mourning be turned , and the joy to heaviness ;
YLT	James	4	10	be made low before the Lord , and He shall exalt you .
YLT	James	4	11	Speak not one against another , brethren ; he who is speaking against a brother , and is judging his brother , doth speak against law , and doth judge law , and if law thou dost judge , thou art not a doer of law but a judge ;
YLT	James	4	12	one is the lawgiver , who is able to save and to destroy ; thou -- who art thou that dost judge the other ?
YLT	James	4	13	Go , now , ye who are saying , ` To-day and to-morrow we will go on to such a city , and will pass there one year , and traffic , and make gain ; '
YLT	James	4	14	who do not know the thing of the morrow ; for what is your life ? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a little , and then is vanishing ;
YLT	James	4	15	instead of your saying , ` If the Lord may will , we shall live , and do this or that ; '
YLT	James	4	16	and now ye glory in your pride ; all such glorying is evil ;
YLT	James	4	17	to him , then , knowing to do good , and not doing , sin it is to him .
YLT	James	5	5	ye did live in luxury upon the earth , and were wanton ; ye did nourish your hearts , as in a day of slaughter ;
YLT	James	5	2	your riches have rotted , and your garments have become moth-eaten ;
YLT	James	5	3	your gold and silver have rotted , and the rust of them for a testimony shall be to you , and shall eat your flesh as fire . Ye made treasure in the last days !
YLT	James	5	4	lo , the reward of the workmen , of those who in-gathered your fields , which hath been fraudulently kept back by you -- doth cry out , and the exclamations of those who did reap into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth have entered ;
YLT	James	5	6	ye did condemn -- ye did murder the righteous one , he doth not resist you .
YLT	James	5	7	Be patient , then , brethren , till the presence of the Lord ; lo , the husbandman doth expect the precious fruit of the earth , being patient for it , till he may receive rain -- early and latter ;
YLT	James	5	8	be patient , ye also ; establish your hearts , because the presence of the Lord hath drawn nigh ;
YLT	James	5	9	murmur not against one another , brethren , that ye may not be condemned ; lo , the Judge before the door hath stood .
YLT	James	5	10	An example take ye of the suffering of evil , my brethren , and of the patience , the prophets who did speak in the name of the Lord ;
YLT	James	5	11	lo , we call happy those who are enduring ; the endurance of Job ye heard of , and the end of the Lord ye have seen , that very compassionate is the Lord , and pitying .
YLT	James	5	12	And before all things , my brethren , do not swear , neither by the heaven , neither by the earth , neither by any other oath , and let your Yes be Yes , and the No , No ; that under judgment ye may not fall .
YLT	James	5	13	Doth any one suffer evil among you ? let him pray ; is any of good cheer ? let him sing psalms ;
YLT	James	5	14	is any infirm among you ? let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , having anointed him with oil , in the name of the Lord ,
YLT	James	5	15	and the prayer of the faith shall save the distressed one , and the Lord shall raise him up , and if sins he may have committed , they shall be forgiven to him .
YLT	James	5	16	Be confessing to one another the trespasses , and be praying for one another , that ye may be healed ; very strong is a working supplication of a righteous man ;
YLT	James	5	17	Elijah was a man like affected as we , and with prayer he did pray -- not to rain , and it did not rain upon the land three years and six months ;
YLT	James	5	18	and again he did pray , and the heaven did give rain , and the land did bring forth her fruit .
YLT	James	5	19	Brethren , if any among you may go astray from the truth , and any one may turn him back ,
YLT	James	5	20	let him know that he who did turn back a sinner from the straying of his way shall save a soul from death , and shall cover a multitude of sins .
YLT	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the choice sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	2	according to a foreknowledge of God the Father , in sanctification of the Spirit , to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace be multiplied !
YLT	1%20Peter	1	3	Blessed [ is ] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who , according to the abundance of His kindness did beget us again to a living hope , through the rising again of Jesus Christ out of the dead ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	4	to an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and unfading , reserved in the heavens for you ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	5	who , in the power of God are being guarded , through faith , unto salvation , ready to be revealed in the last time ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	6	in which ye are glad , a little now , if it be necessary , being made to sorrow in manifold trials ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	7	that the proof of your faith -- much more precious than of gold that is perishing , and through fire being approved -- may be found to praise , and honour , and glory , in the revelation of Jesus Christ ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	8	whom , not having seen , ye love , in whom , now not seeing and believing , ye are glad with joy unspeakable and glorified ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	9	receiving the end of your faith -- salvation of souls ;
YLT	1%20Peter	1	10	concerning which salvation seek out and search out did prophets who concerning the grace toward you did prophecy ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	11	searching in regard to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ that was in them was manifesting , testifying beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory after these ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	12	to whom it was revealed , that not to themselves , but to us they were ministering these , which now were told to you ( through those who did proclaim good news to you , ) in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven , to which things messengers do desire to bend looking .
YLT	1%20Peter	1	13	Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind , being sober , hope perfectly upon the grace that is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	14	as obedient children , not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	15	but according as He who did call you [ is ] holy , ye also , become holy in all behaviour ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	16	because it hath been written , ` Become ye holy , because I am holy ; '
YLT	1%20Peter	1	17	and if on the Father ye do call , who without acceptance of persons is judging according to the work of each , in fear the time of your sojourn pass ye ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	18	having known that , not with corruptible things -- silver or gold -- were ye redeemed from your foolish behaviour delivered by fathers ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	19	but with precious blood , as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted -- Christ 's --
YLT	1%20Peter	1	20	foreknown , indeed , before the foundation of the world , and manifested in the last times because of you ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	21	who through him do believe in God , who did raise out of the dead , and glory to him did give , so that your faith and hope may be in God .
YLT	1%20Peter	1	22	Your souls having purified in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to brotherly love unfeigned , out of a pure heart one another love ye earnestly ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	23	being begotten again , not out of seed corruptible , but incorruptible , through a word of God -- living and remaining -- to the age ;
YLT	1%20Peter	1	24	because all flesh [ is ] as grass , and all glory of man as flower of grass ; wither did the grass , and the flower of it fell away ,
YLT	1%20Peter	1	25	and the saying of the Lord doth remain -- to the age ; and this is the saying that was proclaimed good news to you .
YLT	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter
YLT	1%20Peter	2	2	as new-born babes the word 's pure milk desire ye , that in it ye may grow ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	3	if so be ye did taste that the Lord [ is ] gracious ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	4	to whom coming -- a living stone -- by men , indeed , having been disapproved of , but with God choice , precious ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	5	and ye yourselves , as living stones , are built up , a spiritual house , a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
YLT	1%20Peter	2	6	Wherefore , also , it is contained in the Writing : ` Lo , I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone , choice , precious , and he who is believing on him may not be put to shame ; '
YLT	1%20Peter	2	7	to you , then , who are believing [ is ] the preciousness ; and to the unbelieving , a stone that the builders disapproved of , this one did become for the head of a corner ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	8	and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence -- who are stumbling at the word , being unbelieving , -- to which also they were set ;
YLT	1%20Peter	2	9	and ye [ are ] a choice race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people acquired , that the excellences ye may shew forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous light ;
YLT	1%20Peter	2	10	who [ were ] once not a people , and [ are ] now the people of God ; who had not found kindness , and now have found kindness .
YLT	1%20Peter	2	11	Beloved , I call upon [ you ] , as strangers and sojourners , to keep from the fleshly desires , that war against the soul ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	12	having your behaviour among the nations right , that in that which they speak against you as evil-doers , of the good works having beheld , they may glorify God in a day of inspection .
YLT	1%20Peter	2	13	Be subject , then , to every human creation , because of the Lord , whether to a king , as the highest ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	14	whether to governors , as to those sent through him , for punishment , indeed , of evil-doers , and a praise of those doing good ;
YLT	1%20Peter	2	15	because , so is the will of God , doing good , to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men ;
YLT	1%20Peter	2	16	as free , and not having the freedom as the cloak of the evil , but as servants of God ;
YLT	1%20Peter	2	17	to all give ye honour ; the brotherhood love ye ; God fear ye ; the king honour ye .
YLT	1%20Peter	2	18	The domestics ! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters , not only to the good and gentle , but also to the cross ;
YLT	1%20Peter	2	19	for this [ is ] gracious , if because of conscience toward God any one doth endure sorrows , suffering unrighteously ;
YLT	1%20Peter	2	20	for what renown [ is it ] , if sinning and being buffeted , ye do endure [ it ] ? but if , doing good and suffering [ for it ] , ye do endure , this [ is ] gracious with God ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	21	for to this ye were called , because Christ also did suffer for you , leaving to you an example , that ye may follow his steps ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	22	who did not commit sin , nor was guile found in his mouth ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	23	who being reviled -- was not reviling again , suffering -- was not threatening , and was committing himself to Him who is judging righteously ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	24	who our sins himself did bear in his body , upon the tree , that to the sins having died , to the righteousness we may live ; by whose stripes ye were healed ,
YLT	1%20Peter	2	25	for ye were as sheep going astray , but ye turned back now to the shepherd and overseer of your souls .
YLT	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter
YLT	1%20Peter	3	3	whose adorning -- let it not be that which is outward , of plaiting of hair , and of putting around of things of gold , or of putting on of garments ,
YLT	1%20Peter	3	2	having beheld your pure behaviour in fear ,
YLT	1%20Peter	3	4	but -- the hidden man of the heart , in the incorruptible thing of the meek and quiet spirit , which is , before God , of great price ,
YLT	1%20Peter	3	5	for thus once also the holy women who did hope on God , were adorning themselves , being subject to their own husbands ,
YLT	1%20Peter	3	6	as Sarah was obedient to Abraham , calling him ` sir , ' of whom ye did become daughters , doing good , and not fearing any terror .
YLT	1%20Peter	3	7	The husbands , in like manner , dwelling with [ them ] , according to knowledge , as to a weaker vessel -- to the wife -- imparting honour , as also being heirs together of the grace of life , that your prayers be not hindered .
YLT	1%20Peter	3	8	And finally , being all of one mind , having fellow-feeling , loving as brethren , compassionate , courteous ,
YLT	1%20Peter	3	9	not giving back evil for evil , or railing for railing , and on the contrary , blessing , having known that to this ye were called , that a blessing ye may inherit ;
YLT	1%20Peter	3	10	for ` he who is willing to love life , and to see good days , let him guard his tongue from evil , and his lips -- not to speak guile ;
YLT	1%20Peter	3	11	let him turn aside from evil , and do good , let him seek peace and pursue it ;
YLT	1%20Peter	3	12	because the eyes of the Lord [ are ] upon the righteous , and His ears -- to their supplication , and the face of the Lord [ is ] upon those doing evil ; '
YLT	1%20Peter	3	13	and who [ is ] he who will be doing you evil , if of Him who is good ye may become imitators ?
YLT	1%20Peter	3	14	but if ye also should suffer because of righteousness , happy [ are ye ] ! and of their fear be not afraid , nor be troubled ,
YLT	1%20Peter	3	15	and the Lord God sanctify in your hearts . And [ be ] ready always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that [ is ] in you , with meekness and fear ;
YLT	1%20Peter	3	16	having a good conscience , that in that in which they speak against you as evil-doers , they may be ashamed who are traducing your good behaviour in Christ ;
YLT	1%20Peter	3	17	for [ it is ] better doing good , if the will of God will it , to suffer , than doing evil ;
YLT	1%20Peter	3	18	because also Christ once for sin did suffer -- righteous for unrighteous -- that he might lead us to God , having been put to death indeed , in the flesh , and having been made alive in the spirit ,
YLT	1%20Peter	3	19	in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did preach ,
YLT	1%20Peter	3	20	who sometime disbelieved , when once the long-suffering of God did wait , in days of Noah -- an ark being preparing -- in which few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water ;
YLT	1%20Peter	3	21	also to which an antitype doth now save us -- baptism , ( not a putting away of the filth of flesh , but the question of a good conscience in regard to God , ) through the rising again of Jesus Christ ,
YLT	1%20Peter	3	22	who is at the right hand of God , having gone on to heaven -- messengers , and authorities , and powers , having been subjected to him .
YLT	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter
YLT	1%20Peter	4	4	in which they think it strange -- your not running with them to the same excess of dissoluteness , speaking evil ,
YLT	1%20Peter	4	2	no more in the desires of men , but in the will of God , to live the rest of the time in the flesh ;
YLT	1%20Peter	4	3	for sufficient to us [ is ] the past time of life the will of the nations to have wrought , having walked in lasciviousnesses , desires , excesses of wines , revelings , drinking-bouts , and unlawful idolatries ,
YLT	1%20Peter	4	5	who shall give an account to Him who is ready to judge living and dead ,
YLT	1%20Peter	4	6	for for this also to dead men was good news proclaimed , that they may be judged , indeed , according to men in the flesh , and may live according to God in the spirit .
YLT	1%20Peter	4	7	And of all things the end hath come nigh ; be sober-minded , then , and watch unto the prayers ,
YLT	1%20Peter	4	8	and , before all things , to one another having the earnest love , because the love shall cover a multitude of sins ;
YLT	1%20Peter	4	9	hospitable to one another , without murmuring ;
YLT	1%20Peter	4	10	each , according as he received a gift , to one another ministering it , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God ;
YLT	1%20Peter	4	11	if any one doth speak -- ` as oracles of God ; ' if any one doth minister -- ` as of the ability which God doth supply ; ' that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom is the glory and the power -- to the ages of the ages . Amen .
YLT	1%20Peter	4	12	Beloved , think it not strange at the fiery suffering among you that is coming to try you , as if a strange thing were happening to you ,
YLT	1%20Peter	4	13	but , according as ye have fellowship with the sufferings of the Christ , rejoice ye , that also in the revelation of his glory ye may rejoice -- exulting ;
YLT	1%20Peter	4	14	if ye be reproached in the name of Christ -- happy [ are ye ] , because the Spirit of glory and of God upon you doth rest ; in regard , indeed , to them , he is evil-spoken of , and in regard to you , he is glorified ;
YLT	1%20Peter	4	15	for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or thief , or evil-doer , or as an inspector into other men 's matters ;
YLT	1%20Peter	4	16	and if as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; and let him glorify God in this respect ;
YLT	1%20Peter	4	17	because it is the time of the beginning of the judgment from the house of God , and if first from us , what the end of those disobedient to the good news of God ?
YLT	1%20Peter	4	18	And if the righteous man is scarcely saved , the ungodly and sinner -- where shall he appear ?
YLT	1%20Peter	4	19	so that also those suffering according to the will of god , as to a stedfast Creator , let them commit their own souls in good doing .
YLT	1%20Peter	5	1	Peter
YLT	1%20Peter	5	5	In like manner , ye younger , be subject to elders , and all to one another subjecting yourselves ; with humble-mindedness clothe yourselves , because God the proud doth resist , but to the humble He doth give grace ;
YLT	1%20Peter	5	2	feed the flock of God that [ is ] among you , overseeing not constrainedly , but willingly , neither for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ,
YLT	1%20Peter	5	3	neither as exercising lordship over the heritages , but patterns becoming of the flock ,
YLT	1%20Peter	5	4	and at the manifestation of the chief Shepherd , ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory .
YLT	1%20Peter	5	6	be humbled , then , under the powerful hand of God , that you He may exalt in good time ,
YLT	1%20Peter	5	7	all your care having cast upon Him , because He careth for you .
YLT	1%20Peter	5	8	Be sober , vigilant , because your opponent the devil , as a roaring lion , doth walk about , seeking whom he may swallow up ,
YLT	1%20Peter	5	9	whom resist , stedfast in the faith , having known the same sufferings to your brotherhood in the world to be accomplished .
YLT	1%20Peter	5	10	And the God of all grace , who did call you to His age-during glory in Christ Jesus , having suffered a little , Himself make you perfect , establish , strengthen , settle [ you ] ;
YLT	1%20Peter	5	11	to Him [ is ] the glory , and the power -- to the ages and the ages ! Amen .
YLT	1%20Peter	5	12	Through Silvanus , to you the faithful brother , as I reckon , through few [ words ] I did write , exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace of God in which ye have stood .
YLT	1%20Peter	5	13	Salute you doth the [ assembly ] in Babylon jointly elected , and Markus my son .
YLT	1%20Peter	5	14	Salute ye one another in a kiss of love ; peace to you all who [ are ] in Christ Jesus ! Amen .
YLT	2%20Peter	1	2	Grace to you , and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgement of God and of Jesus our Lord !
YLT	2%20Peter	1	1	Simeon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who did obtain a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ :
YLT	2%20Peter	1	3	As all things to us His divine power ( the things pertaining unto life and piety ) hath given , through the acknowledgement of him who did call us through glory and worthiness ,
YLT	2%20Peter	1	4	through which to us the most great and precious promises have been given , that through these ye may become partakers of a divine nature , having escaped from the corruption in the world in desires .
YLT	2%20Peter	1	5	And this same also -- all diligence having brought in besides , superadd in your faith the worthiness , and in the worthiness the knowledge ,
YLT	2%20Peter	1	6	and in the knowledge the temperance , and in the temperance the endurance , and in the endurance the piety ,
YLT	2%20Peter	1	7	and in the piety the brotherly kindness , and in the brotherly kindness the love ;
YLT	2%20Peter	1	8	for these things being to you and abounding , do make [ you ] neither inert nor unfruitful in regard to the acknowledging of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
YLT	2%20Peter	1	9	for he with whom these things are not present is blind , dim-sighted , having become forgetful of the cleansing of his old sins ;
YLT	2%20Peter	1	10	wherefore , the rather , brethren , be diligent to make stedfast your calling and choice , for these things doing , ye may never stumble ,
YLT	2%20Peter	1	11	for so , richly shall be superadded to you the entrance into the age-during reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
YLT	2%20Peter	1	12	Wherefore , I will not be careless always to remind you concerning these things , though , having known them , and having been established in the present truth ,
YLT	2%20Peter	1	13	and I think right , so long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up in reminding [ you ] ,
YLT	2%20Peter	1	14	having known that soon is the laying aside of my tabernacle , even as also our Lord Jesus Christ did shew to me ,
YLT	2%20Peter	1	15	and I will be diligent that also at every time ye have , after my outgoing , power to make to yourselves the remembrance of these things .
YLT	2%20Peter	1	16	For , skilfully devised fables not having followed out , we did make known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ , but eye-witnesses having become of his majesty --
YLT	2%20Peter	1	17	for having received from God the Father honour and glory , such a voice being borne to him by the excellent glory : ` This is My Son -- the beloved , in whom I was well pleased ; '
YLT	2%20Peter	1	18	and this voice we -- we did hear , out of heaven borne , being with him in the holy mount .
YLT	2%20Peter	1	19	And we have more firm the prophetic word , to which we do well giving heed , as to a lamp shining in a dark place , till day may dawn , and a morning star may arise -- in your hearts ;
YLT	2%20Peter	1	20	this first knowing , that no prophecy of the Writing doth come of private exposition ,
YLT	2%20Peter	1	21	for not by will of man did ever prophecy come , but by the Holy Spirit borne on holy men of God spake .
YLT	2%20Peter	2	2	and many shall follow out their destructive ways , because of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	3	and in covetousness , with moulded words , of you they shall make merchandise , whose judgment of old is not idle , and their destruction doth not slumber .
YLT	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God messengers who sinned did not spare , but with chains of thick gloom , having cast [ them ] down to Tartarus , did deliver [ them ] to judgment , having been reserved ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	5	and the old world did not spare , but the eighth person , Noah , of righteousness a preacher , did keep , a flood on the world of the impious having brought ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	6	and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah having turned to ashes , with an overthrow did condemn , an example to those about to be impious having set [ them ] ;
YLT	2%20Peter	2	7	and righteous Lot , worn down by the conduct in lasciviousness of the impious , He did rescue ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	8	for in seeing and hearing , the righteous man , dwelling among them , day by day the righteous soul with unlawful works was harassing .
YLT	2%20Peter	2	9	The Lord hath known to rescue pious ones out of temptation , and unrighteous ones to a day of judgment , being punished , to keep ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	10	and chiefly those going behind the flesh in desire of uncleanness , and lordship despising ; presumptuous , self-complacent , dignities they are not afraid to speak evil of ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	11	whereas messengers , in strength and power being greater , do not bear against them before the Lord an evil speaking judgment ;
YLT	2%20Peter	2	12	and these , as irrational natural beasts , made to be caught and destroyed -- in what things they are ignorant of , speaking evil -- in their destruction shall be destroyed ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	13	about to receive a reward of unrighteousness , pleasures counting the luxury in the day , spots and blemishes , luxuriating in their deceits , feasting with you ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	14	having eyes full of adultery , and unable to cease from sin , enticing unstable souls , having an heart exercised in covetousnesses , children of a curse ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	15	having forsaken a right way , they did go astray , having followed in the way of Balaam the [ son ] of Bosor , who a reward of unrighteousness did love ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	16	and had a rebuke of his own iniquity -- a dumb ass , in man 's voice having spoken , did forbid the madness of the prophet .
YLT	2%20Peter	2	17	These are wells without water , and clouds by a tempest driven , to whom the thick gloom of the darkness to the age hath been kept ;
YLT	2%20Peter	2	18	for overswellings of vanity speaking , they do entice in desires of the flesh -- lasciviousnesses , those who had truly escaped from those conducting themselves in error ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	19	liberty to them promising , themselves being servants of the corruption , for by whom any one hath been overcome , to this one also he hath been brought to servitude ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	20	for , if having escaped from the pollutions of the world , in the acknowledging of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , and by these again being entangled , they have been overcome , become to them hath the last things worse than the first ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	21	for it were better to them not to have acknowledged the way of the righteousness , than having acknowledged [ it ] , to turn back from the holy command delivered to them ,
YLT	2%20Peter	2	22	and happened to them hath that of the true similitude ; ` A dog did turn back upon his own vomit , ' and , ` A sow having bathed herself -- to rolling in mire . '
YLT	2%20Peter	3	2	to be mindful of the sayings said before by the holy prophets , and of the command of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour ,
YLT	2%20Peter	3	3	this first knowing , that there shall come in the latter end of the days scoffers , according to their own desires going on ,
YLT	2%20Peter	3	4	and saying , ` Where is the promise of his presence ? for since the fathers did fall asleep , all things so remain from the beginning of the creation ; '
YLT	2%20Peter	3	5	for this is unobserved by them willingly , that the heavens were of old , and the earth out of water and through water standing together by the word of God ,
YLT	2%20Peter	3	6	through which the then world , by water having been deluged , was destroyed ;
YLT	2%20Peter	3	7	and the present heavens and the earth , by the same word are treasured , for fire being kept to a day of judgment and destruction of the impious men .
YLT	2%20Peter	3	8	And this one thing let not be unobserved by you , beloved , that one day with the Lord [ is ] as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day ;
YLT	2%20Peter	3	9	the Lord is not slow in regard to the promise , as certain count slowness , but is long-suffering to us , not counselling any to be lost but all to pass on to reformation ,
YLT	2%20Peter	3	10	and it will come -- the day of the Lord -- as a thief in the night , in which the heavens with a rushing noise will pass away , and the elements with burning heat be dissolved , and earth and the works in it shall be burnt up .
YLT	2%20Peter	3	11	All these , then , being dissolved , what kind of persons doth it behove you to be in holy behaviours and pious acts ?
YLT	2%20Peter	3	12	waiting for and hasting to the presence of the day of God , by which the heavens , being on fire , shall be dissolved , and the elements with burning heat shall melt ;
YLT	2%20Peter	3	13	and for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise we do wait , in which righteousness doth dwell ;
YLT	2%20Peter	3	14	wherefore , beloved , these things waiting for , be diligent , spotless and unblameable , by Him to be found in peace ,
YLT	2%20Peter	3	15	and the long-suffering of our Lord count ye salvation , according as also our beloved brother Paul -- according to the wisdom given to him -- did write to you ,
YLT	2%20Peter	3	16	as also in all the epistles , speaking in them concerning these things , among which things are certain hard to be understood , which the untaught and unstable do wrest , as also the other Writings , unto their own destruction .
YLT	2%20Peter	3	17	Ye , then , beloved , knowing before , take heed , lest , together with the error of the impious being led away , ye may fall from your own stedfastness ,
YLT	2%20Peter	3	18	and increase ye in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ; to him [ is ] the glory both now , and to the day of the age ! Amen .
YLT	1%20John	1	1	That which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we did behold , and our hands did handle , concerning the Word of the Life --
YLT	1%20John	1	2	and the Life was manifested , and we have seen , and do testify , and declare to you the Life , the age-during , which was with the Father , and was manifested to us --
YLT	1%20John	1	3	that which we have seen and heard declare we to you , that ye also may have fellowship with us , and our fellowship [ is ] with the Father , and with His Son Jesus Christ ;
YLT	1%20John	1	4	and these things we write to you , that your joy may be full .
YLT	1%20John	1	5	And this is the message that we have heard from Him , and announce to you , that God is light , and darkness in Him is not at all ;
YLT	1%20John	1	6	if we may say -- ` we have fellowship with Him , ' and in the darkness may walk -- we lie , and do not the truth ;
YLT	1%20John	1	7	and if in the light we may walk , as He is in the light -- we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son doth cleanse us from every sin ;
YLT	1%20John	1	8	if we may say -- ` we have not sin , ' ourselves we lead astray , and the truth is not in us ;
YLT	1%20John	1	9	if we may confess our sins , stedfast He is and righteous that He may forgive us the sins , and may cleanse us from every unrighteousness ;
YLT	1%20John	1	10	if we may say -- ` we have not sinned , ' a liar we make Him , and His word is not in us .
YLT	1%20John	2	1	John
YLT	1%20John	2	2	and he -- he is a propitiation for our sins , and not for ours only , but also for the whole world ,
YLT	1%20John	2	3	and in this we know that we have known him , if his commands we may keep ;
YLT	1%20John	2	4	he who is saying , ` I have known him , ' and his command is not keeping , a liar he is , and in him the truth is not ;
YLT	1%20John	2	5	and whoever may keep his word , truly in him the love of God hath been perfected ; in this we know that in him we are .
YLT	1%20John	2	6	He who is saying in him he doth remain , ought according as he walked also himself so to walk .
YLT	1%20John	2	7	Brethren , a new command I write not to you , but an old command , that ye had from the beginning -- the old command is the word that ye heard from the beginning ;
YLT	1%20John	2	8	again , a new command I write to you , which thing is true in him and in you , because the darkness doth pass away , and the true light doth now shine ;
YLT	1%20John	2	9	he who is saying , in the light he is , and his brother is hating , in the darkness he is till now ;
YLT	1%20John	2	10	he who is loving his brother , in the light he doth remain , and a stumbling-block in him there is not ;
YLT	1%20John	2	11	and he who is hating his brother , in the darkness he is , and in the darkness he doth walk , and he hath not known whither he doth go , because the darkness did blind his eyes .
YLT	1%20John	2	12	I write to you , little children , because the sins have been forgiven you through his name ;
YLT	1%20John	2	13	I write to you , fathers , because ye have known him who [ is ] from the beginning ; I write to you , young men , because ye have overcome the evil . I write to you , little youths , because ye have known the Father :
YLT	1%20John	2	14	I did write to you , fathers , because ye have known him who [ is ] from the beginning ; I did write to you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God in you doth remain , and ye have overcome the evil .
YLT	1%20John	2	15	Love not ye the world , nor the things in the world ; if any one doth love the world , the love of the Father is not in him ,
YLT	1%20John	2	16	because all that [ is ] in the world -- the desire of the flesh , and the desire of the eyes , and the ostentation of the life -- is not of the Father , but of the world ,
YLT	1%20John	2	17	and the world doth pass away , and the desire of it , and he who is doing the will of God , he doth remain -- to the age .
YLT	1%20John	2	18	Little youths , it is the last hour ; and even as ye heard that the antichrist doth come , even now antichrists have become many -- whence we know that it is the last hour ;
YLT	1%20John	2	19	out of us they went forth , but they were not of us , for if they had been of us , they would have remained with us ; but -- that they might be manifested that they are not all of us .
YLT	1%20John	2	20	And ye have an anointing from the Holy One , and have known all things ;
YLT	1%20John	2	21	I did not write to you because ye have not known the truth , but because ye have known it , and because no lie is of the truth .
YLT	1%20John	2	22	Who is the liar , except he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ ? this one is the antichrist who is denying the Father and the Son ;
YLT	1%20John	2	23	every one who is denying the Son , neither hath he the Father , [ he who is confessing the Son hath the Father also . ]
YLT	1%20John	2	24	Ye , then , that which ye heard from the beginning , in you let it remain ; if in you may remain that which from the beginning ye did hear , ye also in the Son and in the Father shall remain ,
YLT	1%20John	2	25	and this is the promise that He did promise us -- the life the age-during .
YLT	1%20John	2	26	These things I did write to you concerning those leading you astray ;
YLT	1%20John	2	27	and you , the anointing that ye did receive from him , in you it doth remain , and ye have no need that any one may teach you , but as the same anointing doth teach you concerning all , and is true , and is not a lie , and even as was taught you , ye shall remain in him .
YLT	1%20John	2	28	And now , little children , remain in him , that when he may be manifested , we may have boldness , and may not be ashamed before him , in his presence ;
YLT	1%20John	2	29	if ye know that he is righteous , know ye that every one doing the righteousness , of him hath been begotten .
YLT	1%20John	3	1	John
YLT	1%20John	3	3	and every one who is having this hope on him , doth purify himself , even as he is pure .
YLT	1%20John	3	2	beloved , now , children of God are we , and it was not yet manifested what we shall be , and we have known that if he may be manifested , like him we shall be , because we shall see him as he is ;
YLT	1%20John	3	4	Every one who is doing the sin , the lawlessness also he doth do , and the sin is the lawlessness ,
YLT	1%20John	3	5	and ye have known that he was manifested that our sins he may take away , and sin is not in him ;
YLT	1%20John	3	6	every one who is remaining in him doth not sin ; every one who is sinning , hath not seen him , nor known him .
YLT	1%20John	3	7	Little children , let no one lead you astray ; he who is doing the righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous ,
YLT	1%20John	3	8	he who is doing the sin , of the devil he is , because from the beginning the devil doth sin ; for this was the Son of God manifested , that he may break up the works of the devil ;
YLT	1%20John	3	9	every one who hath been begotten of God , sin he doth not , because his seed in him doth remain , and he is not able to sin , because of God he hath been begotten .
YLT	1%20John	3	10	In this manifest are the children of God , and the children of the devil ; every one who is not doing righteousness , is not of God , and he who is not loving his brother ,
YLT	1%20John	3	11	because this is the message that ye did hear from the beginning , that we may love one another ,
YLT	1%20John	3	12	not as Cain -- of the evil one he was , and he did slay his brother , and wherefore did he slay him ? because his works were evil , and those of his brother righteous .
YLT	1%20John	3	13	Do not wonder , my brethren , if the world doth hate you ;
YLT	1%20John	3	14	we -- we have known that we have passed out of the death to the life , because we love the brethren ; he who is not loving the brother doth remain in the death .
YLT	1%20John	3	15	Every one who is hating his brother -- a man-killer he is , and ye have known that no man-killer hath life age-during in him remaining ,
YLT	1%20John	3	16	in this we have known the love , because he for us his life did lay down , and we ought for the brethren the lives to lay down ;
YLT	1%20John	3	17	and whoever may have the goods of the world , and may view his brother having need , and may shut up his bowels from him -- how doth the love of God remain in him ?
YLT	1%20John	3	18	My little children , may we not love in word nor in tongue , but in word and in truth !
YLT	1%20John	3	19	and in this we know that of the truth we are , and before Him we shall assure our hearts ,
YLT	1%20John	3	20	because if our heart may condemn -- because greater is God than our heart , and He doth know all things .
YLT	1%20John	3	21	Beloved , if our heart may not condemn us , we have boldness toward God ,
YLT	1%20John	3	22	and whatever we may ask , we receive from Him , because His commands we keep , and the things pleasing before Him we do ,
YLT	1%20John	3	23	and this is His command , that we may believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ , and may love one another , even as He did give command to us ,
YLT	1%20John	3	24	and he who is keeping His commands , in Him he doth remain , and He in him ; and in this we know that He doth remain in us , from the Spirit that He gave us .
YLT	1%20John	4	1	John
YLT	1%20John	4	4	Ye -- of God ye are , little children , and ye have overcome them ; because greater is He who [ is ] in you , than he who is in the world .
YLT	1%20John	4	2	in this know ye the Spirit of God ; every spirit that doth confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come , of God it is ,
YLT	1%20John	4	3	and every spirit that doth not confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come , of God it is not ; and this is that of the antichrist , which ye heard that it doth come , and now in the world it is already .
YLT	1%20John	4	5	They -- of the world they are ; because of this from the world they speak , and the world doth hear them ;
YLT	1%20John	4	6	we -- of God we are ; he who is knowing God doth hear us ; he who is not of God , doth not hear us ; from this we know the spirit of the truth , and the spirit of the error .
YLT	1%20John	4	7	Beloved , may we love one another , because the love is of God , and every one who is loving , of God he hath been begotten , and doth know God ;
YLT	1%20John	4	8	he who is not loving did not know God , because God is love .
YLT	1%20John	4	9	In this was manifested the love of God in us , because His Son -- the only begotten -- hath God sent to the world , that we may live through him ;
YLT	1%20John	4	10	in this is the love , not that we loved God , but that He did love us , and did send His Son a propitiation for our sins .
YLT	1%20John	4	11	Beloved , if thus did God love us , we also ought one another to love ;
YLT	1%20John	4	12	God no one hath ever seen ; if we may love one another , God in us doth remain , and His love is having been perfected in us ;
YLT	1%20John	4	13	in this we know that in Him we do remain , and He in us , because of His Spirit He hath given us .
YLT	1%20John	4	14	And we -- we have seen and do testify , that the Father hath sent the Son -- Saviour of the world ;
YLT	1%20John	4	15	whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God in him doth remain , and he in God ;
YLT	1%20John	4	16	and we -- we have known and believed the love , that God hath in us ; God is love , and he who is remaining in the love , in God he doth remain , and God in him .
YLT	1%20John	4	17	In this made perfect hath been the love with us , that boldness we may have in the day of the judgment , because even as He is , we -- we also are in this world ;
YLT	1%20John	4	18	fear is not in the love , but the perfect love doth cast out the fear , because the fear hath punishment , and he who is fearing hath not been made perfect in the love ;
YLT	1%20John	4	19	we -- we love him , because He -- He first loved us ;
YLT	1%20John	4	20	if any one may say -- ` I love God , ' and his brother he may hate , a liar he is ; for he who is not loving his brother whom he hath seen , God -- whom he hath not seen -- how is he able to love ?
YLT	1%20John	4	21	and this [ is ] the command we have from Him , that he who is loving God , may also love his brother .
YLT	1%20John	5	1	John
YLT	1%20John	5	5	who is he who is overcoming the world , if not he who is believing that Jesus is the Son of God ?
YLT	1%20John	5	2	in this we know that we love the children of God , when we may love God , and His commands may keep ;
YLT	1%20John	5	3	for this is the love of God , that His commands we may keep , and His commands are not burdensome ;
YLT	1%20John	5	4	because every one who is begotten of God doth overcome the world , and this is the victory that did overcome the world -- our faith ;
YLT	1%20John	5	6	This one is he who did come through water and blood -- Jesus the Christ , not in the water only , but in the water and the blood ; and the Spirit it is that is testifying , because the Spirit is the truth ,
YLT	1%20John	5	7	because three are who are testifying [ in the heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Spirit , and these -- the three -- are one ;
YLT	1%20John	5	8	and three are who are testifying in the earth ] , the Spirit , and the water , and the blood , and the three are into the one .
YLT	1%20John	5	9	If the testimony of men we receive , the testimony of God is greater , because this is the testimony of God that He hath testified concerning His Son .
YLT	1%20John	5	10	He who is believing in the Son of God , hath the testimony in himself ; he who is not believing God , a liar hath made Him , because he hath not believed in the testimony that God hath testified concerning His Son ;
YLT	1%20John	5	11	and this is the testimony , that life age-during did God give to us , and this -- the life -- is in His Son ;
YLT	1%20John	5	12	he who is having the Son , hath the life ; he who is not having the Son of God -- the life he hath not .
YLT	1%20John	5	13	These things I did write to you who are believing in the name of the Son of God , that ye may know that life ye have age-during , and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God .
YLT	1%20John	5	14	And this is the boldness that we have toward Him , that if anything we may ask according to his will , He doth hear us ,
YLT	1%20John	5	15	and if we have known that He doth hear us , whatever we may ask , we have known that we have the requests that we have requested from Him .
YLT	1%20John	5	16	If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto death , he shall ask , and He shall give to him life to those sinning not unto death ; there is sin to death , not concerning it do I speak that he may beseech ;
YLT	1%20John	5	17	all unrighteousness is sin , and there is sin not unto death .
YLT	1%20John	5	18	We have known that every one who hath been begotten of God doth not sin , but he who was begotten of God doth keep himself , and the evil one doth not touch him ;
YLT	1%20John	5	19	we have known that of God we are , and the whole world in the evil doth lie ;
YLT	1%20John	5	20	and we have known that the Son of God is come , and hath given us a mind , that we may know Him who is true , and we are in Him who is true , in His Son Jesus Christ ; this one is the true God and the life age-during !
YLT	1%20John	5	21	Little children , guard yourselves from the idols ! Amen .
YLT	2%20John	1	2	because of the truth that is remaining in us , and with us shall be to the age ,
YLT	2%20John	1	1	The Elder to the choice Kyria , and to her children , whom I love in truth , and not I only , but also all those having known the truth ,
YLT	2%20John	1	3	there shall be with you grace , kindness , peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
YLT	2%20John	1	4	I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of thy children walking in truth , even as a command we did receive from the Father ;
YLT	2%20John	1	5	and now I beseech thee , Kyria , not as writing to thee a new command , but which we had from the beginning , that we may love one another ,
YLT	2%20John	1	6	and this is the love , that we may walk according to His commands ; this is the command , even as ye did hear from the beginning , that in it ye may walk ,
YLT	2%20John	1	7	because many leading astray did enter into the world , who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh ; this one is he who is leading astray , and the antichrist .
YLT	2%20John	1	8	See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we wrought , but a full reward may receive ;
YLT	2%20John	1	9	every one who is transgressing , and is not remaining in the teaching of the Christ , hath not God ; he who is remaining in the teaching of the Christ , this one hath both the Father and the Son ;
YLT	2%20John	1	10	if any one doth come unto you , and this teaching doth not bear , receive him not into the house , and say not to him , ` Hail ! '
YLT	2%20John	1	11	for he who is saying to him , ` Hail , ' hath fellowship with his evil works .
YLT	2%20John	1	12	Many things having to write to you , I did not intend through paper and ink , but I hope to come unto you , and speak mouth to mouth , that our joy may be full ;
YLT	2%20John	1	13	salute thee do the children of thy choice sister . Amen .
YLT	3%20John	1	3	for I rejoiced exceedingly , brethren coming and testifying of the truth in thee , even as thou in truth dost walk ;
YLT	3%20John	1	1	The Elder to Gaius the beloved , whom I love in truth !
YLT	3%20John	1	2	beloved , concerning all things I desire thee to prosper , and to be in health , even as thy soul doth prosper ,
YLT	3%20John	1	4	greater than these things I have no joy , that I may hear of my children in truth walking .
YLT	3%20John	1	5	Beloved , faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work to the brethren and to the strangers ,
YLT	3%20John	1	6	who did testify of thy love before an assembly , whom thou wilt do well , having sent forward worthily of God ,
YLT	3%20John	1	7	because for [ His ] name they went forth , nothing receiving from the nations ;
YLT	3%20John	1	8	we , then , ought to receive such , that fellow-workers we may become to the truth .
YLT	3%20John	1	9	I did write to the assembly , but he who is loving the first place among them -- Diotrephes -- doth not receive us ;
YLT	3%20John	1	10	because of this , if I may come , I will cause him to remember his works that he doth , with evil words prating against us ; and not content with these , neither doth he himself receive the brethren , and those intending he doth forbid , and out of the assembly he doth cast .
YLT	3%20John	1	11	Beloved , be not thou following that which is evil , but that which is good ; he who is doing good , of God he is , and he who is doing evil hath not seen God ;
YLT	3%20John	1	12	to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all , and by the truth itself , and we also -- we do testify , and ye have known that our testimony is true .
YLT	3%20John	1	13	Many things I had to write , but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to thee ,
YLT	3%20John	1	14	and I hope straightway to see thee , and mouth to mouth we shall speak . Peace to thee ! salute thee do the friends ; be saluting the friends by name .
YLT	Jude	1	1	Judas , of Jesus Christ a servant , and brother of James , to those sanctified in God the Father , and in Jesus Christ kept -- called ,
YLT	Jude	1	2	kindness to you , and peace , and love , be multiplied !
YLT	Jude	1	3	Beloved , all diligence using to write to you concerning the common salvation , I had necessity to write to you , exhorting to agonize for the faith once delivered to the saints ,
YLT	Jude	1	4	for there did come in unobserved certain men , long ago having been written beforehand to this judgment , impious , the grace of our God perverting to lasciviousness , and our only Master , God , and Lord -- Jesus Christ -- denying ,
YLT	Jude	1	5	and to remind you I intend , you knowing once this , that the Lord , a people out of the land of Egypt having saved , again those who did not believe did destroy ;
YLT	Jude	1	6	messengers also , those who did not keep their own principality , but did leave their proper dwelling , to a judgment of a great day , in bonds everlasting , under darkness He hath kept ,
YLT	Jude	1	7	as Sodom and Gomorrah , and the cities around them , in like manner to these , having given themselves to whoredom , and gone after other flesh , have been set before -- an example , of fire age-during , justice suffering .
YLT	Jude	1	8	In like manner , nevertheless , those dreaming also the flesh indeed do defile , and lordship they put away , and dignities they speak evil of ,
YLT	Jude	1	9	yet Michael , the chief messenger , when , with the devil contending , he was disputing about the body of Moses , did not dare to bring up an evil-speaking judgment , but said , ` The Lord rebuke thee ! '
YLT	Jude	1	10	and these , as many things indeed as they have not known , they speak evil of ; and as many things as naturally ( as the irrational beasts ) they understand , in these they are corrupted ;
YLT	Jude	1	11	wo to them ! because in the way of Cain they did go on , and to the deceit of Balaam for reward they did rush , and in the gainsaying of Korah they did perish .
YLT	Jude	1	12	These are in your love-feasts craggy rocks ; feasting together with you , without fear shepherding themselves ; clouds without water , by winds carried about ; trees autumnal , without fruit , twice dead , rooted up ;
YLT	Jude	1	13	wild waves of a sea , foaming out their own shames ; stars going astray , to whom the gloom of the darkness to the age hath been kept .
YLT	Jude	1	14	And prophesy also to these did the seventh from Adam -- Enoch -- saying , ` Lo , the Lord did come in His saintly myriads ,
YLT	Jude	1	15	to do judgment against all , and to convict all their impious ones , concerning all their works of impiety that they did impiously , and concerning all the stiff things that speak against Him did impious sinners . '
YLT	Jude	1	16	These are murmurers , repiners ; according to their desires walking , and their mouth doth speak great swellings , giving admiration to persons for the sake of profit ;
YLT	Jude	1	17	and ye , beloved , remember ye the sayings spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ :
YLT	Jude	1	18	that they said to you , that in the last time there shall be scoffers , after their own desires of impieties going on ,
YLT	Jude	1	19	these are those setting themselves apart , natural men , the Spirit not having .
YLT	Jude	1	20	And ye , beloved , on your most holy faith building yourselves up , in the Holy Spirit praying ,
YLT	Jude	1	21	yourselves in the love of God keep ye , waiting for the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ -- to life age-during ;
YLT	Jude	1	22	and to some be kind , judging thoroughly ,
YLT	Jude	1	23	and some in fear save ye , out of the fire snatching , hating even the coat from the flesh spotted .
YLT	Jude	1	24	And to Him who is able to guard you not stumbling , and to set [ you ] in the presence of His glory unblemished , in gladness ,
YLT	Jude	1	25	to the only wise God our Saviour , [ is ] glory and greatness , power and authority , both now and to all the ages ! Amen .
YLT	Revelation	1	1	A revelation of Jesus Christ , that God gave to him , to shew to his servants what things it behoveth to come to pass quickly ; and he did signify [ it ] , having sent through his messenger to his servant John ,
YLT	Revelation	1	2	who did testify the word of God , and the testimony of Jesus Christ , as many things also as he did see .
YLT	Revelation	1	3	Happy is he who is reading , and those hearing , the words of the prophecy , and keeping the things written in it -- for the time is nigh !
YLT	Revelation	1	4	John to the seven assemblies that [ are ] in Asia : Grace to you , and peace , from Him who is , and who was , and who is coming , and from the Seven Spirits that are before His throne ,
YLT	Revelation	1	5	and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the first-born out of the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth ; to him who did love us , and did bathe us from our sins in his blood ,
YLT	Revelation	1	6	and did make us kings and priests to his God and Father , to him [ is ] the glory and the power to the ages of the ages ! Amen .
YLT	Revelation	1	7	Lo , he doth come with the clouds , and see him shall every eye , even those who did pierce him , and wail because of him shall all the tribes of the land . Yes ! Amen !
YLT	Revelation	1	8	` I am the Alpha and the Omega , beginning and end , saith the Lord , who is , and who was , and who is coming -- the Almighty . '
YLT	Revelation	1	9	I , John , who also [ am ] your brother , and fellow-partner in the tribulation , and in the reign and endurance , of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , because of the word of God , and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ ;
YLT	Revelation	1	10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's-day , and I heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet , saying ,
YLT	Revelation	1	11	` I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last ; ' and , ` What thou dost see , write in a scroll , and send to the seven assemblies that [ are ] in Asia ; to Ephesus , and to Smyrna , and to Pergamos , and to Thyatira , and to Sardis , and to Philadelphia , and to Laodicea . '
YLT	Revelation	1	12	And I did turn to see the voice that did speak with me , and having turned , I saw seven golden lamp-stands ,
YLT	Revelation	1	13	and in the midst of the seven lamp-stands , [ one ] like to a son of man , clothed to the foot , and girt round at the breast with a golden girdle ,
YLT	Revelation	1	14	and his head and hairs white , as if white wool -- as snow , and his eyes as a flame of fire ;
YLT	Revelation	1	15	and his feet like to fine brass , as in a furnace having been fired , and his voice as a sound of many waters ,
YLT	Revelation	1	16	and having in his right hand seven stars , and out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword is proceeding , and his countenance [ is ] as the sun shining in its might .
YLT	Revelation	1	17	And when I saw him , I did fall at his feet as dead , and he placed his right hand upon me , saying to me , ` Be not afraid ; I am the First and the Last ,
YLT	Revelation	1	18	and he who is living , and I did become dead , and , lo , I am living to the ages of the ages . Amen ! and I have the keys of the hades and of the death .
YLT	Revelation	1	19	` Write the things that thou hast seen , and the things that are , and the things that are about to come after these things ;
YLT	Revelation	1	20	the secret of the seven stars that thou hast seen upon my right hand , and the seven golden lamp-stands : the seven stars are messengers of the seven assemblies , and the seven lamp-stands that thou hast seen are seven assemblies .
YLT	Revelation	2	2	I have known thy works , and thy labour , and thy endurance , and that thou art not able to bear evil ones , and that thou hast tried those saying themselves to be apostles and are not , and hast found them liars ,
YLT	Revelation	2	3	and thou didst bear , and hast endurance , and because of my name hast toiled , and hast not been weary .
YLT	Revelation	2	4	` But I have against thee : That thy first love thou didst leave !
YLT	Revelation	2	5	remember , then , whence thou hast fallen , and reform , and the first works do ; and if not , I come to thee quickly , and will remove thy lamp-stand from its place -- if thou mayest not reform ;
YLT	Revelation	2	6	but this thou hast , that thou dost hate the works of the Nicolaitans , that I also hate .
YLT	Revelation	2	7	He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies : To him who is overcoming -- I will give to him to eat of the tree of life that is in the midst of the paradise of God .
YLT	Revelation	2	8	` And to the messenger of the assembly of the Smyrneans write : These things saith the First and the Last , who did become dead and did live ;
YLT	Revelation	2	9	I have known thy works , and tribulation , and poverty -- yet thou art rich -- and the evil-speaking of those saying themselves to be Jews , and are not , but [ are ] a synagogue of the Adversary .
YLT	Revelation	2	10	` Be not afraid of the things that thou art about to suffer ; lo , the devil is about to cast of you to prison , that ye may be tried , and ye shall have tribulation ten days ; become thou faithful unto death , and I will give to thee the crown of the life .
YLT	Revelation	2	11	He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies : He who is overcoming may not be injured of the second death .
YLT	Revelation	2	12	` And to the messenger of the assembly in Pergamos write : These things saith he who is having the sharp two-edged sword :
YLT	Revelation	2	13	I have known thy works , and where thou dost dwell -- where the throne of the Adversary [ is ] -- and thou dost hold fast my name , and thou didst not deny my faith , even in the days in which Antipas [ was ] my faithful witness , who was put to death beside you , where the Adversary doth dwell .
YLT	Revelation	2	14	` But I have against thee a few things : That thou hast there those holding the teaching of Balaam , who did teach Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel , to eat idol-sacrifices , and to commit whoredom ;
YLT	Revelation	2	15	so hast thou , even thou , those holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans -- which thing I hate .
YLT	Revelation	2	16	` Reform ! and if not , I come to thee quickly , and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
YLT	Revelation	2	17	He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies : To him who is overcoming , I will give to him to eat from the hidden manna , and will give to him a white stone , and upon the stone a new name written , that no one knew except him who is receiving [ it ] .
YLT	Revelation	2	18	` And to the messenger of the assembly of Thyatira write : These things saith the Son of God , who is having his eyes as a flame of fire , and his feet like to fine brass ;
YLT	Revelation	2	19	I have known thy works , and love , and ministration , and faith , and thy endurance , and thy works -- and the last [ are ] more than the first .
YLT	Revelation	2	20	` But I have against thee a few things : That thou dost suffer the woman Jezebel , who is calling herself a prophetess , to teach , and to lead astray , my servants to commit whoredom , and idol-sacrifices to eat ;
YLT	Revelation	2	21	and I did give to her a time that she might reform from her whoredom , and she did not reform ;
YLT	Revelation	2	22	lo , I will cast her into a couch , and those committing adultery with her into great tribulation -- if they may not repent of their works ,
YLT	Revelation	2	23	and her children I will kill in death , and know shall all the assemblies that I am he who is searching reins and hearts ; and I will give to you -- to each -- according to your works .
YLT	Revelation	2	24	` And to you I say , and to the rest who are in Thyatira , as many as have not this teaching , and who did not know the depths of the Adversary , as they say ; I will not put upon you other burden ;
YLT	Revelation	2	25	but that which ye have -- hold ye , till I may come ;
YLT	Revelation	2	26	and he who is overcoming , and who is keeping unto the end my works , I will give to him authority over the nations ,
YLT	Revelation	2	27	and he shall rule them with a rod of iron -- as the vessels of the potter they shall be broken -- as I also have received from my Father ;
YLT	Revelation	2	28	and I will give to him the morning star .
YLT	Revelation	2	29	He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies .
YLT	Revelation	3	3	` Remember , then , how thou hast received , and heard , and be keeping , and reform : if , then , thou mayest not watch , I will come upon thee as a thief , and thou mayest not know what hour I will come upon thee .
YLT	Revelation	3	2	become watching , and strengthen the rest of the things that are about to die , for I have not found thy works fulfilled before God .
YLT	Revelation	3	4	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis who did not defile their garments , and they shall walk with me in white , because they are worthy .
YLT	Revelation	3	5	He who is overcoming -- this one -- shall be arrayed in white garments , and I will not blot out his name from the scroll of the life , and I will confess his name before my Father , and before His messengers .
YLT	Revelation	3	6	He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies .
YLT	Revelation	3	7	` And to the messenger of the assembly in Philadelphia write : These things saith he who is holy , he who is true , he who is having the key of David , he who is opening and no one doth shut , and he shutteth and no one doth open !
YLT	Revelation	3	8	I have known thy works ; lo , I have set before thee a door -- opened , and no one is able to shut it , because thou hast a little power , and didst keep my word , and didst not deny my name ;
YLT	Revelation	3	9	lo , I make of the synagogue of the Adversary those saying themselves to be Jews , and are not , but do lie ; lo , I will make them that they may come and bow before thy feet , and may know that I loved thee .
YLT	Revelation	3	10	` Because thou didst keep the word of my endurance , I also will keep thee from the hour of the trial that is about to come upon all the world , to try those dwelling upon the earth .
YLT	Revelation	3	11	Lo , I come quickly , be holding fast that which thou hast , that no one may receive thy crown .
YLT	Revelation	3	12	He who is overcoming -- I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of my God , and without he may not go any more , and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , that doth come down out of the heaven from my God -- also my new name .
YLT	Revelation	3	13	He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies .
YLT	Revelation	3	14	` And to the messenger of the assembly of the Laodiceans write : These things saith the Amen , the witness -- the faithful and true -- the chief of the creation of God ;
YLT	Revelation	3	15	I have known thy works , that neither cold art thou nor hot ; I would thou wert cold or hot .
YLT	Revelation	3	16	So -- because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I am about to vomit thee out of my mouth ;
YLT	Revelation	3	17	because thou sayest -- I am rich , and have grown rich , and have need of nothing , and hast not known that thou art the wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked ,
YLT	Revelation	3	18	I counsel thee to buy from me gold fired by fire , that thou mayest be rich , and white garments that thou mayest be arrayed , and the shame of thy nakedness may not be manifest , and with eye-salve anoint thine eyes , that thou mayest see .
YLT	Revelation	3	19	` As many as I love , I do convict and chasten ; be zealous , then , and reform ;
YLT	Revelation	3	20	lo , I have stood at the door , and I knock ; if any one may hear my voice , and may open the door , I will come in unto him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
YLT	Revelation	3	21	He who is overcoming -- I will give to him to sit with me in my throne , as I also did overcome and did sit down with my Father in His throne .
YLT	Revelation	3	22	He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies . '
YLT	Revelation	4	4	And around the throne [ are ] thrones twenty and four , and upon the thrones I saw the twenty and four elders sitting , clothed in white garments , and they had upon their heads crowns of gold ;
YLT	Revelation	4	2	and immediately I was in the Spirit , and lo , a throne was set in the heaven , and upon the throne is [ one ] sitting ,
YLT	Revelation	4	3	and He who is sitting was in sight like a stone , jasper and sardine : and a rainbow was round the throne in sight like an emerald .
YLT	Revelation	4	5	and out of the throne proceed do lightnings , and thunders , and voices ; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne , which are the Seven Spirits of God ,
YLT	Revelation	4	6	and before the throne [ is ] a sea of glass like to crystal , and in the midst of the throne , and round the throne , [ are ] four living creatures , full of eyes before and behind ;
YLT	Revelation	4	7	and the first living creature [ is ] like a lion , and the second living creature [ is ] like a calf , and the third living creature hath the face as a man , and the fourth living creature [ is ] like an eagle flying .
YLT	Revelation	4	8	And the four living creatures , each by itself severally , had six wings , around and within [ are ] full of eyes , and rest they have not day and night , saying , ` Holy , holy , holy , Lord God Almighty , who was , and who is , and who is coming ; '
YLT	Revelation	4	9	and when the living creatures do give glory , and honour , and thanks , to Him who is sitting upon the throne , who is living to the ages of the ages ,
YLT	Revelation	4	10	fall down do the twenty and four elders before Him who is sitting upon the throne , and bow before Him who is living to the ages of the ages , and they cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
YLT	Revelation	4	11	` Worthy art Thou , O Lord , to receive the glory , and the honour , and the power , because Thou -- Thou didst create the all things , and because of Thy will are they , and they were created . '
YLT	Revelation	5	5	and one of the elders saith to me , ` Weep not ; lo , overcome did the Lion , who is of the tribe of Judah , the root of David , to open the scroll , and to loose the seven seals of it ;
YLT	Revelation	5	2	and I saw a strong messenger crying with a great voice , ` Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose the seals of it ? '
YLT	Revelation	5	3	and no one was able in the heaven , nor upon the earth , nor under the earth , to open the scroll , nor to behold it .
YLT	Revelation	5	4	And I was weeping much , because no one was found worthy to open and to read the scroll , nor to behold it ,
YLT	Revelation	5	6	and I saw , and lo , in the midst of the throne , and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a Lamb hath stood as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the Seven Spirits of God , which are sent to all the earth ,
YLT	Revelation	5	7	and he came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who is sitting upon the throne .
YLT	Revelation	5	8	And when he took the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb , having each one harps and golden vials full of perfumes , which are the prayers of the saints ,
YLT	Revelation	5	9	and they sing a new song , saying , ` Worthy art thou to take the scroll , and to open the seals of it , because thou wast slain , and didst redeem us to God in thy blood , out of every tribe , and tongue , and people , and nation ,
YLT	Revelation	5	10	and didst make us to our God kings and priests , and we shall reign upon the earth . '
YLT	Revelation	5	11	And I saw , and I heard the voice of many messengers round the throne , and the living creatures , and the elders -- and the number of them was myriads of myriads , and thousands of thousands --
YLT	Revelation	5	12	saying with a great voice , ` Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive the power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing ! '
YLT	Revelation	5	13	and every creature that is in the heaven , and in the earth , and under the earth , and the things that are upon the sea , and the all things in them , heard I saying , ` To Him who is sitting upon the throne , and to the Lamb , [ is ] the blessing , and the honour , and the glory , and the might -- to the ages of the ages ! '
YLT	Revelation	5	14	and the four living creatures said , ` Amen ! ' and the twenty-four elders fell down and they bow before Him who is living to the ages of the ages .
YLT	Revelation	6	6	and I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , ` A measure of wheat for a denary , and three measures of barley for a denary , ' and ` The oil and the wine thou mayest not injure . '
YLT	Revelation	6	2	and I saw , and lo , a white horse , and he who is sitting upon it is having a bow , and there was given to him a crown , and he went forth overcoming , and that he may overcome .
YLT	Revelation	6	3	And when he opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature saying , ` Come and behold ! '
YLT	Revelation	6	4	and there went forth another horse -- red , and to him who is sitting upon it , there was given to him to take the peace from the land , and that one another they may slay , and there was given to him a great sword .
YLT	Revelation	6	5	And when he opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature saying , ` Come and behold ! ' and I saw , and lo , a black horse , and he who is sitting upon it is having a balance in his hand ,
YLT	Revelation	6	7	And when he opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying , ` Come and behold ! '
YLT	Revelation	6	8	and I saw , and lo , a pale horse , and he who is sitting upon him -- his name is Death , and Hades doth follow with him , and there was given to them authority to kill , ( over the fourth part of the land , ) with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and by the beasts of the land .
YLT	Revelation	6	9	And when he opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those slain because of the word of God , and because of the testimony that they held ,
YLT	Revelation	6	10	and they were crying with a great voice , saying , ` Till when , O Master , the Holy and the True , dost Thou not judge and take vengeance of our blood from those dwelling upon the land ? '
YLT	Revelation	6	11	and there was given to each one white robes , and it was said to them that they may rest themselves yet a little time , till may be fulfilled also their fellow-servants and their brethren , who are about to be killed -- even as they .
YLT	Revelation	6	12	And I saw when he opened the sixth seal , and lo , a great earthquake came , and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ,
YLT	Revelation	6	13	and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth -- as a fig-tree doth cast her winter figs , by a great wind being shaken --
YLT	Revelation	6	14	and heaven departed as a scroll rolled up , and every mountain and island -- out of their places they were moved ;
YLT	Revelation	6	15	and the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich , and the chiefs of thousands , and the mighty , and every servant , and every freeman , hid themselves in the dens , and in the rocks of the mountains ,
YLT	Revelation	6	16	and they say to the mountains and to the rocks , ` Fall upon us , and hide us from the face of Him who is sitting upon the throne , and from the anger of the Lamb , '
YLT	Revelation	6	17	because come did the great day of His anger , and who is able to stand ?
YLT	Revelation	7	7	of the tribe of Simeon
YLT	Revelation	7	2	and I saw another messenger going up from the rising of the sun , having a seal of the living God , and he did cry with a great voice to the four messengers , to whom it was given to injure the land and the sea , saying ,
YLT	Revelation	7	3	` Do not injure the land , nor the sea , nor the trees , till we may seal the servants of our God upon their foreheads . '
YLT	Revelation	7	4	And I heard the number of those sealed , (
YLT	Revelation	7	144	thousands were sealed out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel ) :
YLT	Revelation	7	5	of the tribe of Judah
YLT	Revelation	7	12	saying , ` Amen ! the blessing , and the glory , and the wisdom , and the thanksgiving , and the honour , and the power , and the strength , [ are ] to our God -- to the ages of the ages ! Amen ! '
YLT	Revelation	7	6	of the tribe of Asher
YLT	Revelation	7	8	of the tribe of Zebulun
YLT	Revelation	7	9	After these things I saw , and lo , a great multitude , which to number no one was able , out of all nations , and tribes , and peoples , and tongues , standing before the throne , and before the Lamb , arrayed in white robes , and palms in their hands ,
YLT	Revelation	7	10	and crying with a great voice , saying , ` The salvation [ is ] to Him who is sitting upon the throne -- to our God , and to the Lamb ! '
YLT	Revelation	7	11	And all the messengers stood around the throne , and the elders and the four living creatures , and they fell upon their face , and bowed before God ,
YLT	Revelation	7	13	And answer did one of the elders , saying to me , ` These , who have been arrayed with the white robes -- who are they , and whence came they ? '
YLT	Revelation	7	14	and I have said to him , ` Sir , thou hast known ; ' and he said to me , ` These are those who are coming out of the great tribulation , and they did wash their robes , and they made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb ;
YLT	Revelation	7	15	because of this are they before the throne of God , and they do service to Him day and night in His sanctuary , and He who is sitting upon the throne shall tabernacle over them ;
YLT	Revelation	7	16	they shall not hunger any more , nor may the sun fall upon them , nor any heat ,
YLT	Revelation	7	17	because the Lamb that [ is ] in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters , and wipe away shall God every tear from their eyes . '
YLT	Revelation	8	8	And the second messenger did sound , and as it were a great mountain with fire burning was cast into the sea , and the third of the sea became blood ,
YLT	Revelation	8	2	and I saw the seven messengers who before God have stood , and there were given to them seven trumpets ,
YLT	Revelation	8	3	and another messenger did come , and he stood at the altar , having a golden censer , and there was given to him much perfume , that he may give [ it ] to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that [ is ] before the throne ,
YLT	Revelation	8	4	and go up did the smoke of the perfumes to the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the messenger , before God ;
YLT	Revelation	8	5	and the messenger took the censer , and did fill it out of the fire of the altar , and did cast [ it ] to the earth , and there came voices , and thunders , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
YLT	Revelation	8	6	And the seven messengers who are having the seven trumpets did prepare themselves that they may sound ;
YLT	Revelation	8	7	and the first messenger did sound , and there came hail and fire , mingled with blood , and it was cast to the land , and the third of the trees was burnt up , and all the green grass was burnt up .
YLT	Revelation	8	9	and die did the third of the creatures that [ are ] in the sea , those having life , and the third of the ships were destroyed .
YLT	Revelation	8	10	And the third messenger did sound , and there fell out of the heaven a great star , burning as a lamp , and it did fall upon the third of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ,
YLT	Revelation	8	11	and the name of the star is called Wormwood , and the third of the waters doth become wormwood , and many of the men did die of the waters , because they were made bitter .
YLT	Revelation	8	12	And the fourth messenger did sound , and smitten was the third of the sun , and the third of the moon , and the third of the stars , that darkened may be the third of them , and that the day may not shine -- the third of it , and the night in like manner .
YLT	Revelation	8	13	And I saw , and I heard one messenger , flying in the mid-heaven , saying with a great voice , ` Wo , wo , wo , to those dwelling upon the land from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three messengers who are about to sound . '
YLT	Revelation	9	9	and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron , and the noise of their wings [ is ] as the noise of chariots of many horses running to battle ;
YLT	Revelation	9	2	and he did open the pit of the abyss , and there came up a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace , and darkened was the sun and the air , from the smoke of the pit .
YLT	Revelation	9	3	And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth , and there was given to them authority , as scorpions of the earth have authority ,
YLT	Revelation	9	4	and it was said to them that they may not injure the grass of the earth , nor any green thing , nor any tree , but -- the men only who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads ,
YLT	Revelation	9	5	and it was given to them that they may not kill them , but that they may be tormented five months , and their torment [ is ] as the torment of a scorpion , when it may strike a man ;
YLT	Revelation	9	6	and in those days shall men seek the death , and they shall not find it , and they shall desire to die , and the death shall flee from them .
YLT	Revelation	9	7	And the likenesses of the locusts [ are ] like to horses made ready to battle , and upon their heads as crowns like gold , and their faces as faces of men ,
YLT	Revelation	9	8	and they had hair as hair of women , and their teeth were as [ those ] of lions ,
YLT	Revelation	9	10	and they have tails like to scorpions , and stings were in their tails ; and their authority [ is ] to injure men five months ;
YLT	Revelation	9	11	and they have over them a king -- the messenger of the abyss -- a name [ is ] to him in Hebrew , Abaddon , and in the Greek he hath a name , Apollyon .
YLT	Revelation	9	12	The first wo did go forth , lo , there come yet two woes after these things .
YLT	Revelation	9	13	And the sixth messenger did sound , and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the altar of gold that is before God ,
YLT	Revelation	9	14	saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet , ` Loose the four messengers who are bound at the great river Euphrates ; '
YLT	Revelation	9	15	and loosed were the four messengers , who have been made ready for the hour , and day , and month , and year , that they may kill the third of men ;
YLT	Revelation	9	16	and the number of the forces of the horsemen [ is ] two myriads of myriads , and I heard the number of them .
YLT	Revelation	9	17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and those sitting upon them , having breastplates of fire , and jacinth , and brimstone ; and the heads of the horses [ are ] as heads of lions , and out of their mouths proceedeth fire , and smoke , and brimstone ;
YLT	Revelation	9	18	by these three were the third of men killed , from the fire , and from the smoke , and from the brimstone , that is proceeding out of their mouth ,
YLT	Revelation	9	19	for their authorities are in their mouth , and in their tails , for their tails [ are ] like serpents , having heads , and with them they do injure ;
YLT	Revelation	9	20	and the rest of men , who were not killed in these plagues , neither did reform from the works of their hands , that they may not bow before the demons , and idols , those of gold , and those of silver , and those of brass , and those of stone , and those of wood , that are neither able to see , nor to hear , nor to walk ,
YLT	Revelation	9	21	yea they did not reform from their murders , nor from their sorceries , nor from their whoredoms , nor from their thefts .
YLT	Revelation	10	10	And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the messenger , and did eat it up , and it was in my mouth as honey -- sweet , and when I did eat it -- my belly was made bitter ;
YLT	Revelation	10	2	and he had in his hand a little scroll opened , and he did place his right foot upon the sea , and the left upon the land ,
YLT	Revelation	10	3	and he cried with a great voice , as a lion doth roar , and when he cried , speak out did the seven thunders their voices ;
YLT	Revelation	10	4	and when the seven thunders spake their voices , I was about to write , and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me , ` Seal the things that the seven thunders spake , ' and , ` Thou mayest not write these things . '
YLT	Revelation	10	5	And the messenger whom I saw standing upon the sea , and upon the land , did lift up his hand to the heaven ,
YLT	Revelation	10	6	and did swear in Him who doth live to the ages of the ages , who did create the heaven and the things in it , and the land and the things in it , and the sea and the things in it -- that time shall not be yet ,
YLT	Revelation	10	7	but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger , when he may be about to sound , and the secret of God may be finished , as He did declare to His own servants , to the prophets .
YLT	Revelation	10	8	And the voice that I heard out of the heaven is again speaking with me , and saying , ` Go , take the little scroll that is open in the hand of the messenger who hath been standing upon the sea , and upon the land : '
YLT	Revelation	10	9	and I went away unto the messenger , saying to him , ` Give me the little scroll ; ' and he saith to me , ` Take , and eat it up , and it shall make thy belly bitter , but in thy mouth it shall be sweet -- as honey . '
YLT	Revelation	10	11	and he saith to me , ` It behoveth thee again to prophesy about peoples , and nations , and tongues , and kings -- many . '
YLT	Revelation	11	11	And after the three days and a half , a spirit of life from God did enter into them , and they stood upon their feet , and great fear fell upon those beholding them ,
YLT	Revelation	11	2	and the court that is without the sanctuary leave out , and thou mayest not measure it , because it was given to the nations , and the holy city they shall tread down forty-two months ;
YLT	Revelation	11	3	and I will give to My two witnesses , and they shall prophesy days , a thousand , two hundred , sixty , arrayed with sackcloth ;
YLT	Revelation	11	4	these are the two olive [ trees ] , and the two lamp-stands that before the God of the earth do stand ;
YLT	Revelation	11	5	and if any one may will to injure them , fire doth proceed out of their mouth , and doth devour their enemies , and if any one may will to injure them , thus it behoveth him to be killed .
YLT	Revelation	11	6	These have authority to shut the heaven , that it may not rain rain in the days of their prophecy , and authority they have over the waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the land with every plague , as often as they may will .
YLT	Revelation	11	7	` And when they may finish their testimony , the beast that is coming up out of the abyss shall make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them ,
YLT	Revelation	11	8	and their dead bodies [ are ] upon the broad-place of the great city ( that is called spiritually Sodom , and Egypt , where also our Lord was crucified , )
YLT	Revelation	11	9	and they shall behold -- they of the peoples , and tribes , and tongues , and nations -- their dead bodies three days and a half , and their dead bodies they shall not suffer to be put into tombs ,
YLT	Revelation	11	10	and those dwelling upon the land shall rejoice over them , and shall make merry , and gifts they shall send to one another , because these -- the two prophets -- did torment those dwelling upon the land . '
YLT	Revelation	11	12	and they heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them , ` Come up hither ; ' and they went up to the heaven in the cloud , and their enemies beheld them ;
YLT	Revelation	11	13	and in that hour came a great earthquake , and the tenth of the city did fall , and killed in the earthquake were names of men -- seven thousands , and the rest became affrighted , and they gave glory to the God of the heaven .
YLT	Revelation	11	14	The second wo did go forth , lo , the third wo doth come quickly .
YLT	Revelation	11	15	And the seventh messenger did sound , and there came great voices in the heaven , saying , ` The kingdoms of the world did become [ those ] of our Lord and of His Christ , and he shall reign to the ages of the ages ! '
YLT	Revelation	11	16	and the twenty and four elders , who before God are sitting upon their thrones , did fall upon their faces , and did bow before God ,
YLT	Revelation	11	17	saying , ` We give thanks to Thee , O Lord God , the Almighty , who art , and who wast , and who art coming , because Thou hast taken Thy great power and didst reign ;
YLT	Revelation	11	18	and the nations were angry , and Thine anger did come , and the time of the dead , to be judged , and to give the reward to Thy servants , to the prophets , and to the saints , and to those fearing Thy name , to the small and to the great , and to destroy those who are destroying the land . '
YLT	Revelation	11	19	And opened was the sanctuary of God in the heaven , and there was seen the ark of His covenant in His sanctuary , and there did come lightnings , and voices , and thunders , and an earthquake , and great hail .
YLT	Revelation	12	12	because of this be glad , ye heavens , and those in them who do tabernacle ; wo to those inhabiting the land and the sea , because the Devil did go down unto you , having great wrath , having known that he hath little time . '
YLT	Revelation	12	2	and being with child she doth cry out , travailing and pained to bring forth .
YLT	Revelation	12	3	And there was seen another sign in the heaven , and , lo , a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his head seven diadems ,
YLT	Revelation	12	4	and his tail doth draw the third of the stars of the heaven , and he did cast them to the earth ; and the dragon did stand before the woman who is about to bring forth , that when she may bring forth , her child he may devour ;
YLT	Revelation	12	5	and she brought forth a male child , who is about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron , and caught away was her child unto God and His throne ,
YLT	Revelation	12	6	and the woman did flee to the wilderness , where she hath a place made ready from God , that there they may nourish her -- days a thousand , two hundred , sixty .
YLT	Revelation	12	7	And there came war in the heaven ; Michael and his messengers did war against the dragon , and the dragon did war , and his messengers ,
YLT	Revelation	12	8	and they did not prevail , nor was their place found any more in the heaven ;
YLT	Revelation	12	9	and the great dragon was cast forth -- the old serpent , who is called ` Devil , ' and ` the Adversary , ' who is leading astray the whole world -- he was cast forth to the earth , and his messengers were cast forth with him .
YLT	Revelation	12	10	And I heard a great voice saying in the heaven , ` Now did come the salvation , and the power , and the reign , of our God , and the authority of His Christ , because cast down was the accuser of our brethren , who is accusing them before our God day and night ;
YLT	Revelation	12	11	and they did overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb , and because of the word of their testimony , and they did not love their life -- unto death ;
YLT	Revelation	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast forth to the earth , he pursued the woman who did bring forth the male ,
YLT	Revelation	12	14	and there were given to the woman two wings of the great eagle , that she may fly to the wilderness , to her place , where she is nourished a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent ;
YLT	Revelation	12	15	and the serpent did cast forth after the woman , out of his mouth , water as a river , that he may cause her to be carried away by the river ,
YLT	Revelation	12	16	and the land did help the woman , and the land did open its mouth and did swallow up the river , that the dragon did cast forth out of his mouth ;
YLT	Revelation	12	17	and the dragon was angry against the woman , and went away to make war with the rest of her seed , those keeping the commands of God , and having the testimony of Jesus Christ .
YLT	Revelation	13	13	and it doth great signs , that fire also it may make to come down from the heaven to the earth before men ,
YLT	Revelation	13	2	and the beast that I saw was like to a leopard , and its feet as of a bear , and its mouth as the mouth of a lion , and the dragon did give to it his power , and his throne , and great authority .
YLT	Revelation	13	3	And I saw one of its heads as slain to death , and its deadly stroke was healed , and all the earth did wonder after the beast ,
YLT	Revelation	13	4	and they did bow before the dragon who did give authority to the beast , and they did bow before the beast , saying , ` Who [ is ] like to the beast ? who is able to war with it ? '
YLT	Revelation	13	5	And there was given to it a mouth speaking great things , and evil-speakings , and there was given to it authority to make war forty-two months ,
YLT	Revelation	13	6	and it did open its mouth for evil-speaking toward God , to speak evil of His name , and of His tabernacle , and of those who in the heaven tabernacle ,
YLT	Revelation	13	7	and there was given to it to make war with the saints , and to overcome them , and there was given to it authority over every tribe , and tongue , and nation .
YLT	Revelation	13	8	And bow before it shall all who are dwelling upon the land , whose names have not been written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world ;
YLT	Revelation	13	9	if any one hath an ear -- let him hear :
YLT	Revelation	13	10	if any one a captivity doth gather , into captivity he doth go away ; if any one by sword doth kill , it behoveth him by sword to be killed ; here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
YLT	Revelation	13	11	And I saw another beast coming up out of the land , and it had two horns , like a lamb , and it was speaking as a dragon ,
YLT	Revelation	13	12	and all the authority of the first beast doth it do before it , and it maketh the land and those dwelling in it that they shall bow before the first beast , whose deadly stroke was healed ,
YLT	Revelation	13	14	and it leadeth astray those dwelling on the land , because of the signs that were given it to do before the beast , saying to those dwelling upon the land to make an image to the beast that hath the stroke of the sword and did live ,
YLT	Revelation	13	15	and there was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast , that also the image of the beast may speak , and [ that ] it may cause as many as shall not bow before the image of the beast , that they may be killed .
YLT	Revelation	13	16	And it maketh all , the small , and the great , and the rich , and the poor , and the freemen , and the servants , that it may give to them a mark upon their right hand or upon their foreheads ,
YLT	Revelation	13	17	and that no one may be able to buy , or to sell , except he who is having the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .
YLT	Revelation	13	18	Here is the wisdom ! He who is having the understanding , let him count the number of the beast , for the number of a man it is , and its number [ is ]
YLT	Revelation	13	666	.
YLT	Revelation	14	14	And I saw , and lo , a white cloud , and upon the cloud [ one ] sitting like to a son of man , having upon his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle ;
YLT	Revelation	14	2	and I heard a voice out of the heaven , as a voice of many waters , and as a voice of great thunder , and a voice I heard of harpers harping with their harps ,
YLT	Revelation	14	3	and they sing , as it were , a new song before the throne , and before the four living creatures , and the elders , and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred forty-four thousands , who have been bought from the earth ;
YLT	Revelation	14	4	these are they who with women were not defiled , for they are virgin ; these are they who are following the Lamb whithersoever he may go ; these were bought from among men -- a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb --
YLT	Revelation	14	5	and in their mouth there was not found guile , for unblemished are they before the throne of God .
YLT	Revelation	14	6	And I saw another messenger flying in mid-heaven , having good news age-during to proclaim to those dwelling upon the earth , and to every nation , and tribe , and tongue , and people ,
YLT	Revelation	14	7	saying in a great voice , ` Fear ye God , and give to Him glory , because come did the hour of His judgment , and bow ye before Him who did make the heaven , and the land , and sea , and fountains of waters . '
YLT	Revelation	14	8	And another messenger did follow , saying , ` Fall , fall , did Babylon , the great city , because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom she hath given to all nations to drink . '
YLT	Revelation	14	9	And a third messenger did follow them , saying in a great voice , ` If any one the beast doth bow before , and his image , and doth receive a mark upon his forehead , or upon his hand ,
YLT	Revelation	14	10	he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God , that hath been mingled unmixed in the cup of His anger , and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy messengers , and before the Lamb ,
YLT	Revelation	14	11	and the smoke of their torment doth go up to ages of ages ; and they have no rest day and night , who are bowing before the beast and his image , also if any doth receive the mark of his name .
YLT	Revelation	14	12	Here is endurance of the saints : here [ are ] those keeping the commands of God , and the faith of Jesus . '
YLT	Revelation	14	13	And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me , ` Write : Happy are the dead who in the Lord are dying from this time ! ' ` Yes , ( saith the Spirit , ) That they may rest from their labours -- and their works do follow them ! '
YLT	Revelation	14	15	and another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary crying in a great voice to him who is sitting upon the cloud , ` Send forth thy sickle and reap , because come to thee hath the hour of reaping , because ripe hath been the harvest of the earth ; '
YLT	Revelation	14	16	and he who is sitting upon the cloud did put forth his sickle upon the earth , and the earth was reaped .
YLT	Revelation	14	17	And another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary that [ is ] in the heaven , having -- he also -- a sharp sickle ,
YLT	Revelation	14	18	and another messenger did come forth out from the altar , having authority over the fire , and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle , saying , ` Send forth thy sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth , because come to perfection have her grapes ; '
YLT	Revelation	14	19	and the messenger did put forth his sickle to the earth , and did gather the vine of the earth , and did cast [ it ] to the great wine-press of the wrath of God ;
YLT	Revelation	14	20	and trodden was the wine-press outside of the city , and blood did come forth out of the wine-press -- unto the bridles of the horses , a thousand , six hundred furlongs .
YLT	Revelation	15	15	And I saw another sign in the heaven , great and wonderful , seven messengers having the seven last plagues , because in these was completed the wrath of God ,
YLT	Revelation	15	2	and I saw as a sea of glass mingled with fire , and those who do gain the victory over the beast , and his image , and his mark , [ and ] the number of his name , standing by the sea of the glass , having harps of God ,
YLT	Revelation	15	3	and they sing the song of Moses , servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , ` Great and wonderful [ are ] Thy works , O Lord God , the Almighty , righteous and true [ are ] Thy ways , O King of saints ,
YLT	Revelation	15	4	who may not fear Thee , O Lord , and glorify Thy name ? because Thou alone [ art ] kind , because all the nations shall come and bow before Thee , because Thy righteous acts were manifested . '
YLT	Revelation	15	5	And after these things I saw , and lo , opened was the sanctuary of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven ;
YLT	Revelation	15	6	and come forth did the seven messengers having the seven plagues , out of the sanctuary , clothed in linen , pure and shining , and girded round the breasts with golden girdles :
YLT	Revelation	15	7	and one of the four living creatures did give to the seven messengers seven golden vials , full of the wrath of God , who is living to the ages of the ages ;
YLT	Revelation	15	8	and filled was the sanctuary with smoke from the glory of God , and from His power , and no one was able to enter into the sanctuary till the seven plagues of the seven messengers may be finished .
YLT	Revelation	16	16	and they did bring them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon .
YLT	Revelation	16	2	and the first did go away , and did pour out his vial upon the land , and there came a sore -- bad and grievous -- to men , those having the mark of the beast , and those bowing to his image .
YLT	Revelation	16	3	And the second messenger did pour out his vial to the sea , and there came blood as of [ one ] dead , and every living soul died in the sea .
YLT	Revelation	16	4	And the third messenger did pour out his vial to the rivers , and to the fountains of the waters , and there came blood ,
YLT	Revelation	16	5	and I heard the messenger of the waters , saying , ` righteous , O Lord , art Thou , who art , and who wast , and who shalt be , because these things Thou didst judge ,
YLT	Revelation	16	6	because blood of saints and prophets they did pour out , and blood to them Thou didst give to drink , for they are worthy ; '
YLT	Revelation	16	7	and I heard another out of the altar , saying , ` Yes , Lord God , the Almighty , true and righteous [ are ] Thy judgments . '
YLT	Revelation	16	8	And the fourth messenger did pour out his vial upon the sun , and there was given to him to scorch men with fire ,
YLT	Revelation	16	9	and men were scorched with great heat , and they did speak evil of the name of God , who hath authority over these plagues , and they did not reform -- to give to Him glory .
YLT	Revelation	16	10	And the fifth messenger did pour out his vial upon the throne of the beast , and his kingdom did become darkened , and they were gnawing their tongues from the pain ,
YLT	Revelation	16	11	and they did speak evil of the God of the heaven , from their pains , and from their sores , and they did not reform from their works .
YLT	Revelation	16	12	And the sixth messenger did pour out his vial upon the great river , the Euphrates , and dried up was its water , that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun may be made ready ;
YLT	Revelation	16	13	and I saw [ come ] out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits like frogs --
YLT	Revelation	16	14	for they are spirits of demons , doing signs -- which go forth unto the kings of the earth , and of the whole world , to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God the Almighty ; --
YLT	Revelation	16	15	` lo , I do come as a thief ; happy [ is ] he who is watching , and keeping his garments , that he may not walk naked , and they may see his unseemliness , ' --
YLT	Revelation	16	17	And the seventh messenger did pour out his vial to the air , and there came forth a great voice from the sanctuary of the heaven , from the throne , saying , ` It hath come ! '
YLT	Revelation	16	18	and there came voices , and thunders , and lightnings ; and a great earthquake came , such as came not since men came upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake -- so great !
YLT	Revelation	16	19	And it came -- the great city -- into three parts , and the cities of the nations did fall , and Babylon the great was remembered before God , to give to her the cup of the wine of the wrath of His anger ,
YLT	Revelation	16	20	and every island did flee away , and mountains were not found ,
YLT	Revelation	16	21	and great hail ( as of talent weight ) doth come down out of the heaven upon men , and men did speak evil of God because of the plague of the hail , because its plague is very great .
YLT	Revelation	17	17	for God did give into their hearts to do its mind , and to make one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast till the sayings of God may be complete ,
YLT	Revelation	17	2	with whom the kings of the earth did commit whoredom ; and made drunk from the wine of her whoredom were those inhabiting the earth ; '
YLT	Revelation	17	3	and he carried me away to a wilderness in the Spirit , and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast , full of names of evil-speaking , having seven heads and ten horns ,
YLT	Revelation	17	4	and the woman was arrayed with purple and scarlet-colour , and gilded with gold , and precious stone , and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom ,
YLT	Revelation	17	5	and upon her forehead was a name written : ` Secret , Babylon the Great , the Mother of the Whores , and the Abominations of the earth . '
YLT	Revelation	17	6	And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the saints , and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus , and I did wonder -- having seen her -- with great wonder ;
YLT	Revelation	17	7	and the messenger said to me , ` Wherefore didst thou wonder ? I -- I will tell thee the secret of the woman and of the beast that [ is ] carrying her , which hath the seven heads and the ten horns .
YLT	Revelation	17	8	` The beast that thou didst see : it was , and it is not ; and it is about to come up out of the abyss , and to go away to destruction , and wonder shall those dwelling upon the earth , whose names have not been written upon the scroll of the life from the foundation of the world , beholding the beast that was , and is not , although it is .
YLT	Revelation	17	9	` Here [ is ] the mind that is having wisdom ; the seven heads are seven mountains , upon which the woman doth sit ,
YLT	Revelation	17	10	and there are seven kings , the five did fall , and the one is , the other did not yet come , and when he may come , it behoveth him to remain a little time ;
YLT	Revelation	17	11	and the beast that was , and is not , he also is eighth , and out of the seven he is , and to destruction he doth go away .
YLT	Revelation	17	12	` And the ten horns that thou sawest , are ten kings , who a kingdom did not yet receive , but authority as kings the same hour do receive with the beast ,
YLT	Revelation	17	13	these have one mind , and their own power and authority to the beast they shall give over ;
YLT	Revelation	17	14	these with the Lamb shall make war , and the Lamb shall overcome them , because Lord of lords he is , and King of kings , and those with him are called , and choice , and stedfast . '
YLT	Revelation	17	15	And he saith to me , ` The waters that thou didst see , where the whore doth sit , are peoples , and multitudes , and nations , and tongues ; '
YLT	Revelation	17	16	and the ten horns that thou didst see upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and shall burn her in fire ,
YLT	Revelation	17	18	and the woman that thou didst see is the great city that is having reign over the kings of the land . '
YLT	Revelation	18	18	and were crying , seeing the smoke of her burning , saying , What [ city is ] like to the great city ?
YLT	Revelation	18	2	and he did cry in might -- a great voice , saying , ` Fall , fall did Babylon the great , and she became a habitation of demons , and a hold of every unclean spirit , and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird ,
YLT	Revelation	18	3	because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom have all the nations drunk , and the kings of the earth with her did commit whoredom , and merchants of the earth from the power of her revel were made rich .
YLT	Revelation	18	4	And I heard another voice out of the heaven , saying , ` Come forth out of her , My people , that ye may not partake with her sins , and that ye may not receive of her plagues ,
YLT	Revelation	18	5	because her sins did follow -- unto the heaven , and God did remember her unrighteousness .
YLT	Revelation	18	6	Render to her as also she did render to you , and double to her doubles according to her works ; in the cup that she did mingle mingle to her double .
YLT	Revelation	18	7	` As much as she did glorify herself and did revel , so much torment and sorrow give to her , because in her heart she saith , I sit a queen , and a widow I am not , and sorrow I shall not see ;
YLT	Revelation	18	8	because of this , in one day , shall come her plagues , death , and sorrow , and famine ; and in fire she shall be utterly burned , because strong [ is ] the Lord God who is judging her ;
YLT	Revelation	18	9	and weep over her , and smite themselves for her , shall the kings of the earth , who with her did commit whoredom and did revel , when they may see the smoke of her burning ,
YLT	Revelation	18	10	from afar having stood because of the fear of her torment , saying , Wo , wo , the great city ! Babylon , the strong city ! because in one hour did come thy judgment .
YLT	Revelation	18	11	` And the merchants of the earth shall weep and sorrow over her , because their lading no one doth buy any more ;
YLT	Revelation	18	12	lading of gold , and silver , and precious stone , and pearl , and fine linen , and purple , and silk , and scarlet , and all thyne wood , and every vessel of ivory , and every vessel of most precious wood , and brass , and iron , and marble ,
YLT	Revelation	18	13	and cinnamon , and odours , and ointment , and frankincense , and wine , and oil , and fine flour , and wheat , and cattle , and sheep , and of horses , and of chariots , and of bodies and souls of men .
YLT	Revelation	18	14	` And the fruits of the desire of thy soul did go away from thee , and all things -- the dainty and the bright -- did go away from thee , and no more at all mayest thou find them .
YLT	Revelation	18	15	The merchants of these things , who were made rich by her , far off shall stand because of the fear of her torment , weeping , and sorrowing ,
YLT	Revelation	18	16	and saying , Wo , wo , the great city , that was arrayed with fine linen , and purple , and scarlet , and gilded in gold , and precious stone , and pearls -- because in one hour so much riches were made waste !
YLT	Revelation	18	17	` And every shipmaster , and all the company upon the ships , and sailors , and as many as work the sea , far off stood ,
YLT	Revelation	18	19	and they did cast dust upon their heads , and were crying out , weeping and sorrowing , saying , Wo , wo , the great city ! in which were made rich all having ships in the sea , out of her costliness -- for in one hour was she made waste .
YLT	Revelation	18	20	` Be glad over her , O heaven , and ye holy apostles and prophets , because God did judge your judgment of her ! '
YLT	Revelation	18	21	And one strong messenger did take up a stone as a great millstone , and did cast [ it ] to the sea , saying , ` Thus with violence shall Babylon be cast , the great city , and may not be found any more at all ;
YLT	Revelation	18	22	and voice of harpers , and musicians , and pipers , and trumpeters , may not be heard at all in thee any more ; and any artizan of any art may not be found at all in thee any more ; and noise of a millstone may not be heard at all in thee any more ;
YLT	Revelation	18	23	and light of a lamp may not shine at all in thee any more ; and voice of bridegroom and of bride may not be heard at all in thee any more ; because thy merchants were the great ones of the earth , because in thy sorcery were all the nations led astray ,
YLT	Revelation	18	24	and in her blood of prophets and of saints was found , and of all those who have been slain on the earth . '
YLT	Revelation	19	19	And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , having been gathered together to make war with him who is sitting upon the horse , and with his army ;
YLT	Revelation	19	2	because true and righteous [ are ] His judgments , because He did judge the great whore who did corrupt the earth in her whoredom , and He did avenge the blood of His servants at her hand ; '
YLT	Revelation	19	3	and a second time they said , ` Alleluia ; ' and her smoke doth come up -- to the ages of the ages !
YLT	Revelation	19	4	And fall down did the elders -- the twenty and four -- and the four living creatures , and they did bow before God who is sitting upon the throne , saying , ` Amen , Alleluia . '
YLT	Revelation	19	5	And a voice out of the throne did come forth , saying , ` Praise our God , all ye His servants , and those fearing Him , both the small and the great ; '
YLT	Revelation	19	6	and I heard as the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunderings , saying , ` Alleluia ! because reign did the Lord God -- the Almighty !
YLT	Revelation	19	7	may we rejoice and exult , and give the glory to Him , because come did the marriage of the Lamb , and his wife did make herself ready ;
YLT	Revelation	19	8	and there was given to her that she may be arrayed with fine linen , pure and shining , for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints . '
YLT	Revelation	19	9	And he saith to me , ` Write : Happy [ are ] they who to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb have been called ; ' and he saith to me , ` These [ are ] the true words of God ; '
YLT	Revelation	19	10	and I fell before his feet , to bow before him , and he saith to me , ` See -- not ! fellow servant of thee am I , and of thy brethren , those having the testimony of Jesus ; bow before God , for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy . '
YLT	Revelation	19	11	And I saw the heaven having been opened , and lo , a white horse , and he who is sitting upon it is called Faithful and True , and in righteousness doth he judge and war ,
YLT	Revelation	19	12	and his eyes [ are ] as a flame of fire , and upon his head [ are ] many diadems -- having a name written that no one hath known , except himself ,
YLT	Revelation	19	13	and he is arrayed with a garment covered with blood , and his name is called , The Word of God .
YLT	Revelation	19	14	And the armies in the heaven were following him upon white horses , clothed in fine linen -- white and pure ;
YLT	Revelation	19	15	and out of his mouth doth proceed a sharp sword , that with it he may smite the nations , and he shall rule them with a rod of iron , and he doth tread the press of the wine of the wrath and the anger of God the Almighty ,
YLT	Revelation	19	16	and he hath upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written , ` King of kings , and Lord of lords . '
YLT	Revelation	19	17	And I saw one messenger standing in the sun , and he cried , a great voice , saying to all the birds that are flying in mid-heaven , ` Come and be gathered together to the supper of the great God ,
YLT	Revelation	19	18	that ye may eat flesh of kings , and flesh of chiefs of thousands , and flesh of strong men , and flesh of horses , and of those sitting on them , and the flesh of all -- freemen and servants -- both small and great . '
YLT	Revelation	19	20	and the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him , in which he led astray those who did receive the mark of the beast , and those who did bow before his image ; living they were cast -- the two -- to the lake of the fire , that is burning with brimstone ;
YLT	Revelation	19	21	and the rest were killed with the sword of him who is sitting on the horse , which [ sword ] is proceeding out of his mouth , and all the birds were filled out of their flesh .
YLT	Revelation	20	20	And I saw a messenger coming down out of the heaven , having the key of the abyss , and a great chain over his hand ,
YLT	Revelation	20	2	and he laid hold on the dragon , the old serpent , who is Devil and Adversary , and did bind him a thousand years ,
YLT	Revelation	20	3	and he cast him to the abyss , and did shut him up , and put a seal upon him , that he may not lead astray the nations any more , till the thousand years may be finished ; and after these it behoveth him to be loosed a little time .
YLT	Revelation	20	4	And I saw thrones , and they sat upon them , and judgment was given to them , and the souls of those who have been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus , and because of the word of God , and who did not bow before the beast , nor his image , and did not receive the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand , and they did live and reign with Christ the thousand years ;
YLT	Revelation	20	5	and the rest of the dead did not live again till the thousand years may be finished ; this [ is ] the first rising again .
YLT	Revelation	20	6	Happy and holy [ is ] he who is having part in the first rising again ; over these the second death hath not authority , but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
YLT	Revelation	20	7	And when the thousand years may be finished , the Adversary shall be loosed out of his prison ,
YLT	Revelation	20	8	and he shall go forth to lead the nations astray , that are in the four corners of the earth -- Gog and Magog -- to gather them together to war , of whom the number [ is ] as the sand of the sea ;
YLT	Revelation	20	9	and they did go up over the breadth of the land , and did surround the camp of the saints , and the beloved city , and there came down fire from God out of the heaven , and devoured them ;
YLT	Revelation	20	10	and the Devil , who is leading them astray , was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where [ are ] the beast and the false prophet , and they shall be tormented day and night -- to the ages of the ages .
YLT	Revelation	20	11	And I saw a great white throne , and Him who is sitting upon it , from whose face the earth and the heaven did flee away , and place was not found for them ;
YLT	Revelation	20	12	and I saw the dead , small and great , standing before God , and scrolls were opened , and another scroll was opened , which is that of the life , and the dead were judged out of the things written in the scrolls -- according to their works ;
YLT	Revelation	20	13	and the sea did give up those dead in it , and the death and the hades did give up the dead in them , and they were judged , each one according to their works ;
YLT	Revelation	20	14	and the death and the hades were cast to the lake of the fire -- this [ is ] the second death ;
YLT	Revelation	20	15	and if any one was not found written in the scroll of the life , he was cast to the lake of the fire .
YLT	Revelation	21	21	And the twelve gates [ are ] twelve pearls , each several one of the gates was of one pearl ; and the broad-place of the city [ is ] pure gold -- as transparent glass .
YLT	Revelation	21	2	and I , John , saw the holy city -- new Jerusalem -- coming down from God out of the heaven , made ready as a bride adorned for her husband ;
YLT	Revelation	21	3	and I heard a great voice out of the heaven , saying , ` Lo , the tabernacle of God [ is ] with men , and He will tabernacle with them , and they shall be His peoples , and God Himself shall be with them -- their God ,
YLT	Revelation	21	4	and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes , and the death shall not be any more , nor sorrow , nor crying , nor shall there be any more pain , because the first things did go away . '
YLT	Revelation	21	5	And He who is sitting upon the throne said , ` Lo , new I make all things ; and He saith to me , ` Write , because these words are true and stedfast ; '
YLT	Revelation	21	6	and He said to me , ` It hath been done ! I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End ; I , to him who is thirsting , will give of the fountain of the water of the life freely ;
YLT	Revelation	21	7	he who is overcoming shall inherit all things , and I will be to him -- a God , and he shall be to me -- the son ,
YLT	Revelation	21	8	and to fearful , and unstedfast , and abominable , and murderers , and whoremongers , and sorcerers , and idolaters , and all the liars , their part [ is ] in the lake that is burning with fire and brimstone , which is a second death . '
YLT	Revelation	21	9	And there came unto me one of the seven messengers , who have the seven vials that are full of the seven last plagues , and he spake with me , saying , ` Come , I will shew thee the bride of the Lamb -- the wife , '
YLT	Revelation	21	10	and he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high , and did shew to me the great city , the holy Jerusalem , coming down out of the heaven from God ,
YLT	Revelation	21	11	having the glory of God , and her light [ is ] like a stone most precious , as a jasper stone clear as crystal ,
YLT	Revelation	21	12	having also a wall great and high , having twelve gates , and at the gates twelve messengers , and names written thereon , which are [ those ] of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel ,
YLT	Revelation	21	13	at the east three gates , at the north three gates , at the south three gates , at the west three gates ;
YLT	Revelation	21	14	and the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and in them names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
YLT	Revelation	21	15	And he who is speaking with me had a golden reed , that he may measure the city , and its gates , and its wall ;
YLT	Revelation	21	16	and the city lieth square , and the length of it is as great as the breadth ; and he did measure the city with the reed -- furlongs twelve thousand ; the length , and the breadth , and the height , of it are equal ;
YLT	Revelation	21	17	and he measured its wall , an hundred forty-four cubits , the measure of a man , that is , of the messenger ;
YLT	Revelation	21	18	and the building of its wall was jasper , and the city [ is ] pure gold -- like to pure glass ;
YLT	Revelation	21	19	and the foundations of the wall of the city with every precious stone have been adorned ; the first foundation jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , chalcedony ; the fourth , emerald ;
YLT	Revelation	21	20	the fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , sardius ; the seventh , chrysolite ; the eighth , beryl ; the ninth , topaz ; the tenth , chrysoprasus ; the eleventh , jacinth ; the twelfth , amethyst .
YLT	Revelation	21	22	And a sanctuary I did not see in it , for the Lord God , the Almighty , is its sanctuary , and the Lamb ,
YLT	Revelation	21	23	and the city hath no need of the sun , nor of the moon , that they may shine in it ; for the glory of God did lighten it , and the lamp of it [ is ] the Lamb ;
YLT	Revelation	21	24	and the nations of the saved in its light shall walk , and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it ,
YLT	Revelation	21	25	and its gates shall not at all be shut by day , for night shall not be there ;
YLT	Revelation	21	26	and they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it ;
YLT	Revelation	21	27	and there may not at all enter into it any thing defiling and doing abomination , and a lie , but -- those written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb .
YLT	Revelation	22	22	And he shewed me a pure river of water of life , bright as crystal , going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb :
YLT	Revelation	22	2	in the midst of its broad place , and of the river on this side and on that , [ is ] a tree of life , yielding twelve fruits , in each several month rendering its fruits , and the leaves of the tree [ are ] for the service of the nations ;
YLT	Revelation	22	3	and any curse there shall not be any more , and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it , and His servants shall serve Him ,
YLT	Revelation	22	4	and they shall see His face , and His name [ is ] upon their foreheads ,
YLT	Revelation	22	5	and night shall not be there , and they have no need of a lamp and light of a sun , because the Lord God doth give them light , and they shall reign -- to the ages of the ages .
YLT	Revelation	22	6	And he said to me , ` These words [ are ] stedfast and true , and the Lord God of the holy prophets did send His messenger to shew to His servants the things that it behoveth to come quickly :
YLT	Revelation	22	7	Lo , I come quickly ; happy [ is ] he who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this scroll . '
YLT	Revelation	22	8	And I , John , am he who is seeing these things and hearing , and when I heard and beheld , I fell down to bow before the feet of the messenger who is shewing me these things ;
YLT	Revelation	22	9	and he saith to me , ` See -- not ; for fellow-servant of thee am I , and of thy brethren the prophets , and of those keeping the words of this scroll ; before God bow . '
YLT	Revelation	22	10	And he saith to me , ` Thou mayest not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll , because the time is nigh ;
YLT	Revelation	22	11	he who is unrighteous -- let him be unrighteous still , and he who is filthy -- let him be filthy still , and he who is righteous -- let him be declared righteous still , and he who is sanctified -- let him be sanctified still :
YLT	Revelation	22	12	And lo , I come quickly , and my reward [ is ] with me , to render to each as his work shall be ;
